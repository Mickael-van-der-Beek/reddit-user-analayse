[/r/BoardwalkEmpire](/r/BoardwalkEmpire) - Season 3 Finale Giveaway!

(kindly sponsored by Redditor /u/ovived!)

**First Prize wins**

* Official Boardwalk Empire T-Shirt

* Season 1 Blu-Ray/DVD

* Season 2 Blu-Ray/DVD

**Runners Up receive**

* Official Boardwalk Empire T-Shirt

* Official Boardwalk Poster or Keychain

**Rules:**

- ~~The winner is the most upvoted comment (ordered by 'top'). *Upvotes should be for the most insightful and overall best quality comments.* We will assess the winning comments at 11PM MONDAY (EST)~~

~~[*EDIT: Due to Reddit's wonderfully timed outages and bugs that are affecting comments, accessibility, and votes, we're currently looking at possible alternative ways of issuing the prizes. Nothing's been decided yet.*]~~

**OK folks. The mods have discussed some things and we both agree that everything would work out best if we approached this a bit differently. We've decided that jokes made early on had an unfair advantage over more well thought out comments that occurred after the show was over. This was totally our bad. To make things worse, Reddit was semi-down for a few hours during the show's airing and after. Votes were not being recorded, and comments were not being submitted. Obviously this puts people at a disadvantage as well.**

**Therefore, we believe that the best representation of what we're looking for quality-wise as well as upvote/popularity-wise will be found by not sorting by 'top', but instead sorting by 'best'. Surely we should have thought this through a bit better but we only learned of Ovived's generosity late in the day on Saturday. So please forgive us. That said, we will still issue prizes for the 'top' comments as well, but not the top prize. Please direct any hatemail to me, Unlucky13.**


- ~~Runners up are the following 2 comments.~~

- Moderators (/u/baueruk and /u/unlucky13 ) are obviously not included, nor is /u/ovived who is providing the prizes.

- Moderators reserve the right to discount a comment for whatever reason, which will be explained to the community if need be. We're looking for the best and most insightful comments, so a good one-liner may be funny but doesn't necessarily provide the best content. Anyway, it's up to you all- the BWE community, so upvote!!

/u/ovived has kindly agreed to ship worldwide, but if for whatever reason this is not possible, we'll endeavor to get some 
prize of equivalent value to you (most likely &gt; Boardwalk Empire DVDs). Likewise, we may also consider substituting the prize offered for one of equal value from the HBO store if the winner(s) so choose.",,False,self,t5_2s0gm,1354582761.0,,hat,True,t3_146air,http://www.reddit.com/r/BoardwalkEmpire/comments/146air/boardwalk_empire_episode_discussion_s03e12/,moderator

Obviously, watching a historical drama is a great experience for everyone. But, as a black person, I always appreciate the chance to look back in time at how things used to be. 

I don't know what the best name/image for the flair should be, seeing as some names might be a little politically incorrect. But I'd like *some* option to be available. Chalky White is one of my favorite characters, and I think the flair might be appreciated by any of his fans, African-American or not.

It's just flair, but that's my 2 cents.

1349574297.0,82,self.BoardwalkEmpire,112ikv,I was worried this would happen. All BWE subscribers- please read and discuss.,Unlucky13,114,32,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/BoardwalkEmpire/comments/112ikv/i_was_worried_this_would_happen_all_bwe/,"There have been two successful submissions lately that have shown two BWE actors starring together in other films. While I agree they are an interesting bit of trivia, I firmly believe that submissions like ""look who I found in this other movie"" and essentially all meme-style pictures may get lots of upvotes and attract plenty of adolescents and karma queens, but doing so severely degrades the overall quality of the subreddit. 

I've been a user of [/r/dexter](/r/dexter), [/r/breakingbad](/r/breakingbad) and [/r/gameofthrones](/r/gameofthrones) for a few years now and it disappoints me so much when I have to sort through submission after submission of ones like I mentioned above just to find a quality discussion or linked content.

I became a mod for BWE because I didn't want to see this subreddit succum to shitty jokes and people acting surprised when they see actors in other roles. At the beginning of Season 2, we had a little over 900 users. Today we have over 4,400. That's fucking awesome. 

And to think that we've grown to this size while maintaining what I consider the best and highest quality content of any TV Show subreddit is admirable, to put it lightly. But submissions like the ones over the past two days make me concerned that we may be approaching a point where I must either take action or essentially do nothing.

**Here's my case**: There are thousands of subreddits and hundreds of TV Show subreddits that allow memes and/or ""look who i found"" posts. I ask that this *one* to remain free of such submissions and that I be granted the autonomy to remove such future submissions as spam. I understand the desire to allow the 'reddit community' to decide through up/downvoting, but all too often these submissions are upvoted by the people that such posts attract, and that quickly makes it impossible to keep in check.

I'm very interested in hearing your opinions on this subject and I hope we can reach consensus on this issue. - Unlucky13",,False,self,t5_2s0gm,False,,hat,True,t3_112ikv,http://www.reddit.com/r/BoardwalkEmpire/comments/112ikv/i_was_worried_this_would_happen_all_bwe/,moderator

Bugs's actual name was George Clarence Moran, but after escaping from juvey he changes his name to George Miller and flees to Chicago where he ultimately becomes involved in O'Bannion's North Side Gang.  Sound familiar?

 Bugs also got his more well known nickname because people around him thought he was a little nuts (""buggy"", think about how Van Alden's eyes bug out when he gets crazy) .

One of the biggest knocks against this theory is that Van Alden and Bugs share very dissimilar pasts (Bugs was involved in crime since he was a teen and obviously was never a prohibition agent).",,False,self,t5_2s0gm,False,,,True,t3_14wrk9,http://www.reddit.com/r/BoardwalkEmpire/comments/14wrk9/van_alden_theory/,

edit: in light of how glitchy reddit is being as pointed out by /u/ParanoidAndroids, i no longer think that the poor thread is the mods' fault, but instead reddit's on the whole, because it's being very glitchy. still I think deep discussion is being undercut in the other thread by the contest/glitching during when most of the comments were posted, so what we're doing here is still a valid endeavor. most of the comments in the other thread are jokes/one-liners, not discussions.

anyways,


my points:

-OH MY CHRIST HARROW

-Gillian - is she dead? I hope.

-Gyp couldn't have died better

-The Nucky/Rothstein/Mellon/Masseria/Randolph thing was perfection.

His bombastic, almost stereotypical gangster persona actually made him unique in an otherwise fully realized, humanized cast. Whether you loved him or hated him, he was just straight up entertaining. If Gyp was in a scene, odds are, something was going to go down.

That all being said, I think him being killed at the end of the season (outside of just losing an entertaining character) was particularly tragic, because his ""closure"" ran contrary to what I imagined everyone thought it might be.

After putting a stranglehold on the man running Atlantic City and coming close to claiming it outright for himself, Gyp gets out-played, out-witted and undermined by Nucky's planning and subtlety; two traits Gyp just doesn't possess.
After all is said and done, Gyp comes to a sort of mad insight and says (I paraphrase), ""We came into this town with nothing and now we're leaving with nothing. We ain't lost anything.""
Essentially, Gyp does mature and accept what's going on and even begins speculating how they can start again, in the middle of nowhere where there's no competition,  a couple of speak-easies, a couple of stills. For the first time, Gyp is actually taking a positive look on what's been a pretty catastrophic situation for him.
And of course, that's just when his trusted Lieutenant stabs him in the back.

Say what you will about Gyp, I think the worst thing about his whole story was that he had almost reformed at the end... insomuch as a gangster can....and that's right where his story finished.

Jimmy lived a fucked up life with little importance, and thought he could run AC better than Nucky. 

And I don't understand how some people are comparing this to the GoT ending - I don't think its comparable at all. Ned was truly a righteous hero who cared for his family and his kingdom more than anything, and would sacrifice his life to honor that commitment.

I see it going one of three ways

1) Harrow successfully kills Gillian, takes Tommy, Julie is none the wiser and doesnt ask questions, and they leave together or settle into Jimmy and Angelas place. 
...but this is Boardwalk Empire, and that seems too good to be true.
2) Harrow successfully kills Gillian, takes Tommy, and Julia finds out and can't deal with him being a killer and leaves. Or something happens to her father in which she cannot leave or be with Harrow, therefore making Gillians words true.
3) Harrow successfully kills Gillian, freeing Tommy but doesnt make it out of Gillian's alive.

As someone who enjoys acting in school plays, I tend to look out for the minutiae of characters. Subconsciously I believe its the little details that we don't really think about that make TV/Movie/Stage actors so believable

Just some three that I've noticed:

Nucky: Nucky is a very generous man and is quick to take out a wad of cash and give it to anyone who comes to hime with a problem. But what I love is that every time he does so he does this little thing where he counts out the amount of money and then puts it in the back of the wad handing the rest to whoever he's giving the money too.

Richard: Huston embodies Richard Harrow so physically. The way he swallows so visibly, try to swallow with one side of your mouth open. you can see how uncomfortable every 30 seconds of his life must be. And the way that he so slightly tilts his good eye and ear towards whoever he's talking to. it really gives the character more depth and makes him stand out.

Jimmy: Every time he took a drink, he would say ""To the lost"" referring to his time in the war. It just shows how even after all that time, he never really left his experiences behind.

1323096469.0,37,self.BoardwalkEmpire,n14lt,Let's discuss the Oedipal Complex...,blundetto,38,1,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/BoardwalkEmpire/comments/n14lt/lets_discuss_the_oedipal_complex/,"Edit: SPOILERS

We've all had a good laugh (or cringe) about last night's episode, but I think it should be remembered that this show has always been very intentional about what happens in it and the meaning behind what happens and I'd love to hear the thoughts of people who have considered the larger implications of Jimmy's long standing Oedipal tendencies. 

I've never studied Oedipus Rex, but I have studied a little Freud and here is my understanding of what is going on in the back of Jimmy's mind. I understand the Oedipal impulse to have sex with the mother not as strictly sexual, but more as a desire to ""return to the womb"" where we were once more comfortable than anywhere on earth. When in the womb all of our desires are synonymous with our surroundings. There is no strife, there is no disappointment, there is no failure. We are well fed, warm and comfortable, safe and without even the notion of danger or insecurity - in other words we are in all ways ""satisfied"" because our selves and environment are one and the same. Freud explains the act of being removed from the womb and thrust violently into the world as the very first traumatizing incident of our lives, to be followed throughout the rest of our existence with only more and more small traumatic events. Jimmy Darmody, once a pampered and care free youth, as he came to understand himself and the people around him only observed more and more corruption, deception, selfishness, and disillusionment. His one bastion of acceptance and purity is his mother. She is the first and last place he feels at home, and it is evident to me that he has, ever since that dance at Princeton, been fighting tooth and nail not to see his mother as a whore or gold-digger or what-have-you. At the same time Jimmy feels sheltered and - as evidenced with Manny Horowits - is violently sick of being seen as a child and that merging of thesis and antithesis, simultaneous return to the womb and emergence into adulthood, is nowhere better seen than in the act of motherfucking. 

Meanwhile, I am less clear on what the Oedipal urge to kill the father is really all about. I would venture to say it is about reclaiming your destiny from the super-ego,  or haunting conscience, idea of what you are supposed to live up to and supposed to be when you are at last yourself. Jimmy has obviously always had daddy issues and always been oppressed by what the patriarchal and hyper-masculine figures in his world expect him to become. As we see in the poetry class scene at Princeton, Jimmy resists these roles in favor of something more cultured and ideal, but when confronted with the suggestion that the moral ambiguity and two-facedness common in those Atlantic City archetypes is also potentially present in those more romantic ideas, he reverts back to the barbaric oppressiveness of his hyper-masculine roots and ultimately goes on a spree of destruction that leaves him grasping for rigid institutionalism and discipline. Ergo joining the army. 

There is another layer of complexity here because of the conflict between the Commodore's and Nucky's style of fathering. Jimmy seems to temporarily embrace the brutality and power dynamics of the Commodore, but at the same time never really let go of the subtlety and intellectualism of Nucky's worldview, itself edged with a kind of bottom line inhumanity common to politics and business. I think of the hunting analogies from the first episode: the Commodore boasting of walking right up to a bear and blasting it with a shotgun, while Nucky sends a figurine of a father and sun sharing in a kill, romantic yes, but still nothing more than a brass model.

Anyway, those are my thoughts, half baked and unedited. There is surely much more to be said. After seeing all the jokes and jabs of predictability I would love to hear some other takes on what the actual substance of this whole Oedipal play is all about.

Nucky's problem is that he doesn't have the muscle to take on a connected guy like Gyp. So he puts an idiot like Doyle in charge of his most important operation, tells his men to use backroads knowing that they can't support the volume that needs to be transported, and then makes it clear to Doyle that failure would not be accepted. He knew that Doyle would have no choice but to run Tabor Heights, and in doing so make Gyp do something ""unreasonable"". A.R. would have no choice but to act or risk looking weak in front of the other NY factions. A.R. takes out Gyp, a war makes Nucky A.R.'s best source of booze (as the other NY factions would wait till the dust settles to sell to the winner), and Nucky doesn't have to do the heavy lifting.

Just saw the finale of Season 3. 

Two things I wasn't clear on..

1) Why is Mellon helping Nucky trap Rothstein? I remember Mellon not even liking Nucky when they originally set up the Overholt deal. Has him thrown out of that club and everything. 

2) Why did Rothstein (or was it Masseria) set up Luciano with the heroin?

Richard Harrow is an incredible character and one of my complete favourites, he's complex, unpredictable, sad and a little bit crazy. And of course, he's ridiculously iconic. A mask covering half your face is as visually distinctive as you get, especially in a show where most characters dress similarly. He's this subreddit's reddit alien for a reason.
  
So with all this in mind, overusing Richard would be *very* easy. He's the Tyrion of Boardwalk Empire, a complete fan-favourite that owns every scene and everyone wants to see him all the time. Yet the writers don't. They have this incredible, amazing character and they use him like any other because he's just that: another character in a huge cast just as good as him. Richard could get very old very fast if they overused him to pander to the fans.

But while Nucky's trouble with Gyp and Masseria may be over momentarily, there is still a lot going on that will spill over to next season. Let's look at where some of our characters are at now:

Nucky is a new man. He got rid of his carnation in a metaphorical attempt to not be so easily recognized. He alluded to running a tighter business, with tight friends. Him and Eli reconciling and becoming a team was probably my biggest payoff of the season.

Eli really redeemed himself this season. He has gone from hotheaded submissive sheriff to a leader. He pretty much too Owen's place which is very impressive seeing as how he tried to kill Nucky in season two. But now they are partners and seem to be closer than ever.

Margaret has left Nucky to live in Brooklyn. Winter has said she will still be a big part of his story, but how? Will she be a staunch feminist? Will her and the young doctor continue to try and educate women about their bodies? Also, was anyone else surprised she aborted Owen's son? I was.

Van Alden holds a particularly ambiguous position between Capone and O'Banion. Winter has said, as well as heavily implying this season, that next season will take place during Capone's rise in Cicero and the O'banion Capone war. Van Alden is slowly transforming from the worst federal agent and salesman ever to the coolest bootlegger with the hottest wife of ever. It looks like he's being groomed for gang assassination.

Rothstien might be screwed. It's hard for me to tell whether or not Luciano and Lansky will hold a major grudge for the power play on their heroin, but Rothstien is definitely in trouble over the Overholt distillery. It's ambiguous as to how that will go down, but it seems that the word from Mellon is all Esther needs to arrest AR. He has also entered the heroin trade with Masseria. Masseria and AR are probably not huge fans of Nucky right now, and them working together can't be good either.

Speaking of Esther Randolph, I may be a little biased here but I want to see more of her. I'm biased because I'm in love with her. Any interesting predictions about her that don't have to do with wearing clothes will get my upvote.

The Overholt Distillery. Originally I was under the impression Mellon helped Nucky keep AR away from it as per their agreement, so that Nucky could use AR's help with Masseria without having to give him most of the profits. It seems, however, that Winter has said Nucky ruined his own deal with that move. He sacrificed the distillery and then made it so no one can have it if he can't. But it seems odd to me to introduce that distillery and not use it. I mean, when Doyle was standing in the front office on the phone and you could see all the distillery tanks behind him, I felt like that was major foreshadowing. Whoever got that distillery and got it running at maximum capacity would be the largest bootlegger and alcohol producer in the country. I'm just hoping they don't sweep it, and Mellon, aside. Which I don't think they will.

Where is Harrow going? Winter said he still has more to explore with Harrow. Is he going to work for Nucky because of their previous trust? Is he going to try and get as far from Tommy as possible to keep him out of danger? It was heartbreaking when Richard told Juila's dad he wasn't coming back. I wonder what his next move is.

Speaking of next moves, what does Gillian have left? Practically nothing. She has the house (or does she? Is it Tommy's technically? Anyone know?) but she has no financial backing for her cathouse anymore. She also lost her grandson, who was her last great connection in the world. Couple that with finally coming to terms with her sons death and I think things are about to get very dark for Gillian.

Lucky and Meyer? Winter has said 1924 (the year S4 will probably take place in) is when we see not only Capone come into power,but also Meyer and Lucky. Anyone who knows history knows they play a huge role in American gang life. If you know what they eventually do, watching the first three seasons has kind of been like watching The Little Rascals for national crime families. I think we will see a much more serious and violent Lucky and Meyer after how this season went for them.

Capone, as well, will obviously rise to power. After rewatching the third season this weekend it was obvious Torrio is retiring and giving it to Capone. History tells us he sets up in Cicero, which we all know is where Van Alden lives. 

So, what are your thoughts or predictions for season four? 

Also, I've had this nagging feeling that Nelson Van Alden changing his name to George Meuller is an homage to George Nelson, famous criminal robber of the 20's. Alden is a little older than George Nelson would have been so I don't think that's where it's going, but I can't be the first to think of that connection. Besides, I think Babyface would be the most inappropriate name possible for that Meuller Mug.",,False,self,t5_2s0gm,False,,government,True,t3_147txd,http://www.reddit.com/r/BoardwalkEmpire/comments/147txd/what_did_the_finale_really_say_about_where_next/,

If this assumption is correct, it begs the logical question, ""Who's the snitch?"" I don't think Owen was setting himself up for a suicide mission, so...

Agent Sawicki: He was the one who came into the meeting proposing that the hit take place at the bath house, and we don't know yet what has become of him after the botched murder attempt.

Mickey Doyle: He's been portrayed throughout the series as pretty much a buffoon, but is he actually more shrewd than we're aware? Was his question about the mineral baths just the utterances of a fool, or was he making certain to ascertain the exact location of the proposed hit?

Eli Thompson: Is he really re-committed to his brother, or just working the long con?

At his beachhouse, Jimmy lights a cigarette with his back to Richard, but he can still sense that something weighs on Harrow's mind, so he asks him to come out with it.

You said a nice girl and I would settle down,"" Richard clarifies. ""You will. You'll see,"" Jimmy pledges. The honk of a car sounds from outside and Jimmy looks out the window and sees his expected visitors have arrived. ""It's them,"" Jimmy says. ""You're my friend?"" Richard asks Jimmy as he puts on his jacket. ""You know I am,"" Jimmy declares. ""Then why did you make fun of me?""



What is Richard speaking of? When did Jimmy make fun of Richard? I guess would be the better question. Is Richard talking about Jimmy not fulfilling his promise to find a nice girl for Richard?

Every character seems to well cast and the show is near impossible to stop watching once you've started. By far my favourite character is Van Alden; Michael Shannon plays this troubled part stunningly. As well as this, I'm completely stunned at how good Jack Huston is as Richard Harrow, conveying more character in such limited screen time than most other actors he shares the screen with.

Also possible that Nucky's plan will result in AR being busted for bootlegging and go to prison.  Same effect as far as the plot goes, which doesn't exactly mirror history.

I'm also interested in the prosecutor Esther Randolph.

Also, it's only 1923 in the show.

A few parallels between Winter in Sopranos and BWE:

A few people point out Furio/Carmella and Owen/Margaret.

Gyp is a pain in the ass but will likely go the way of the buffalo... 
Think: Richie or Ralphie.


All of the other major characters are prominent historic people who have much more story left to tell.

Alright, Cromwell. He's playing Andrew Mellon, Treasury Secretary. He was testifying about corruption to [Senator Edge](http://files.mymovies.dk/Photos/17c3c160-eb50-402c-bfec-5f6cdf493edc.jpg)- The guy from S1/S2 that Nucky kind of screwed over by backing Harding instead of Edge for the Republican Presidential nominee. Edge had screwed over Nucky regarding roadway funding in season one.

Alrighy so directly after the Cromwell testify scene One of the clerks or whatever spilled information to [Gaston Means](http://images.zap2it.com/images/tv-EP01308836/boardwalk-empire-stephen-root-0.jpg), who's a corrupt investigator working with our favorite bootleggers and their ally the corrupt [Attorney General Daugherty](http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/christopher-mcdonald-boardwalk-empire-hbo.jpg)   

Gaston is the guy that Nucky Drops money off too in a goldfish bowl and has that long cerebral conversation in early season 3. He's also the guy advising Daughterty(? I think it was him...) that they need to find somebody to pin the bootlegger/crime blame onto. (It's theorized that they're gonna use Gyp as the fall guy)   
  

I hope this covers everything. It shouldn't be that complicated to figure out the stuff now that I've laid everything out for you.

Watching this episode was like watching a train wreck -- it all unfolded to seem inevitable, but it could have been prevented at any juncture. Jimmy's cohorts were right: if he had stayed the course, he would have toppled Nucky.

Throughout the episode, Jimmy also seemed very sure that this would end in his death. I suppose that his decision to meet with Nucky at the very beginning of the episode was also the beginning of his assisted suicide.

Why did he choose this path?

Why did he ever desire to be on top in the first place? Or did he?

Perhaps we witnessed Jimmy's death when he fulfilled his Oedipal destiny, last episode? Jimmy looked broken then -- but what about his son? He alluded to his fear of his mother repeating the cycle -- I suppose that fear was not enough to break the cycle himself, by becoming an available, protective father?

Also-- keep in mind, we're only halfway through the season. There's a lot of potential for things to get freaking insane. We've got a now completely insane and unpredictable Gyp Rosetti on the loose, a new and improved Eli back calling shots, a Capone v O'Banion (with perhaps a Van Alden sidekick?) story that's sure to explode soon, and who knows what Gillian has in store.

I personally see this as his opportunity to crack down. On everything. He's the ""prince"" of Atlantic City, but so far he just has managed to just fuck everything up. I anticipate that after he recovers he's gonna go back to the Jimmy we all knew and loved in season 1. He was a cold, ruthless, killing machine and that's where he got his respect from.

I pretty much just wanted to see what others might have to say about these things, or at the very least get my thoughts in writing.

First off, [](//#spoiler ""What's Margaret's deal with the help? We see her sort of figuring out her life as the mistress of the most important man in town a day at a time and she still retains her humility and grace throughout; the most poignant example is how she treats her servants. I don't remember exactly which episode it was but somewhere in the second season we see her sitting down with her servants to have a drink and talk and she seems genuinely interested in being equals with them, then Nucky, seemingly confused as to why she was with them, takes her to dinner. After that point Margaret completely blows the servants off. Was it the stress of realizing that she was dead to her family? Did she just decide it was a bad idea to treat them as equals? Also, did Margaret simply take Owen because she had become jealous of Kady and use him as a means to show Kady who is boss, or does she truly have romantic interest in him? Or both?"")

On another topic, this is the thing that shocked me the most. I had seen it coming since the moment we saw Jillian in the first season, but I kept denying it. Especially since a friend of mine had told me that her story gets fucked up, I told myself [](//#spoiler """"Man I knew it, I knew something was off about the relationship between Jimmy and his mom."" But I kept casting aside the notion thinking I was misreading things and when I learned the circumstances of Jillian's relationship with the commodore, I thought that was the 'fucked up' my friend had alluded to. The flashback with Jillian still took me way by surprise, even though I knew deep down it was coming. What I didn't expect was that it had already happened, long before the events of the first episode; I kept thinking that their relationship was leading up to something incestuous rather than a result of it. I sort of understand the psychology of it now. Obviously Jillian has a completely warped view on men; Jimmy was the only man in her life who cared to defend her and truly loved her, and Jimmy has a warped view on father figures. Jillian also did not care for Angela, perhaps out of some jealousy for her son's attention. I mean I'm no psychologist but that seems like the makings of a classic Oedipal complex... Anyway, the whole point of this paragraph is to say that if I understood the events that took place subsequent to the night Jimmy laid with his own mother, he wakes up and she is gone. He immediately enlists in the army because he knew he fucked up and probably wanted to die. Jimmy goes to the war, survives, comes home and waits two months to see his mom. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the first time the viewers meet Jillian is also the first time that Jimmy sees her since that night they had sex."") I'll have to go back and watch some of the first season again, but that realization really paints their reunion in a pretty different light for me...

I am also really surprised that, in light of the notion that Jimmy [](//#spoiler ""knew he was going to die and took measures to ensure his son's fortune, why didn't he try to save his son from Jillian? Especially with the chilling things she says like ""He's not going to be a little boy forever"" or something along those lines... Does Jimmy not feel anything about what happened between himself and his mother? Does he still trust his mother to take care of his son?"")

TL;DR: [](//#spoiler ""What convinced Margaret to stop seeking a less formal relationship with the help of the house? Do either Jillian or Jimmy feel any remorse or disgust for what has happened between them and are there indications of that throughout the two seasons? Will Jimmy's son fare well under the protection of Jillian?"")

EDIT: I was also thinking about the possibility of it all being a dream sequence (killing Jimmy and signing the deed over to the church). Setting them both up to make BIG decisions at the beginning of the next season. Or maybe they will change it if that was not the original plan. Looking at the Facebook post about the finale on the BE page, there are almost 7000 comments about ""WTF?!! You idiots killed Jimmy off?!?!?!"".

There's really so much interesting stuff going on in the Gangster world that they just don't talk about in BWE because it either A) doesn't concern Nucky &amp; Co or B) just simply hasn't happened yet.  I've been thinking that when BWE's run is over and the actors are somewhat older, maybe in the late 2010s or early 2020s, it would definitely be very fun and interesting to take more in-depth looks into the lives of Meyer Lanksy and/or Lucky Luciano and/or Al Capone ETC ETC. Capone's certainly been done a lot before, but Lucky and Lansky are relatively underexposed, and both of them lead very, very interesting lives after the current Prohibition era of BWE.     

Now you might be saying ""well that would just be it's own show, not really a spin-off"" BUT my response to that is ""no!"" This dream idea that I'm floating by here would be a spin-off because it would have the same actors, the same characterizations, the same aesthetics, and the same creative team(s). ***History spoilers coming up***: How cool would it be to see an older Vincent Piazza playing an older Lucky Luciano becoming king of New York and assisting the US vs the Axis powers?  How cool would it be to see Anatol Yusef playing an older Meyer Lansky somehow evading the law after all those years and getting into illicit businesses in Florida?

She has a lot of things to think about as far as the safety or her family is concerned.  She just lost the only person that she actually had real feelings for and he felt the same way for her.  Losing him probably wouldn’t be that serious if she wasn’t carrying his baby.  Based on her reaction to seeing him in that box, we can pretty much assume that Nucky knows he was more than just a bodyguard to her.  Should she stay or should she go?  The only positive thing she gets out of being with Nucky is financial support, but right now that means nothing to her.  She can quickly have sex with him, claim that it is his baby, and just say that the kid arrived early but that is a serious stretch.

I really liked Owens character but I am a bit peeved that he chose to go to New York with just Sawicki.  Personally I think he botched everything up like he always does and Owen is the one that got screwed.  Did he think that it was going to be as easy to kill Masseria as it was when he did the hit on the guy in the second season (the guy he stabbed in the bathroom)?

Whatchu think bout that?” My daddy say, “Well, I thinks you need some bookcases.” “Well then that’s what I want you to make me.” Ten month my daddy worked there, and when he finish, he bring me round. “Uh, Mr. Purcell, this here my boy. I’d like to show him what I done.” “Well come on in! Through the front door.” Just like that. And we did. And when I seen them bookcases, all carved with scroll and flowers, baskets of fruit.

First of all I'd just like to say thank you all for taking part in the discussions week-in, week-out. It really is a pleasure to be part of the moderation team for shows I love and Boardwalk Empire is definitely one of the most enjoyable to be a part of, and that's all because of you guys. Comment threads are a joy to read and posts made through the week are on topic and often really insightful.

Obviously, there's things we as moderators can do to make the subreddit better. As we go into the next season we'll try our best to maintain timely discusison threads, update our episode guide and keep on top of lower-quality posts. But for this we'll need your help. Please let us know if you think we're being too harsh or too easy on posts. Myself and /u/unlucky13 both have a slightly different approach to moderation, and though we have the same goals in general, we really need the community to dictate the tone of the subreddit especially as the subreddit becomes more popular.

## **Welcome all ye Newbies**

New subscribers continue to join, and for the finale we saw a massive jump in traffic on the subreddit -- our best day this year, in fact -- with 6,800 unique readers and 42,000 page views (see [full stats as of today](http://imgur.com/a/g8RW5)). We welcome any new viewers and we hope that we can maintain a generally spoiler-free environment for people just joining the show. 

Also, we have an [episode guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/BoardwalkEmpire/comments/13stam/boardwalk_empire_episode_guide_every_episode/) that we're hoping to keep updated (something which we'll probably put in a wiki once subreddit wiki pages are re-enabled) right through until the series ends. Unfortunatley, many of those discussions will be archived and are now read-only, but may provide good reading material if you're part way through the show.

## **Finale Giveaway**

A special thanks also to everyone who participated in the finale discussion, we had a massive turnout.

I'd also just like to apologise if anyone got the wrong impression with our attempts to hold the giveaway.

For those interested, here's what lead to the giveaway and what our thought process was:

/u/ovived came to the moderators just before the finale aired and offered to fund a competition of some kind. We had no real plan, we just wanted to give out some cool Boardwalk Empire stuff to subscribers.

Our decision was that it should be fairly arbitrary so we decided to just let the upvotes decide.

In retrospect this may have been a bad idea, since it most likely promoted karma-grabbing.

This was of course not our intention, and so we've tried to correct that by giving away the top prize to the user with the highest score sorted by 'best', and a runners-up prize to the highest scored sorted by 'top'. We've also selected a third comment which we thought was worthy of praise, and that user also receives a runners-up prize.

So, without further ado, **the winners**! (You may `Ctrl+F` for `TL;DR` here!)

Also, did anyone notice Meyer's comment last episode about not sitting near the window?  I see it as possible foreshadowing as to how Masseria is killed.

In it, they discuss the St. Valentine's Day Massacre (supposedly Al had no knowledge of it going down), the way Al liked to act tough in front of others, how Al became the famous mobster he was, and what ultimately became of him.

The two also discuss some urban legends about Capone, such as his bulletproof car (Woodford explains that it's impossible to have such a thing and not have pictures taken of it everywhere, and people would notice it since it would draw so much attention. Capone had, however, been given a car by Mr. Ford himself that had been fixed so it would turn tighter, allowing getaways to be much more of an easier thing back in those times) and an urban legend regarding the back of Capone's chair having a headrest that was bulletproof as well.

Remember when he started bawling at his father's wake?
I also think that it's going to come to light that Jimmy truly didn't want to assassinate him, and that it was Eli's idea to ice Nuck. Maybe even a drunken confession from Jillian about her and Jimmy's night together. That'll also make Nucky realize why he left Princeton to join the army.

""Season 3 is going to be a hell of a season, because the last episode [of Season 2] is just going to blow people's minds. The last episode, everyone who read it, said, ""No *beep* way."" It's awesome. It's crazy. It's amazing. It will blow people away.""


Know thinking about all the scenarios and plot lines this season, Jimmy getting killed off is the only thing that makes me go ""WOW, no way!"", the rumors and what not about Van Aldens baby dying doesn't really make me go ""wow"". 

We've seen Jimmy's character arc, its probably on of the saddest I've seen in a series, especially after we find out much of his back story. He goes from this nice young man with all the potential in the world to this seedy ruthless killer with his world crashing down. I love how Micheal Pitt played the character tonight, Jimmy at Princeton was happy and bright eyed, Jimmy now is cold and just looks dead in eyes( even when not high).

I, personally, will not remove one of those submissions, so it's ultimately up to the community.

And I've got this theory, I like to call it my Theory of TV Relativity, where specifically someone who has killed another person, then gets murdered themselves.  The example that I like to give is from Buffy when [](//#spoiler ""Anya gets whacked at the end"").   Sure, she was a good guy now, but lets not forget the centuries she spent as a vengeance demon doing awful things to people.  



Of course, I realize this isn't always the case,  like with anti-heroes or people who are just, who kill people and get away . But in general I find this to true - you kill someone, especially in cold blood, you end up dying (being murdered) yourself.



This has sent me on a quest through TV tropes to see if its an actual *thing*, but no such luck.  The closest I've come to supporting this theory is Karmic Death and/or The Killer Becomes the Killed, but both, I feel, are too specific for what I'm trying to describe.  Its not a plot device, per se, but something that transcends straight to the audience, where are blood lust/sense of vengeance needs to be satisfied.



That said, it only  it only makes sense that [](//#spoiler ""Jimmy should have to die."")  He's killed or tried to kill a lot of people - the two guys at the fountain, the guy he scalped, his father, Nucky and Munya, to name a few.  The only difference is that this really offends are senses because audiences love fan-service, Jimmy was popular, and naturally we route for the underdog, ie: we say ""Wow, what a shit life Jimmy has had, wouldn't it be great to see him actually succeed at something for a change!""  But we should note that Jimmy is not the hero of this show.  He's not even an anti-hero...



A good example of this is on LOST [](//#spoiler ""Ana Lucia kills Shannon who in turn gets shot by Michael who ultimately gets blown up."")   On Bones, [](//#spoiler "" the Grave Digger, who buried her victims alive, gets executed by sniper."")  And practically EVERYONE in The Departed, but that's a movie.  You get my point.



I'm not sure how well my theory holds up in a show about gangsters, who, in fact murder people and presumably get away with it but, like I said, I'm really trying to wrap my head around what happened in ""To The Lost.""  Thanks for letting me babble.  What do you guys think?  Is karma going to catch up with the rest of them?  (I'm thinking about Van Alden and Nucky, in particular, who have now tasted blood.)



Also, side note: Jimmy should have never screwed Munya over - that would have been a great alliance.  Never, ever, fuck with a butcher.

This is where he is noticed by Margaret Schroeder, a pretty, pregnant housewife who comes to him for help in getting her abusive husband, Hans, a job. Later that evening, the duplicitous Nucky privately tells his ward bosses about the opportunity to make huge profits selling bootleg liquor. At a countdown-to-midnight blast at Babette's Supper Club, he assures Jimmy Darmody, a recently returned WWI vet, that his appointment as ""Man Friday"" to the new Chief Clerk of the Fourth Ward, Paddy Ryan, will lead to bigger things. Jimmy, meanwhile, has higher aspirations and ends up making an alliance that may have dire consequences for both him and Nucky. "")

Meanwhile, in Chicago, Al Capone shows a local reporter what he thinks about accusations that Johnny Torrio was involved in the killing of local mobster ""Big Jim"" Colosimo. Back in Atlantic City, Nucky discusses the upcoming election with Commodore Louis Kaestner, his aging mentor, with whom he debates the women's vote issue.

They've got a great cast of characters, and I love the time period and story and all of that, but I feel that their putting together of the puzzle, so to speak, has been very lackluster. Compare the heart of this show with Walter White, BB fame. White's transformation was so, so believable. You can track when (and why) he's changed. Nucky? Sometimes to me, it feels like he changes on a dime just because the writers want him to be a tragic figure (which he's not).

The entire show has been about self-centered, hubristic characters fighting and betraying each other over whatever modicum of power can be attained whithin the world they live. The parallels between classic tragedies are pretty apparent, notably Macbeth and Oedipus Rex. Jimmy was a dead man as soon as he slept with his mother and murdered his father. In this world, there is no altruism without an expected reciprocation, no mercy or forgiveness. The show has been about awful people doing awful things to each other with very little regard for those not involved.

That's not the real tragedy, though. The real tragedy comes from the audience. We watch this show, hoping that Nucky gets acquitted or that Chalky gets revenge. We watch hoping that our favorite characters will, in the end, find a way. We must have some degree of empathy with these violent, selfish characters; the show's existence is contingent on it.

It should have happened at the end of Season 3. In my opinion, the Nucky vs Jimmy storyline could have been fleshed out a lot more.

Here's what could have happened.


 - Season 2 should have been all Nucky. Right now, I think the Nucky Thompson character SUCKS. If you look at main characters like Tony Soprano, Don Draper, or Walter White you'll see that they can be assholes and unlikeable at times but they have a soft side to them as well. Nucky is just cold. The shooting Jimmy set up should have put Nucky in a coma for the rest of Season 2. Here we could have gotten some character development about his past.

- While Nucky is in a coma, Jimmy rises to power for the rest of Season 2.

- Nucky's coma in Season 2 would also give Margaret more reason to turn to faith as this man and her daughter are stricken down with ailments. 

- Season 3 then begins with Nucky recovering 16 months later and Jimmy beginning his downfall and would end similarly to how it did in the real Season 2....

Just hear me out. I had been hearing rumors all week that what happened in the season finale would ""change the way we think about the show"" and be a huge shocker. Of course, the killing of Jimmy Darmody fit the bill, and while it disappointed me since I don't know whether the show will be nearly as good next year without him in it, it certainly packed an emotional punch and was a great capper to an epic season.

However, while it has been noted that there were many ways the show could have gone, I've yet to see anyone suggest it could have gone down the path of killing a noted historical figure like Capone. Talk about changing the way we think about the show; right now, when we watch, we know that there are several characters who, excusing the pun, are untouchable, simply because they are real people and we know what happened to them in real life. I think killing Capone would have sent a great message for future seasons of the show: this is not necessarily a true story, we're using these characters to fit the mold of our tale (and not the other way around), and ANYONE is expendable. Obviously, the death of Darmody does show us the series is not afraid to knock off main characters, but it still doesn't tell me the show would be willing to plant a bullet in the head of, say, Arnold Rothstein if it needed to. This fact causes the show to forgo the possibility of having the same level of suspense and uncertainty as similar shows like The Wire or Game of Thrones, because we know the writers aren't truly willing to go all the way to assure us that anything can happen.

Capone to me would have been the perfect historical figure to kill because his character has been uninteresting lately, and he won't have much to do with Jimmy gone anyway. The other real-life characters on the show, I think, have a bit more potential for drama from this point on.

Thoughts? I can see people thinking there's no way the show should go this route, but I really don't think it would hurt the show one bit to do it and would actually help it greatly.",,False,self,t5_2s0gm,False,,,True,t3_nazmn,http://www.reddit.com/r/BoardwalkEmpire/comments/nazmn/i_was_hoping_they_would_kill_spoilers/,
