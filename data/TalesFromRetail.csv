1367109170.0,4065,self.TalesFromRetail,1d8v0y,How to change a kid's life in 20 minutes,Osiris32,6330,2265,399,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1d8v0y/how_to_change_a_kids_life_in_20_minutes/,"Some of you may recognize this story, since I posted it before elsewhere, but again this is the perfect sub for it.  And it's a happy story.  We all like happy stories.

This story starts long ago in the dim ages, when bear and bison swarmed the forest and the prairie.  Or about 2004, which ever you prefer.  I was working at a sporting goods/automotive store at the time, at the customer service counter.  A father and his son, who appeared to be about 11, came in and asked where the camping equipment was.  I pointed them towards the two areas that held our camping merch, and was about to go about doing something else boring when the boy piped up, ""I'm going on my first Boy Scout campout!""

Now, if you've read my other stories, you'll know that I'm an Eagle Scout.  I take this position very seriously, and will do everything in my power to encourage and help young scouts on their trail to Eagle.  So I looked over at my boss, a nice lady who hired me because of my outdoor experience in scouting, and asked if I could go help these people personally.  She smiled and said yes.

The father was COMPLETELY out of his element with camping gear.  By his attitude and behavior I would guess that he had never gotten further out of the city limits than a highway in his life.  Everything in the aisle perplexed him, but thankfully his son's troop had given them a list of what equipment they'd need.  So for about 20 minutes or so I went through the list with them, point by point, explaining what each thing was, what it did, what version to use, and how Kybo Tape is the scout term for toilet paper.  That got quite a bit of laughter.

During this time I also talked with the kid.  He was very new to scouting, only having joined a couple months prior.  He was enthusiastic about getting to go out into the wilderness and camp and make campfires and fish and all the other activities he'd heard about.  I talked about my experiences in scouting, which was all of what he was talking about and so much more.  Climbing Mt Hood, going to National Jamboree, touring military bases, rafting down the Deschutes, the kid was very impressed.  I kept telling him, ""this is only the start, you have no idea how awesome it can get.""

So we finally have a cart filled with a small tent, sleeping bag, cooking equipment, small first aid kit, beginner backpack, rope (you and yer fuckin' rope), shovel, water bottle, etc etc etc.  Quite a haul, but I'd done my best to get everything that the kid would need while still keeping things cheap.  Well, cheap-ish.

The total was something like a bit over $200.  Now, they say that a picture is worth a thousand words, but if I could have taken a picture of the dad's face when the total came up, it would be worth a MUCH longer essay.  It was a shock/fear/resignation combination that said, ""damn, I didn't expect it to be this much.  But he's so excited, I can't tell him no, it would break his heart.  Maybe if I just eat ramen for the next couple weeks, I can afford this.""  As dad reached  reluctantly for his wallet, I flashed him a smile, looked at my boss, and knocked 20% off the total.  ""A scout is helpful and kind,"" I quoted.  The father thanked me profusely, as did the son.  They left with a spring in their step and smiles on their faces.  My boss said, ""that was very nice, but don't ever do that again.""  I replied, ""but boss, you do realized that, from now on, they are going to be in here on a regular basis to buy camping equipment, right?  I know that kid's look, he's just like me at that age, and he's going to be spending a LOT of dad's money here.""  She laughed, agreed, and the deed was put out of my mind as other customers approached.

But the story isn't done yet, dear reader!  For about a week later, look who comes running through the door, but our little first-time camper, with dad trailing along.  This kid very specifically wanted to see ME, because he had pictures and he wanted to show them to me.  Awwww, sweet!  Sure, let's take a look...hey, I know this camp!  I know exactly where you were!  So we talked about being at that camp, and taking the hike down the hill to the old camp location, and how the fishing in the lake is, and the deer that just don't care that you are around, and how the chow hall seems to be made mostly of sieves given how drafty it is.  We had a brag board up for the hunters who had trophy hunts, so I pinned a couple of the better pictures to the board.  This kid beamed with pride, then ran off to use the bathroom.

This is when dad chimed in, and thanked me for a much more personal reason.  He and the kid's mom had gone through a fairly nasty divorce, and she had majority custody.  Scouting events were one of the few ways that dad could spend extended quality time with his son, and this camping trip had been very good for the both of them.  He got a little choked up about it, as did I.  I simply told him, ""this is what scouting is all about.  'Help other people at all times.'  This is just the tip of the iceberg.""

Over the next year+, they became regulars of the store.  I knew which troop they were with, a large and active one, so they were pretty consistently in need of various consumable camping supplies.  More pictures got posted to the brag board.  His first summer camp saw him earn four merit badges and the Mile Swim badge.  I started to volunteer with his troop as a merit badge counselor, and had a great time.

However, real life gets in the way.  School, and a couple of new jobs meant I couldn't devote the time I needed to to help his troop out.  We basically drifted apart, and the other things going on in my life made me forget about him and his dad.

Until late in 2010.  I get a phone call out of the blue.  The voice on the other end is deeper, self confident.  ""Is Osiris32 there?""  ""Yeah, that's me, who is this?""  It's that young scout from the store, calling me up to invite me to his Eagle Court of Honor.  I stood there in my kitchen in mute shock.  All those memories of helping him out came flooding back.  ""You better believe I'll be there.  I'll even try to fit into my old uniform.""

And so I did.  Though I eschewed the shorts and went for pants.  This young boy, now turned into a young man, stood tall and proud as they pinned the Eagle Medal to his shirt, recited the Eagle Charge, and gave a short speech thanking people who'd made a difference in his life.  He looked right at me as he gave the speech, pointed me out, and said, ""this guy right here, he was the first adult to encourage me.  His example as an Eagle was what I followed.  I cannot thank him enough.""  Tears flowed.

Following the ceremony, I found his dad.  Scouting had made both of them better people.  He'd decided that being bitter towards his kid's mom wasn't what a scout leader (oh yeah, he was now an assistant scoutmaster, the bug bites very hard) should be doing.  This had allowed their divorce to become more amicable, and they had successfully renegotiated custody some time earlier.  He was a happier man, and was so proud of his son I was pretty sure his chest was going to burst.  His son, now tall, strong, confident, and an obvious leader, was destined to go places.  He would be graduating high school the next spring, and was looking at getting into college for a degree in psychology with a minor in criminal justice.  He wanted to live his Oath and Law by being a police officer.  My own chest felt like it was going to burst at this point.

I still keep in touch with him.  He's now coming up on his 21st birthday, and is readying applications for various police departments around town.  I've already told him that I'd gladly be his reference, because he's one of the guys we all want to become a cop, someone with a strong and steadfast sense of duty, honor, integrity, generosity, and kindness of spirit.  He'll make a damn fine officer, and I can say that a little part of that, just a little part, is because of my willingness to help him choose tents one day several years ago.

It really helped cut down on returns. This meant, however, that we would get a few customers who would abuse this policy. Enter Draconian. 

I don't know his real name, I just know that every character he made on any game, and the Xbox profile he set up on our demo unit was named Draconian. He was a late teens/early 20s man child. About 6'5"" and overweight. He would come in almost daily and spend hours playing games, rarely purchasing anything.

When this happened, The Elder Scrolls:Oblivion had come out. Draconian was coming in daily and spent literally hours standing in one spot and playing the game. I would inform him every half hour or so that he needed to take a break and could just play games all day. He would save, walk away for a minute and jump right back to it when I started working on something else. 

After a few days of this, I was tired of him. 

The next time he came in, he played Oblivion for a solid 5 hours. I didn't bother him once. When he finally took his leave of the game, and I was sure he was gone, I loaded up his game and dumped almost a week's worth of progress in one part of the map. Warped him across the map to the woods, and left his character naked and alone. Deleted every save file except this one, and shut the game off.

The next time Draconian came in, he asked to play Oblivion. I gladly obliged, put the game in and walked away. I can still remember him sputtering and frantically trying to search for a way to get his progress back. He was nearly in tears as he left minutes after.

I went to a school whose name is similar to a large craft store chain. We'll just say the store started with A.C. something and my school's name started with Moore. I was home from break and working at a local sandwich/connivence store. After work one day I decided I needed some brushes, and A.C. Something was on the way. So I'm wearing my work uniform from my sandwich store(its just a polo shirt).  I'm also wearing a lanyard that is plastered with my school's name and attached are my keys and my student ID which is also plastered with my school's name. I'm in the painting section which is next to the fake flowers when an elderly lady doesn't just tap, but grabs my arm. 

Lady: You, are there any more tulips?
Me: Uh, I'm sorry?
Lady: Where are the rest of the tulips?
Me: Sorry, I don't know. I don't work here. 
Lady. DON'T LIE TO ME IT SAYS YOU DO RIGHT HERE. 

The woman points to my lanyard and school ID. 
Me: Oh no! That's where I go to school. (laughing) 
Lady: Don't laugh at me, goddamn lazy employees. I'm going to go get your manager and you'll see who is laughing now! 

She walks away and I go back to looking at paint. About three minutes later I hear the shrill voice of the old lady again. 

Lady: There she is! That's the girl!
What I assume to be the asst. manager looks pissed. 
Asst Manager: I'm writing you up and you are going to help this woman. 
Me: I'm sorry? 
Asst Manager: If you don't help this woman I'm writing you up twice.
Me: I don't work here.
Asst: Okay if that's what you want consider yourself fired. 
The old lady has a smug look on her face. 

Right then though what I assume to be the manager appears and asks the Asst Manager what happened. 

Asst: She refuses to help this woman. 
The Manager looks pissed as well but when he walks up to me his face drops and he looks amused. 
Manager: You don't work here. 
Me: Nope. 
Lady: She's a bad employee! 
Manager: She is not an employee m'am, she doesn't work here. 
Lady: Because you fired her! 
Manager: No, because she never worked here. 

The manager then tells the old woman that he cannot have customers harassing other customers and he tells her to leave. He profusely apologizes to me, the woman turns bright purple and slinks away. I get a 10% off coupon and the Manager tells the Asst. Manager to meet him in the back office. 

I still have no idea how the Asst. thought I worked there. I'm guessing he just had no clue who was working there. (Obviously)

One day my boss asked if I would interview a 16 year old girl for a position we had. She said she would hire her if I think they would do well. I sit down to interview the goth. Imagine the girl with a dragon tattoo about 150lbs heavier, and more face rings. She was wearing a uniform for the fast-food joint down the road. The conversation goes something like this. 

""So i see your wearing a uniform. Are you still working for them?"" 

""No i just walked out because they were being dumb"" 

""Being dumb? What do you mean by that?"" 

""They were being dumb, because they were asking too many questions"" 

Awkward pause... 

""Well this is an interview and the purpose is to ask questions. So what makes you think you would be a good fit here at pizza place?"" 

""Well I like pizza"" 

After the interview I decided to hire this girl because she was entertaining and would be a good laugh when my boss had to work with her every day. My boss puts in the paper work and hires her without ever seeing her. The next day i come into work and my boss is fuming mad. The goth showed up with purple hair and more rings in her face. My boss told me to deal with it. So i go out and tell the goth she has to change. When asked why i tell her because she is scaring the customers away. The goth busted out laughing. She actually went home and changed. We put her on prep work in the back to keep her away from people because we quickly found out there was no filter from her brain to her mouth. A month goes by and i notice cuts on her arm (she always wore long sleeve shirts). I asked her about it and she acted like it was no big deal. Come to find out she was having the typical ""no one understands me and my parents just don’t understand"" issues most kids have; she was just taking it to an extreme. I told her what she was doing was wrong and she should talk to someone even if it is a school counselor. She actually did it. In a sense i became a life coach to this girl for about 6 months. She became an invaluable member of the team, i helped her filter what she said and to consider others and life was grand. About 6 months later i finish up at a Jr college and am moving away to go to big people college and it’s my last day at pizza place. The girl pulls me into the back and just begins to sob. She says ""Thank you Mr. Webus for giving me a chance when no one else would. You saw past the thing i was and saw the woman i could be. If it wasn't for you i would not have a job, i would not have moved out of my parents’ house, and I’d probably be dead by now. I just wanted to say thank you for hiring me here and for being my friend."" My heart about imploded on itself. I felt so guilty. Here is this girl pouring her heart out singing my praise because i wanted to troll my boss. I hired her as a joke. I decided not to tell her. I figured i could live with the guilt because not knowing means she feels there is someone in her life that cares. Fast forward a few years later and I’m in my profession going out to lunch and i hear ""MR WEBUSMASTER MR WEBUSMASTER!"" It was her again. Her hair was blond apparently she had been dying it black. She is the manager of a sandwich shop in the mall going to night classes at college to be a social worker. She said she wanted to help others who were in her situation. I almost cried. Felt i would share this with you reddit. If the end justifies the means then why do i feel so guilty?

After we closed we had a policy where we would continue to sell pizza that was in the window while we cleaned, we just wouldn't make any new pizza. Normally this was fine, mostly we would get people from the other businesses in the strip mall wanting a late night snack. 

Anyways, one night this lady and here two daughters come in like half an hour after we closed. I was already stacking chairs at this point which is one of the last things we do.
I say hello as she walks in and say we are closed but would gladly sell her some of the slices we have left. She just ignored me. Here is how the rest of our encounter went.

-Lady (standing at the register): ""Are you going to help me or not"".

-Me: ""All we have left is pepperoni, how many slices would you like""

-Lady: ""Slices? I don't wan't that! I want a (some kind) Pizza and we are in a hurry so make it quick""

-Me: ""Sorry mam but we closed over 45 mins ago, the ovens are off. I would gladly sell you what we have left"".

-Lady: ""What? Your lights are still on which means you aren't closed, you should still be making pizzas. Whatever give me everything you have left.

-Me: (Box up pizza, charge her for a whole pizza even though its a slice short. saves her money) ""Ok mam here is your pizza, your total is $x.xx. I charged you for a whole pizza to save you money""

-Lady: ""What!!! That isn't a whole pizza, you can't charge me for that. It's missing a slice."" (One of her daughter's explains how I am saving her money)

The first four months or so I was a bagger, then the managers had me crosstrained as a cashier.  This story occurred about a week after that training.  

Guy walks into my line, and in his rather large order is a large pack of chicken legs.  It's one of the last items I ring up, and as soon as I scan it, he goes off, saying that the associate in the market had told him it would be a different, cheaper price.  He's pissed, so I apologize and call my manager, but he evidently wants to go bitch at the associate who told him the price, so he grabs the pack and starts storming off towards the back.  With his order still sitting in front of me.  With a line of about ten people behind him.  I'm not sure what to do, but before I can do anything, the 5'-nothing lady (who was behind him in line) turns, and at the top of her voice, yells, ""HEY! Get the HELL back here and pay for your shit!""

Chicken guy stops dead in his tracks, then turns around and comes back.  He starts in on this lady, but he also starts paying for his order (as I recall, he wrote a check).  He's going on, ""Don't you ever fucking talk to me like that again, you don't know who I am,"" and she's giving it right back, ""I don't give a fuck who you are, you don't walk off like that, you see this line?""  

It continues like that, them at each others' throats, and poor me just trying to finish the order and stay unnoticed.  Finally his order finishes, and he snatches his shit up and say ""I'll be waiting for you outside, bitch.""

It’s long so feel free to ignore.

I have always lived in the city, but moved to a very small rural town last year.  Lots of farms, ranches, and woods.  I’m actually growing to love it.  Except for the community of rich, entitled people who come down on the weekends.  Thankfully I do not work in customer service in any form so my contact with them is minimal.  I’ve had two very memorable encounters at the same grocery store, both with the same amazing witness.

First one – I was shopping on a Friday afternoon a few months ago, stocking up regular stuff as well as a planned party for my SO’s coworkers so the total came to about $200.  I had been helping bag everything as it was being rung up.  The clerk finished, gave me the total, but before I could move, the woman in line behind me stomped forward, swiped her card, and punched in her PIN then went back to yacking on her phone.

I just stood there for a moment, looking at her.  I finally said, “Excuse me?”  She cut this glare at me and turned away.  So again, “Excuse me?”  And I get “I am on the phone, God some people are so rude!”

*You want rude, bitch?*  “I was just wondering why you paid for my groceries. Not that I don’t really appreciate it.”  Her “What?  I’m not paying for your shit!  How dare you!  What makes you think anyone would just pay for you?”  Me “Well you just did ma’am.  You swiped your card and paid for my groceries.”  Her “It doesn’t matter when I swipe the card during the transaction.”  Me “It does if she’s still ringing up my transaction!”

And now we’ve got a problem.  Transaction is complete and yes, she has paid for my $200 groceries.  She actually got off the phone at that point.  We get a manager over to try to figure out what to do.  They end up deciding for the manager to do a complete return of the groceries to her card and then ring them up again so I can pay.  And cue the bitching.  She’s in a hurry, her time is valuable, this is ridiculous.  So I toss in, “Lady at this point I could walk out the door.  My groceries are paid for and this is a problem that you caused!”  Now the clerk had gone to another register and started ringing other customers.  But there was a guy standing behind bitchy woman.  He’s a solid 6’6 or more, just a HUGE guy.  Obvious biker.  Black leather, t-shirt, chains, you name it.  When I said that, he cracked up laughing and said, “Wow, you’re a cute thing but you are a little badass aren’t you?”

The bitchy woman turned to him and said something about minding his own business.  *That’s it lady, poke the grizzly bear.  What could happen?*  And this guy’s face went from laughing to scary in a second flat.    He told her, “Lady you need to just stand there quietly while they clean up the mess you made.”  I don’t intimidate easily but even I was nervous.  But then he smiled and winked at me.  So the manager does the return and I chat with scary biker guy.  He told me that he keeps telling his little girl that “It’s important to be polite, but it’s also important to stand up for yourself.”  Every time the bitch woman made a noise, like huffed or explosive sigh, he made this little sound almost like a growl.  The clerk offered to check him out a few times, but he just stood there, arms crossed, a solid mountain of a man, talking to me.   Finally the return is done and the bitch has the nerve to ask, “So can I get checked out now?  You are going to let me go first right?”

I just said no and the manager started re-ringing my stuff.  Final dig – bitch started the *I am never shopping here again, do you know how much business you are going to lose?*  I glanced over her items and said, “What thirty – thirty five dollars?  Oh my God they will have to lay off half their staff.”  Biker guy called me “Little badass” again and went to the next lane to pay for his stuff.   

---------------------
I’ve run into this guy a few times.  Even met his wife and ‘little’ girl once (who’s not much younger than I am).  He calls me ‘little badass’ every time. 

--------------------------------
Then came today.  I just needed a few things so I run in on my way home.  I got to the store and there are signs everywhere.  And I mean everywhere.  Both doors, all across the front windows, posted on several aisles, and on every register – CASH ONLY – Computers not working, all purchases must be paid in cash.   I’m good so I grab what I need and get in line (there were only two open).  In front of me is an older woman with a cart full of stuff.   Everything is rung up and she whips out her checkbook.  

Clerk - “Uh, ma’am, you’ll need to pay cash, our computers aren’t working.  There are signs.”

Woman – “I saw those signs, you can take a check, it’s the same thing.” And tried to hand the check to the clerk.

Clerk “Ma’am I can’t take that.  We can only take cash.”

Woman waved the check in the clerk’s face  “Just take it.  It’s the same as cash.”

And me “Ma’am the only thing that’s the same as cash is CASH.”

Woman “You stay out of this you filthy little bitch.”

Me “What the hell?”

And enter biker guy and wife – “Hey little badass I thought I heard your voice.  How are you?”  We chatted for a second and the woman is still shoving her check in the poor clerk’s face.

Me “Lady seriously, you need to pay with cash.  They cannot take a check.  A check is not the same as cash.”

Woman turned, “Look you…” caught sight of biker guy and slammed her mouth shut.  Glared for a second then says “So what would you suggest I do?”

Me “Well there is a bank across the street, another about a half mile that way, another about that far that way.  I would suggest you go get cash.”

She grumbled and slammed things around… then pulled out a wad of cash with more than enough to pay for her shit.  Gave me one more glare and stomped out.

Biker guy “Still the little badass I see.  Though I wish I’d called you little ass kicker.”

Biker’s wife “She won’t get that reference.”

Me “sure I do.  It’s what Daryl called the baby when she was born.”

Biker guy just roared and yanked open his jacket to show me his Walking Dead T shirt.  We ended up in the parking lot for a half hour talking about last night’s episode and what we thought was coming next.

--------------------------------

I should mention, with the first incident, I did think after I left the store that I could have gone to the ATM and pulled the cash to pay the bitch.  But I’m actually glad I didn’t think of that so that I got to ‘waste all her valuable time’.  If you actually read all this, thanks, hope you got a laugh.  And hope that the next bitch customer comes with a little badass and big ass biker dude.


TL;DR – Bikers are amazing, defenders of little badasses who stand up to bitchy customers.


Edit Fixed the typo, they bug me, thanks for catching it!

Edit2. Sorry for the Walking Dead spoiler, if anyone knows how to hide it please let me know.  I didn't realize there were places that were so far behind us.

And for those who went there,  I have a boyfriend that I moved to the middle of nowhere with.  And Big Ass Biker Guy has a daughter about my age, and a wife who is very nice, but is a Big Ass Biker Babe who could snap me in half.  He's a great guy that I run into everywhere (small town) but mostly see at this store.  THANKS! !

The customer grabs a soda from the Fridge at the register and scans it just as another customer walks up.

Me and the customer look up and noticed the look on the woman's face as the first customer gets out his credit card.

Smelly Snatch &amp; Mannequin Molester

The most shocking to me was when this older couple (50-60) came in reeking of black and milds and booze (more so the wife than the husband). The wife who had scraggly blonde hair, missing teeth, loose skin dripping everywhere from a recent weight loss and all around bad personal hygiene asked me to fit her for a bra cause it had been upwards for 10 years since she had bought a bra, always willing to help I happily agreed. We go into the fitting room and before I know it she strips her top half and lifts her arms to reveal long (and i mean loooooong) tangled underarm hair so I measure her, tell her size and she seems delighted. So I leave her in the room and I go select a couple bras for her, once I leave the room I see her husband caressing the mannequins vagina and staring at its arse. I let it go and go on the hunt for bras, while I'm looking he then starts yelling, quite loudly i may add, at how much would I be willing to sell the ""pretty young blonde"" for. I politely told him they weren't for sale etc etc but he still kept asking, caressing, and even sniffing the life sized mannequin. So I smiled nodded and went back in to cater to his wife. When I got in there she asked since I had measured her bust would I kindly measure her waist and hips cause she'd like to know, once again I agreed with a smile. I was at her waist told her the number and she got so excited (ya know cause of the weight loss). I squatted down do reach her hips and BOOOOOM. She pulls down her elastic banded mum jeans, to reveal her large flurry, matted muff. About 4inches in front of my face was this woman's vagina, she was not wearing underwear...Obviously I couldn't do anything to upset her (sensitive job and whatnot) so I continued measuring around the sagging skin, trying not to touch anything I didn't have to and then the smell hit me. It was that old foosty, musty, old sock smell mixed with a fish market and some strong perfume. I held my breath and told her the measurement and stood up so fast I got a head rush. I then left her to her own devices to try on and went to get some sanitizer for my hands. Of course the husband was still chatting up the mannequin but I just smiled and nodded at him and went about my business til she was done.

TL;DR Old foul smelling couple comes in for a fitting, husband feels up/molests the mannequins and I get face time with the wife's vagina.

Trash Can Shit Storm

It's my second week on the job, getting the swing of American retail, learning how often to say ""ya'll"", so it's going well. I'm serving this adorable old woman she's super nice, gave her a coupon that i didn't have to give her, she's happy as a clam. She leaves the register and I turn around to get a drink of water and to look on the receiving bar (which has loads of clothes on it to be put away) but still in a good mood from awesome customer. I turn back around and that sweet little old lady is charging at me like a rabid bull. Her face is stern, strained and bright beetroot red. I . AM. FUCKING. SCARED. (so scared I have to pee). I though I had made a mistake on her receipt as she is holding it high in the air with the other hand gripping her purse for dear life. I don't know what to do so I freeze, like a bloody deer in the headlights. After what seems like an eternity or this crazed woman coming at me she makes it to my register. I try to ask her how I could help her again/ if I made a mistake and it's obvious I am invisible to her. She doesn't stop AT the register she makes her way around it beside me pulls out the little blue trash can from my left hikes up her skirt, drops her tights and fucking EXPLODES into that poor wee unsuspecting trash can. What do I do? I stand there staring at her looking gormless. I have no idea what to do, or what the protocol even is for a shit situation. She starts profusely apologizing and stating that she couldn't make it the extra 20ft to the toilets....I come around to my senses get on the phone, call a manager and page housekeeping. I felt so bad for the housekeeping women she's so nice and funny...We still used that trash can, it even survived a store remodel...it was still there to my left on the day I quit.

TL;DR Sweet adorable old lady shits a fountain into my unsuspecting trash can. Same trash can still there and in daily use.

Shameless Pooper.

Busy day. Running around covering 2 departments cause we're short staffed and scheduling manager is an idiot. Carrying an arm load (about 16-21) bras from the fitting room to my counter, the lingerie department is a mess and I'm all by myself (as usual). In the middle of all the questions from customers, calls on the phone, passing comments of associates...I see it in the middle of the pathway around the store right in front of the bathroom entrance (about 5 ft) and inbetween my register and the home store register. A small slight Asian man about 48-52ish unbuckling his trousers, pulling them down along with his undergarments, revealing his flaccid willy, squats down and starts to poop. In front of customers and associates just keeps going. It is not a small pile, I have horses so I know piles of shit, this was a horse sized shit for a small sized man. His wife/older daughter (30s 40s?) turns teh corner, sees him and starts screaming at him and drags him to the loo with the trousers around his ankles. Leaving the pile. So my manager sees and orders me to guard the tower of poop on one side and my coworker on the other. I am being paid $10/hr to guard a pile of shit...The smell is moving quickly and customers are freaking out but they are all stopping for a good 10 seconds a piece to stare and marvel at the giant piece of fecal matter. It takes forever for housekeeping to show up but I am grinning ear to ear because my boss is a douche, we clash all the time, she is a moron. I don't even care about the smell cause I am watching her hang onto a fixture of guy fieri pans holding her nose and throat while gagging.

Turns out the wife/older daughter was the bad guy of the story not the small man. Small man needed the toilet, they sent him on his way alone, he didn't know where it was and not only that he'd had a stoke a day or two before and they had left him BY HIMSELF in a place he didn't know. So he wasn't all there. When they eventually came out of the bathroom they were screaming at him and he just looked like he had no idea hat was going on. So what'd they do left him alone (again) and wandered off down to the ladies dept to check out the clearance &gt;.&lt; I wandered down to check on the man but he'd wandered outside. So being on the clock I couldn't follow.

TL;DR Guy shits on floor, not his fault, uncaring family.


The Birth of Titty Sling Gurl

It was a slow Sunday, about 20 minutes before the after lunch church crowd usually comes in, and I was dressing a couple mannequins in some bathing suits (opposite side of the bra dept). So there I am elbow deep in some mannequin arse trying to hike on a pair of neon orange and pink bikini bottoms. For the record I am 5'2 and these mannequins are at least 6ft tall maybe more. So of course I look like I am humping this mannequin while I'm really trying to make sure it's arms and legs don't fall off and that's when I hear it.

""Hellluurrrrr???""

I look up and the expression on my face can only be described as ""WUT?""

""Hellllurrrrrr??? Yo bra ladeeeee???""

I wave my hand and tell this voice I'll be right with her and to give me a second.

Apparently a second is too long. She comes storming up through the swimwear racks, and I get my first look at Shamu. I say Shamu, not because of her size but the wave bathing suits are flying off her like waves off a small child. She's about 5'6, 300-350lbs, long neon green nails, dew rag paired with a weave that appeared to be falling out, leggings, a black shirt that had cut out holes in the back and an arse that was as big as the boot of my car. She was quite a woman.

I dropped the mannequin and smiled while cheerily stating my apologies for the wait and how could I help her.

Her reply went as follows, "" Is this where I get da tittay slings""

Trying not to laugh I tell her yes and ask if she knows what size she needs.

""I dunno my tittay size but I don't want you to be touchin all up on my tittays, that's wrong forreal.""

So i politely tell her how the fitting process works and she eventually agrees and she leaves happily with her new bras. Until a week later she returns with what I believe is her mother? And yells across the department, ""HEEEY HEEEY DAS HER!!! DAS HER!!! THE TITTAY SLING GURRRL!!!""

Tl;DR I am the ""tittay sling gurrl""

I was working at a local chain bakery in a fairly upscale neighbourhood one Saturday when this happened. For some backstory, in our store our manager always told us to ask a lot of questions when people just asked for ""bread"" because otherwise customers had a habit of returning later and complaining/trying to score free stuff. I'm not talking a *lot* of questions either, it was literally stuff like ""seeds or no seeds, brown or white bread, thick or thin slice?"" and we always moved and worked while talking so we could provide fast service.

One day I was working alone and this guy came in, clearly in a massive hurry. He was the only customer so I was doing my best to be courteous and get his items bagged up quickly for him, asking the usual questions when he looks up and snaps at me. ""Are you fucking stupid or something? I just want a loaf of bread. You'd better work on your customer service skills because it looks like you'll be in sales for the rest of your life."" At this point I'm kind of in shock because I was honestly just going through the usual routine and trying to work quickly for him and no one had ever said anything like that to me at work before. Never mind the fact that I had good results in school and was on track to law school, I was totally stumped about what to say to him, whether to defend myself or just take it. That's when this voice pipes up from over the man's shoulder. It's my English teacher and he says ""Actually, this cashier is a student of mine and in the top 5% of her grade, you absolute dick."" The man looks flabbergasted, slaps his money down on the counter and stalks off with his loaf of bread. I just looked at my English teacher and he smiled, apologised for swearing and kept walking with his coffee. 

EDIT- There seems to be some confusion when I say ""law school."" In Australia, you can go straight from high school to an undergraduate Bachelor of Laws. I meant my predicted high school results were high enough to get me into my preferred university for that course. And yes, the main point of contention for my story has almost nothing to do with my story...

I was checking out of the local home supply warehouse, and used my store credit card for my purchase - which consisted of a couple of pallets of fencing materials.

The cashier didn't look like she was new.  This particular store has everyone wearing orange vests, and they are encouraged to decorate them.  Hers was starting to look a little shabby, but had lots of colored drawings of flowers all over it.  She'd been here for a while.

And she was wooden.  She was doing her job quickly and efficiently, but I might as well had been invisible.  No eye contact, no talk, no life.  Taking my cue from her, after my initial ""hello"" I stayed quiet.

When I pulled out my store credit card, she asked me if she could see my ID too.  

I've been the victim of identity theft before.  My credit cards have my signature, and a ""see ID"" on the back.  Even now I have a fraud alert on my credit.  

So I'm VERY happy when cashiers ask to see my ID, and I ALWAYS tell them ""thank you"" in a cheerful manner.

""Thank you so much for asking!"" I said as I pulled out my ID, ""I'm always so glad when a cashier asks!  I know people give you crap for it, but it really does mean a lot to me.  So thank you.""

And she started crying!  It wasn't like she was bawling, but her eyes teared up and her voice got that tremulous tone we have all experienced at some point in our lives.

There weren't any other customers, so we talked for a few minutes about how terrible customers can be, and she regained her composure again.  Apparently another customer had read her the riot act for something or another (I'm not sure what) and it had really hurt her.

We're across the street from a mixed-income neighborhood, so a lot of our customers come from there. Lot of nice people, some non-English speakers, but people who are super nice and make the job fun.

Around 815 PM, three teenage boys started to ride around the parking lot in their bikes. We don't think much of this - it's a large parking lot, filled with many stores (such as Sprawl Mart). We start picking up the carts from the parking lots as the three boys walk into the store, playing with the laptops and tablets, then the cameras. Fine, whatever we thought, we're almost closed, so be it.

Then they entered the small electronics department and started to knock things over - throwing down iPad cases on the floor, putting the music on loud and cursing at each other, running around the television area and putting terrible things on the smart tv's (websites with pornographic images, loud music - NOTE: We never blocked websites on the smart TV's, but now we do, we never thought this would happen.""

My manager comes over, talks to them, but as he does, they start calling him names - ""Old Man McGee"" (our boss' last name is McGee) - as well as attempting to push around the vacuums and knocking things over. Our manager, a patient man who we never heard raise his voice, yelled ""LEARN SOME GODDAMED MANNERS AND GET OUT!""

The boys laughed and gave up, and walked out the store as we cleaned up the mess they left us (especially one in the furniture area, who peed on the recliners). At close, as we were removing the recliners and marking ""Defective Merchandise - Move to Atlanta"" on each of them, a woman banged on our doors (they were locked) and screams ""OPEN YOUR DOORS!"" My manager walked up to the door and pointed to his watch, ""We're closed ma'am. We'll be open at 10 AM tomorrow for your shopping convenience.""

But then we see those three boys as well around her, banging on the doors. The manager opened the doors slowly, and as the woman tried to push herself in, our manager blocked her entrance. ""Ma'am, we're closed. And your boys left us a mess, so even if we were open, we wouldn't let you in. One of your boys peed on the recliners, which is going to lose us money on each one. We have to order new ones and tell corporate what happened to each one."" 

The mom kept pushing on the manager and the doors, then yelled, ""YALL DON'T YELL AT MA KIDS! THEY GOOD, YALL EVIL! THEY JUST EXPRESS THEMSELVES! YALL EVIL AND BAD AND WE WILL YALL MANAGERS."" Our manager, in a smug voice, says, ""Sure ma'am, call corporate, but we have so much evidence against your boys."" One boy kept screaming over us ""I AINT GOIN' BACK TO JUVIE!"" NO WAY! AINT GOING BACK TO JUVIE. MAMA I AINT GOING BACK."" 

Next morning, we open up at 10 AM, and who's the first customer - Mama Crazy! The store is quiet, a lot of us had just pulled doubles, and so everyone is tired and just waiting for the day to end. The same manager from the night before is there, and she walks up to him, huffing and puffing. ""LEMME SEE THOSE RECLINERS. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. YALL TRYING TO PUT MY BOYS IN JUVIE AND THEY ALL I HAVE."" My manager walks the woman to the warehouse, and we follow. He shows her the photos of what her boys have done, and then showed her the recliners, lined up, marked defective. 

""HOW DO I KNOW YOU DIDN'T PEE ON IT? HOW DO I KNOW YOU DIDN'T STAGE THIS BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE MA KIDS? THIS IS A WITCH HUNT, MA BOYS AINT GOING TO JUVIE, YALL GOT NO PROOF. I LOVE MY BOYS!"" Our manager walks her out, and as she leaves, he says, ""We are pressing charges ma'am. We have every camera, every photo, and six associates who saw what happened. We'll see you in court.""

Everyone has had a co-worker like this, someone who is disrespectful to the bosses and who snaps at the customers. One of my bosses is Asian, yet born and raised in America, and she is incredibly nice. One day DB foolishly decided to belittle her because of her race in front of at least 10 customers, while simultaneously not getting their food. (McD lolberries.) 

Anyway I got a text from DB the following Sunday, asking if I can give him a ride to work as he missed the bus, DB told me if he doesn't come in they were going to fire him.

DB getting fired sounds petty good to me, so I told him I can't give him a ride. When I got to work later that day, I saw DB sitting in the lobby while my store manager is talking to him, turns out he found a way to work, and they fired him anyway. I later found out they only scheduled him to fire him! He was on for three hours, 5pm-8pm on Monday, and he didn't see anything weird with it! The Asian manager just wanted to see his face when he found out, so they had him come in. 

The store manager, being the nice person he is, gave him $3 for the bus, which Douche Baggins promptly used to buy a lottery ticket (if he lost he'd have to walk miles home, in the winter. He luckily won $20, yet used it to buy alcohol and get drunk in the lobby.

Our Asian manager happily kicked his ass out, he had no ride home. I also got a text from him a few weeks ago asking me for money, I didn't respond.

I am a gymnastics coach, and I generally love my job. I work with the upper level girls, the ones that go out and compete, even though I'm considered pretty young (college age) to be coaching teams. We're a pretty small gym and the parents are, for the most part, great to work with. But there is one. Ohhhhh there is always that one.

This mom, a woman who takes pride in the fact that she is a children's therapist and basically a glorified tutor, is the most ""I'm their friend first, and their parent second."" person I have ever met in my life when it comes to her children. She brought her daughter, Entitled Mini Witch (EMW for short), to our program just under 4 years ago. Now, EMW is talented, but because her mother lets her get away with murder, she is one of the most lazy, rude, and miserable children I have ever had to work with. I am absolutely heated in a conversation that happened during my lunch break, and I just need to get this out of my system before going back for the team's second work out because I'm still livid.

I'm eating at the front desk and sorting through paperwork, because it's easier for me to just stay there rather than drive all the way back home then all the way back to the gym, and there are no classes during the afternoon, so my boss is fine with it. This mother storms into the gym, marches straight up to the desk and says, ""Ginger24, I am absolutely shocked and appalled by what EMW told me today, but I know kids can exaggerate, so I wanted to come talk to you before going to [Owner]."" Awh shoot. I know exactly what's coming. 

This girl came to practice 20 minutes late, we were almost done with warm up, and she was being generally unpleasant. But its two-a-days, and mornings suck, so I was trying to be understanding. I got nothing but backsass and ""I can't do [event she doesn't like], my ankle hurts."" Yet, when we got to an event she enjoyed, she was magically healed. I was having none of it. But like the good little peon I am, I responded with, ""Oh, uhm, okay. What did EMW tell you about practice?"" 

**Mom**: ""She said that you made her condition for the whole practice while everyone else was working out. All practice! She was in tears by the time she got home because you were so rude to her""

Alright, now I'm kind of agitated, but I expected this kind of thing. This sounds like a typical case of a 13 year old girl who is blatantly manipulating her mother. Regardless, I know this family, and I know that trying to explain this would go in one ear, and out the other, so I respond in my most sickly-sweet customer service voice, ""Ah, well, I'm sorry EMW was crying after practice, but I was trying to keep her as healthy as possible. See, when she got here late I asked her to warm up on her own while we went to tumbling. As soon as she finished she got through two turns before complaining that her ankle hurt. I had her sit and ice it for 10 minutes, take the ice off for 5, then had her come try tumbling again. She said it still hurt, so I had her do the ""Leg/Ankle Injury"" conditioning list so that she was still working while giving her ankle a break.""

**Mom**: ""Okay, but then why didn't you let her do Trampoline?""

Understandable question, but I was so sick of this girl coming up to me, demanding to do trampoline, insisting that her ankle felt better, and that I was just a horrible, mean person, that I had had enough of the way she was treating me. I explained to the mother that, ""If the impact of using nothing but a spring floor and her own momentum caused pain in EMW's ankle so badly that she couldn't tumble, adding a trampoline into that mix would absolutely cause her excruciating pain. I didn't want her to further injure herself, so I had her finish the list.""

This is where it gets insane. This is where I legitimately expect to lose my stuffing. Her mom decided to inform me, ""EMW was just being dramatic. I'm sure her ankle wasn't as bad as it seemed, she just doesn't like tumbling. I'm sure you know that. She wanted to do trampoline though and I don't understand why you wouldn't let her just because she was pretending to get hurt.""

What? No, seriously, what? My mind was absolutely blown. I was so infuriated I was tempted to kick her out right then and there. But alas, I kept my voice steady and my smile permanently plastered as I informed this mother, ""I'm sorry Mrs. [last name], here at [gym name] we take athlete health and injuries very seriously. I had no way of knowing whether EMW's ankle was barely twisted, or about to fall off. I had nothing but EMW's word to decide what to do. When an athlete says they are in that much pain, I cannot, in good conscience, allow them to further injure themselves. If EMW wants to be a part of gymnastics, she has to practice gymnastics. If she wants to be a part of trampoline, there is a [name of a business with wall to wall trampolines and a history of a lot of injuries that is pretty popular on the west coast] about 20 minutes away.""

She huffed out and said that EMW wasn't feeling well and would not be coming to night practice today. I asked that she make sure EMW gets some ice on that ankle as she walked out the door. I called the owner as soon as the mother left and let her know what happened. She just laughed and said she'd take care of it if she got a call. Sorry for the wall of text, and if there is somewhere better to put this please let me know, but I really just needed to get that out there.

**EDIT**: I realized some of you might not know what conditioning is. Its basically the strength part of gymnastics. Push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups, things like that where you aren't actually doing anything completely gymnastics related, just focusing on building muscle and endurance.

**EDIT 2**: Obligatory ""Holy shit I'm on the front page!!!"" edit. But seriously, thank you to everyone who upvoted and everyone who commented. Y'all made my day so much better.

If anyone was wondering, second practice went very well, and we even played a game at the end of practice. One of the girls asked where EMW was, and I explained that she was resting her ankle. One of my other girls asked, ""You know she was faking, right?"" My only response was, ""I know"" and we moved on. Very good, very productive practice.

I work for an attraction in a tourist town that hires high schoolers for summer jobs. A couple of days ago we had a group of elderly men and women come in to play our miniature golf course.

Now, this day, we had one of the high schoolers running the register. We shall call her Mouse, because she's very quiet and timid.

The first old man walks up to the counter, and very quickly says ""one for mini-golf."" Mouse says ""okay, sir, that will be 11.99.""

Old man replies with ""what about the senior discount?"" Now, we don't have a senior discount, but if you're nice, we will normally give the local discount, 50 percent off.

Mouse says ""I'm sorry sir, we don't have a senior discount, but I can-""

At this point the old man loudly interrupts with ""WELL WHAT KIND OF S*** IS THAT? DON'T YOU SUPPORT SENIORS?""

Now, you should understand that our demographic is families with young children. So there are kids everywhere.

He stares at Mouse with a smirk on his face. What followed surprised me. Mouse looked him straight in the eye (thank God for the elevated cash wrap, because she's like five feet tall, and otherwise would have had to crane her neck to do it.), and says ""that will be 11.99."" He starts in again, she interrupts with ""that will be 11.99."" Every time he opens his mouth, she just says ""that will be 11.99.""

The look of utter defeat as he handed his money over was very satisfying.

I posted a [story](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1eakwt/i_lost_my_purse/) a couple of days ago from my time working at a deli. While some crazy things happened every now and then, this is by far the craziest thing that has every happened to me while working there. Please bear with me, as this will be a little long.

This particular day I was working a double shift as a delivery driver. It was a couple of hours until my first shift ended, and two deliveries got called in. One delivery was pretty close to our location and the other was a little farther but still a pretty short drive.

*Easy*, I think to myself. *I'll take the farther one and drop of the closer one on the way back.* I came to find out that I'm glad I made that decision.

Everything goes relatively smoothly. I drop off the first one, arrive at the second, and knock on the door. I immediately hear what sounds like a small child yelling.

""MOOOOOMMM!!! HEEELLLLPP!!!""

*No biggie*, I think. *Some kid was horse-playing and probably fell down. I'm sure their mom will be here shortly and answer the door*.

So I wait. And wait. And wait some more.

I knock again and the screaming picks back up. Wait a minute or two, the screaming subsides. Knock again, the screaming picks up.

My mind starts to race. *Surely the mom will be here, right? Did she fall asleep? Is she even there??*

By now, every time I knock, the screaming gets more and more desperate. Like someone is in some serious pain. I even tried opening the door, but it was locked. I mull it over in my head a bit, and finally decide on what I need to do. I'll call 911. Even if it isn't an emergency, at least I can have the peace of mind that it wasn't anything bad. As an aside, I've hardly ever called 911, so I was extremely nervous and it took a lot to convince myself to call.

I call the dispatcher and tell them what's going on. I tell them that there's what sounds like a child yelling in this house, and they inform me that there's a unit close by who's on the way. Within 60 seconds, a police cruiser comes down the road. He comes up and I tell him what I told the dispatcher. 

He knocks and hears the screaming. Tries to get into the house but no avail, so he goes around to the back. By this point, a second cop shows up. And a third. 

The first cop comes back to the front and tells me that he was able to speak to the person screaming through the back door. Turns out it was an older lady, not a kid like I thought. 

Shortly after he tells me this a fire truck and an ambulance come blaring down the road. Fuck. This might be pretty bad. Even worse was the fact that I parked in the driveway of this house, and the ambulance blocked me in, forcing me to stay. 

The firemen rush up to the door and bust it down. The paramedics rushed in after them, along with the cops. So now I'm outside by myself, waiting for them to finish... whatever it is they're doing so I can finally leave and get back to work. The entire time I'm worried that something is seriously wrong and felt helpless throughout the whole thing.

Finally, the paramedics come out with someone on a stretcher and load them up into the ambulance. One of the cops comes up to me and informs me that the lady living in this house recently has hip surgery, and while she was walking around the house she somehow displaced her hip, leaving her immobile and in a lot of pain. He told me it was a good thing I called since she had been there for a while and who knows how much longer she could have been stuck there.

He gives me a congratulatory pat on the back, everyone loads up and leaves, and I finally make my way back to the deli. I get there, cash out, and go on my much needed break.

**Epilogue** - Later on during the night shift, the husband of the woman came in to pick up the food from earlier. As my coworker was helping him, she pointed me out as the one who called 911.

""You're the one who did that?""  
""Yes sir. I was really worried that something serious happened...""

He beams at me, shakes my hand while thanking me profusely, and hands me a few bucks for the trouble. In all honesty, he didn't even have to tip me. Just his face and reaction was a good enough tip for me.

It was my very first day, and I was manning the register. 
My store manager, the only other person on shift, let's me know she will be gone for a 10 minute lunch break. If I need her, call her. 

Sure, I got this! 

10 minutes turned into an hour. Then two. Before I knew it three hours had passed, but I was doing well. No mistakes, figured she got held up with her kids or something. 

A customer purchases an item, $10.99. Pays by card. Cool. 
As I tap in the amount onto the machine, I realise in horror I have just charged this poor woman $109.99, and need to do a refund. 

I am upset, and explain to the customer that I will need to call my manager to do it, as it was my very first day. She is good natured and understanding. 

I call my boss on her mobile. No answer. Call again. No answer. Fuck. Try again. This time she picks up.
""What??""
Me: ""hi, it's ----, I've just made a mistake and need to make a refund on her credit card, but I need you to show me how and to approve it."" 
""Just get it out of the til. I'll fix it later.""
""Um, it's over $100, I don't have that much in the til.""
""Fuck, alright. Give me 5 minutes."" 

Boss hangs up, and I explain to the customer the wait. She is cool, understands 14 year old me has no real power. Cool lady. 

15 minutes pass, no sign of boss. Try to call, phone is off. I am starting to freak out and cry. Customer is cool, talks calmingly to me. Turns out she knows my mum (small town). She owns the new bakery, and has gotten to know everyone. Start joking around, relaxing with her. 

Nearly an hour later, boss rocks up stinking of sex. Even in my innocence I could see she was a mess. Shirt on backwards, makeup smudged, hair mussed. So mortifying. 

My boss rolls her eyes at the customer. 
""Can't get good workers these days, sorry about the idiot.""

I feel like I was slapped. Customer glared at this woman, this stinky boss, and then looks at me. 
""You start work in my shop at 9am. Want a ride home?"" 

I left with her, worked at her shop until I graduated in 2007, and moved away. Awesome woman. Life is sometimes very good.

I was working the Saturday night drive-thru shift at a popular fast food place. It was maybe 10 PM. We were pretty busy, typical Saturday night crowd - soccer moms in their minivans, stoners with their loud bass music playing, and nurses from a nearby hospital on their way to the night shift.  
  
A Camaro pulled up to order. The driver, a typical spoiled college kid, began his order with ""sup,"" and ended every other sentence with ""bro."" While I was inputting his order, he exchanged raunchy jokes with the guy in the passenger's seat. They ordered 2 large size combo meals... and an order of chicken nuggets.  
  
When the car pulled up to the window, both of the bros had their shirts off. They looked fairly sweaty, despite the fact that it was barely 80 degrees (27 Celsius for any non-Americans.) They both had the expression that said ""yeah, we're the shit."" I couldn't tell what they were so proud of... until I looked in the back seat.  
  
The back seat of the car contained the ugliest crack whore I have ever seen. Her skin looked like something from The Thing, and her nails were several inches long. Her boobs drooped like wilted, rotten petunias. She was wearing platform heels... and nothing else. I couldn't tell for sure, but I think her hair was a wig too.  
  
When I handed the bros their food, she stuck her abominable head into the front seat and screeched at me in a voice like a million nails on a chalkboard: ""CAN I HAVE SOME KETCHUP?"" I shoved a handful of ketchup packets into the bag and shuddered. The bros handed her the box of chicken nuggets, cranked up their shitty rap music, and peeled out.

I'm a wordy person and feel this story is best in all its glory.

I work alone at a dry cleaner/laundromat. This lady comes in and hands me her tickets to pick up her dry cleaning. She had more than the average bear's worth of dry cleaning spread out over a few tickets. I add up her total twice and check to make sure it matches her receipt.

""Okay, your total is $82."" She looks at me flabbergasted for a second.

""No it's not. The guy told me that it was $72."" 

""I'll double check the math."" I added everything up again and said, ""No, I'm sorry. This is $82, see?"" 

""No you're wrong! Why would he tell me that it was $72?! He must have been giving me a discount."" 

""He might have misspoke, or miscalculated, but he wrote right here on your ticket $82.""

""Well you need to get him on the phone then, I need to talk to your manager.""

""I'm sorry, that man is not the manager. My manager doesn't actually work at the store. I'm in charge for the day.""

""Well I'm going to need his number."" She was huffing and puffing at this point and I was also getting shakey. My boss had given me a no nonsense policy and tells me to ask customers to leave and not come back when they get indignant. She also doesn't want me calling her for any reason. (She's not a very good manager.)

""I'm sorry, to be honest with you I don't know the other employee's number, and I can't give you my manager's cell phone number.""

""WELL THEN CALL HER! Get her on the phone right now.""

""I'm sorry, I can't call her in the middle of the day. She's at work right now. I'm the manager right now."" (This argument repeats until she gets the picture.)

""I'm not paying anymore than what that man told me. $70 is all you can have!""

""That's fine if you just want to pick up a few things. We can hold on the the rest until you can pay for them.""

""Are you fucking kidding me?! You're going to be stealing my clothes from me?! I can take them if I want to!""

""Well, we've already provided you a service, I'm not going to give them back until you pay for them."" (Protip, using big words like this piss people off. In retrospect I was being condescending.)

At this point she goes over to her clothes and starts tearing them out of the bags. She's throwing the bags all over the floor, huffing and mumbling and tearing her clothes off the hangers.
""These look like shit! I'm not paying for these!""

""I'm sorry, I'd be happy to redo them for you. It would be ready to pick up in two days.""

""Fuck! I NEED them this weekend. No you can't redo them. But I'm not paying full price!'

""I'm sorry, the total is still $82."" (I was not giving in)

""Who THE FUCK do you think you are?!"" she screamed. 

I then make the worst mistake of my life, I chuckle. Not to be condescending, but because I am really uncomfortable. I mean really uncomfortable, even after five years in retail I am in awe every time some yells at me like this. I am a humanist and am still constantly in shock that people can be so aggressive and hateful. I'm naive, whatever. Anyway, I chuckle a nervous is-lady-going-to-kill-me laugh. She loses it.

""THIS IS NOT A FUCKING JOKE. I'M NOT FUCKING PLAYING WITH YOU RIGHT NOW. MY HUSBAND IS GOING TO KILL ME WHEN I GET HOME IF I SPEND $80 FUCKING DOLLARS ON THESE CLOTHES. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? HE'S ALREADY PISSED OFF WITH ME, AND HE'S PISSED OFF WITH YOU FOR TAKING SO FUCKING LONG TO GET HIS CLOTHES DONE. YOU DO NOT WANT HIM TO COME HERE. I DO NOT WANT TO BOTHER HIM WITH THIS SHIT. HE'S ALREADY PISSED OFF WITH ME!"" which makes me more uncomfortable thinking her husband probably beats her.

""Ma'am, please stop cursing at me. There are kids in here."" There were.  

""I'M NOT CURSING AT YOU. IF I WAS CUSSIN' AT YOU I'D BE CALL YOU A SKANKY FAT-ASS BITCH CUNT FUCKING HEIFER. I'M NOT CALLING YOU ANY OF THOSE THINGS AM I?"" Alright, I've hit my limit. 

""I'm sorry, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.""

""YOU CAN'T DO THAT. I'M GOING TO CALL 911.""

""...um okay?"" I was really confused. She took out her cell phone and called 911. 

""Hello, I'm at [This] dry cleaner and I'm having a domestic dispute. We need an officer right away. Yes, thank you.""

I look around for a bit trying to wrap my brain around what's happening and said, 'Okay. Well I'm going to get some work done while we wait for the police."" I picked up all the trash and hangers she threw all over the floor. In retrospect, I should have left them as evidence she was being crazy. I guess she might have said I threw it at her. The police station is right up the road so it wasn't a long wait. Oh, she called in late for work while she watched me pick up her mess. 

The officer came in and he was super polite and calm. She recounted her story which was mostly true, if a little biased. Me not giving her a discount, me not calling the manager. She also added that I owed her for the money she was missing by not being at work in time. She did say that I told her she had to leave after she called 911 because I was trying to hide the evidence. (lolwhut.) I then said that wasn't true, that she called the police after I asked her to leave. The officer looked a little confused and asked me what happened. 

He turned back to the lady and said ""Okay. What can Thiscity Police Department do for you today?""

She said, ""Well officer, if I'm not happy with the service I need a discount.""

He turned to the lady and said ""You know, I don't want to discourage you from calling 911 when you need to. You should call if you're in danger. Or in the case of criminal activity- but this is a dispute that the police department can't settle for you. Why don't you come back on another day to pick up your clothes.""

""Yes sir officer, that's a good idea."" 

""I agree,' he said. ""I'm going to need you to step outside with me so that I can get your information. Just in case you need me again.""

And she left. He took her info outside and she got in her car and (presumably) drove to work. She came back the next day and payed $82 for her dry cleaning. I felt really bad for her.

It was a high volume store, so we got plenty of copies. This also meant we had a huge amount of preorders.

People would often preorder the game specifically to get the included collector's items, and we had one customer (we'll call him Fred) that called up the day before and preordered the collector's edition for his son's 10th birthday. It was one of the last ones we had in stock, so he was lucky to snag it in time.

Fast forward to release day, and it was crazy busy. For the first time since I'd worked there, we actually sold every one of our preorders on release day, as well as all of our regular stock.

Except for one - Fred's copy.

So the day chugged along busily and as it drew to a close, we only had one copy left, which was reserved for Fred. I was constantly turning people down for sales of the game, or signing them up for a copy when a new shipment arrived.

I then left the register to do some inventory for 10 minutes before returning. In just 10 minutes, my genius colleague managed to sell Fred's copy of Fifa 10.

I didn't know this had happened, so about 20 minutes after I'd returned to the register, Fred and his wife walks in and asks to pick up his son's copy of the game. I do a search for the game, and our stock says a big fat ZERO. This includes reserved stock.

Me: ""I'm sorry sir, we just sold the last copy. There must have been a mixup and your reserved copy was sold to another customer.""

Fred: ""What? But I reserved it! It's for my son's 18th birthday tonight!""

Me: ""I apologize, it's entirely our fault. We don't have any copies to sell you today, but I can put you on a waiting list for the next shipment that comes to the store if you'd like?""

It's at this point I notice Fred's wife is crying. I notice that Fred is visibly trying to control his anger, but his face is going red and I can see that the situation is not getting any better.

Fred: ""My son's birthday is tonight and I promised him we'd play the new Fifa tonight! What am I going to do? THIS IS UNFAIR!""

I feel very sorry for these people, and I realize that this is a very unfair situation for them, so I improvise.

Me: ""I'm really sorry sir. Let me do a quick search for other stores in the area that have stock, and here's a $25 off voucher for the game. I hope that makes up for our mistake.""

As I was talking, I found a store about 10 minutes away that had stock of the game. As I handed the voucher to Fred, his entire composure changed completely. He was dumbfounded, and a massive smiled exploded onto his face.

Fred: ""Oh... wow, thank you so much! I'll go there right now and pick the game up. Thank you! I'll definitely come back to this store from now on!"" And his wife thanked me profusely as well. I felt great. I'd made a family's day, kept a customer happy and probably saved the store a lot of bad word-of-mouth. Those are the moments that make retail worthwhile.

As I was closing up that night, the store manager came up and started talking to me.

Store manager: ""fat_head, I saw what you did with those customers today. You do realise that's a serious breach of store policy? That's $25 off the other store's margin. Those vouchers are supposed to be for the &lt;other game&gt; promotion only. I'm going to speak to the Area Manager about this, and I never want to see you do that again without my permission.""

I was speechless. I could not believe a manager could be so money-hungry that he'd prefer to absolutely piss a customer off because of my colleague's mistake, over giving them a voucher and making them happy as anything. I was furious that night, because even though it was (apparently) against store policy, I didn't deserve to be told off.

Next day, I come in for my shift, and the Area Manager is talking to the store manager. I get pulled into the back room.

Area Manager: ""fat_head, Store Manager has filled me in on what you did yesterday with the $25 coupon. Unfortunately that is a serious breach of store policy, and we're going to have to terminate your employment. Please give me your store key and leave immediately.""

I was actually not really that surprised. I was only a casual and so they could fire me on a whim, and the area manager was equally as penny-pinching as the store manager.

Me: ""You know what, don't bother firing me, I don't want to work here if you're going to treat me like this. I tried my best to keep the customer happy, but hey, don't let me stop you from pissing off the people who pay your wage! Did Store Manager tell you it was &lt;employee&gt;'s fault their RESERVED game was sold to someone else? I guess that's perfect grounds for firing the employee that fixed the situation! Now there's some good management!""

Then I dropped my store key on the ground and walked out without another word. Maybe that was a bit too rude, but I just couldn't believe that they'd value $25 over customer service. Just another example of managers power tripping and penny-pinching without caring for the people they are there to service. Oh well, I'm glad they fired me. It was a terrible place to work.

1361842235.0,1473,self.TalesFromRetail,198a3j,Customer calls the cops on HIMSELF,hostile__17,1731,258,191,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/198a3j/customer_calls_the_cops_on_himself/,"I've been working in a grocery/clothing/general merchandise retailer for about four years.  Mostly I work up at the customer service desk, which entails printing up money orders, processing wire transfers, selling all the tobacco products, cashing out lottery, and primarily, returns and exchanges.  

A year or so ago, during a slower part of the day, a man (probably in his mid-late 50's) comes up to me at the desk with an xbox 360 to return.  He said that he bought it a couple weeks prior (which was true, as he had his receipt still and I checked the date) for his son who decided that he wanted a PS3 instead.  He said that they already purchased a PS3 somewhere else, and he just needed to return the xbox.

Unfortunately, even with a receipt, gaming consoles (in addition to all computer software and hardware, CDs, DVDs, video games, etc) are non-refundable once they've been opened.  I've always thought that this policy was completely reasonable, especially since my store only deals in brand new products, not used.  And we can't ship it back to the manufacturer unless there is some kind of manufacturer's defect, which in this case, there was not.

I calmly explained to him that once a console has been opened, we can do nothing but exchange it for an identical product (and that's only in the case of a defect).  He scowls at me and demands a manager.  

Fine, AWESOME.  I can see where this is going, and I don't get paid enough to deal with the brewing storm of attitude.  So I call up the electronics manager, and he comes over to talk to the customer.

The customer explains that he doesn't want the xbox anymore, and wants his money back.  In return, the electronics manager disclosed our return policy basically verbatim for what I said. He demands a different manager, this time much, MUCH louder.  Wow, okay.  So I give *my* direct manager a call and ask her to come over.  She comes over, gets the spiel from the customer about how he wants his goddamn money back, and how we're stealing from him by not giving him a refund.  She asks the electronics manager (who is still standing up here) what our policy is, he informs her, she looks at the customer and says something like, ""sorry, this is our policy.  If there's anything else we can do for you, please just ask hostile __17.""

The man explodes.  Yelling and screaming about how he doesn't want this fucking thing, and it's ours and we have to take it back.  There was some more screaming about how we're dirty thieves and we're stealing money from him, and how it's illegal.  Lots of yelling.

I called the store director.  The boss's boss's boss.  HE gets paid enough to deal with this bullshit.

The director (who is actually a completely rational cool dude) comes up and (after patiently listening to this guy's ranting for about 10 minutes) gives him the same answer that he's gotten from the rest of us. (Don't you love it when your managers back you up after you've said no to an asshole customer?) 

This is the last straw for unhappy customer guy.  He claims that if we aren't going to do something for him, he's calling the police to arrest us all for theft. Yep. Theft. I'm stoked to see if he does, and apparently the managers are too, so they tell him that he is free to call the police if he wants to.

Dude picks up his cellphone, calls his lawyer (or at least claims to), and leaves a message detailing the situation.  Apparently his lawyer didn't have time in the middle of a work day to answer a call from one of her clients.  

He makes a second call to the 6 o'clock news.  He wants EVERYONE to know how shitty [undisclosed retailer] treats their customers, and screams at us about how we'll all be out of jobs and that no one will ever shop here again!  It's a nationwide chain, bro.  I'm pretty sure we're going to be fine, but thanks.

He makes a final call to the police.  They were the only ones to answer the fucking phone.  Hah.  He says that the customer service bitch from [retailer] has stolen hundreds of dollars from him, and is being backed up by all her dumbass managers.  He's screaming at the cops over the phone (I'm almost surprised that the police didn't hang up on him, but, I mean, they *are* the cops.  I don't think they can legally hang up on anyone who's dialed 911).

It takes the cops about 30 minutes to show up, during which time my managers have gone back to their jobs, and I'm filing away some paperwork, and this crazy dude has plopped himself on the floor in front of my desk (having some kind of sit it or something).  Every time another customer starts heading my way, he yells and screams at them, ""don't shop here!!  They steal your money!  Bunch of fucking thieves!!!""  I'm fine with this.  It's hilarious, he looks like a bridge troll and I have paperwork to catch up on.

Eventually the police show up and the dude brings them over to me and has the most smug look on his face.  It won't last.

He declares to the nice officers that I took his money and refused to give it back, which obviously puzzles them, as I'm a fucking employee and covered by like five cameras at all times.  I clarify that I didn't take *anything* from him.  He bought an xbox a couple weeks back, opened it up and played it, then wanted to return it.  I also explained our return policy to them.  I showed them the copy of this policy which was hanging by my desk, by the desk that the xbox was purched at, on our website, and on HIS receipt.  I can tell that the poor cops are just dreading dealing with this guy, but they give him an ultimatum.

He can either:

*Not get a refund from us and go home.

*Not get a refund and go to jail.

Angry customer: ""I'D RATHER GO TO JAIL THEN LET THESE FUCKERS WIN!  I'M NOT LEAVING WITHOUT MY MONEY!!!!!""

I don't think he was getting it.  So the cops handcuff him and start heading towards the door, when I realize that his xbox is still sitting on the counter.  I grab it and run after them.

Me: ""Wait, sir!  You left your merchendise at the counter.""

One of the cops takes it from me.

Me: ""Have a wonderful day, sir!  Thank you for shopping at [retailer]!""

I'm pretty sure he would have strangled me if he hadn't been handcuffed. Haha.

I worked as a cashier at a major electronics store. I was ringing up a woman's stuff. She was rather large, white, wearing a ripped tank top that used to have sleeves. I had her pegged as white trash the moment I saw her. (I would say I try not to judge people, but would be a total lie. As a cashier, you don't have much else to keep you occupied)

Me- ""Hi, thanks for coming into [Store] today. Find everything all right?""

Her-unintelligible grunt

Me-*thinking she's just having a bad day, start ringing her up, without pestering her about our credit card deals.

I see she pulled out a plastic card, so I say ""Swipe you card please.""

her- *gives me a death glare.

Me- ""enter your PIN, or press cancel for credit""

Her- ""do I look like a motherfucking retarded nigger to you?""

me- completely taken aback ""Pardon?""

her- ""I asked if I looked like a retarded nigger! I know how to work the fucking machine!'

Me- ""Ma'am, I say that to everyone. I'm just doing my job.""

Her- ""Well, do it silently."" ""dipshit""

At this point, my manager, who I was good friends with, was wondering what the raised voices were, was just coming out of his office just in time to catch the last comment.

Manager- *looking at me- ""Is there a problem here?""

woman- *starts to say something, manager cuts her off.

Manager-""I wasn't talking to you. Aegonix, is there a problem here?""

I explained verbatim what the woman had just said, and the security guy standing by the door 15 feet away confirmed.

Manager moved me over, cancelled the transaction, looked at the woman and said ""Get the fuck out of my store.""

She was furious. I think. All she managed to do was splutter a couple incoherent phrases, and then storm out of the store. We, thankfully, never heard from her again.

He shared this story with me, and I thought I'd share with you.

So my friend and his friends went to this diner, and were sat next to a very large woman, (probably about  five foot nothing, and around 300 pounds) and her very skinny boyfriend. Also, shes really drunk. So Big Fat Drunk Lady (bfdl) demands that her boyfriend give her a dollar, she wants to play the claw machine.

She walks over to the claw machine and drops the dollar. When she bends over to pick it up, her too small sweat shorts dissapear into her butt. My. friend described it as ""the largest, grossest, most pock marked and cellulite ridden cottage cheese ass you have ever seen."" So, that is pretty gross.

After trying and failing the claw machine, BFDL disappears around the corner for a few minutes. She comes back just as her food gets to the table, but along with the waitress, two cops walked up to the table.

The cops say ""ma'am, some of the other patrons said that they saw you take four dollars from a table that they left as a tip"".

BFDL immediately starts yelling and cursing at the officers 

""OH HELL NO! THATS BULLSHIT!"" She pulls some neatly folded twenties in a money clip from one pocket as shes screaming. She pulls from the other pocket, four crinkled ones. 

""THIS HEAR IS MY MONEY, I FOUND IT"" , she yells as shes trying to smooth out the money. Then she realizes what she said and changes her story ""NO, I BROUGHT THESE FROM HOME! THIS IS MY MONEY!""

Finally the officers have had enough, and they say that shes going to have to come with them. BFDL screams no, picks up her plate of food and smashes it against the wall. At this point she goes under the table and comes back up eating a piece of food that hit the floor. The officers lead her out in cuffs at this point, as shes screaming and spraying food chunks everywhere.

The super skinny boyfriend who has not said a single word at this point, looks at his food, lets out a long deep sigh and says ""Man. She has the keys""

Also, I am not entirely sure that this belongs here, but I thought this was the most interesting phone call at my last job.

Setup: I live in a small city I  the midwest, and I worked for a company that served adults with disabilities in a group home setting. I am working at the main house, the first house the owner opened and also the location of the office. The number to the house also functioned as the main line to the business.  I would answer the phone when working since I would never have any idea if a manager or the owner was downstairs working, and they did not like to get interrupted anyway. 

So I am working one afternoon,  and this guy calls in and says something like: ""You have someone working for you who is on drugs and I thought you would like to know this.""

Since the company is so small, I have met every single employee. 

So I bite. Me: ""who are you talking about?""

He names an employee that we don't have! I'm a bit at a loss, so I tell him thanks for calling, but we don't actually have that person as an employee. 

He insists that she is working there, says her name repeatedly, and very slowly, as if that will help.

 I again, tell him this person is absolutely not an employee, and add that I have personally met each employee, and have never heard of this woman. I remember there is another organization in town that works with individuals with disabilities.  The first two words of my company's name is the same as their's, and the third word is similar.  I suggest to him that he has confused our companies, and he should call them.

Him: ""YOU DON'T CARE IF YOUR EMPLOYEES ARE ON DRUGS!!""

Me: ""Sir, we would care if that was our employee, but since that person doesn't work here, it really doesn't concern us."" I am staring to get a bit frustrated. 

Him: ""I WANT TO SPEAK WITH YOUR SUPERVISOR. NOW!""

Me: ""They are very busy and don't have time for this. This person is not our employee, so I am not going to bother them with this.

Him: WHERE IS YOUR OFFICE?  I WILL COME DOWN THERE AND TELL THEM MYSELF.

Since the office is actually a group home as well, I really don't want this guy coming here. Besides,  the address to the company is listed along with the phone number. So I lie.

Me: The location is confidential, I'm sorry I can't tell you.

The guy really loses it, starts screaming about how he knows that we have that druggie person employed,  and how he is going to come straight down to the office, which he can now apparently find,  and tell to my supervisors everything, and get both myself and this other person fired. 

I tell him that I will see him soon then and hang up. No one ever shows up.

Guy slowly creeps back in store, setting off the sensor again. He had a couple bags from other stores like Aero, American Eagle, Hollister, etc. filled with shit from those stores.

Some involve unruly customers, most involve Black Friday, and a few result in some hilarious attempts to steal shit in the store.

You've all been in big box stores, so I'll describe this one's layout.  (Remember = Don't guess!  Youbanistan is not a fun place to visit...they don't have cookies or milk at all!)

The layout at the time was that your PCs, Televisions, Appliances, and all the big ticket items were on the outside of the main floor.  We had a white and black walkway that was a gigantic square which wrapped around the store and separated the big ticket stuff from the smaller items in the center.  Inside the center were cameras, cell phones, and most importantly, shelves upon shelves of CDs, DVDs, video games, etc.

Middle of the week in this store was boring as hell.  Most of us kept ourselves entertained on our earpiece radios by playing guessing games and commenting on the mullets that came into the store and even giving a rating by referring to them as ""Code M"" which would prompt about ten employees to start looking at the department.  Our LP guy was a good friend of mine, and at 6'7"" with a hilarious sense of humor, the store tended to be more fun when he was watching the cameras up front.

On this day, however, we got our entertainment from a short woman who decided she was going to try and rob us blind.

It was a little cool outside, but nothing overbearing as it was early Spring.  This woman, however, had come in wearing extremely heavy and somewhat baggy pants, a winter jacket, sunglasses (kept them on indoors), and a heavy sweater underneath.  It wasn't a minute before she was in the DVDs and already frantically looking around and just acting sketchy.  My friend at LP, we'll call him Alex, hits me up on the earpiece.

**Alex:  Hey man, can you wander over by this woman in DVDs and see what the hell she is doing?**

**Me:  Yeah...why?  Is she acting strange?**

**Alex:  Oh yeah.  She did a triple take at one of the cameras I have locked on to her.**

**Me:  Wow.  Why is she bundled up like it's 20 below outside?**

**Alex:  That's why I want you to watch her.**

I set up camp about three aisles diagonally from her and actually had a good view.  Sure enough, this woman grabs a bunch of the cheap DVDs that weren't in security cases, looks around, and stuffs them down her pants.

**Me:  You catch that on camera?**

**Alex:  Yep, already calling the police now.  Just keep locked onto her.**

She wasn't content there.  She made a few stops along the way, stopping at the Xbox 360 section, the Blu-Rays, and the PS3 games.  Hey, at least she wasn't a fanboy of one system or the other!  Thieves apparently don't discriminate!

She spent the next ten minutes or so walking around to make it seem like she was just browsing.  At this point, there are four of us basically watching her from a distance while we wait for the police, who showed up in the form of two cruisers outside.  One was set up in the parking lot, the other pulled up alongside the front of the building just away from the entrance.  Alex went out to greet him, where the officer was outside stretching and limbering up.

**Alex:  Why are you stretching, sir?**

**Officer:  I hope she runs.  I need a workout!**

Meanwhile, back in the store, our little thief had caught on to the fact that she was being watched the entire time and was putting the cheap DVDs back in a different spot than the belonged.  Once she did that, even though she still had plenty of other things, she loudly announced to everyone as she made for the exit ""I PUT EVERYTHING BACK DON'T YOU ALL DARE TOUCH ME YOU FUCKING PRICKS!""

Oye.  Some people just don't get it, do they?

Of course, the alarm goes off when she hits the exit and bolts right past Alex as he's coming back into the building.  Now, store rules for us meant that once she was outside the store, we couldn't chase her.  However, Officer Workout was ready and, sure as shit, she took off the moment she saw the cruiser.  We would find out later that the officer used to play safety for a Division Three college nearby, which wasn't a shock as he performed a beautiful form-fitting tackle on her in the middle of the parking lot.  You know the type I'm talking about:  Getting her from behind, lifting her completely off her feet, but making sure that he set her back down on the feet like you would in football warmups when practicing tackling form.

No injuries, no blood, just getting the thief.

The best line of the day, though, came from the officer after he brought her back in for us to show her the security tape and to fill out our official paperwork on her.  He heads out of the office and comes over to us, giving us his direct phone number.

**Officer:  Seriously, guys, just call me next time and not dispatch.  I love this shit.**

I'm planning on leaving at the end of the month (would have left by now, but I at least wanted to give them two weeks notice so they won't be short staffed at Christmas), so let's just say I put up with a lot less rudeness from customers than before. I'm still polite and try my best to give good customer service, but if a customer's giving me shit, I'll give it right back. Today was a perfect example of this.




I'm ringing up a well dressed older woman. She seemed nice at first and was buying a lot of Christmas decorations. I was making small talk with her and mentioned how this was my first Christmas living with my boyfriend and how excited I was to decorate our apartment. This was when shit hit the fan. She asked in a cold tone if I meant husband. I said no, we're engaged but not married yet. Suddenly she went on a tirade about how we're living in ""sin"" because we're living together but not married. I notice that every customer in earshot is staring and feel myself getting flushed. After about a minute of this I'd had enough. I voided her transaction and said ""I don't get paid enough to stand here and get insulted like this. I'm refusing you service. Go to customer service and pay there because I'm done."" 




She started to sputter ""How dare you talk to me like that? Call your manager right now! I'll have you fired!"" I couldn't help but smile. ""I'm planning on quitting anyway, so I really don't care. Actually, if I get fired I can leave early so you'd be doing me a favor."" She could tell I was serious and that her threat fell on deaf ears, so she stomped off to customer service screaming about what a whore I am (nice!). I was shaking with adrenaline and rage for the next couple of minutes, but the other customers in my line reassured me I was in the right and she was a nutcase.

",toxicpretty,1661,314,121,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1a4yhv/an_evening_of_bringing_humble_pie_to_a_bitchy/,"Ok, so my latest tale was well received (http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1a3vgj/gave_a_bitchy_coworker_a_lesson_in_karma_while/) and so I thought I might share my favorite moment in the long and multifaceted job history that is mine. And it stars a decently famous person to boot...

When I was ten, I had the fortunate experience to begin work at a semi well known theater in Waterford, CT where many a star and playwright began their careers. This is a place that holds a coveted playwrights conference each year during the summer where many promising writers compete to have their best work fine tuned into  masterpieces. The pieces are given to promising young actors who work the plays each night, script in hand (rife with changes), in front of live audiences....bare props, simple sets....just the work. Each morning mentor directors and scriptwriters work with the playwright to interpret audience reactions and tweak the scripts till they shine. It's a fun, spontaneous place to work.

 Fortunately, my mother worked in the small print shop and after a few weeks of hanging around the theaters, I was give a job as an usher. It was an unpaid gig but it guaranteed entry and killer seats to any and all the plays during the season...and as a kid who loved theater, it was better than money. I worked there from the age of ten till I graduated high school and loved every minute. I have a hundred stories from those summer nights but one stands out from the rest...

Two summers in, there came a time when our awesome stage manager had to quit for another gig. Being the most senior of the present ushers and mature for my age, the managers  of the theater asked if I would step in for a night or two while they filled the position..two days become a week and a week became a month and I was doing a really good job. But my hopes of keeping the gig were dashed when they filled the position with the mother of all insecure, power-heady bitches. She hated me from the moment she realized that a twelve year old had essentially been doing her job...and she made sure to remind me of my place whenever possible. Often, after saving myself a seat with my jacket, I would find it moved as the lights turned down for the performance. Her excuse? Only legitimate customers should have decent seats despite our unpaid status. Soon I could only hope to get a middle orchestra seat if I stealthily did it when she wasn't looking. The hate was becoming seriously mutual and I had begun to think of quitting.

But I had to wait till the end of the month because I wanted to see one play in particular...a musical version of Fahrenheit 451. Besides being one of my favorite books, I had been watching the rehearsals for weeks and the score was amazing. It had two of my friends in it and it was rumored that the playwright had even invited Ray Bradbury to come to opening night....and he had accepted! I wasn't going to miss it for anything. 

That night turned out to have one of the harshest thunderstorms of the summer for CT. It was pouring and the wind was fierce. I had been extra careful reserving a seat for myself...or at least I thought I had. And it was a half hour from curtain. Suddenly my bitch manager appeared out of nowhere and demanded I go to the mansion to tell Mr. Bradbury's agent that  it was time to get seated.

Now let me explain ""the mansion"". This theater was built on the grounds of an old estate in Waterford. It had several amphitheaters and the main stage was in a converted barn where tonight's performance was. About a quarter of a mile across the estate lay the mansion that housed the theater offices, lounges, and the cafeteria. She essentially wanted me to run a quarter of a mile in the pouring rain to ask a guest to come down...despite the fact that there were phones. When I tried to argue, she threatened my position. I was pissed but I began to run. 

I show up breathless at the lounge in the mansion to see a piggish man finishing the vestiges of a huge meal. He hardly acknowledges me when I speak to him and then tells me that I'm ""dismissed""! By this point I'm getting way too pissed to even speak so I run back to the barn sopping wet. It's almost curtain time and as soon as I hit the barn, I scan for my jacket and my seat...only to find them moved to the back railing. It's now standing room only (which we allowed with our informal nature) and I'm done. Completely. 

I look around and see my manager speaking to a grey haired gentleman in the front row. I quickly walk to where they are standing and my presence naturally draws their attention. I tell my manager that I've done what she's asked and I'm going home. She actually smirks and walks away! Turning around to leave the gentleman says""Aren't you staying for the play? It's supposed to be wonderful."" I sigh and without thinking, I tell him that I've just had the worst night ever, lost my seat to an ungrateful boss, gotten sopping wet tracking down an ego case at the mansion, and that even though I was looking forward to it...well, it's obvious that its time to go home. He suddenly says ""I'm so sorry! My agent really is a self righteous ass, isn't he?"" That's when I realize who I'm talking to...Mr. Bradbury...himself! Between the self pity and him being a lot older than pics I'd seen of him, I hadn't even recognized him! I begin to apologize profusely for being so candid but he won't hear any of it...instead he starts looking around and motioning for my bitch manager to come over.

Mr. Bradbury (suddenly all business):  ""This young lady is sitting with me this evening...I will need a towel and another seat right here in the aisle."" 

Bitchy manager: ""But sir, she can't sit here...it breaks fire codes and besides... She's an u..usher!""

Mr. Bradbury: ""I don't give a crap about fire codes...she's sitting here or I'm not staying! Now get her a towel and a chair!""

She looks at me. I look at her. I smile a smile three miles wide. She sighs and slinks off! She ever so humbly returns with the requested items but this time can't make eye contact. I beam.

Mr Bradbury, gesturing to a seat dead front and center: ""My lady, shall we enjoy the show?"" I didn't walk....I floated.

And that, my friends, is how I got to spend an evening watching the coolest musical ever, sitting right next to Mr Ray Bradbury, discussing with him the finer points of the musical during intermission, and chuckling about how annoying his agent and my boss could be. After that night, my manager basically gave up being rude to me. She didn't last long after that and I went on to spend many a wonderful summers there!

This incident takes place during my summer position at a gas station. All employees wore headsets so we wouldn't have to yell from across the store.

From the moment this guy walked in I could tell he was having a bad day. He impatiently waits in line. When he makes it to the counter, he starts speaking and suddenly there came a fairly loud conversation taking place over the headsets. Taking the earpiece out, I apologize.

""I'm sorry sir, what was that?"" Apparently that meant I was deaf and stupid.

""Coolant! C-O-O-L-A-N-T, where is it!?""

""Oh, I'm sorry, it's right down this first aisle here on the bottom shelf."" 

He storms off and picks one up, brings it up and drops it on the counter. I quietly ring it up and tell him his total. He opened his wallet and a very audible ""Fuck!"" radiated through the store. 
""I hope I have enough in my damn bank account."" He swipes his card, it goes through. He snatches the coolant and heads out to his car. 

It was only then I noticed the hood was propped up and a twenty something girl was sitting in the passenger seat, crying. I keep my attention on the guy, as there were no other customers at that moment. He makes an attempt to pour the coolant in and misses, getting it everywhere except where it needed to be. I can't hear him but I can see his mouth go through the motion of that famous word again... several times.

He comes back in.
""Can I get a funnel and some paper towels?"" It took a few seconds as I was turning around I swore I heard ""Please"". No, surely not.

""Absolutely, did you need any help out there?"" I say as I hand him a small stack of towels and a funnel. This guy was shaking so much in frustration he was about to break.

""No, I should be able to get it this time. Thanks though.""

Wait...what?

Fast forward to a few minutes later, he comes in to wash his hands. I figured he'd just leave afterwards. Nope. He stood in line again, this time less anxiously. He reaches the counter again and sighs.

""I'm sorry for being short with you. I had to drive all the way to the other side of the state to get my daughter and her stuff from her asshole boyfriend's apartment. My car is overheating and I spent everything I had getting over there and back.""

I carry on speaking with him for a few minutes about how her boyfriend must have been a major ass-hat and directing him to an auto shop down the road that did quick, free assessments.

By the time he left, he had a smile on his face and a freezy drink in each hand (because I felt bad and had extra coupons). Everything is better with freezies. Not a bad day.

**TL;DR -** Guy starts out as a jerk, slowly turns into a decent guy and apologizes for being a jerk. Also, freezies make the world a better place.

We dealt with the snobbiest of the snobby as we were in a wealthy area of socal. While I was there I was playing poker full time as well, using the earnings from this job to cover me in the event of a losing night

So, one day I had this customer with his cart loaded to brim with everything from cookies to vitamins. I can already tell his bill is gonna be somewhere between $800-$1200. (Something easy to do in the store). Immediately the guy starts being a snob, ordering me to empty his basket while he stood there on his phone texting the whole time. He had me fetch several other items for him as well, not bothering to unload while I was gone. It took me a solid 10 minutes to ring up his items and another 15 to bag it all up, as he refused to lift  finger. So finally, when this all said and done his bill comes out to a little over $1300. This man had the audacity to sneer at me and say ""That's it? Pfft!"" and proceeded to slide his card. After punching in his info, his card was declined. He looked at me like I just took a shit on his chest. He said ""Run it again!"" So after 3 more attempts I finally ask him ""do you maybe have another card you can use? This one doesn't seem to be working. "" he responded with ""Don't take that tone with me! I make more money in a week than you do in a year! Run my damn card."" After several more attempts he demanded to talk to my manager, proclaiming it was my fault his card was declining.  After having my manager run his card several more times to the same result he just exploded with rage calling us criminals and that he was going to boycott the store. I was so frustrated and finally had enough with this asshole and exclaimed ""watch this!"" I took out my debit card ran it through the machine, typed in my pin and to his shock it went through. ""He started stammering in shock. I can only imagine what was going through his mind that this ""lowly cashier"" was able to buy his groceries no problem. He promptly left the store and never came back. Needless to say my manager was shocked, and I got a refund on all the groceries. Fuck people for looking down their noses at cashiers.

When I looked up to see the man behind the selections, a tall, stocky figure with a legendary mustache and a chipped front tooth greeted me. The bundle of facial hair was extremely thick, brown with spots of gray, and obviously something he took an enormous deal of pride in. My first instinct, as it usually is with anybody who has exceptional facial hair, was to compliment the man on his work of art.

He replied by thanking me and explaining how he hadn’t shaved it since 1973. When I asked why, he responds “Back in Vietnam, my best friend told me ‘if you ever die, I’m never shaving this here mustache’. We were always competing against each other so I told him ‘alright motherfucker, you got a deal.’  Three days later I saw him get shot in the head and this has been untouched ever since.”  I was completely taken back, obviously, and after a few seconds told him that was very honorable.

She was pretty much done cleaning up my station and we were just talking about how gross the pastries in our display start looking (calorie/sugar content wise) after you've worked there for a while.

So we're talking for a few minutes. Not long at all before an older woman, who had been seated at the bar by our espresso just staring at us, started almost screaming out, ""EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE. ME! HEY!"" 

My co-worker, who we'll call ""Sunny"", turned and walked over to her and asked her, ""How can I help you today?"" The woman stared at her for a few moments before saying, ""Are you done talking and ready to take my order? I'd really hate to inconvenience *you*."" 

Sunny handled it pretty well and explained to the lady that to make a to-go order she would need to approach the register and that we don't take those orders from seated customers; especially customers who already have bagged up food from whatever they ate dining in. Which, the lady did have several to-go boxes already with her.

The lady made a huge deal of getting up and walking over to the register. I decided to clock in while she waddled over to us. While I was punching in my number and tying my apron she just stood at the register I was at and stared at me. I directed her to the open register and she just stayed where she was. I then explained that I wasn't on the clock and Sunny will be more than happy to help her. She rolled her eyes and barked out, ""Mushroom soup."" 

I rolled my eyes and asked, ""Medium or large?"" 

""Large.""

Sunny went to the back to make it and I clocked in and rung it up for her. The lady kind of wandered over to our display and looked at it for a while. She came back to my register (I was standing at the open register this time) and just stood there. I was still in a pretty decent mood, despite how short and abnormally rude she was being. So I remained casual and waited for her order. She finally says, ""You need to take your hand out of your pocket.""

This is a terrible habit of mine. I always keep my left hand in my pocket and ring people up with my right. Now, because I don't handle food without gloves on... no one ever says anything about it. But I had the strong feeling that this wasn't really a big deal to her. At this point, something I did or said when I walked in the door made her hate me. I don't know what it was... but it was something.

I took my hand out of my pocket and raised my eyebrows in a, ''kay, let's get this show on the road so you can gtfo' kind of manner and she proceeded to say, ""I want one creme brulee.""

We have three different kinds of creme brulee. I asked if she wanted the one with sprinkles, berries, or vanilla. She just rolled her eyes and said, ""The creme brulee! Duh!"" 

So I just gave her whatever was in the back of the 'throw out in an hour' slightly smashed up against a metal rail in the cooler creme brulee and packaged her soup before ringing her up. She placed her money directly on the counter in front of my register where I couldn't reach it. So I had to come around to the front and pick it up and take it back to my till where I finished the transaction and put the money back on the counter and slid it over to her.

She took it, pocketed it, and grabbed her bag. Then she said, ""Can I have your name?"" Out of curiosity I just had to ask... ""Why? What have I done wrong besides put my hand in my pocket?""

She then looked at me with this look of pure hatred that I can't explain and said, ""This isn't your goddamn social hour. You come here to work. Not talk about how gross your food is, not to flaunt off how skinny you are, and not to show off your political views. This. Is. Work. Remember that when corporate fires you and you have to find a job at some other restaurant.""

I was shocked. Sure, my co-worker and I discussed the calorie count in our desserts. But my political views? So, being bold again I asked, ""I'm sorry, I understand that I did in fact make comments about the calorie count in our desserts. And I'm truly sorry if it offended you. Though, I'm just curious as to when I stated my political views.""

She then said, ""I saw that NRA sticker on the back of your truck when you pulled in. You represent this company, and now I'm never eating here again. In fact, you're pretty mouthy. Go get your manager.""

The NRA sticker on the back of my *husband's* truck. But fine, whatever. I got my manager who explained to her that a tiny, almost invisible round sticker with the letters 'NRA' on it was not grounds to get me fired. Neither was discussing the calories in an item. And that her behavior was inappropriate and turning into harassment and that he would appreciate it if she left.

The rest of the night was fine. But damn. I think she just didn't like me.

Crazy lady starts yelling that I am going to burn in hell, and she wants her money back. Again i calmly explain i can not accept this item. Crazy lady goes on a rant about how evil and sad I am for selling these items. ""Well, that's all fine and dandy but I don't really give a damn. Either buy something or get out as I am not accepting this item"", I explained as nicely as possible.

Crazy lady goes up in arms and starts waving the dildo in my face ""I want to speak to the manager!"", I smile ""Ma'am, I am the manager"", she gets red in the face and then screams she wants to talk to the owner. ""Ma'am, the owner is a busy man and can't always be here. I don't think you would like to see him mad. I am sorry ma'am, but, I can not accept a used dildo"".

Crazy lady gets mad and throws the dildo at my face and then spits on me. ""God will strike you dead. You are a corrupter. You have defiled my daughter by selling her this tool of the devil. I shall not leave until I have a refund"". I shake my head, no more being nice. I politely tell her to get the hell out of my store before I call Police. We have a very clear no soliciting rule. Crazy lady stutters and thinks I'm bluffing. I'm not, I pick up the phone and prepare to call.

Crazy Lady runs out the store and thats last i see of her. Whats worse is today was supposed to be my day off. I only came in because my asst-manager and other worker decided to ""conveniently"" call in sick today, leaving me as the only one working today.

You see, most places use the saying ""the customer is always right,"" but my boss likes to say ""if the customer is an asshole, fuck 'em!"" 

For the past several weeks, we've had this bitchy woman come in to the shop every afternoon and complain about our coffee. She always likes to stand at the edge of the counter and watch us with hawk eyes as we steam the milk that goes into her latte. ""Not too hot, not too cold"" she always says. And I swear, if you go one degree above 160, she'll flip her lid and say she won't drink it!

Well, one day, my boss had enough. We were having a slow day and nobody was inside the shop at the moment. That's when we saw her. Our mortal enemy was making her way into the shop. My boss said ""play along"" and winked to me. 

As soon as the woman walked through the door my boss said to me ""Hey, did you see where I left my crack? I need a smoke, but I can't find it anywhere!"" The women looked astonished at the conversation, and I could tell she thought we were serious. I said ""I left it in the lightbulb, hold on, I'll get it."" 
I walked over to the supply closet, which was conveniently located out of sight in the office. I reached for a lightbulb, and cut off the metallic end with some pliers to make it look like paraphernalia. When I came back, my boss was taking the woman's order. I interrupted the woman as she was taking her order and handed the lightbulb to my boss, who was trying desperately not to bust out laughing. The woman, who was horrified by what had just happened stormed out of the cafe without finishing her order. 

We haven't seen the woman in about a week now, and I don't think she's coming back. In the meantime, I think I've become my boss's favorite employee!

Applied at a few local places and ended up taking a job at Fat Krispy Chicken (FKC). For the few weeks there were no issues. I was a computer nerd already, so learning the register and procedures was a cinch. I only worked 12 hours per week still being in highschool.

My manager was a 25 year-old bitch, at this point. She'd been thin and pretty but not-so-bright when she started working there and had gained quite a bit of weight due to her free manager meals of complete grease. She hated that I packed a lunch from home instead of eating the slop we served.  Topping it off, I'd caught on to things way quicker than she had and people talked about it and it caused her to hate me.

In my third week I'm up front manning the register when a couple walks in... a very large couple. 350lb+ each. The man wheezes up to the counter and makes their to-go order of a 14 piece family meal with a family sized side of potato wedgies and two family sized mashed potatoes. I'm thinking this is a big order, but their big people, and I don't know how many people they're going to be feeding anyway.

I ring the order in and tell him his total and his wife suddenly looks pissed and yells: ""I'm eating too!"" ... wut? She orders 24 hot wings and two family sized orders of potato wedgies. Seriously. She then follows that up with ""And I need a large diet Coke."" at which the man chimes in that he needs a large diet Coke as well.

I'm laughing internally at this point, but it is a to-go order and they probably have a few kids or another family coming over... something. Right? It has to be.

Their order comes up and they take the gargantuan bags of food... to the dine-in tables.

Me: I'm sorry folks, I thought you'd ordered that for take-out, I could get you some trays if you'd like.""

Man: Don't need trays. We always order take-out because I'm not paying tax to eat here!

Cheap fucks. They just spent nearly $40 on food but can't pay the tax? Eh. Whatever. I go about my day and start cleaning the lobby. I'm mopping and trying to ignore them so they can eat in peace when they stand up. I figured something must be wrong so I look to see and.... the food's all gone. In roughly 7 minutes. Nearly 17,000 calories of extra krispy, wings, and potatoes.

Stunned silence. I'm staring at the trays covered in bones and destruction that these customers kindly left for us to clean instead of throwing their trash out.

Woman notices me staring and and gets pissed. Calls for manager. Manager comes up and listens to how badly I treated them by acting like she wouldn't be eating too and then making fun of them for eating a healthy (wut?) meal.

She told me in front of the customers that I had two choices. 1. Apologize to the customers for my rudeness and take a write up or 2. Termination. Fat lady customer was smiling and pleased with herself.

I laughed and told her if working there was going to turn me into a fat angry slob like her and our wonderful customers then leaving this job would be a blessing. Took my apron off and put it on the counter, clocked out and headed for the door. The whole time the fatties are bitching at me and manager both: ""Come back here! Are you going to let him...!"" and manager is trying to calm them down and yell at me: ""Come back here! You can't do..."" and it's all just background noise, because it suddenly feels like all weight and stress has been removed from my shoulders.

Hello again, TalesFromRetail!  
My previous story, [The Chicken Nugget Hooker](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1icw8i/the_chicken_nugget_hooker/), received so much positive attention that I thought another story was needed.  
  
About a year after the aforementioned incident, I was working the Saturday night drive-thru shift again. It was fairly busy, as Saturday evenings tend to be. A very shiny rental car pulls up to the ordering microphone, and the driver begins ordering. He has a very thick French accent, and I have trouble understanding him, as the microphone is already in terrible condition. I ask him to repeat his order a few times. He is clearly agitated by the time he completes his order.  
  
A few minutes later, he pulls up to the drive-thru window. I walk over to take his payment. He informs me that he wants to change his order.  
  
""Hi, my wife does not want number 7 anymore. She wants number 3 now. Change it, please. Also add two milkshakes.""  
  
I inform him that I will be happy to change his order, but that there will be a small additional wait. He mutters something under his breath. I ignore the comment and begin making the milkshakes. I hear him and his wife conversing in French through the window.  
  
Now, I took French in high school. I was by no stretch of the imagination a good student. Madame Durand despaired that I only did enough work to squeak by with a C every semester. However, I could still make out phrases of the couple's conversation, and sometimes entire sentences.  
  
""Sad excuse for a restaurant...""  
  
""...stupid white boy, should go to university."" (They both laugh.)  
  
At this moment, I hatch a brilliant idea. I can't speak French that well, but I can well enough to get the point across. I begin recalling nouns and verbs from the many hours spent in French class. Madame Durand would have been proud.  
  
I take the payment for the order, hand over the food to the driver, and prepare myself. As he reaches for the milkshakes, I say to him in broken French,  
  
""I hope you enjoy your meal, sir. It was a pleasure to serve you today.""  
  
He looks at me, and gets that terrified deer-in-the-headlights look of someone caught red-handed. His eyes begin to bulge out of his head. My grin is wider than that of a Jack-o-lantern. I'm afraid that if my smile gets any wider, the top of my head will fall off.  
  
Then, the best thing that could possibly happen... happened.  
  
You know when your eye starts twitching randomly, and it just won't stop? It always happens during a job interview or a date, and it's the worst thing ever.  
  
My eye started twitching now. Not a little mini-twitch where you can hope the other person didn't notice, but a full-on Berserker Rage twitch. My eyelid was threatening to jump off my face and start a life of its own.  
  
This guy definitely noticed it. It was beautiful. A great interstellar drama spread across his face as his brain recategorized me from ""Obnoxiously Cheerful Food Worker"" to ""Twitching Psychopath Whom I Just Insulted.""  
  
This man wasted no time. Eyes bulging, he made a sound that can only be described as a strangled grunt and slammed the vehicle into gear. Not one to waste food, he seized both milkshakes from my hands and *tossed* them into his wife's lap. Her shrieking protests mixed with the squealing tires on the pavement.  
  
I never saw either of them again.

Backstory: So I'm 20 and work part time in a major UK supermarket. Our store is unlike most supermarkets in that there is no nearby car-park, and is located in the city centre. 

I am the 'lucky' person that gets to supervise the self-service checkouts. There is 9 in total for one person to supervise. One particularly busy period an obnoxious middle aged woman (OMAW) interrupted me whilst I was helping another customer and demanded I show her how to use the machine. I asked her to please be patient until I had finished helping the current customer and that I would be right with her.

When I got around to helping her, she had already attempted to use the machine herself, and had of course failed to follow any of the on screen instructions and had every possible error occurring at once.

Me: Ok you've actually put your items on the wrong side of the checkout which is why you're getting these errors. Don't worry a lot of people make that mistake. I'll just sort it for you.

OMAW: (Huffs, Sighs, Tuts etc)

Me: Is this your first time using one of these machines then?

OMAW: Yes I'm in a big hurry, I've just parked my car outside because I needed a couple of things before I go home.

(I glance up to where she indicated and see her car parked literally outside the front door of the store, right in the middle of a bus lane.)

Me: Right so all you have to do is... (I explain the procedure and even process a couple of items for her). Ok?

OMAW: Yes fine.

(I then go and help another machine that requires approval for alcohol before I get another tap on my shoulder)

OMAW: THE STUPID MACHINE IS BROKEN

Me: Well let's have a look. Ok you've actually put all your items into the bagging area, but none have been scanned.

OMAW: YES I DID WHAT YOU TOLD ME TO DO 

Me: Well I'm afraid none of your items have registered if you did try to scan them, let's put them through again. (This time I process her entire basket just to try and get rid of her)

OMAW: YOU CAN'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO. YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT EVEN OUT OF YOUR TEENS. YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO TELL ME I DID IT WRONG, NO RIGHT AT ALL. YOU'RE JUST A STUPID LITTLE BOY.

Me: (Quite obviously shocked at the outburst) I was simply telling you what you may have done wrong.

OMAW: WHY DO THEY HIRE YOUNG PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE SO RUDE. WHERE IS YOUR MANAGER?

(I personally love it when this happens. So I go and get the manager, causing more delays for herself and the 8 other machines I'm supposed to be helping as well as a queue of people which has now formed)

Man(ager): Hello there what seems to be the problem?

OMAW: YES THIS IDIOT YOU'VE EMPLOYED IS BEING VERY RUDE

Man: Well we take abuse in out store very seriously, if I could just take some details off you.

(OMAW gives name, address and telephone number)

Man: Ok thank you for that. I'd like to now tell you that you will be placed on the list of customers banned from the store. I will not tolerate abuse to my staff. Good day. 

OMAW: WHAT? I WORK FOR THE COUNCIL, YOU CAN'T DO THAT. 

Man: I'm afriad I can, now are you going to leave or shall I call security to escort you off the premises?

OMAW: I'M GOING, BUT I WILL CLOSE THIS STORE DOWN, JUST YOU WAIT UNTIL I GET BACK TO THE OFFICE.

Man: Ok then have a nice evening.

OMAW storms out of the store, gets into her illegaly parked car and drives the wrong way down a one way road straight into the path of an oncoming police car, who gives her a fixed penalty notice on the spot, all right outside the front of the store.

OMAW looks around exasperated, and then looks straight at me as I stand there staring right back, with a huge grin on my face.

TL;DR: Middle aged council worker was unnecessarily rude to me, was banned from store and received a fine from the police.

At one of the largest video game stores in the United States, in fact. It was a glorious time, just before the advent of corporate's fixation on reservations and subscriptions, but during the heady days of the newly launched XBox 360 and PS3. Systems flew of the shelves, Jack Thompson was the source of many a knowing chuckle, and I truly enjoyed going into work each and every day.

Now, because Jack Thompson was still a thing at that time, we had all been briefed over and over again that we could not sell rated M games to minors, and had to in every single case get the purchaser's ID. If the minor wanted the game, we had to get their parent to approve. No parent, no sale.

Cue the 13 year old gangster kid. He waltzed into the store all dressed up, trying to look as intimidating as a short, chubby pre-teen with ego issues could. I kept an eye on him, asked him if he needed help, and went about my business.

After about ten minutes he came up to the front desk with GTA San Andreas. He slammed it down on the front desk and announced, ""I'm getting this.""

Cheerful, delighted me replied, ""Of course! Can I see your ID?""

Blank stare. ""What?""

I helpfully flipped the game case over to the ESRB rating. ""I'm sorry, but since this is a rated M for mature game, I'm not able to sell it without your ID or your mother or father's permission.""

His eyes lit up. Little did I know, I'd given him the perfect out. With a hurried, ""One sec,"" he ran out of the store to fetch the parental unit. The parental unit in this case turned out to be his mother, or possibly grandmother, who clearly spoke little to no English as her frustrated chatter to her son revealed as she entered the store.

*""What do you need?""* she grumbled at him as they came to the desk.

*""The lady needs your ID, just show her your license and say OK,""* her son told her as quickly as he could. *""It's nothing, they're just stupid.""*

Now, you might have noticed I put that dialogue in italics. That's because it was conducted entirely in Spanish, and because, thanks to my public school education, I knew Spanish. Not well enough to write an essay, but definitely well enough to follow the conversation and know the son was trying to pull a fast one on Mom. Time for due diligence.

*""Ma'am, I'm sorry to bother you, but your son wishes to purchase this mature game,""* I told her.

Her eyes widened. (Ed. note: I am the whitest white chick that ever walked the earth. I'm so white, my ancestors came over on the Mayflower.) *""Ok, fine,""* she replied, *""Let me get it.""* She started to rummage about in her purse while her son glared daggers at me.

*""There's a little more to it,""* I told her. I pointed deliberately to the M rating. *""This game has blood, violence, people having sex, naked people, drugs, and other assorted mature topics. I want to make sure you understand this before I sell him the game.""*

Her eyes got wider and wider with each strike against the game, as her son wilted more and more. When I finished, she whipped around, grabbed her son by the ear, and marched him out of the store flinging invectives and curses at him for trying to trick her into letting him get the game.

I chuckled, put the game away, and lay in wait for the next troublemaker to enter the store.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,standard,True,t3_1h91nf,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1h91nf/when_a_public_school_education_does_a_video_game/,

It always baffled me that customers would write ""CHECK ID"" or ""SEE DRIVER'S LICENSE"" on the back of them but, as I was supposed to do, whenever someone put that on their card I would ask for their actual ID.

Most people would say, ""WHY?! MY PICTURE'S RIGHT THERE!""

""I know, but you wrote 'CHECK DL' in all caps where your signature should be so I am obligated to ask.""

From this point, one of two things would happen:

1) They'd show me their ID apologetically and feeling a little stupid

2) They'd continue to call me stupid or act like I was a neanderthal while showing me their ID.

In my earlier posts, I mentioned that this store was in a higher income neighborhood so we had a lot of people in their golf attire come in. One such fellow did. Polo shirt tucked into his khakis, white visor, graying hair, and a goatee. He was a portly fellow, possibly from eating too much wine and cheese.

At this point in my career, I'm sick of the job and my shit-taking levels are at record lows. He clearly wrote, ""Check Driver's License"" on the card with his photo on it so before I charged it, I asked for it.

""That's me.""

""Yes, I know it's you but since you wrote to check your license, I have to ask.""

""That's fucking stupid. I'm not taking out my ID.""

""I'm not charging the card then.""

""You little shit, do you know who I am? I'm not taking out my ID.""

""I have no idea who you are because you wont show me your ID.""

The line is long as all hell because it's one of those stores and it's a weekend and it's coupon time. 

""Well, I'm not leaving until you ring me up,"" this asshole says.

At this point, I give him back his card.

""Alright, then. Ring yourself up,"" I said, locked my register and walked away. 

Some supervisor finished his order while I ate a Snickers bar in the breakroom and watched whatever was on the TV. I didn't get into any trouble because the customers after him told the supervisor what a dick the guy was.

Cried at work for the first time] (http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/178lwi/people_can_be_vicious_cried_at_work_for_the_first/) about three months ago, I got a lot of PMs. Not regarding Jill or other customers, but regarding my manager. These past few weeks have been absolutely insane. 

Since this incident, our staff began to have more and more problems with this manager disrespecting us, embarrassing us, and just making our lives miserable. We came close to having a lot of great people quit and we went home every night absolutely hating our jobs. Things got really bad for a while. Finally, I decided enough was enough and I gathered everyone that had talked to me about their issues with him, and decided to take it to our store manager and have one big meeting. 

This decision terrified me. I haven't been there nearly as long as some of the others and I'm low on the food chain. My decision could have gotten me in serious trouble, or even terminated. I figured if I was going to get fired for speaking up about the harassment we were enduring, then I didn't want to work there anyways. 

The meeting lasted about an hour or so and we didn't even get everything out that we had wanted to say. It was time to go back to work. We were told things would get sorted out. The next day, I come in to this weird aura. Everyone was in a good mood, customers were happy, and I didn't see the grumpy, miserable faces I usually saw when I got to work. 

My manager no longer worked for the company. This was enough to celebrate, but what would come next was even better. We all began to wonder who would take his job. We all got along with each other so it was fair game. They talked for a while about hiring someone brand new and that made us a bit nervous. It could be someone just as bad, or worse than the original manager. 

There's a lot of meetings and closed doors and finally, I get called in. Long story short, I got the job. I'm young, and have no experience with management and I got the job. I'm beyond proud of myself and I'm excited to see what I can do for our store. Things are turning up!

My gym partner, is a very well toned, athletic female who Crossfits. She also loves Paleo, just so you understand. I gym, I obstacle race, I still carry a bit of weight. She grew up in Italy, and has a competent grasp on the Italian language, where I know as much as Mario and Luigi, and occasional Bolognaise Sauce advertisement.

I am heading out to dinner this weekend with friends, so I task my gym buddy to aid me choosing a new outfit. Not only am I a male, I am an engineer. Clothes for me are functional, I am in desperate need of a queer eye, or someone who understands fashion, hence the tasking of said female friend.

We are in the local Jeans shop, I am squeezing into jeans not only in cuts that I never thought were possible, but sizes which I never would have thought I would wear since primary school. As I am trying on a pair of jeans, I hear two guys in the changerooms just up from me spark up a conversation. The most I can gather is they want to speak only in Italian, not in English. After that, I lose track of what they are saying.

At the moment I walk out of the changerooms for an opinion, my friend turns to them, says something vicious and rapid in Italian. These two guys turn bright red, turn, put down their potential purchases, and slowly start backing out of the changerooms and shops entirely.

After watching this whole debacle, and after they left I turn to my friend and give the biggest WTF look I have. it turns out they started ragging on me from the moment I entered, and culminated in the sentence ""What does a guy like him think he should be doing in public with a lady like her"".

Like in my last story I worked at a sunglass shop in the older part of my city. 

On this day I had a female customer come in. She was about 5""2 brunette and a hourglass figure. Lets call her HF. I, being the sells man I am, automatically ask if she needs and help. She says no and looks around the store. When another customer comes in. This customer is a guy, whom I usually don't do my pitches to since they always just ignore me. Well he notices HF and try's on some glasses next to her. When he try's on the most expensive pair in the rack in front of him HF tells him that they look great on him. Also that he should buy them. So comes up to the register and pays for them. The. He tries to talk to HF who started talking up another pair of shades to another female. HF ended talking 15 people into buying expensive shades that day. At the end of it all she come up to me and asked if that counted as a live interview.

Anyway, when I was in highschool I worked as a junior mechanic at a small garage in southern Maine. One day we had a guy call in and tell us he needed his clutch replaced. (I'll call him Screwguy). I was like ""no problem, man. Bring the car in at three and we'll get it done right quick"". So the guy brings his car in, and we start to raise it up on the lift. My boss looks at the undercarriage of the car and lets out this long whistle. Turns out Screwguy had (in his attempt to replace the clutch himself) removed literally every bolt and screw from the underside of his car. Every. Single. One. After digging around for about 5 minutes we determined that Screwguy had ruined his transmission with his overzealous bolt removal. When I break the news to him he goes dead pale. He just stares at me for a minute and then says ""my wife told me I was gonna break something... She's never gonna let me live this down"". I tell him the it's gonna cost about $900 to replace both the transmission and the clutch, and it's like a switch is flicked inside his head. ""$900, eh? I can do that... Yeah, that'll be fine. I'm gonna pay for all the work right now, in cash"". I'm just staring at Screwguy as he paces back and forth, gears in his head spinning like crazy. Suddenly he stops, and turns to me. ""Don't tell my wife"". He says looking me dead in the eyes. I just stare at him for a second before saying ""sure thing, man"". He shakes my hand as vigorously as is humanly possible before running, actually running, to the front of the store to pay for the work. When Screwguy and his wife come back later to pick up the car, he looks at his wife, then the car, and then he gives me this long slow wink. Like he's the smoothest criminal of all time. I almost spit my coffee half way across the room. Anyway, he got his car, drove off, and lived happily ever after. Not exactly a ""Tale from Retail"", but I thought you guys might enjoy it.

Went down the road to get a sammich, and decided to stop for gas.As I'm putting the nozzle into the tank, a Mercedes pulls up behind me.  We were the only two people at the pumps, and I didn't think much of it at the time.  After about 30 seconds, the Mercedes issues a short, loud honk.  Ok, maybe the driver leaned on the horn by accident while getting composed to step out into the cold. No big deal.

10 seconds later, 2 more honks in quick succession.  Ok.... dafuq?  So I turn and look and the driver is waving me over to her.  Umm alright.  So I shimmy on over, and the drivers side window rolls down. Inside is what I can only describe to be a reject from the Real Housewives of NJ.  Orange skins still glowing from her last session in a tanning bed.  Lips are so inflated and puffed up, I wonder if she either has had too many colagen injections, or if she's perhaps dating Chris Brown.  Designer purse and sunglasses.  The only thing missing would be a Gucci dog carrier with a small pomeranian inside.  

Anyways, the woman extends her hand, full of money, and tells me ""Thirty Dollars"".  At this point, as I've only gotten two hours of sleep, I'm still not grasping what the fuck is truly going on here. My normally sharp intellect is now moving at the same pace as Kristy Alley running a marathon after her 3rd mile.

Me: I'm sorry, whats the problem?

HouseWife:  I want $30 put into the tank.

I decided at this time to look down at myself, and make sure that I was in fact wearing my work uniform.  And just as I suspected all along, I am wearing dress pants, shoes, a white button down shirt, and nice heavy sweater with a nice bright white patch on it that says *SECURITY COMPANY NAME SECURITY* on it.  

Me: Ummm ma'm I don't work here.

HW: What? You don't?

Me: Noooo.  See this right here. It says Security.  

HW: Well then wheres the attendant? Why isn't he pumping your gas?

Me:  He's inside I guess. And it's not full service.

HW: What? YOU MEAN I HAVE TO PUMP MY OWN GAS?

Me: Well, yes it's self service.

HW: Well, this is NOT how it is in NJ.

Me:  Yea well this is not NJ, so don't know what you were expecting.

HW: Where's the nearest self serve station.

Me: Far as I know, about 4 towns north.

Hw: Well can't you just pump my gas?

Me:uhhh... no.

Hw: Why not?

At this point I just walked away.  Stupidity is infectious and I don't wanna catch a case of the HerpDerps.  The HW, clearly pissed off, actually had to get out of her car. Can you believe it. How dare I?  She storms into the convenience store and starts berating the clerk.  Now at this point my gas is done pumping, but much like a porno after you've already finished, I HAD to sit tight and watch the final shot.

The clerk, visibly confused, is listening to this woman, as she is pointing to me, clearly yelling.  The clerk stares at me, blinks a few times, and turns back to the woman.  I can see him shake his head.  This obviously upsets HW even further.  I can see her ranting and raving and the clerk, great guy that he is, stands his ground and tells her she can either pump her own gas or go somewhere else.  Well HW comes out, walks over to the gas pump, and sits there.  She obviously can't figure out how to work the damn thing.  I walk in grab my receipt, share a quick laugh with the cashier, and walk back to my car.  As I'm walking over, HW waves and says ""Sweetie, could you show me how to work this! Be a doll.""

My laughter could be heard for miles from that one.  I got back into my car, put on Jump by Van Halen, and laughed my way back to work.

**TL;DR-How do I gas?**

Years ago I was attending a local college learning computer repair and networking. A guy in my class, who was known for being a braggart, worked part-time at a big box store that serviced and sold computers. He came in one day bragging about his new processor and how much faster his computer ran now. He was just dying to tell us how he'd out-smarted a different big box store and come out of it with a free processor.

He told us how he'd gone into the store and bought a brand new processor. He took it home, installed it in his computer, and put his old one back in the box. He then returned it to the store and got his money back, claiming it was defective.

Of course, this is clearly theft, and it made all of us uncomfortable to hear about, and the instructor shook his head sadly at him.

The next day he didn't show up for class. Neither did he show up the second day. On the third day he came back, and was raging mad that things were unfair. He told us he'd taken the two days off to cool down because he was so angry at what had happened to him.

It turns out that in addition to bragging to us, he'd also bragged to all his coworkers at the big box store. He thought they'd love his story, because he'd done the stealing from a competitor.

His boss was disgusted by his actions, and phoned up the store he'd ripped off and told them what he'd done. He told them that the thief would be coming in and returning the real processor, and gave them the guy's full name and phone number in case he skipped out on it. The braggart was afraid of losing his job at this point, so he manned up and took back what he'd stolen. As soon as his boss had confirmation that things had been put right, he fired the guy.

I really like to think that the guy learned something from the whole ordeal, but the way he was raging about how unfairly he'd been treated, I doubt it.

The particular location I was employed at was going through a lot of changes in management, procedures, and the like. Basically, the store was in a shambles logistically and couldn't keep employees for more than a month or two at best.

Beyond the usual age verification for certain items, there was no standard procedure followed by anybody with regards to people purchasing tobacco, lottery, or basically any high-value items that had to be stored behind the counter. We would take the items, scan them, and put them on the counter while the customer paid for them. Didn't have any issues.

One day we had a loss prevention guy come in and observe our security procedures. One of his ""suggestions"" was that when making these kind of sales, we do not place them in reach of the customers until they are paid for in full. Okay, seems reasonable. Nobody should have a problem with this unless they actually plan to steal shit, right?

Not so. From the time we implemented the measure, there was ONE GUY, a regular, who came in to buy cigarettes every day, and he had a huge problem with this.

""Where are my cigarettes?""

""They're here behind the counter, sir.""

""Well why aren't they in my hand yet?""

""Because you have not yet paid for them, sir. We have new security measures in place to prevent potential losses.""

""So you think I'm going to steal them?""

""No sir.""

""Well then put them in my fucking hand!""

""No sir, that would breach proper procedure. I don't think you're going to steal them, but this is the rule and it will be followed.""

""I don't care what the rule is, you have no right to treat me like a criminal! Now put the smokes in my hand or I'm going to talk to your manager!""

""Okay sir, I'll call him from the back.""

So I rang the button that ding-donged the backroom, and an assistant manager came out and asked what was going on. They talked for a while and decided that I would place the cigarettes in his hand, breaching procedure and making me look like an asshole.

So I did. And the guy smirks at me and says ""There, was that so hard? At least your managers are competent. Maybe you should get a job cleaning toilets or something, seems more your speed."" Right in front of my manager.

At this point I looked at my manager and said ""Hey *Mike, did you hear what he just said to me? That was an abusive comment, and I'm not going to take it.""

I told him to hand back the cigarettes and get out of the store, but he refused.

""You put them in my hand, they're mine now. take my money or don't, they're mine.""

So I looked at my manager and said ""This is what happens when you don't follow procedure and make me look like an idiot, Mike. This is your problem now, I quit.""

And I walked out. Abusive customers suck, and managers who abide them are worse.

EDIT: Guys, don't downvote people just for *respectfully* suggesting that I could have done things differently. If somebody's being an asshole and lobbing insults, fine.

Despite the title, it's by no means meant to be political argument for or against guns. It's just... well, you'll see. And sorry for the length.

I did a post about this store called [You think you had a bad day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1ejoer/you_think_you_had_a_bad_day/). Anyways, onto the stories!

**First Experiences**

Before starting working where I work now, I only had limited experience with guns, firearms, weapons, etc. I was nervous as all get out to work behind the gun counter. One of the people training me, laid some ground rules about handling firearms that should always be followed. These rules are:

1) The weapon is always loaded.

2) Even when you know the weapon is unloaded. It's always loaded.

3) Always point the weapon at a safe direction. Never at someone. See rules 1 and 2 for why.

4) When handing a weapon over to someone, make sure the slide/bolt is locked back and present the arms to them with the chamber so they can see that it's cleared.

5) When a weapon is handed to you, always clear it. See rules 1 and 2.

6) Never point a firearm at something that you don't intend to kill. There is no such thing as shooting to injure.

7) Finger is never on the trigger unless you are ready to kill whatever it is you are pointing at.

I also developed a habit of not walking in front of pointed weapon. People will take a weapon and look down the sights usually aiming at the back counter wall. I would wait to the side for them to raise or lower the weapon due to rules 1 and 2 (notice a theme?). Most people will drop sight line, raise the weapon's barrel to point at the ceiling, lower the weapon down, etc to let me pass. Cool, no problem.

My first day behind the gun counter, and the first customer I had behind there wanted to see a Glock 17. I remove the weapon from the case, clear it, locked the slide back, handed it to him and the proceeded to let the slide forward and take aim to see how it fit in his hands. Problem? He was pointing it right at me. I moved to the side to get out of the line of ""fire"" and he followed me.

""Sir, could you please not point the weapon at me?""

""Why, it's not loaded?""

""I don't care, please don't point the weapon at me.""

""Stop being such a...""

At this point, a co-worker who's been there for 10+ years reaches out, grabs the slide from the top, breaks the guys grip and tells him to leave.

""Why do I have to leave?""

""Because you aren't being safe with the weapon. You need to leave now.""

""Fuck you. I want to see a manager.""

Fine. My coworker calls out a name. Down at the other end of the counter, is the president of the company. The name called was his. My coworker tells the president what just happened, including the ""fuck you"" part, the president looks at me asks if I did have a gun pointed at me. ""Yes sir."" asked the customer if he did point the gun at me, ""Yeah, but it was unloaded."" The president looks at the guy and says matter of factly,""Get the fuck out of my store and don't come back.""

The guy started to cause a slight ruckus about it, saying that he shouldn't be talking to a customer that way, which was meet with a reply of ""you stopped being a customer when you pointed a gun at one of my employees."" The guy wasn't moving and was getting more and more angry. Since we are cater to LEO and military, we usually have a sheriff, police officer, constable, state police, federal agent in store. The president pointed out that right now the guy is trespassing and disturbing the public and that there's five officers looking at him, ready to take him out of the store and to downtown/jail if he doesn't leave now.

Officers were watching the scene unfold and were just waiting. I never seen so many different people from different agencies waiting to bust some jerk's ass.

""Fine! I'm never coming here again!"" The customer said.

""I know and I don't care,"" the big boss said.

**Yes, we accept trades!**

After a while, you get to feel for how heavy a weapon is unloaded, and can tell when it is loaded, even if you never held a loaded weapon before. There's a certain weight to it and the balance is different.

So, we take trades. This guy comes in looking to trade his shotgun for credit to get a different shotgun. No biggie. We do this all the time. We tell him to bring in the weapon, and make sure it's cleared. He brings in the shotgun, and hands it to me. It felt... different. Heavier.

""Are you sure this is cleared?""

""Yeah, I cleared it before I put it in the car.""

So most of you know, it's not very smart to carry a loaded shotgun in a car/truck or have one in the chamber because it can accidentally discharge. Shotguns don't usually have a drop safety and some hard bumps can make the hammer strike the shell causing an accidental discharge. It's illegal, at least in my state, to have a loaded shotgun in the vehicle for these reasons.

I rack the action and a shell goes flying out and hits the guy in the forehead. I follow the shell in flight, in slow motion as I see it hit him in the head, thinking ""What the fuck man!?""

I rack it six more times.

Six more shells go flying out.

He is told to put the shells back in his car and we'll finish the trade when he comes back in. He also got a stern talking too by one of the mangers.

**I need a holster**

We sell anything an officer needs; duty gear, pants, holsters, accessories for their weapons, badges, vehicle equipment, you name it, we have it or can get it. So a local officer comes in and needs a holster.

""We can help you with a holster. What weapon do you have?""

""I don't know.""

This happens more times than I feel comfortable with saying. If my sample size is any indication about other officers, a good 85-90% don't know what side arm they carry. We ask if he has it with him, he says yes, and we tell him to clear the weapon, lock the slide back and bring it in and we can help him find a holster.

He comes back in with a weapon, ""cleared."" We see that it's a common weapon, and we have different holsters for it and show him the holsters. As he is looking at the holster, someone notices that he has a full loaded magazine in the the weapon. He drops the slide, which chambers a round. The gun is now hot, live and ready to shoot. Someone mentions this to him as he slides the weapon into the wrong holster. The weapon is stuck.

Fuck us, a loaded gun is stuck in a holster. Coworker gets that look of slight panic, I grab the weapon and holster from the customer, drop the magazine, and keep the whole thing pointed down at the floor. I explained to the guy that we can try to take the weapon out, but it's gotta come off the floor and we have to take it our vault and for his safety and the safety of others, he's not allowed in there. I also tell him very politely how much of a dumb ass he is.

He's cool with this, and does feel very stupid. I'm can't really fault him too much because we failed at our job too make sure that it really is safe.

So, I take it to the vault and try to figure out how to get this things out safely. I call in two other, more experience co-workers to help figure this out. After some cussing, grumbling, lots of WD-40, and talk about taking a saw to the holster, we finally got it free.

The next day, everyone got a lecture and retaining on weapon safety.

**I'm on the SWAT team**

People come in all sorts of different shapes and sizes. Sheriffs, at least in my part of the woods, tend to be on the bigger size of things.

This big fellow comes in and is looking for tactical gear for his SWAT rig/uniform. He has a purchase order from his department. He needs everything, new body armor, clothing, thigh rig, chest holster, sling for the AR he has to get, new duty belt rig, the whole nine.

The problem? We didn't have anything that fit him.

We can measure for body armor as those are custom made. But the sheet measurements didn't go that big.

Pants? We didn't have anything close to his size. I had to take a measuring tape, or two, to get the guys waist size. We had to order a 6XL. For frame of reference, I'm a size 30 waist. When these pants finally came in, myself and another guy got into each leg of the pants and had room for more people.

Of course, he was offended that everything had to be custom made, that we didn't have it in stock, and would be up charged for the size, which, the department PO didn't take into account.

The horrible person in me was thinking that they were going to use him for tactical entry as a human shield. I also joked with some other coworkers that the department should order all his gear in red and when he does bust down the door, have him scream ""OH YEAH!""

Alright, I think this is long enough. I have other stories that I'll share at a later time. Enjoy!

I once had a parent dump a kid's piggy bank on the counter and sit and laugh while I counted out all the change. But, today, I had a good experience with a parent and wanted to share.

The little kid was about 5-6 years old and had clearly been saving for this toy for awhile. He had his money all wadded up in his hand... like, crumbled and stuff. His mom caught it as he was handing it to me, and she crouched down to his level.

Mom: Now, look at what you're about to give her. What would you think if someone gave that to you? Would that be very nice?

The little boy looked at his hand and kind of shrugged. 

Mom: Let's unfold this and count it out. When you buy something, you always hand the nice lady or man your money the way you'd want your money handed to you. So, that means you count it out, and you unfold it, and you put it in their hand and not on the counter. You wouldn't like it if someone just dropped it in front of you, so that's how we treat other people.

I basically wanted to hug this mom. It took her kid an extra minute or so to un-wad his bills, but the gesture was so nice.

Above all, I want to give a shout out for those who worked Black Friday. Thanks for toughing it out, you all have the patience of a saint. Thank you for making my week, Reddit!**  
  
Black Friday was, thankfully, somewhat kind to our store. I work as a receptionist in a big-name motorcycle dealership, and I am happy to report that the small crowd we had was well-behaved and generally pleasant to be around. Honestly, bikers looking to get a couple cheap tee-shirts and some reduced-price parts are pretty mellow fellows. When closing time rolled around, there was very little to clean up and I could've counted on one hand how many calls we'd received in the past hour.  
  
I was expecting based upon the time and what I'd bore witness to that most other stores in the area would have a reduction in traffic. Seeing as I'd just gotten my check and the banks were, of course, closed at that hour, I decided to head to the superstore in the area. My plan was to go in, cash the check, and see if I could pick up a couple packs of cards before heading another hour down the road for home.  
  
Right off the bat, upon pulling into the parking lot, I could tell I'd been wrong. The zoo-keepers were apparently on leave, because the animals were still there. I should have just left and taken myself further down south towards home, but I'd just noticed my poor and loyal beast had an empty tank. The only way to quench the thirst of this monster is a cool 50$ and a pump, and I was out of money. 'For you then, you poor dear'.  
  
Check in hand, I entered the fray and immediately bee-lined for the money center. Weaving between buggies of children, televisions, and food (not necessarily in that order), I managed to finally cross the thresh-hold and enter the rope lines. That was the first time I heard what I was going to hear the entire half hour I was in the store:  
  
""Ah-scuse me.""  
  
There was no one near me in the lines, so I continued to walk. It was then that a set of talons took the edge of my shirt sleeve, tugging me back a step.  
  
""AH-SCUSE ME! DON' JUS' WALK AWAY FROM ME!""  
  
Inwardly, I began to panic. Whoever this was was out for blood, and it was mine. My inner monologue began to replay the past couple minutes. Who in the world could I have angered in that short time? Slowly, I turned to face the bird of prey that had cornered me. Beside her was a nest-like buggy with two small children in them, and all three of them were staring right at me.  
  
""Where yo' bathrooms at?!"" She squawked.  
  
I, not being from the area, shrugged. ""I...don't know, I'm sorry.""  
  
""WHAT'CHU MEAN YOU DON'T KNOW?!"" Her cry rang out, causing other animals of the hunt to perk up. The sound echoed with tones of going in for a kill, and I was the hapless victim. ""WHERE YO' MANAGUH?!""  
  
Then it clicked. For some reason, this furious fowl seemed to think **I** was her usual prey. She had somehow confused the black button up shirt with white pinstripes, plastered with our black and orange logo and name, for the blue shirts the poor employees of the super store had. She had seen my name tag, but her eyes had blacked out the bar-and-shield logo right beside it. She had been leering at my back, with *my store's name and logo on it*, and in her mind thought I worked here.  
  
Having tried to process these facts and gotten the blue screen, I finally decided to tell this woman what I was sure she should've known: ""...I don't...work...here...""  
  
There was silence. She leered and glared and stared at me for a moment longer before huffing. ""Oh...well I'm sorry. You sho' look like it."" She strutted away, her children still staring around her at me, before I could ask how in the world she could've thought that. I was too grateful to be clear of the situation, however, and instead of chasing her down, I crawled through the line and cashed my check. It was over, I was free. This wasn't so bad! I decided I'd go and get my cards after all. Surely, I thought as I strolled out of the safety of the center and out towards the aisles, that would be the only-  
  
""MISS, MISS! MISS CAN YOU HELP ME FIND THE LADIES' NIGHTGOWNS?!""  
  
""I don't know where they are, I'm sorry, I don't work here."" There, okay, that was handled, he was walking away-  
  
""Ma'am? My son spilled his drink over there.""  
  
""I...okay?""  
  
""...Where are you going?! People could slip in that!"" Came the reply. I kept walking. I was regretting this already. I should haven taken off the name tag and the shirt right then and there, but I was cold and there was nowhere to put the tag. ""HEY! YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CLEAN THIS UP!""  
  
I'd had enough. Slowly, I turned around and pointed at my shirt, right where my store name was. ""Ma'am, I work for THIS company. I don't know WHERE they keep the mop here.""  
  
She just gawked at me like I was speaking some dead language. ""...So you're just going to stand there? Wow. They hire people like you here?""  
  
""I work for [Motorcycle Dealership], ma'am. I don't work here.""  
  
""...Oh...OH."" I left her as she tried to pick up the broken pieces of her life from where I'd shattered it. I was almost to the cards. If I could just get to where the Pokemon were staring at me with sympathy, I could snag a couple and head for a check-out.  
  
""Ugh I cannot BELIEVE this...why don't they have more people on the lines?!"" Because they're all busy helping out other customers...? You know, WORKING?! I refrained from rolling my eyes: Keldeo was welcoming me to the promised land. ""HEY! HOW ABOUT YOU DO YOUR JOB AND GET ON A REGISTER?!"" Nope, not me. Nope...  
  
What is it with people and thinking it's perfectly okay to GRAB SOMEONE? Someone snatched the wrist holding my wallet and I thought for sure I was going to be robbed. ""What are you doing?! Get off me!""  
  
""Don't ignore me when I'm talking to you!"" The lady was close to fifty, looked neat and proper, and oozed anger like a cyst. ""You're not doing anything, go and do your-""  
  
I was done. I was so done. It was my own fault for coming into the store in my work shirt and name tag, but I was not going to be grabbed at twice in one night.  
  
""MA'AM, read my shirt! I work for a **BIKE**. **SHOP**! I'm here doing my own shopping! Just because you have to wait five minutes doesn't mean you can just GRAB people! Shut up, turn around, and just WAIT! Someone will get to you as soon as they can!""  
  
The entire area went dead silent. People were staring at me once again, but I was too upset to care. The woman who had an iron grip on my wrist looked as though she'd stepped in something nasty, and she finally let go. She stepped back into her line, muttering about how that wasn't necessary. The complaints stopped. I slithered over to the card rack and picked up my two precious packs of cards. I ended up in the line beside the same woman who'd grabbed me, so she was glaring at me the whole time.  
  
""Hun?""  
  
I closed my eyes briefly and looked at the man in front of her. He just grinned. ""Biddies like that is why I drink. Gimme your cards. I gottem.""  
  
In the end, he walked me out to my car and wished me a good night. I went home and told everyone how grateful I was that I worked where I did. I felt so bad for the employees. No one should ever be treated like that where they work. No one.

The guys over there would hop next door and chat with us while it was slow, we were all on friendly terms.

I went away for vacation and when I came back, boy was there gossip. ""Greg,"" one of the friendliest and most helpful employees, had been fired. Funny thing was, Greg had *also* been on vacation, out of state for a family reunion.  He came back into our shop a couple months later and I got the whole story.

You see, the store manager next door was Boss' Son. Like many beneficiaries of nepotism, he practically got away with murder. Showing up late or not showing up for shifts, opening shop late, disappearing for half the day, ""borrowing"" things for his rec softball team, all that good stuff. BS also had a habit of calling his employees to cover shifts at the last minute -- an hour or less of lead time.

Greg, as I mentioned, had his vacation approved in advance, all the paperwork in order, tickets purchased, bags packed, everything was gravy. The day he's set to fly out, he gets a text from BS telling him he needs to get to the shop ASAP to cover BS's shift. (Not that BS was sick or had some important business function to perform. He just had a date.) No can do, obviously -- Greg isn't going to reschedule a flight at the last minute just to cover BS's ass. So Greg texts back and tells him that since the vacation was approved by BS himself as of two months ago, he won't be coming in.

BS, being the mature and responsible manager he is, sucks it up and covers the shift himself.

... hahaha, just kidding. No. He fires Greg via text, instead. 

Greg, he takes it in stride. Goes on vacation, gets back, and instead of heading to work, heads right to the unemployment office to file a claim for wrongful dismissal, paperwork and copies of texts in hand. Then he goes to a friend who worked for the city and gets a much more lucrative and rewarding job, same day.

Nice thing was, when all was said and done, he won his suit for wrongful dismissal, and *still got awarded monthly unemployment payments despite already having another job*. Apparently, in this state the unemployment office does a routine conference call with employees and employers when verifying claims, just to get both sides of the story at once. BS was blatant and unashamed of his actions, proudly admitting his role in the matter. Of course it's not like BS was punished in any way.

Hey all,

This is a story from many years ago back when I used to work at a electronics / computer / appliance / media retailer. Sorry it's so long. I get verbose sometimes.

The backstory:

Apparently a man and wife came in and wanted to purchase a refrigerator. They found a couple they liked for something around $1000. They picked one, and paid for it on their credit card. They set it up to be delivered some time a few days later. No real issues at this point.

The next day the woman came back in. They decided they had changed their minds, and didn't want that specific refrigerator anymore, and wanted to think about switching to the other one they liked instead. No problem. Delivery was canceled.

This is where the core problem occurred: She neglected to bring the credit card (presumably her husband's) they had originally paid with back in. At this time (I don't know if it's different now... I haven't worked there in over a decade), we could only process a credit card return if we had the original card to put the money back on. She didn't have it, and they lived an hour away.

A manager was called over. This manager told the woman (in front of two different customer service reps) that, because she didn't have the credit card, we could only process the return for store credit (unless, of course, she made the two hour round trip to grab the credit card). The woman was not happy about this, but agreed, since they were planning on buying a refrigerator with that money anyway.

As the manager was processing the return, he very specifically said something along the lines of, ""Just so you know, after the close of business today, we will no longer be able to undo this transaction. You will be stuck with the store credit and there's absolutely no way for us to get this money back onto your credit card, give it back to you in cash, etc. If you want the money back on the credit card, you need to show back up here to the store with the credit card before the end of the day, and then we have a way we'll be able to put the money back on the card. After the close of business though, there's literally nothing we can do to get the money back on the card.""

The woman acknowledged this, accepted the store credit voucher, and went on her way.

Now, here's where I come in:

The next day, I'm working Loss Prevention for the store, standing at the front, checking receipts, monitoring cameras, etc. Nothing out of the usual was happening, when all of a sudden I hear a loud commotion coming from the customer service desk. A woman is yelling at one of the customer service representatives something along the lines of ""You guys are thieves! Give me back my money!"" It was the woman from the day before. At this point, I have no idea what the situation is, though.

I ask someone to cover the desk for me, and head over to see what is going on. The manager who had helped her out the day before happened to be there. He arrived at customer service desk at the same time I did.

Apparently when her husband got home from work that night (after we had already closed), he informed her that he had already purchased another refrigerator from one of our competitors, assuming she would be able to handle the return of the one they had purchased from us. She informed him of the store credit situation, and he got pissed. She was sent back to try to do the return she was already informed would be impossible. 

The manager did what he could to calm the woman down. She was screaming and crying and talking about how we robbed them of her money, etc. The manager reminded the woman of the conversation they had the day before. Of course, she accused the manager of lying and said he never told her anything like that. However, he had witnesses, and in addition, that exact policy was spelled out in plain English on both her receipt, and the wall right next to her. It was literally impossible for him to process the return now that the close of business had come and gone. At this point, she had $1000 store credit, and you can't return store credit. He apologized, but said there was nothing he could do, and asked her to step aside if she didn't have any other business.

She stepped aside, but then just started swearing at every customer as they approached the customer service desk. ""Don't fucking buy anything from these assholes. They will steal your fucking money."" At the point, I had to ask her to leave as she was causing a disturbance. She complied, but on her way out yelled, ""I am calling my husband. Wait until he gets here. You fuckers will all pay.""

Fast forward a few hours, and in storms the most irate looking man I've ever seen in my life. Face beet red... fists clenched... looking like he's ready to punch the first person who says a word to him. He's not a big dude or anything... but he. looks. pissed. He storms up to me and (to his credit), quite calmly says, ""Please point me towards customer service."" I point. He heads off that way.

I know there's going to be trouble at this point, so I call back to the warehouse and ask for the biggest guys back there to come up to the front. I lucked out. We had a guy back there who was about 6'4"" probably 400 lbs and another who was about 6'1"" 250. At this point, I was about 6'1"" and maybe 180. Together, we were a formidable enough force that I figured we'd be able to handle whatever happened. I got someone to cover the desk and headed over to customer service.

By the time I get there, the dude is already screaming his ass off at some poor 19 year old customer service rep, who is desperately trying to get anyone's attention to come help her. The manager gets there just as I do, again, and tries to calm the man down. The man isn't hearing a word of it, though. He throws the credit card and store credit voucher in the customer service reps face and says ""If that money doesn't get back on that card in the next two minutes, something bad is going to happen."" Well, he was right.

I approach the man from behind, and I see the two guys from the warehouse jogging up. The manager says, ""Sir, your wife was informed of our return policies when she processed the return. There's literally nothing anyone here in the store can do for you.""

The man replies, ""Bullshit. You guys can do it. And you will do it.""

My manager, ""Sir, I assure you we literally can't. The system won't allow it. There's nothing we can do. You need to leave.""

The man says, ""No. Fuck that. I'm not leaving until I get my money. I don't care how. Pull $1000 cash out of the drawer. I don't care. Give me my fucking money.""

My manager says, ""Sir, we can't help you. The corporate number is on your original receipt. Maybe they can do something. We can't do it here. You need to calm down and leave the premises now.""

The guy says, ""I'm not going anywhere. Fuck you.""

Manager says, ""I have now asked you to leave. If you don't leave the premises in the next 10 seconds, I'm calling the police and having you arrested for trespassing.""

The guy responds, ""Fuck you. Call them. I don't give a fuck.""

So the manager picks up the phone and starts dialing. Meanwhile, the dude starts screaming at the customer service rep again, who just looks like a deer in headlights. I say firmly, ""Sir, you have been asked to leave. You are trespassing. It is really in your best interest to leave now before things get worse.""

This apparently startled him. He didn't know I was there. He quickly turns and swings at me. Luckily for me, the dude was off balance and threw a terrible punch, so I was able to dodge out of the way of it. I charge him and slam him into the customer service desk. The other two dudes from the warehouse jump in and we wrestle the guy to the ground, where the 400 lbs dude just holds him down.

The guy hilariously squirms and flails beneath the weight of this huge guy, swearing up a storm, ""Ah fuck you get off me fuck you pieces of shit... fucking assholes!"" This lasted for a couple of minutes. After realizing he's not nearly strong enough to get out of the situation, he starts to calm down and bargain. ""Okay, okay... you're right... I should just go. Just let me up and I'll leave calmly.""

My manager, having gotten off the phone with the police at this point, says, ""We gave you plenty of chances for that. You decided not to go. At this point, you assaulted one of my employees, and you are going to go to jail.""

And went to jail he did. He was charged with battery (for throwing the cards in the customer service rep's face), assault (for verbal threats such as ""something bad is going to happen"" and swinging at me), and trespassing (failing to leave the premises when ordered). He plead guilty across the board. I never heard what his sentence was.

I work in the produce department so that means I get to stock fruit and vegetables and fun things like that.

Anyways, yesterday I was working and it was a busy day for a Sunday.  (I live in a religious area where not many people go do stuff on Sundays)  

The entire day people had been ruder than usual.  I usually have no problems with my job, everyone is nice and I enjoy being nice to people and helping people out when they have questions but it seemed that yesterday everyone was grumpy for some reason.  Nothing big enough to make a post solely about that, but grumpier than usual.

I was stocking some cucumbers when someone touched my shoulder and said, ""Excuse me, Young man."" Right when I heard this I got a little nervous because I've learned in my time on the job that when someone is going to be especially rude, it's an elderly man.

I turned around and put on my smile and said, ""Yes? How can I help you?""

I was expecting a rude tone about something because his face seemed a little distressed but instead he smiled as well and said, ""Do you have any corn?  There isn't any in the bin it's usually kept in.""

I realized that I had been stocking everything else but somehow in the rush of the day I had forgotten to stock the corn and now it was empty, causing a misfortune for a lot of customers.

""I'm sorry sir.  I'll hurry and get the corn from the back.  I know we have some back there."" and I rushed off to get the corn.

When I got back I began to stock the corn.  The old man stayed around though and began to have a conversation with me.  He was a very nice old man and asked how long I'd been working at where I worked at, how the day was going, if my boss was working me hard. 

It was nice to actually have a person kind of appreciate what I was doing instead of acting like I was their slave.

As I finished stocking the corn and went back to my other tasks I said to him, ""I'm sorry I didn't have the corn stocked originally, that was my fault.""

He said, ""Don't worry about it.  Even if you didn't have any corn, there are more important things in life than corn.""

The old man's conversation made me happy the rest of the day.

I wish that every person who gives me a glare or mutters something under their breath whenever I say we're out of something would understand that there are more important things in life than [item] and that being rude isn't going to get them what they want.

The neighborhood is very wealthy, and they tend to be the kind of wealthy that is convinced its constantly being cheated by everyone.  They expect a lot, and they tend to be ungrateful even after they've gotten it.  Needless to say, while stressful, the store provided me with lots of amusement in retrospect.

Today's story begins when we have a workman come in to look at our water line (the distilled water we use to mix liquid suspensions).  We have a suspended ceiling in the pharmacy, and the water line is above it, so the guy got up on a ladder and went into the ceiling.  

I have no idea what he was standing on up there, but he lost his footing and fell, face first, right through the suspended ceiling onto the floor, which is just carpet squares over concrete.

Everything in the pharmacy stops, as we have a bleeding, unconscious man on the floor.  My fellow pharmacist goes to assess the damage.  I call 911.  He's not dead, but he is out cold.

We are walking distance from the fire station, and the paramedics are there before you know it.  5 minutes, tops.  While they are putting him on a stretcher, I notice the phone ringing and I pick it up.

""I need you to page my doctor at the hospital RIGHT NOW!""  

It's the middle of the day.  We generally don't page during the day.  Plus, with current events being what they are, I am a bit flustered.  ""You want me to page him why?""

""It's an EMERGENCY!  And I was on hold for FIFTEEN minutes!""

This is doubtful.  But I still apologize.  ""I'm sorry, sir, but things are crazy here.  We just had a guy fall through the ceiling.  The paramedics are here.""

""Is he an employee?""

I am baffled, but answer, ""Yes.""

""Then he doesn't matter!  I'm a customer, I'm more important."" Yes, honest to God, the guy actually said that.  ""Are you going to page my doctor or what?""

Now I am really flabbergasted.  ""Um, sure.  Give me the number where I can reach him.""  He does.  ""What am I calling for?""  

""He'll know.  I'll be there in 15 minutes to pick it up.""  And he hangs up.

By now the workman is on his way to the hospital and my manager is scrubbing up the blood on the carpet (which never came completely clean).  I recount the phone conversation to my co-workers, who all decide this guy is the biggest asshole ever.  Then I dutifully page his doctor at the hospital.

The rx I got was the icing on the cake.  His ""emergency"" was for hemorrhoid suppositories.

Woman: This is preposterous! Why would your advertisement lie?!!!

Me: I'm very sorry about that. May I ask where you saw the advertisement?

Woman: In [insert name of large department store chain here]!

Me: That department store is not qualified to sell our jewelry. You might have saw an ad for another brand.

During that 10am-4pm timespan, I am the only person who is on two main floors, and often the only staff member in the whole place.  My bosses are wonderful people with a sense of humor, and always back me 100% in whatever I need to do.  It's basically a resort town, filled with upper middle to upper class tourists in the summer (mostly from Boston) who are some of the most self entitled people I've ever met in my life.  I have tons of examples, and this is just one of them.

It was a particularly slow day, before the season really started, so it was nearly noon before the first guests came in.  I'd been chatting with one of our docents, who thankfully served as witness to the whole thing.  A group of nine came in, and I immediately knew there was going to be trouble.  There was just a way that they was looking down their noses at everything.  Those are always the problem ones.  The obvious leader was a ~65 year old woman, dressed to the nines like she was some sort of Kennedy.  I launched into my normal greeting.

""Good afternoon, how are you?  Would you like to tour the museum today?""

She looked at me like I was the lowest speck of dirt on her $400 shoes.  ""Yes, you don't have to take that attitude.  We are going to tour the museum, and it will be free.""

I was a little shocked.  The docent, who's been volunteering since the 80's, said, ""We have free weekends once every couple of months, but other than that there is an admission fee.  It's very small, and it goes to help further education for the local area!""

Faux Kennedy Lady snorted, ""Yes, but *we* will get in for free, you understand.  Do you have anyone more respectful to give a tour, miss?""

""This is our only docent for the day, and if you would like to go further than the front desk, you all will have to pay an admission fee unless you are active duty military, a museum member, or under the age of 6.""

""No, we won't, because *we will* get in *free*.  We are special guests of the director.""  She was completely certain I was going to cave, and the polo bedecked clan of family she had with her was crowding around like they were trying to physically intimidate me.

""If you are a special guest, I have to approve that through the director of the museum.  Let me just call him.""  As I grabbed the phone, she continued talking to be like the was negotiating with a deaf monkey.  My boss said he'd be up in a few seconds, and I held them off just wandering into the building by showing them greeting cards.

There was a firefighters benefit going on that night after hours, and some of the guys were there setting up.  So, trailing just behind our museum director, were two young large firefighters there to help move things in the front hall.

I presented the group as the director's ""special guests.""  The director was very friendly, shaking their hands.  They kept glancing at me, with this look in their eyes like they'd won.  Finally, the director said with a big smile on his face, not losing a beat from his friendly demeanor, ""Please leave.  You have had your opportunity to visit with us, and you have tarnished it.  We welcome you to come back another day, possibly a free family weekend.  Have a lovely day!""  Then he went back downstairs, leaving me with two large firefighters making a wall preventing them from going further inside.

Faux Kennedy Lady huffed, then stormed out, yelling something about being the ruin of all of us.

My last story really had nothing to do with my job specifically, but this one, oh this one...Just happened a few hours ago, and I'll write it while it's fresh on my mind.

As I stated in my previous tale, I work in the deli department of the big-box retailer in my town. We do specialty trays, vegetable, sandwich, you name it - we do it. Now, all trays, no matter hot or cold, we ask for at least 24 hours notice on orders, so we can prepare the next day's crew, and get the cold trays for the next day out of the way. 

Now, onto the story.

Yesterday, I took a lady's order over the phone for a cubed cheese tray (let's call the lady Entitled Twatwaffle, or **ET** for short. Now, ET was polite while I was taking her order, very specific in what she wanted, and was very grateful for taking her order and repeating it as we went along in our conversation. Seemed like a nice enough lady, assumed she'd be an easy customer.

Fast forward to today. It was around 2 PM, I was ready to go to lunch, it'd been a long day (tax-free weekend, and the last day of summer vacation here). The phone rings. My coworkers were swamped with customers, so I quickly answered. The conversation goes as follows:

Me: Thank you for calling the [redacted] deli, how may I help you today?

ET: Hi, I called for a tray yesterday, and I was supposed to pick it up earlier, and I'm running a bit late.

Me: Oh, okay! What was the name on the order?

ET: Twatwaffle.

Me: Ah, yes, you ordered our cubed cheese tray, correct?

ET: Yes, ma'am. 

Me: Okay, well what can I do for you?

ET: Well, I'm running a bit behind today, and I'm on my way there right now, I was wondering if there was any way you could take my tray to the customer service desk so I can just pay for it and go. 

**NOTE**: This wasn't a problem. Our deli is in the VERY BACK of our store, and I honestly didn't feel any issue with running an order to the front for a customer.

Me: Yes ma'am I can do that for you! If you will just call us when you arrive, I, or someone else, can meet you at the service desk with your tray!

ET: Oh, well I was also going to see if you could pick up two cases of bottled water, the store brand, my balloons from the produce department, OH, and two medium sized watermelons on your way. 

Me: ...excuse me?

ET: Well, I mean, you're going to pass ALL THOSE THINGS on your way to the service desk, you might as well.

Me: Well, ma'am, I'm sorry, but I can't do your shopping for you.

ET: UGH. WELL YOU'RE BRINGING MY TRAY UP, YOU MIGHT AS WELL.

Me: (at this point, I'm grimacing and mouthing to my friend/coworker that I'm going to kill myself) Ma'am, I apologize, but we're extremely swamped and shorthanded as it is, and I'm doing you a huge favor just taking your tray up front, I really don't want to take much more time than I can. 

At this point, my manager can hear the frustration in my voice. She stands beside me as I'm arguing with this insufferable asshat. 

ET: You're inconveniencing me! I don't have time to walk all over the store for those things! I need to speak to your manager right now, young lady!

I hand the phone over to my manager. Now, my manager is a no-nonsense lady. She's yelled at customers for being rude to us before, so I have no doubt in my mind this situation will be the same. I'll call her Badass Manager, or **BM** for short.

BM: This is the BM, deli manager, how may I help you?

All I can hear is yelling through the earpiece, I heard a few ""stupid""s and ""rude""s in the mixture. Maybe a ""lazy"" or two. 

BM: Ma'am, my employees are NOT your personal shoppers. Now, unless you are disabled, my employees have NO reason to do your shopping for you. Caticorns was doing you a FAVOR by agreeing to take your tray up front for you. But since you've been nothing but rude, you can walk back here and pick it up yourself.

And with that, she hung up on ET.

BM let me go to lunch to cool down (I get pretty angry and quick, BM could see it in my face that I was about to snap). The only thing my coworkers told me was that ET was in no way disabled. She was in her mid to late 20s, dressed as nice as they come, with no obvious disabilities. They informed me that she just sheepishly asked for her tray and walked away.

How high end you ask?  Some of our coworkers wanted to jazz our days up by attacthcing spoons to the pens we use for credit card reciepts and draw some smiley faces on them.  Our boss sat us all down and explained that we were way too classy of a store to allow that to happen.

We usually give out samples of fudge or ice cream whenever people ask for them, but when it's really busy and the store is full, we just put out a plate and let people go after them.  A little risky perhaps, but we seem to have faith in the goodness of our customers, something i tend to doubt from time to time.  

One busy day, we had a bunch of caramel bars out in the store for people to sample, and a group of people are gathering around them, all of the sudden, we hear a voice call out above the others.

""OH MY GOD!  I found a tooth in the chocolate!""

My manager and i snap into action, all these companies and other industries have been in a lot of trouble when people find body parts in their food, so we wanted to difuse the situation as fast as possible.  Unfortunately, if you find a tooth and start shouting about it in front of a bunch of people, you will start what we in the retail world refer to as a stampede.  

MY manager handled the situation wonderfully.  She apologized profusely, gave the lady a bunch of free chocolate, and took the tooth away and threw it out.  Our whole store empties out, as no one wants to buy the toothy chocolate anymore.  Our manager also dons our version of a HAZMAT suit and removes the tooth from our proximity.

A few minutes pass, then we see the tooth lady open our door and walk back into the store.  She walks up to the manager and in a very quiet voice tells her,

""So that actually was my tooth, it just popped out in the bar when i chewed it and i didnt want people to know.  Could i have it back?""  

My manager was very calm, and explained that she had acted as if the tooth wasnt hers, so we handled it the way we had to handle it if we found a foreign object in our product, we throw it away immediately.  

The lady has a meltdown, ""YOU STOLE MY TOOTH!!  YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT BACK ITS MINE!""  

To which my manager responded, ""If you had been honest with us and not tried to incite panic from our customers we could have simply given you back your tooth.  But you decided to cover up your problem and create one for us.  Luckily, we address our problems immediatley and effectivley, something you could stand to learn from.""

The lady, obviously humiliated, straightened up, took one more caramel sample, and walked out the front door, minus one tooth

One of my older friends was manager, and his dad owned the store. He got me the job, and we were usually the only two working.

My first day there, I got an earful. Some guy bought a pack of Duracell batteries, and brings them back not an hour later for a return. I think, maybe they were the wrong size, so I ask him for the batteries and the receipt.

He hands me his receipt, and an opened, torn, and retaped package containing 2 Energizers, a Rayovac, and an Everready. Oh, hell no.

I tell him, ""Sir, I can't accept this return.""

He replies, ""Why not? It's in the pack AND I have my receipt. I did everything you want!""

My efforts to convince him that returning 4 dead batteries (i tested them) from 3 different wrong brands only led to a massive fit on his part. As he berated me, I went and got my manager, who said he knew how to deal with this type.

The irritating oaf turns his vulgarities towards said manager, who reaches under the counter and pulls out a stadium air horn. In the middle of his shouted sentence, the psychopath got an earful of arena-style hearing loss.

I stood there, half in shock, half trying to keep myself from laughing, as the look of horror came over the oaf's face, the store suddenly silent.

The manager said, breaking the silence, ""You fucked up. Leave. Now.""

The oaf gathered his belongings and hauled ass out the door. 

The manager turned to me and said, ""This is our angry customer horn. When they start insulting you and your grandmother, give 'em an earful and they'll shut right up!""

""What sort of pet store doesn't have paper towels for pet accidents?"" she shouted.  ""Ma'am, I don't work here... I'm just shopping.""  She angrily sighed at me and stomped away.

Cautiously, i unlock the door to tell him we are closed.  He is all hopped up and wanting to come inside to look at and buy a system.  I tell him we are closed and he is going off about not being able to buy a system anywhere.  Now he has a lazy eye and that kind of creeps me out and with the good eye he looks at me and asks could he at least look inside to see what we sell?  I say tomorrow at 9.  He is pleading with me.  So i say ""what the hell, come on in"".  He is almost crying with joy as he motions to the driver of the other car to come in too.  He is like a kid at Christmas and wanting to know what amp and woofers are the ""baddest &amp; loudest""?  He is non-stop, hyperactive like a tweeker I'm thinking so keep an eye on him. 

Meanwhile a lady driving the other car comes wandering in and she asks if it's OK that she comes in too?  I say of course because your with this guy right?  She smiles and says yes this is her son and he just bought his SUV and wants a loud stereo for it.  She took a seat at the counter while i explained to her son, Anthony what would be the loudest and baddest bass system.  He is going off!  ""I want it, I want it now"" is what he is saying.  I say ""we all do"" but a lot of us don't have $2500.00 to drop on it"".  With the one lazy eye going sideways and the other looking at me he says ""I DO"" .  So he starts saying to Mom how much can i spend?  Mom looks at me and says ""how much is this your talking about?""  I say about $2600.00 not installed"".  She says ""yeah no problem"".  Tony is bouncing around saying ""yeah, fuck yeah, oh hell yeah""  pacing like a caged tiger.

So now the whistles and bells are going off in my head thinking credit card scammers because this is the ""poster child"" scenario for this to occur.  But Mom says OK if that's what you want lets get it.  So I play along and start writing the sales invoice and gathering all the various components and boxes and packages and the ticket totals $2690.00 and she hands over a credit card and so I figure OK who knows?  I ask her if I should run it as Credit or Debit and she say's Debit.  Debit means you must have a pin number and less likely to be stolen. I run the card and it instantly gets an approval. I'm jacked.  So I ask Mom how she found us and she says that they had already been to 3 other stores and they looked at Anthony and wouldn't let them in and said they were closed.  Now it is about 7:00pm and they were close to closing time, but they wouldn't even answer the door to talk to them as i did. She said he has a medical disability that makes him act like he does and he just received a very sizable settlement from an accident that allows him to spend like this.  He promised himself if he got better he would buy a SUV and have the loudest bass system he could buy, and today he was released to be able to drive again.  I grew many orders of respect for both Anthony and Mom as i helped them load their new loudest and baddest bass system into his new SUV.  Seeing Anthony so happy was making Mom cry and she was hugging me like I did some good for her son.  I too got swept up in all the raw emotions going off like fireworks in my parking lot between Mother and son and just let them happen.  It was truly awesome. Pure, unadulterated JOY. So seldom seen nowadays.  It really was.  So the TL/DR version would be:  Don't judge people by their looks, and every now and than let someone in to look around even after your closed, because you just never know.

I turn around and look into the Managers Office as its behind the counter and call for the Bitchy Bigot Manager (Hence forth called BBM) 

**Me:** Hey, BBM! Where did the My Little Pony toys get moved too?

**BBM:** Oh god...Shouldn't you know that!! (Get's up from chair) I swear. (Walks out of office and sees the Man and his Kid) Who's the Pony Toy for?

**Me:** This Guest and his child.

**BBM:** What do THEY want pony toys for?

(At this point, I've had it with her attitude. She's made comments like this before and been written up for it. But this time, I take it into my own hands.)

**Me:** The same reason that Girls want Nerf Guns. You know what? Nevermind. I think me and the Guest can find them on our own. (On Radio) Service, I'm helping a guest. If someone needs the keys, I have them in girls.

**BBM:** You can't do that!

**Me:** Oh yes I can. I've had it with your sexist attitude toward Men and in general. Personally, I like the show as they (I gesture to the customers) do and there is no way I'm gonna let you demean them and me.

The BBM looks flabergasted as I walk off toward the back of the store but am stopped by another person who walks up. 

**Me:** I'm sorry sir. I... (I stop as I notice that this is the District Manager)

**BBM:** AH HA! Now your gonna get it for talking back to me!

**DM:** Actually no BBM. I wanted to stop him because I wanted to commend him for handling you the way he did. (To Me) Make sure these guests get exactly what they want. (To BBM) I think we need to have a talk in the back office.

I walk off with the Customer and his son and together we find the Pony toys and I help them pick out their favorites (Dad included) and as I get to the front I see the DM standing there. He tells me that the BBM was fired once they got to the back and that the Guest's purchase today is free of charge. He also gave me and the customer a 50$ gift card as he says that his son has also taken a liking to the show and wants to make sure that anyone can get the toys that they want.

**TL;DR** Manager was a Bitch and got fired for it. I got a Gift Card for standing up to her.

I work at your regular chicken joint, and the other day a woman and her daughter came in. The woman places her order of three pieces of chicken and one side item. Being the good person I am, when she asks how much it is, I add it up for her and let her know that if she were to get a meal, she could get another side and a biscuit for a dollar less. This is where it gets weird. We go back and forth for ten minutes. Her telling me she wants the cheapest option (rudely) and me telling her the meal is the way to go and then her telling me she just wants what she originally ordered and me telling her that that is the more expensive one, yada yada yada. Finally she gets it and takes another side item. 

With that I had thought we were out of the woods. Then the total happened... Now mind you, the adult daughter never flinched for any of this.

Me: ""Your total is $13.andsomeoddcents.""

Lady: ""That much!!! You are taking all my gas money!!!"" (yelling, now)

She grudgingly hands me the money and I nervously get her change, as she was extremely rattling. I just got yelled at because she doesn't know how to budget. I hand her her change with the appropriate thank yous, and I get:

Lady: ""This is all the gas money I have now!!!!"", as she fans it out in my face. 

I don't understand this. If you do not have the money to eat out, maybe don't? And why yell at your cashier? They are absolutely the last people to have control over what the prices are. Maybe call corporate and complain about them? Anybody else have to deal with this on a regular basis?

Reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1hwyyp/retiring_from_retail_tales_of_woe_redemption/) awesome tale of outrageous expenditures reminded me of the few times in retail that I also had customers spending way more than they should.

Working in the Goth Store at the mall in a small town, we had our share of regulars. About a dozen of those were the local strippers- having a well stocked kinky section in the late 90's, before Amazon and online ordering became popular, meant that we were a one stop slut shop for some.

This one particular day everything is going smoothly and the mall is a little dead. Then two of my regular strippers come walking in, arm in arm with a man I've never seen before. He's middle aged, balding, wearing a suit jacket. Um, ok, not our regular clientele, but hey, whatever.

I go over to greet them and immediately notice something is up. They're positively *fawning* over this guy, doing the whole bit- fingers trailing up and down his jacket, whispering and giggling in his ear, etc. It was like a parody of seduction.

I could tell immediately they were taking this guy for a ride. But again, who am I to say anything? The ladies start picking out outfits- the sluttier the better. Best of all, every time they tried something on for him, he would hold on to it in a growing pile of lacy undergarments, too short skirts, and see through tops. After an hour, I eventually started taking the piles up to the register.

After *two* hours I was starting to lose my patience. They had tried on almost every combination of clothing in the store and done a little strip tease in each one for the guy. I was starting to think that this was a session- where a client pays for a fantasy, and this particular fantasy was shopping. I'm starting to think they won't buy *anything* and start sorting the clothing to be put back out on the sales floor.

That's when he comes up to the register and tosses his credit card on the counter. ""Anything my girls want, they get,"" he says, and puffs his chest out. I swear to god, he *puffed it out* and tilted up his chin. I'm starting to look for the hidden camera because people don't really behave like this in real life, do they?

Again, whatever. I'm overjoyed that they're actually going to buy something, but at the same time I still feel bad for the guy, completely oblivious to the idea that these girls are just taking advantage of him. I put two associates on the register to bag and ring everything up, and as they're going, I asked a few times ""Are you sure you want this skirt? Because it's the same as this other skirt,"" just trying to give the guy an 'out'. Nope, he wants it all. 

It takes almost an hour to ring it all through and the total ends up being almost three thousand dollars. It's at this point that he hesitates. Oh Christ, I'm thinking. He squirms a little, and the girls' hands drop down to waist level and the whispering begins again. His face brightens and he nods approval to run the card. I'm sweating bullets waiting for the stupid register to tell me whether or not it would take it.

Card approved.

The girls squeal and kiss him on either side of the face, and grab their booty. I go to the back and collapse into a chair, half exhausted and half giddy over the ridiculous sale.

A few days later, I'm working in the store and I see two women walk in the front door holding a massive amount of our store bags. Oh shit, I think, they're back.

They come up to the register and drop the bags. ""We want to return this stuff,"" one of them says, while the other one chimes in with ""Yeah, it don't fit right.""

I sigh inwardly and go up to break the news to them.

I smile and say ""No problem ladies. Do you have the credit card the clothes were charged to?""

Blank stares.

""Yeah...you see, you can't return items just for cash. That's not how it works. If items are bought with a credit card, that's not *money*. That's a promise of money *in the future*, but no money *today*. So you don't get any money *today*. If you want to return anything, you'll have to bring your...friend back in with his card.""

The women are furious and started cussing me out. That just made me happier, because I now had a valid reason to call mall security and have them escorted from the store. You see, if they had been smart, they would have asked for my district manager's info, and depending on her mood, she could have overridden me and offered them cash. Now, they were banned from the store for threatening me, and this being the only location for 400 miles, there was no chance they could hustle anyone else.

I worked as everything from clerk to manger and district manger in that time. I have always hated customers. Hiding that fact was always a challenge. 

One day we had a customer that was upset that we had charged his credit card over a hundred dollars. We did this because he had rented 3 Sony Playstation games for his kid. Our games had those CD shield protective stickers that were stuck to the back and impossible to take off without destroying the game. His kid had tried to peel them off, and killed three fairly new games. The mom came in and claimed that they didn't work and wanted to exchange them. The clerk told her what her son had done to the games and that she was now responsible for the replacement of the games her son ruined. When my employee told her how much it would cost to replace them, she said ""Good luck with that."" and walked out. 

When I came in later that day my employee showed me the games and told me what happened. I call their house and got the father. I explained what had happened and that I could probably cut him a little bit of slack on the replacement cost. His response ""Fuck you, I'm not paying anything."" He hung up and I charged his credit card, the one that he must have forgot we kept on file. 

A few weeks later he got the credit card bill in the mail and came down to the store to yell at me. I tried to explain that he was responsible. I tried to tell him that if he could go find replacements at a used game store cheaper I would refund the full price which we had charged him. 

He started off with the ""I'll sue you"" and then went to the ""I'll report you to the Better Business Bureau"" to ""I'll report you to the State's Attorney General."" When he realized that I wasn't intimidated by his threats he very smugly said this to me. 

Douche-Nozzle Customer - ""I know the owner, and you are fucked for how you treated me. When I tell him you'll be fired so quick it will make your head spin."" 

Asshole me - ""You know David?"" 

DNC - ""Yeah I know David, and you're so fucked."" 

AHM - ""The owners name is Peter."" 

DNC - ""That's what I meant."" 

AHM - ""Actually his name is Jack."" 

DNC - ""Fuck you."" 

He crumpled up his credit card bill, tossed it at me and stormed out.

Let me tell you, today took the cake. 

I work at an international big box home improvement store as a cashier. I've been there for 2 years and am one of the most versatile associates on the front end; I can work lumber cash, garden cash, returns, front end cash, self-checkout, customer Service Desk and Tool Rental. I recently got a promotion to Head Cash (basically just opening and closing all the registers and managing the cashiers and lot associates throughout the day) and am in training right now for that. 

So I go into work this morning for 5am to open the 20 registers in the store and get things ready for the day. Now, different parts of our store are staffed at different times of the day. Lumber cash and self-checkout open at 6am, but I dont get a cashier in for front end cash until about 8, and Returns sometimes isn't open until 9. Its just the way our schedule runs but it's fine because whoever is on self-checkout can open up on the cash next to it and the service desk can do returns. Not a big deal right? Well I didn't think so...

So this customer walks in at around 7:30. There's still virtually no one in the store at this hour except for the odd contractor, so when he walks up to the self-checkout area with a couple low-ticket items looking annoyed and confused, I don't hesitate to call him over and open up on the regular cash right next to the self-checkout control station. He ignores the customary questions of ""Hi how are you today, did you find everything okay, will this be on a store credit card today?"" and instead chooses to stare angrily at the screen that everything I scan is showing up on. Jerk. I finish the transaction with him, hand him his receipt, and wish him a wonderful day. 

Fast forward about 3 hours, I've surrendered the head cash phone and keys and have been sent into Returns to help the girl in there clear her line up. Lo and behold, who walks in but Grumpy Morning Guy. We'll call him GMG. So he gets in line and I see that he has a cart FULL of stuff- none of it what I had rung up for him this morning. And I knew- I KNEW- he was going to be trouble. Anyone who works in retail can pick out a trouble maker a mile away, and as I had already confirmed this morning that he wasn't the nicest of people, I slowed down my last transaction just a see bit so that the girl working with me (we'll call her M) would have to deal with him. I know, I'm a terrible person. 

So M greats him and asks if he has a receipt for the product he's returning, he says no. She asks if he bought it with a credit or debit card as we can look purchases made within 90 days up if he had, he says no. She TELLS HIM his only option is a store credit, he says that's fine. So M gets to work scanning all the little odds and ends this guy has in his cart. She totals it up and its around $250. She gives our manager a quick call to get permission to give him back such a large amount, and she gets the go ahead as everything is in perfect condition. GMG signs the pin pad to verify the return, and she hands him his receipt and store credit and tells him to have a great day. 

He looks at the card in his hand for a moment, and then turns to her with a look of disgust on his face,
""What the fuck is this?""

I could see that M was a little taken back, people aren't usually so aggressive with her.
""It's your store credit."" She answered politely. 

GMG shakes his head and smiles condescendingly before flicking the card across the counter at her, 
""I want my fucking cash back.""

Oh here we go. 

I had cleared the line by now but felt it was a good idea to stick around so I started fiddling with things behind the counter.

""Sir, you don't have a receipt and you didn't buy any of it on a credit or debit card, there's no way for me to give you your cash back.""

He gets really mad at this obvious statement of fact (really, what did you think was going to happen?) and slams his hands down on the counter, leaning over it to get in her face, and once more says,
""I WANT. MY FUCKING. CASH.""

I saw that M was getting a little freaked out now, so I stepped forward to help her, 
""Sir there is *physically* no way for us to give you back your cash. The computer wont allow it. You have to have your receipt or have paid with a debit card. I'm sorry but she's right, store credit is your only option.""

""Just PUSH the FUCKING button and give me back my FUCKING CASH!""

Oh right! I totally forgot about the secret 'give this back in cash because I say so' button! GMG isn't listening to either of us, so I call one of my Assistant Store Managers in. We'll call her D. Now D is a little blonde woman, not intimidating looking in the least, but she doesn't take crap from customers. She walks in and asks him what the problem is.

""These idiots wont give me back my fucking cash!"" 

""Well did you have your receipt?""

""No!""

""Did you pay with a card?""

""No!""

""Then you're not getting your cash back. We need proof of purchase to do that, and seeing as you don't have any you're going to have to be happy with a store credit.""

""WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!? ITS MY FUCKING MONEY! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BACK MY FUCKING CASH RIGHT NOW OR I SWEAR TO GOD! I DONT HAVE A RECEIPT BECAUSE SHE FUCKING TOOK IT!""

He's pointing at me now. 

Why's he pointing at me?

Oh, because I took his receipt. Wait, what?

""Pardon?""

""SHE took my receipt! I was in here this morning and she was the one who checked me out. SHE TOOK IT!"" 
D turns to look at me, her eyes saying 'What is this crazy talking about?' 

""I did help him check out this morning, but he only bought 3 things, and none of them are are this table. I gave you your receipt before you left sir.""

""YOU FUCKING LIAR IM GONNA FUCKING SUE FUCK FUCK FUCK BLAH BLAH BLAH-""

""Sir if you don't stop swearing I'm going to have to ask you to leave.""

He obviously ignores her and continues on his very loud, very obscene rant about how the store is trying to scam him and I stole his receipt etc. 

At this point D gets on her walkie and radios another manager to Returns, as GMG looks like he's ready to punch someone in the face. Two of our male managers come in, one of them is one of the biggest humans I've ever come across in my life. I'm talking 6'3"", 350 lbs at least. He's a big boy, and we'll call him J.
J walks up to GMG with a HUGE smile on his face, and asks him what the problem is. GMG tells him very 
explicitly how us fucking idiot cashiers should be fired because we're stealing from him. 

J, still smiling, informs him that if he lets one more profanity slip he will *personally* remove him from store property and hold him until the police arrive, ensuring that he's charged for verbally assaulting everyone in the room. 

""Now,"" his shit eating grin has gotten wider, ""Would you like to take your store credit and leave, or would you like to lose it and leave with me?""

GMG splutters indignantly for a moment, surveys the crowd of managers, associates, and now customers staring at him, grabs the store credit off the counter and storms out of the store. 

Best part?

The doors in front of Returns are automatic doors, but they are entrance only, so he ran head first into them expecting them to open up on his way through. He then had to walk aaaaaall the way around the front end cash area to get to the exit while everyone in Returns laughed at his instant karma. 

TLDR: Asshole accuses me of stealing his receipt, he wants his ""FUCKING CASH"" back, gets told by my managers and hits his face on the doors on his way out. ",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,standard,True,t3_1faa34,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1faa34/you_took_my_receipt/,

Today, something happened that, since I entered the work force 13 years ago, has never happened to me before. I lost my cool and I yelled at a customer. Not just snapped at, I raised my voice to its full volume and pitch and I laid into him. 

The event:

I work at a small family owned Liquor/Convenience store. When I say small, I mean small. I have one coworker not including the owner. The normal rules of retail don't apply here, I have complete permission from my boss(the owner) to defend myself against rude customers.

Every week since I was hired in May of 2012 this man comes into the store, we'll call him Fat Hick(FH for short). He walks down one of the 3 aisles in the store, grab a 750ml of Southern Comfort and brings it up to the counter. Demands I grab him a log(5 cans) of chew. I ring of the tobacco and as I'm ringing up the SoCo, the same conversation happens pretty much every time. This is the way it went today that made me lose it:

FH: $15.99?! That's a complete load of shit! Down at [Big box grocery with membership card that grants discounts] it's only $9.99! Your boss is charging way to fucking much for this!

Me:(In diplomatic retail voice) I'm sorry sir but I don""t make the prices. If you'd like the owner will be here [date and time] and you can take it up with him.

FH: You're fucking right I'm going to take it up with him you stupid fag! He's ripping people off with prices like these!

(I'm at a loss at this point, while he's always been pretty rude, never in my year+ employment has he ever called me names. Now, I pride myself on being really hard to piss off. I have never hit anyone out of anger in my entire life and I am now using all of my willpower not to slam my fist into this guys face. It wasn't calling me a fag that infuriated me, but the way he was speaking to me. Like not only was I an inferior form of life but that I was also mentally disabled)

Me: You know what? Fuck off asshole! Take the goddamn metal rod out of your ass. You want to pay $9.99 for some of the shittiest whiskey I have ever tasted? Then get your fat ass out of this store. I am sick and fucking tired of you doing this every fucking week! We are not [big box store]! You want that price, go there. And by the way, I also shop there. It's not $9.99, its $12.99 and only if you sign up for their fucking membership card, otherwise you're paying $18.99 for the fucking bottle. Oh, and you know what? You can just get the fuck out, NOW. I'm done dealing with your shit. Get your alcohol and chew somewhere else, because you are no longer welcome here. You have 10 seconds to get the fuck out that door before I call the police. 

And if you think I'm bluffing, I'll call the owner too. You can be damn sure he wont give a fuck about whether you shop here or not. 

FHL: I....uh..uh..

Me: (picking up phone) 10...9...I'd seriously get the fuck out...8....7....

FH: Runs out the door. 

I called my boss and let him know what happened. He came and relieved me for an hour so I could calm down. 

I know it doesn't seem like much here, but I am a very non-confrontational person. I had enough conflict while in the army to last me a lifetime. 

I walked out the back door into the private alley, lit a cigarette and started shaking so hard that if someone witnessed it, they probably would have thought I was having a seizure.

Tl;Dr: Lost my temper on a customer and having him try and pull the same bullshit every week for over a year. Was shaken up more by this than entire stint in US Army.

Edit: Thank you everyone. I didn't expect this to get the attention that it did. When I posted this last night I was still angry. More at myself for losing my temper than at the customer.

I work at a high-end clothing store in a nice shopping plaza in a nice town. So, most of our customers are well-off and believe it or not, the vast majority are pretty pleasant, kind, appreciative people. Like any store, we have issues with shoptlifting/theft but as we're in a pretty affluent town, our losses aren't too bad, so we don't really have very tight security or anything (no LP, we can't stop/pursue/detain thieves, etc). 

Anyway, I'm working the dressing rooms trying my best to help a very nice younger woman put some outfits together (I know nothing about womens' clothing yet my manager continues to put me, the only male employee, on the womens' side) when another woman, much older, asks for a dressing room to try on a couple things. I open a room for her and ask her if she needs any help. She asks me if I would get her another jacket in another size. Sure thing, no problem. 

When I get back to the fitting rooms with the jacket, I notice the older woman is poking around the fitting room the younger woman was using (she was out on the floor looking for shirts or something). I peered in closer and noticed the woman going through/looking at the younger woman's purse. I approach her:

Me: Excuse me ma'am, what are you doing?

Old Woman: Oh. I was just getting...my bag. I love this shirt. I think I'll buy it.

Me: This isn't your fitting room and that isn't your bag.

Old Woman: Excuse me? Of course it is, what are you saying?

At this point I'm irritated, confused, hungry, tired, and not in the mood for games. Then, out of nowhere comes the younger woman.

Younger Woman: Hey! Who do you think you are? Trying to steal my purse and give this nice boy a hard time? Scram!

Older Woman: I...I-

Younger Woman: I said shoo!

And with that, the old lady fled the store. Purse lady, wherever you are now, thank you for handling this situation better than I probably would have.

They'd ask how each of us how we were doing, how whatever they heard us say last week turned out, etc. They simply cared. Him with his slouching posture, dated 1980s glasses with tinted red lenses, and bald top with gray hair surrounding underneath. Her with perhaps a tacky floral purse by today's standards, dyed blondish hair that fights off the grays, and one of those faces you can easily tell how beautiful she was without the wrinkles (not saying she's horrid with the wrinkles, but). They were probably the most well treated customers we ever had and possibly will have, since they were the customers that treated us the best. I even requested to work Sunday mornings.

Once our conversations and the laughter died down, theyd say something along the lines of ""we'll catch ya in a few"" and then told one another where they were going and to meet back here (the customer service desk) in 15 minutes-usually giving each other a quick kiss on the cheek before parting ways. He went for the groceries (mostly for beer and junk food) or hardware, she went for the cosmetics, clothing, or health products. Each with their own shopping cart going separate ways down the waxed floor. One of them would sometimes over extend the 15 minute time frame, leaving the other waiting in-front of the desk. Not that either of them minded, plus there were magazines they'd read. Once re united they'd combine their goodies into only one shopping cart, and if the goodies didnt all fit into one they would compromise on what to give us back (he usually had to compromise a bit more than she did). A sort of old timer budgeting. They'd check out, and if they bought candy or other goodies theyd rip open the bag and give some to their cashier. Said their goodbyes and seeya next weeks, and leave as they entered...holding hands and smiling, but this time sharing the burden of pushing a cart.

About six months into this job, I started noticing a decline of health in both of them. They just didn't seem themselves. We'd ask how they were doing, giving us a ""just fine"" being more concerned about how we were doing. The misses started forgetting things more. He'd ask if she got insert product here, and she would either say ""oh no"" or ""I don't know."" The mister moved slower and slower.

Jump to 3 months later, cue sad music.

Her other half didn't walk in with her. An empty hand. A not so big smile. Oh, maybe he's just busy or something. Hopefully. She talks to us, her I'm guessing alzheimers clearer than ever. She starts repeating things. Something clicked and she decided it was time for her to go shopping. 15 minutes pass and she shows up to the front of the service desk. Flipping through magazines, waiting for him. How the fuck do we tell her she didn't walk in with him? How do we tell her that she forgot? We don't know. Then a new cashier a few minutes later, oblivious to who this woman is, asks if she's ready to check out. She says ""oh yes, sorry."" She said oh yes sorry! She's checking out! A weak sigh of relief.

The rest of the week I thought about her. About them. I convinced myself that he'll walk in with her, his hand in hers, smiling, next Sunday. I was wrong. She does the same routine as the last Sunday. She waits for her missing husband. Goddammit, I was on the verge of tears.

4 Sundays pass. The hope of the week of thinking about them diminishes. She persists with the same routine. She waits. She waits until someone or something tells her its time to check out and go, her husband isn't coming. Why must she wait?

I request Sunday mornings off. I ask a coworker that worked my first (the next) Sunday morning I had off in awhile about her. ""She didn't come in"" the fucker said. ""You sure? You know who I'm talking about right?"" ""Ya dude, she didn't come in.""

And so, for some stupid reason Ive asked, and still ask, if either one of them came in the previous Sunday of every week since then and get the same ""no"" every-time. Every fucking time. The most humblest, modest, nicest, caring, loving, and I'm sure plenty of other adjectives that are beyond my vocabulary- couple I have ever had the chance to meet are missing. And now I'm the one waiting.

Dammit.

I have this [little old lady](http://imgur.com/6p6MBdX) that comes everyday to use our phones. She doesn't speak any Enlgish so usually only the Spanish speaking employees deal with her including me. At first she was a little annoying but after a while we got used to her coming. Well today she came in at her usual time and saw that I was in a middle of dealing with an asshole customer. 

She approached me to ask to use the phone and I told her to just let me deal with the person i was ""helping"" and i will help her out. She was cool with that but apparently the customer I was dealing with didn't appreciate this and started calling me names. from the corner of my eye I saw massive purse come swinging towards the customer and just smacks him right on the face. i was stunned as I could only see this little old lady just going to town on this dude yelling at him about being an asshole and just screaming out obscenities to the dude. All he could do was avoid the purse and eventually just left. Then like if nothing had happened asked if I could dial her daughter on the phone. all of us working there were just speechless, never have i witness so much awesomeness radiate form one person. It made my whole day and i just wanted to share with you all.

Let me explain: for some reason, in about 25% of women, when they hit the age of sixty they decide they are the end-all-be-all of interior decorators, and if you say a word about it, they will slice you down faster than a fat kid with a katana will take out a straw mat. Them's some bitches. And now the tale.

We had in the store shopping two sixty something women (Cranky Bitch and Momma Timid) as well as the husband of one of the women (Papa Timid). Now Momma Timid had picked out a vase she liked as well as some branches, so Papa Timid took them to the cash and asked me to check him out. I rang him up, bagged everything, and he smiled brightly, looked to his wife and said, ""I got them for you! Now you can decorate the livingroom!"" Cranky bitch snapped her head around and hissed, ""We aren't *finished*!""

This is when I knew this would not go well. But nonetheless, smile and be helpful, ja? Well Cranky Bitch's idea of design is make it all match! All! ALL! **ALL!!!** Needless to say, we were not going to see eye to eye. Cranky Bitch would make a recommendation, then Momma Timid would look to me and ask, ""What do you think?"" The vast majority of the time I said basically, ""Well, eclectic is going to be better than matching, because that way if anything fades or you decide to add something, it won't be obvious.""

Cranky Bitch's usual reply to me stating my opinion: ""Well what do you even know about it!?""

Um, quite a bit... I completed two years of interior design school, what did you do? Nothing. I do this on a daily basis to the tune of thousands of dollars. What do you do? Decide you're right and yell at people.

Papa Timid, I suppose feeling sympathetic, whispered in my ear, ""Just go stand behind the counter. We'll buy stuff, then return it when Cranky Bitch leaves and have you help us for real."" While I would much prefer a world where people have spines, this is fair enough, so I went back to the cash to wait for a final purchase. Cranky Bitch proceeds to stack 4 orange candles, 2 orange vases, 9 orange flowers, and 2 orange pillow covers on the counter. She thoroughly examines the candles and notes tiny dents and dings and differences between them and exclaims they simply will not do! ""The candles are hand-carved and painted... they're going to be imperfect.""

CB: You just have an excuse for everything, don't you!?

Me: No, ma'am, I'm stating fact. If you don't like them, don't buy them.

CB: Whatever! Hold this up *pointing to a pillow cover* so we can see it!

...seriously? It sitting right next to the things you want to compare it to isn't good enough? Fine... I held it up about chest level.

CB: No! Up! Up! Like this! *she demonstrated by holding her hands at the sides of her head*

Me: I'm not doing that.

CB: Your job is to help me and do what I say!

Me: No, ma'am. I am not holding a pillow cover over my face. It's a loss prevention issue, and I'm not going to degrade myself for you.

CB: You need to shut up and do what I tell you to do!

Me: No, I don't.

Now here is where I should point a few things out. There were only three of us running the store, the GM, me, and a base-level stock worker. Ideally that would mean me covering the door at the front of the store, the GM covering the door at the back of the store, and Stock working stock (obviously), BUT our large furniture storage is in the basement of the mall, and base-level stock workers don't have a security code to access it. We had a customer show up to pick up his table and chairs, so the GM left me his manager keys, and went down stairs to load the furniture, leaving me at the front of the store and Stock at the back of the store. Stock has worked for us for two weeks and has no idea how to run a register, he was standing there for LP reasons only, and was to send any customers up to me. And this is why all of that matters...

CB: You will do what I say or I won't buy anything from you!

Me: I won't be selling you anything today.

CB: Excuse me!?

Me: I refuse to help you. You're welcome to wait for another cashier, but I will not be helping you.

CB: I'll tell your manager!

Me: Please do. He'll come up here the second he gets back in the store (this is true, I had his keys).

CB: You can't refuse to help me!

Me: I can. And I did. We're done talking.

She tried screaming a variety of theoretically insulting things at me (ie ""You think you're smart!"" ""Nobody likes people who are obstinate!"" etc), then tried to get Stock to ring her out. Stock, of course, told her I was the only cashier and he couldn't help her. He informed her that the GM would be back at some point and he'd send him over. Meanwhile, I checked out other customers, which only enraged CB more and more. I welcomed her to sit on a sofa and wait for the GM, but that I was not going to help her. All-in-all, she waited 45 minutes for the GM to come back and ring her out. She told the GM I was crazy and cussed at them, called her names, blah blah blah. He didn't speak until he handed her the receipt and said, ""None of that is true. Now don't come back to my store until you can treat my employees like people."" Her jaw hit the floor, I swear. Papa Timid giggled, and Mama Timid fought a smile.

True to his word, Papa Timid returned about 2 hours later and returned everything CB had picked out. Mama Timid came in about ten minutes later and I helped them pick out pieces that would liven up their living room and kitchen for spring. I did ask, though, how they would explain to CB what happened to the things she picked out.

MT: Oh, that's easy. I have her dog at my house, so I'll just say he destroyed everything and ask her to pay for it.

I kept my composure, but I was dying with laughter on the inside.

I began as a cashier in a store and worked my way up to District Administration. After multiple staff restructures, I eventually get placed back into a regular retail store.

*Insert awful management here.* 
4 years into my job, I’m over it. I oversaw the store’s inventory and employee schedules. Management was already paranoid that they were being fired thus when I came into the store, paranoia escalated. They started to frame me for inventory discrepancies and schedule errors. (I’d schedule an employee for 8:00am – 4:00pm… after the employee left, management would change it, screwing the employee and then holding me accountable. Management would let an installer leave with a really expensive TV, forget to check the item out, and accuse me of “shrink.”) Several of these intentional mistakes would happen time and time again for a period of 12 months.

One day I was supposed to leave for a very important doctor’s appointment and I had scheduled myself accordingly. Management called our mid-shift who would relieve me and told them not to come in for the day, then proceeded to inform me I had to work a double… “or else.” 

I snapped.

I began to tell every person present to fuck off. Customers, employees, management included. Horrified, my supervisor escorted me to the Admin Office, where I continued my ultimate fuck you rant. “Fuck you. Fuck you. I hate working here. You’re all morons. You make me miserable and I hate working for you.”

I am suspended for 20 days. Finally receive a phone call to come back to the store, where I am greeted with a termination letter and a final check. Ok. I apply for Unemployment.

Rejected… on the basis that I willingly quit my job.

Incorrect.

Request my employee file from HR.

Lo and behold, Management forged my signature on a voluntary separation notice dated the day I was suspended.

Take fake termination letter and forged signature to court. Me vs. 3 lawyers representing store. 

I win.

My sister works for the Mouse who likes cheese and throws birthday parties for children. I think his name is Chuck or something. Anyway, one afternoon the store received a phone call to book a party. The lady on the phone mentioned there would be 30 kids. A large party but still within the realm of possibility I suppose, so the manager gave her the rundown of the party packages (for pizza, tokens and whatever else). One for $11.99 per child, $16.99 per child and the final one being $21.99 per child. So she ordered the $21.99 package... for 30 kids. There was a $30 non-refundable deposit paid in advance which goes toward the overall cost of your party. The Lady paid that with no problem.

On the day of the party the family showed up with only 17 kids, but used all 30 of the party packages (if you order more than you need and don't use it all they don't charge for all of it) which is no big deal as long as everything is paid for. At the end of their party their host printed out their bill and was a little worried, when it came to $700, that they weren't expecting it to be that high.

Sure enough
Mom: $700!? I thought it was $21.99!
Host: That was $21.99 per child. We explained that over the phone.
Mom: I ain't payin' no $700!

The party host went to talk to the manager who then called the District Manager.
DM: You have to get something from them. Even if you have to lower their bill, they have to pay for the party.

The manager then confronted the party.
Manager: I can cut your bill to the cost of 25 kids but that's the best I can do that will bring your bill to $xxx
Mom: But I only have $3 to ride the bus home.
Manager: Ma'am, You chose a party package that was $21.99 per child, how could you expect to pay that with $3?
Mom: The girl on the phone said it was $21.99 and the deposit was $30!

As it turns out she not only thought a party for 30 kids was only going to be $21.99, but she also thought the deposit would cover that AND she would be getting $8 back!

The police were contacted at which point the party tried get the bus to pick them up and leave before the cops arrived. They threatened the boy at kid check (which is the store's policy to make sure you don't walk off with someone else's child) with violence, because he was slowing them down in they're attempt to make a break for it. Their escape was a failure, the police arrived, the family was taken to court and my sister never found out what happened after that.

This was either the stupidest scam attempt in all of history or the dumbest group of people to ever walk the earth. Sorry for the not-so-climactic ending. The story is second-hand.

TL;DR Lady ordered a party package for 30 kids at $21.99 per kid, put down the $30 non-refundable deposit and expected the whole party to cost $21.99 and to get money back.

I was running a computer store at the time and once a week, there was a meeting of the managers where we discussed changes to the business, things to watch out for in the store, etc.  During this meeting I had invited a few extra people in (I like to bring in associates from all levels of the business, so they can see the managers aren't plotting to fire people, or other bad things).

So, in this meeting we were tight on space, so I moved to the entrance of the room and was leaning against my desk (probably sitting on it, I don't remember that 100%).  We were talking for probably 45 minutes in total when I heard someone getting upset with one of my computer technicians.  I probably had the best team of technicians in the city for their knowledge, customer service and even pricing.  I hear this lady getting quite rude and to the point of yelling, so I excuse myself from the meeting and go out - I don't believe my staff should get yelled at... I get paid for that part of the job though, so here I go...

I come over to the customer and introduce myself, shake her hand and ask her what I can do to help.  She calms down, but then points at my technician and tells me that ""HE BROKE MY LAPTOP"".  Okay, well tell me about how that happened and I will see what I can do.  She proceeds to tell me that the laptop was brought in just to be cleaned, and now there's no information on it.  Everything was erased; all her pictures, all her work, everything.  I agree that this is terribly frustrating, and that I would have to do a little investigating to see what happened.

I turn in front of her and ask my technician what was up.  He explained that the lady brought the laptop in with a malfunctioning hard drive; you know the type... bad sector, read arm scratching the surface.  The drive was unrecoverable, but he went ahead and searched for her receipt, found that she was still under warranty and then phoned her.  He explained what had happened but since she was under warranty, he could replace the drive with one we had from a previous job and she would be fixed next day (typically we order drives in from the manufacturer so that they actually pay for the parts, and the job.  In this case, we didn't get paid because we used one that was considered our stock and also the manufacturer may or may not even reimburse us for labour for this too).

I turn back to the customer and explain that we definitely didn't break the drive; unfortunately the drive was dead on arrival and there would be no way for us to have ever saved her data.  The only option she would have for that would be to send it to a data recovery lab, pay around $1,000 and they MIGHT be able to retrieve it.  I also was able to explain that we did do some things outside of normal policy to speed up the repair, which meant that we straight up lost money to help her out but thought we would get her up and running much faster than normal.

Well, the lady proceeds to lose her shit and accuses us of stealing her hard drive and data (even though she agreed that she could hear the ticking noise of the hard drive before).  I spent another 5 minutes or so trying to reason with her, showing her that her laptop worked now, and even giving her the old hard drive back so she felt more comfortable that we didn't steal her data.  She said she got it, she understood the situation and left.

A couple of days later, we had a complaint in the store against me.  Basically that I didn't even try to help her, I didn't show her any respect, and we were the worst store in the city.  I got the complaint of course since it was my store, and I closed it off.  I record the solution for all of these things and basically just left this one at: customer will never be satisfied, we did a good job.  I made sure to come back and tell the tech that he did an awesome job helping this lady and to continue to be creative in how he solved issues; customer first.

Fast forward two years.  Lady comes back in to the store (she was a semi-regular customer even after the incident) and asks for the store manager.  I come up to the front of the store and say hello... I recognize her and she doesn't recognize me.  She proceeds to complain about a monitor that ""stopped working"" last night.  I take it over and hook it up to a test computer and it works fine.  I let her know and let her see it.  I explain that her video card may be having an issue, or something else.  This was her home desktop, so I ask her to bring it in, which of course she refuses.  I do have people certified (background checks, etc) to go to customer's homes and do work, so I send someone over to check it out.  Video card is dead.  She comes in, buys another, and we go and install it.

Next day she comes back to the store and asks for me again.  I walk up, shake her hand once again and ask what I can do to help her out.  She wanted to say thank you.  She appreciated that I found a way to help her and she was happy for that.  At the end she let me know this...  ""You are very lucky that you did what you did.  The last manager here lost his job because of me!  He stole my hard drive and I phoned the owner and then he got fired.  He was such a terrible manager and when I was having problems, he just sat in that little room over there staring at me and laughing"".

I laughed a little and said ""Well, I guess today is my lucky day"" and then I thanked her and walked away.  She continued to shop in my store up until I left - probably still does now.  She always made a point to say hi, and I always just had to bite my tongue because I wanted to let her know so bad that she was nuts....

TL:DR Lady had some crazy complaint, yelled a little.  Couple years later same lady had a complaint that I fixed again, and she told me that she had me fired two years prior.

One of the many services we provide is that I (and a few other employees) are notary publics. Basically, as a notary all I am doing is looking at your photo ID, verifying you are who you say you are and then witnessing you sign a document. There are other things notaries can do, but that is the most common and basic service. 

So, this frustrated-looking fellow walks into my store looking for a notary. Cool, I can help you with that.. I just need your photo ID. The guy proceeds to flip his shit because he doesn't have any identification on him. I can't understand why he's getting so irate, just go home and get it. But no, he's yelling and cursing and pacing the store, slinging insults to my intelligence and competency because he does not OWN ANY PHOTO ID. He didn't just leave it at home, folks. Since I refuse to notarize his shit without his ID, he storms out - kicking open the door and then making the effort to try to slam it, which is hilarious because it's one of those with the air-pressurized hinges -- you'll push for a solid three seconds before it will close. 

He stomps across the parking lot to his car (from anywhere in the store you have a full view of the 5-spot lot) and just floors the gas as he puts the car into reverse, then leaves skid marks as he peels out toward the exit of the shopping center which is seriously like 20 feet away. Stupid, bro. So then he has to slam on the brakes immediately in order to wait for traffic on the highway so he can take a left on one of the busiest 5-lane roads in a major city. His impatience is obvious as he revs his engine repeatedly. Finally, he snaps. He punches the gas and tries to cut off an oncoming car . Aaaaand he fails. He gets T-boned super hard.

""Now your screwed"" said I.  Do you have your spare?  Yeah, says he but it's only his valet key which opens the trunk and glove box but won't start the car.  Now i start telling him what adventure awaits him at which he thinks I'm feeding him a line of crap.  I start by asking him if he has AAA because he is going to have to flat bed the Benz to the dealership and they can cut the key and blah, blah He waves me off and starts punching numbers for locksmiths saying I don't have a clue.  I return to the store smiling inside knowing I'm going to watch a grown man melt into a puddle of goo in a short while.  

30 frantic minutes pass when Mercedes guy still outside the store pacing like a caged lion and turning shades of red screaming into his cell phone at locksmiths telling him to call Mercedes.  I can read his lips.  He's about to go ballistic.  So now he comes in demanding we take him to the dealership which i politely decline and say proudly ""I damn sure told you not to use that key but you chose not to listen and you want me to drop everything to help you, ain't going to happen"".  Your welcome to use my phone but I'll be damned if you think I'm going to drive you anywhere and again I laid into him for using the key so he would not try to shift any blame to me.  

Hour later flat bed rolls up and drags the Mercedes up and off to the dealership, I know the tow truck driver and tell him to call me and let me know what goes down.  He calls about an hour later saying the guy was besides himself ranting on why a key costs $500.00 and his should have been covered under some kind of warranty.  Mercedes dealers are much better at dealing with these douche bags than I so the service writer says ""fine, just leave it on the flat bed and find somewhere else to service you because we won't if your so stupid to use your key as a pry bar"".

It comes from my fast food days, long ago first-job kind of stuff.  The first job I had which I stayed at much, much too long.  

So... I started working for a burger place, one of the well-known international places... not the top dog, but you've definitely heard of this place.  Anyway, after a couple years I was an assistant manager so, of course, when problems arose I got to deal with it.    I can honestly not remember what year this happened, what time of year... any of that... best I can say is mid-90's (say 95-97 just for good measure).  

It hadn't been a terribly slow night, nor busy... just your average night slapping together processed beef patties and fake cheese.  It was a bit later in the evening... around 10pm.  We had the tail end of a rush when a rather large order came through.  I believe it had come through the drive through.  Easily 10 different meals (really, who goes through the drive-thru for that much food??? people who never worked fast food... that's who!).  Of course, each and every meal was to be made different: with cheese, without cheese, no pickles, extra onions... you get the gist of it.  


OF COURSE!  flash forward about 15 minutes and the phone rings.  cue up the irate customer, Drive-Thru Guy (DTG, lets call him).  Well, he starts yelling and screaming and saying we made everything wrong.  I remember listening on the headset how he ordered and helped make the food.  We didn't get it wrong from how he ordered it.  Not one bit... guaranteed.  Regardless... he says everything is wrong and starts laying demands on me.  

""The people at my office work hard and are pulling an all-nighter!  We can't be bothered by this incompetence!!!""  

around this time he starts telling me where I can deliver the remade order.  Um... yeah, besides not having the technology to deliver, we can get in serious trouble for that.  I make up something like it's against the store insurance policy to allow employees off-site while on the clock (it may be true, may have heard it and blurted it out... or just something I pulled out my ass).  Amazingly, he accepts this.

""Look, DTG, here's what I'm willing to do for you.  You come on back down, I will have your entire order remade and ready for you when you get here.""  

He tells me the entire order again, we go over each meal to make sure we are on the same page.  Me and my kitchen guy work on the food and as it's just about done I hear a banging on our lobby door.  Our dining room has closed at 10pm so just drive-thru was open.  (I know this is pretty common practice now but back then we were one of the first stores in my area to do it after an attempted robbery)  I go up to the door and tell the guy the lobby is closed, he says he's DTG so I go ahead and let him in.  Yeah, I could have gotten in trouble if the owner drove by or whatever but the guy had a huge order and seemed pretty pissy so I was going to try to appease him as best I could within my control.  He comes in, I let him know we are bagging up the last of his order.  Amazingly, he brought the ""messed up"" food and left it with us.  He was still acting kind of dickish but I did my best to be as nice and professional as possible.  If he was going to undoubtedly complain, he couldn't say one word about our customer service being rude.  

So, food is packed up, I've read every item, looked to show it was marked to have been made exactly as I wrote down and compared notes with his so that we knew each and every meal was right. He says all of them look right, so it gets all packed again.  Right before he picks up his bags I hand him a few coupons for free meals and apologize for the inconvenience, and offer my hand to shake.  Now... DTG had an attitude the entire time, practically sneered and probably just expected the worst out of some punk fast food kid... but what I just did flabbergasted him.  He looks to the coupons, looks to me, shakes my hand and thanks me... the first time in our dealings I felt he wasn't completely looking down on me.  I let him out the door and send him on his way.

fast forward a few weeks, and someone at the drive-thru window asks for me by name.  I go up and who is it but DTG.  He thanks me again for the service I had given him that night and even apologized for the way he acted.  

Over the course of the next few years I saw him at least once a week and most times he would ask for me just to say hi.  At one point he gave me his business card and said if I had any interest in a different career to give him a call.  I forget what that was but I remember it seemed terribly uninteresting or just not what I wanted to do so I never did call. 

After a couple years of him coming by weekly, he asks for me by name in drive thru one last time and says that his company transferred him, that he was moving out of town and he thanked me one last time for the service I provided him with and shook my hand.  

****tldr: life handed me lemons, I made lemonade****

That said, all of our stores had multiple entrances. Each of these entrances had large signs with our hours of operation.
One day, after we had finally gotten the last of the customers out the doors (which, as usual, was more than 40 minutes after we officially closed), and we were in the process of counting out our tills, cleaning the store, etc, a call came in on the store line.


Since our policy was that we had to answer calls even after we were closed, I did. Here is the conversation that ensued:


Customer: Hi, I am at your store, but I can't get in. I think the door is locked.


Me: Oh, well, I can certainly help you with that. Which entrance are you at?


Customer: I don't know....I came in from (blank street)?


Me: O.K, what store do you see when you look to your left?


Customer: Um...(steps away and looks) redacted store.


Me: I know exactly where you are, sir. Now, I am assuming that you are calling us on your cell?


Customer: Yeah.


Me: And does your cell have a clock function?


Customer: What?


Me: Does your cell phone tell the time?


Customer: Yes...


Me: Good. Now, if you look directly at our doors, can you see the large sign with our operating hours posted?

I work at a large grocery chain in the south eastern United States, mostly as a cashier but twice a week I work in another department that I can't say the name of because it will give it away. But basically my job there is to cook simple recipies and sample them to customers in the hopes that they'll buy the stuff and make it. I love my job, I love to cook and I really like to help people, be it a small decision about what they're going to have for dinner or not, I still feel like I'm helping. 

Now, it was a Friday morning and pretty slow around 11 when Bitch Lady and her 4 Demon Spawn come in. I instantly feel sorry for myself because I know how they act, and that I'm gonna have to interact with them. They make their rounds through the store,  leaving my angry coworkers in their wake while I cook, and as soon as I get done cooking there they are, as usual. As soon as I'm sone serving her brats I ask her if she would like to try, being as polite as I can. She declines saying that she's allergic to peaches (which are in the recipe). Her oldest speaks up and says that hes never had a peach before now and he wonders if he's allergic too, I tell him that I hope not and he hits me with this:

""I hope I am, because then if I go into anaphylactic shock I can sue you for a whole bunch of money!"" 

I looked at him for a second,  and then to his mom and she was positively beaming. So I tell him that no he can't,  because his mom was right there and she said he could try and besides, he didn't know he was allergic before eating it. 

He replied: ""Yes I can, I almost died and they were *your* peaches. "" 

I was fuming! What is this woman teaching her kids?! I feel like she would be the kind of woman who would push her kids down if she saw a puddle on the floor just so she can claim he slipped and sue, and now she's passing it on.

Sorry I didn't think of you first!

I used to work in a 24 hour fast food joint by a popular club. At about closing time (the clubs) we'd get the overflow of drunks. Most just wanted a greasy snack before they went home, and probably 90% were perfectly civil and hilarious.

However, as many who serve the late night drunk crowd know, there are douchebags that seek to bolster their self esteem and social standing, by harassing easy targets (like fast food workers who have to switch off their verbal self defence mechanisms to provide 'good customer service').
We had a regular who would spend his time hitting on customers and staff (me on one occasion) after what was probably another night of disappointment. He clearly thought he was charming.

We named him 'TLE' (The Lynx Effect - after an advertising slogan for a deodorant named Lynx, which is the Australian branding for Axe Body Spray).

TLE would hang out in the dining room, sometimes with a crowd of friends that he would play to. After being politely told to stop standing on the seats, TLE decides he wants a burger, so he orders some monstrosity loaded with a stupid amount of bacon that he expects kudos for ordering (I give kudos for bacon, not wasted bacon).

When it comes time to pay, TLE opens his wallet and finds only a parking ticket and a condom. He hands the condom across and says, 'You accept these as payment, right?' Cue polite laughter.

Without a beat, my surpressed verbal defences kick in.

'Usually, sir. However, not when they've clearly been in your wallet for so long.'

He was stunned, his mates laughed and my manager at the time had to hide in the backroom lest someone saw her game face drop. After that, some lady (whom he had been clumsily hitting on) asked if I accepted tips.

Anyway, it's rush time and we are getting absolutely plastered. There aren't enough crew rostered and the customers aren't letting up in the slightest. I have two other crew in the kitchen with me, let's call them 'John' and 'Betty'.
Now, John is doing his job excellently, he's ony been at the store for a month so he is a little slow, but all in all he seems to be holding up okay. Betty on the other hand keeps disappearing and going out back. I have to keep calling her and telling her to stay in the kitchen because we need her here. Anyways, I catch Betty palming a chicken nugget and then see her wonder out back again. I call her back once again but this time I watch her. She does the exact same thing again. 
Furious, I calmly tell her, ""Betty, stay in kitchen on your station and if I see you stealing any more food I'll have you reported"". At this she *screeches*, ""I'm a recovering anorexic you retarded jerk-face! That was the first food I've had all day!"" 
Of course this is the perfect time for our operational manger to walk into kitchen and see 'distraught' Betty. He listens to her side of the story (some bullshit lie that I was picking on her because she was a female with an eating disorder and how I'm a sexist pig)  and without even attempting to hear my side of the story, OM give me a written reprimand.

The store manager approaches me, (knowing that the warning is probably bullshit) and asks my side of the story.

It is a franchise, but it hasn't really expanded enough to become as reputable as other places. Anyway, since we resell used items (NES, cameras, ipods, etc), my state requires it to be considered a pawn store so I had to wait until I was 18 to work there. I was so exited on my first week, as I had been waiting forever to work there. On day three these kids who were no older than 12 walked in and brought a few M rated games and some pokemon cards. (The pokemon cards were pretty rare EX cards, so they went for about $40 for all of them). They put the M rated games on the counter and I said the usual,""We cant sell M rated games to minors"" rant. One of the kids (he was a chubby one who looked like he was going to do the Truffle Shuffle, so I'll call him Chunk) took out an obviously faked ID and said,""HERE! Take it"". I told him it was a fake and he said to prove it. We have a bill checker behind the counter (shines a UV light on bills larger than $50 to see watermark), so I took it out and put the ID under the UV light. Sure enough there was no watermark in the shape of the state seal on the ID, and I showed the kid. He calmly said okay and asked to see more pokemon cards in a case that was away from the register. Then this conversation followed:  
Chunk: Can I see this one?  
Me: Sure, let me get my key from behind the counter    
I run behind the counter and grab the keys.  
Me: *hands him card* will that be all?  
Chunk: You could also give me those games   
Me: Sir, I already told you tha-  
He pulls out a BB gun and shoots a florescent light above me  
Chunk: I said give me the games  
He then points the gun at me.  
I start smiling. I had a brown belt in karate at the time and disarmed him easily.  
I stepped out of his way, grabbed the wrist holding the gun, jabbed my elbow into the inside bend of his elbow (Which has strong nerve endings that pretty much cause you to drop whatever your holding) and took the gun. The other kids ran out of the store at this point  
Me: Why don't you go sit in the corner.  
Chunk: O-Okay man  
I lock the doors and call the police. They come and lead him out in handcuffs. I don't like admitting it, but I smiled in pure satisfaction as that little shit cried for his mommy.

They are along the front wall of the store, and to either side of them are any manner of customer convenience and items for sale -- we have a microwave, coffee grinders, our cigarette racks, etc. but the safes are right in the middle. It's convenient, because if a checker needs a drop or a loan, the safes aren't more than 20ft away. It's nice.

Well, unfortunately, for children, safes apparantly look like playthings. The top compartment on the right hand safe doesn't close -- the door swings open to reveal a little drop box kinda thing. We call it the drop safe. That's where you put all your pulls, as well as the drop bag at the end of the day. You put it in a little thing, pull the handle to drop it to the lower compartment and all's well. They're nice and secure because the lower comparment needs a combo and a key to open. Only management and GARDA (It's like Brinks) can get in there.

The left safe is similar -- the bottom compartment has an electronic keypad and that's where we keep spare tills and the money for till loans. Only supervisors can get in there. The top compartment is our lost and found basically -- it closes, and even locks but you unlock it by turning the dial to the right. There's no combination.


Well anywho, kids love to play with our safes. We don't like them to, because they have no business to. There's no reason for people to poke around in our safes. So whenever people do, we typically ask them not to. And typically, it's not an issue. Parents will tell their kids to stop and that's that.

Enter today. Some 14-15 year old boy opens the door to the drop safe. He opens it wiiiide open and reaches in and starts playing with the drop thingy (it's a lot like those mailboxes on the street). After he plays with it once or twice, he turns around but leaves it open. He's still standing next to it. I walk up, close the safe quick enough so it makes a nice clack when it snaps shut and look at the boy. ""Please don't play with our safe. Thank you."" Polite, courteous, whatever. No sense in being a dick about it, most people aren't usually rude.

Well, I walk back to my checkstand and this kid is kind of sneering at me. Whatever, no big deal. Then the kid tells his mom something and she walks over. Oh boy. She starts spouting some shit about me not telling her kids what to do and blah blah blah. I tune her out and call my supervisor over. She tells her side of the story. My supervisor witnessed what happened in the first place. His response?

""Do not touch the safe.""

The woman keeps on rabbling about this and that and such and such. My supervisor reiterates:

""Do not touch the safe.""

Again, more rabbling.

""Do not touch the safe.""

Each time he says it, you can tell he's enjoying it more and more. She eventually gets upset at his repetition and starts walking out, still rabbling. He follows her and right before she walks out the door:

""Do not touch the safe.""

We bust out laughing after we're sure she's cleared the door. She was obviously pissed off but my supervisor was definitely on my side. The supervisors usually are, because they all started out in our position and know the kind of shit that happens.

Well, fast forward like 15 minutes. We get a phone call, I answer. It's the lady. She doesn't know who I am. She gives me a brief explanation of the situation (something to the tune of ""One of your employees was telling my child what to do and I don't appreciate that and I wanna talk to their boss"", etc. etc.). I tell her that I'll find the supervisor on duty and transfer her. She seems a little calm, probably thinks that she might talk to somebody who wasn't involved just now.

I put her on hold and tell my supervisor that it's the woman from before. I tell him what she said, etc. He looks at me and says ""I know what to say."" I stand next to him, and he picks up the line. She explains it to him and when she gets done talking, he says one thing:

""Do not touch the safe.""

As he's putting the phone down on to the hook to hang up on her after saying that, I can hear screaming... and we bust out laughing again.

Everything was wonderful and I was pretty well trained with cash, credit, checks and giftcards. But a big fat woman came in my line and looked at me in disgust. "" I'm in a hurry, I would like to use cash and write a check for the rest""  I told her to give me a second to call another cashier over to help me. 

"" Are you kidding me? If you're out on the floor like this you should know what you're doing. You're just wasting people's time""  I just call over the other cashier and explain to her that I've never done this. She showed me and the lady wasn't there for more than 5 mins. 

She kept going on about how slow I was and how I shouldn't be out on the floor wasting people's time... Etc. All I said to her was "" Ms, its my second day"" and she just screamed "" yeah, I can tell!"" 

Now here is the interesting part. I went for ice cream a few days ago and in front of me was this obese loud woman. We were in line for a long time ( maybe 20 mins). And she's bitching up a storm to her friend about how she hates waiting. 

So finally she's up to the window and bitching to the poor girl about being too slow and how they don't know how to run the place. I must have let out a loud "" sigh"" because she turned around to glare at me and bitch. 

As soon as I saw that woman's face I saw fucking red. She asked what my problem was and I just said "" all you did was complain about waiting in line, and now you're making me wait to bitch about some ice cream you don't even fucking need"" and she turned red, grabbed her ice cream and walked off. 

Revenge never felt so good. 

 This is my first post too, so I hope I did the format right :/

It was really more software sales instead of tech help, which is why I think this story fits here. We offered a ton of discounted software as well as a lot of free programs for students, like Microsoft Office, Visual Basic, etc. 

Students used to just hear that you could get free software at our office and would come in asking for ""the software."" We had something like 40 different titles, so when I asked for them to clarify what software, exactly, they would usually just respond, ""You know, the software! Whatever I can get."" I got pretty good at narrowing down what the customer wanted/could use, because I wasn't supposed to just throw all the free software at anyone and everyone. So, people who didn't know what they wanted became less of a problem. But I still struggled with people who most definitely DID know what they were after... except, what they were after, wasn't a real thing.

We moved around a lot while I worked there, and one day, everyone else in the office had gone over to see our new space, so I was the only one at the counter. In walked an Indian girl. (I only mention her race because she had a very, very thick accent and spoke very quickly.)

I stammered something, and she sighed loudly and pulled out an absolutely massive 20-something-inch Dell laptop and thunked it on the counter. The fan on this thing sounded like a motorcycle revving its engine.

She turned the screen toward me so I could watch what she was doing. She opened up Gmail and started a gchat with someone.

We waited, but the person on the other end didn't respond.

So just a quick story for you all. Changing jobs, so probably won't be posting as much anymore, since I tend to stay off the computer when I'm not working.  But anyways, here's a quick story for you.

So about two years ago I went with a friend on vacation. It was right after I had quit *D&amp;B* and was enjoying my first vacation since HS.  On one of our last nights there, my friend decided she wanted to, surprise surprise, go shopping at the outlet stores in the area.  Fine, I could always buy a few things.

So while she's out looking at shoes and handbags and shit, I wander over to the ATHLETIC APPAREL   store. Sorry, that was the best analogy I could come up with.  I wanted to get a few golf shirts, and some rash guards  (compression shirts) for BJJ.  I pick out a few shirts, and head over to the fitting room.  As I'm changing, I hear the door to the tall next to me swing open, and some general rustling noises.  Ok no big deal. That's when I heard an all too familiar sound. *Snip.* *Snip*.  

Well, any LP worth his weight in Reddit Gold knows that is the sound of someone cutting the sensors off of an item.  Sure enough, a few seconds later, a cut tag falls on the floor and lads between the stalls.  A foot reaches out, and kicks it back underneath the bench in their stall.  So I put my shirt back on, having tried on the last shirt I had selected, and walk up to the register. The two associates are sitting there, a male and a female. The female is helping a customer, so I walked over to the male, who we shall refer to as Dumbass #1.

DBB: Hey man. I work LP for another company. I'm on vacation but whoever was in the stall next to me is stealing shit from you.

Now, I have never seen a black man blush before, but this guy did it.  He suddenly looks extremely uncomfortable, looks at his co worker, and back to me, and simply says ""Ok"".  

DBB: Hey man, I don't know your stores policies, nor do I want to tell you to do your job. I'm just letting you know because they are using something to snip the tags, so if you guys do do something, just be careful.

At this point, the female, who turns out to be the manager, is finished with her customer and asks what the issue is.  We will call her Belle, because she was a true Southern Belle. And I'm original like that.

Dumbass goes to open his mouth, but I cut him off and repeat that I'm an LP agent and heard someone snipping tags off of the clothes in the dressing stalls.

Belle: Well what are you standing around for? Go approach them Dumbass#1

Dumbass#1: Ummm....Well.



Well Belle doesn't miss a beat. She marches over to the stalls and starts banging on the doors, saying ""You need to drop your shit and come out right now! Get out here now!""  Dumbass walks over and looks horrified.  I walk over too in case this person decides to take the scissors, multi-tool, or whatever it is they are using, and use it as a weapon.  Frantic rustling is heard, and suddenly a bunch of shirts drop on the ground. The door opens up, and out walks a young male we will call Dumbass #2.  

Now, I'm tense because I don't know what's about to happen.  Guts get cold, body tighten's up.  As comedian Bert Kreischer describes it, ""It's that moment in customs when your asshole gets cold, because they just found the hash on you"".  And it gets awkward quick.  DA#2 is starting at DA#1, and DA#1 is staring at the floor.  Belle's mouth is wide open in shock and is starting between DA#1 and #2. It suddenly feels awkward. More awkward than farting at a funeral. Keep in mind that the other shoppers are staring at us after Belle made a racket.

Belle: Dumbass #2? You MOTHER FUCKER!  *Turns to DA#1*. YOUR BROTHER! ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME.  YOU TOLD ME HE NEEDED TO HANG AROUND BECAUSE YOUR PARENTS WEREN'T HOME! SO I WAS NICE AND LET HIM HANG AROUND! AND YOU'VE BEEN STEALING FROM ME? 

Oh god, it was amazing. The look of pure hatred on her face. The look of shock on theirs.  The look of amazement on the other shoppers faces. It was like Christmas and Hannukah and Kwanzaa wrapped up into one glorious moment. 

 [This was me the whole time](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m884kuqDmT1qem02jo1_500.gif)

Belle turned out to be a smart cookie and didn't let her anger get the best of her.

Belle: Well, you didn't leave the store with these, so I can't charge you. And until I go through all the security tapes, I can't prove you took anything else.  But I think you two should leave. And don't bother coming back unless you come back with whatever you've taken, or the cash equivalent.

DA#1: What about my paycheck?

Belle:  I think we can find a nice charity....

So the Super Dumbass Bros. give one last hateful glance at me, and leave the store.  Belle takes a few moments, apologizes to the customers, and walks me back to the counter. She thanks me profusely, and tells me she'll give me a $100 credit.  So I basically got two golf shirts and two rash guards for free.  I tell her I'm sorry and she says it's not a big deal, and that she should have known. Shrink jumped the moment that kid started working there, and she just ignored it.  We said our goodbyes and I walked out with a few shirts and hilarious story.

**TL;DR- Sorry Mario, but Belle is in another castle**

One day, I'm cashiering a regular customer and talking about the weather, the upcoming weekend, etc. The bagger I had was a girl in her mid 20s who was extremely quirky, but she meant well.  

So this order is piling up at the end of my register and my bagger is moving as fast as she can while trying to include herself in the conversation that myself and the customer are having. She suddenly gets to a loaf of freshly baked french bread and pauses. She looks at the paper bag she is bagging, looks back at the bread, looks at the bag, then back to the bread, and snaps the bread in half, stuffs it into the bag, and continues the rest of the groceries.  

I look at the customer, who then says, ""Is she serious?"" Trying to hold back my laughter, I say, ""I guess so..."", and motion for another bagger to come over and go get a new loaf of bread for this customer.  

After that day, that customer made sure to ask to be handed her bread. She never got mad about it, and we joked about it constantly.

I work at a grocery store where every friday and saturday we give loads of food out as a demo. I was cashiering and it was during the middle of the summer around last year. If I recall correctly everyone was complaining of how hot it was but I hadn't been able to walk outside to get carts yet because we had been so busy. I just took their word for it.

Anyway there was a brief lull in the customers when I see a very old lady walk through the door all in shambles. I mean this lady was old, like: belonged in a nursing home. She came in and sat on the bench and starting whimpering so I sort of hustled over to her and sat next to her. Ill write A for me and O for her.

A:""Whats wrong mamm?"" 

O:""Oh I just had to walk down from Wal-blah to go to the bank but I didnt realize how hot it was until I got to the end of their parking lot""

I gasped because I then realized how far this little old hunch-backed lady had to walk because, true, we are quite close to that store, but for a car maybe. Thats when I figured out she had to have walked at least three. miles. crossed a 4 lane road and walked back up to our store because she was so tired.

A:"" Are you okay? Do you know where you are?""

O: ""oh yes Ive been coming here since I was your age, im near this and this street.""
She was wrong unfortunately because I had never heard of those street names before and the store has only been opened for about 14 years but I just went with it.

A:""Okay, well let me go get you some water. We have food here too,  is there certain things you can eat?""

O:""Oh yes anything.""

I didnt want to trust her judgement but I thought that was important first. So on demo we had chicken poppers with ketchup and I got her a glass of  water. Hey, its food. I brought it over to her and her eyes lit up.

A:""I'm gonna sit by you for a little while is that okay?""
she grabbed the plate from me and it wobbled in her shaky old lady hands and onto her lap where she ate them up kinda quickly. She leaned over and hugged me and I told her if there was anything else I can do.

O:""I have this phone but I dont know how to use it, maybe you can call my daughter."" 

It was an old flip phone so I found her contacts and asked her what her daughters name was. She didnt pick up the first time but I left her a message saying where her mom was. We started to get busy so I was called back to my register.

A:""Is it okay if I go for a little while I have to get back to my register. Im right at number 4 so you'll be able to see where I am, right?"" 

She squinted and nodded so I got up and went to my register. About five minutes later I saw her flip open her phone and lean into the speaker part really hard like she couldn't hear very well. Good news, it was her daughter and shes on her way. Later on she pulled out her wallet and wanted to give me money for helping her but I didn't want to take her money but she did that cute-little-old-lady-shame-on-you-thing and I took a dollar. Later on after she left I bought a water bottle with it and surprisingly it helped me on my way home because my engine was going to overheat but luckily I had this water bottle to pour into the radiator till I got to another store to buy coolant. 

And then later I found out she left her walker up at Wal-blah and requested her daughter get chicken poppers the next time she came back. She is one tough cookie.

DC: ""Hi, could we get two basic packs to play paintball thanks?""

Me: ""Sure, so which one of you wants to play first?""

DC: ""Could we play together?""

At this point I assumed that another person was with them and on the way into the shop.

Me: ""No worries, providing someone else is coming in to look after your child.""

DC: ""Oh no, it's fine, he can come with us.""

Me: -blank stare- ""Um, excuse me?""

DC: ""He can come with us onto the field, that way we can look over him.""

Me: ""Sorry, the law here is that you must be 16 to enter the field, and besides, your child might get hurt.""

Me: ""Firstly, it's against the law so I won't allow you to do it, and secondly are you not worried about endangering his life? Now you can either alternate turns so one of you is here with the little guy, or not play at all.""

DC: ""We wouldn't come here if we knew this was going to happen! For fuck's sake.""

They eventually gave in and took turns playing. It turns out that they called the place later and tried to complain to the owner about me not allowing their child into the field. Some people really shouldn't be parents...

But this is a story from a friend of mine. 

As a little bit of background: this guy is an older Greek guy who owns a small but very popular local pizza/greek food/whatever you order restaurant. He's been running this place since before I existed, and does his best to make his customers happy. That being said, he will do a lot to make accomplish this. Anything from charging less than he should occasionally, giving free sodas, hell, he's even got a deal set up with the town to feed the plow truck drivers in the winter (we're in New England). However, he does this within reason. If the kitchen messes up your food, he will have it remade. He will not comp you the entire meal for free unless there was an actual problem with the food (which has happened once in a blue moon). And he will not bend over backwards to satisfy a difficult customer. They usually get tossed out. All in all, you would think it's a great place to work, yeah? Servers don't put up with BS from customers, everyone tips, so on. Not really. The owner and his co-owner brother run a tight ship. So what servers do survive the initial training are GOOD. Okay, background over. 

This was during a freak snowstorm one October that had knocked out power to the entire town and half the state. The owner of said restaurant and his brother had been smart and rented (they've since bought one for permanent use) an 80 kW diesel generator that could run the entire restaurant and then some about a couple days before. This accomplished two things. One, they didn't have to make an insurance claim for lost food, two, being the only place in half the state that has power, heat, and hot food has its monetary benefits. 

Anyway, this guy and about 3 of his cronies come in and request a table (place was packed, requesting a table was the only way to get one). They look about college age, and don't seem the troublemaker type. The other 3 order pizza, sandwiches, all kinds of things. The leader orders a grilled cheese sandwich with tomatoes and other things. Kind of a strange order, but they make it without blinking an eye. All in all, their order ended up totaling about a hundred bucks. And since this place isn't that expensive, that's an achievement. The leader ends up complaining his sandwich doesn't taste right. No problem, the owner has the kitchen remake it. After they finish their meal, the 4 take advantage of the crowd of people coming in the door and disappear. However, the server who cleaned their table noticed that the leader one had left his cell phone. She brings it back to the now pissed owner, who immediately thanks her and disappears into the ""command center"" (office). 

He goes into the contacts of the phone, and finds a ""home"" entry. Hits call, and a woman picks up on the third ring. She at first expects her son to be on the other end. Nope. ""Hi, this is John from Village Pizza, and I'm calling to let you know that your son and his friends ordered a large amount of food at my restaurant, ate it and then decided to leave without paying. However, it seems he has left his phone here. So, here's the deal. If he comes back by tomorrow, and pays off the tab, he will receive his phone back and simply be banned from my restaurant. If not, I will involve the police"". 

She is shocked, and manages to stammer out that she will send him right over, and that she's surprised he would ever try something like this. 

Sure enough, leader is back within a couple hours, apologizing up a storm. He pays the tab without argument, and receives his phone back. His parting words to the owner are another apology, in which he ""feels like an asshole"". The owner's response was a good one. ""No, see, you don't FEEL like an asshole, you ARE an asshole. Now get out of my restaurant.""

Important note, I'm a twenty year old girl and my manager is an older woman, but the other six people who work at the store are men.  
An older woman, in her late 40s or maybe early 50s, walked in one day and I greeted her automatically, being as cheerful and polite as I can be. She glared at me as though I insulted her by opening my mouth, then stomped up to the counter and slammed a certain M-rated game that involves the theft of cars. I blinked at her and waited patiently, knowing that if I said anything she'd find a way to snap at me about something. The woman, who I'll call PM for Protective Mother, slammed the game onto the counter again and gave me another dirty look, which I replied to with a bright smile. (Kindness pisses crazy people off more, I've learned.)  
PM: Did you sell this fucking game to my son?  
Me: I'm not sure. Do you have a receipt?  
(Our receipts say which associate sold the items.)  
PM: No, I don't have a fucking receipt. Did you sell the fucking game to him or not?  
Me: What does your son look like? Maybe I'll remember him.  
PM: That doesn't fucking matter. Did you know this game is M-rated?  
Me: Yes, ma'am, I'm aware. I believe it's M-rated for violence, drug use, sexual themes, that sort of thing. Is something wrong?  
PM: You should this fucking game to my fucking son! You can't do that!  
Me: I'm sorry to hear that, is he grounded or something?  
At this point, I'm eyeing the backroom and trying to decide whether she'd attack me if I fled. I'm used to crazy people and fairly decent at holding my ground, but she had the crazy eyes that usually led to throwing things.  
PM: No, he's not fucking grounded, he's too old for that!  
Me: ....Ma'am, how old is your son?  
PM: He's twenty-one.  
In case you've never gone to an R-rated movie or bought an M-rated game, the legal age to buy them is 17 or 18, depending on where you live.  
Me: I'm sorry, but he's old enough to buy an M-rated game, so I didn't see a problem.  
PM: Are you fucking insane? You need Jesus, you crazy bitch. This is the work of the devil!  
Me: What can I say, the devil makes good games.  
At that, I promptly turned away and went back to my job, leaving her to glare at my back and huff angrily.  
PM: I'm still fucking talking to you!  
Me: I'm sorry, but I can't actually help you. If you want to do a return, I need your receipt.  
PM: This is why women shouldn't work, they're fucking useless.  
Me: You do realize you're a woman, don't you?  
This pissed her off and finally made her leave, hollering about Jesus and women workers. At this point, of course, my manager walks out from the back room where she was doing paperwork and gives me a funny look. I just shrugged and went back to what I was doing, because I honestly didn't get paid enough to give a damn that she was a crazy woman who thought I was Satan's bride.

They're minding their own business, looking around at the Disney section while Randall is of course tearing apart the wrestling section. I'm irritated, but there's really nothing I can do. Randall comes up to the counter with a giant stack of wrasslin' DVDs and pays. His total was something like $200. Crazy. 

He carries his bag back to the kids section where his wife and daughter are, and I hear the lady start SCREAMING. From what I could gather, this lady saved up money for weeks so she could get glasses for their little girl... And he'd just spent that money on wrasslin'. 

I would have been happy to give him a refund, but he just stormed out of the store like a butthurt kid, huffing and puffing about it not being fair. 

It's one thing to be an obnoxious customer, but another thing altogether to spend your kid's glasses money on stupid 10-year old WWE DVDs.

Background Info: I work at a local bakery as an assistant closing manager and close most nights. Because of this it's usually just me and an employee every night till 7pm when we close. The entire front of the store is windows.

Tonight around 6:30pm a customer comes in and I help her out. She buys two loaves of bread and as I'm handing her back her change she gets this look in her eye and says,

""So, I hate to be rude... but a few days ago I came here at like 7:01...""

As soon as she said it I remembered her. She had actually been here on Friday(two days ago) and had in fact knocked at the door at around 7:05 with a few of her friends. As usual I looked and shook my head at her and mouthed, ""We're closed"" and went back to doing our donations.

 ""...and I get it, I've worked retail before, but I think that it's incredibly rude that you would refuse to let customers in...""

I cut her off there because seriously I hear this like a million times a week. 

""I'm sorry ma'am, but our registers shut off at 7pm. Even if I had let you in I wouldn't have been able to ring you up.""

She then looked at me with this look of smug pride and attacked.

""That's not true! You were ringing someone up! I watched you!""

That threw me for a loop for a second, and then I realized something.

""...it was friday right?""
""Yea""
""...was I helping an older white haired man?""
""Yea?""
""That's our **donations person.** At the end of the night we **donate** to local shelters and non-profits. That was a volunteer picking things up for the &lt;local homeless shelter&gt;""

You could see her face just fall.

""Oh.'

She took her receipt and left after that. Seriously I f***ing hate when people think that by knocking on the window or making the begging hand-signs I'm going to let them in.

I haven't been here recently due to work and helping my family open a new restaurant. This story takes place in the new restaurant. In this restaurant I'm the hostess and cashier, while also being my dad's eyes when he's not here and just doing whatever is needed. 

This may be a little long. 

The other day a lady came in, she looked pretty normal and with 2 other women who I assume were just having a lunch. Didnt strike me as odd or anything, I sat her down, gave her the menu, and explained all the specials we had, and told her the waiter would be here soon. 

Everything goes off smoothly I see the waitress bring them their drinks and take down their order. No problems there. Their food arrives about 15 minutes later, again everything is going off smoothly. 

She and her friends finish their meal, and ask for the check. Cool, again this lady seems pretty normal. 

She gets to the register and I ask if her meal was okay. 

Customer: no the waiter wasnt attentive at all, she just looked so bored! The food was dry and just tasted off to me! 

Me: Oh! I'm so sorry about that! 

Customer: But thankfully I know the owner and his family! And he said I could have my meal for me and my friends for free. 

Me: um... I don't have note of that anywhere. *(I know just about everyone my dad knows, and yes he will offer free meals, but will always text me or give me a heads up, with names and descriptions; I will say this lady just didn't look like the type of person my parents would know.)*

Customer: *looks at me and rolls her eyes* Of course you wouldn't know the owner! You know what? I'll just call him!!!

Mentally I want to avoid a confrontation but now I really want to know if she knows my dad. Haha. 

She picks up her phone, and dials some number only to say the line was busy. Weird, my dad never has a busy line. 

Me: oh that's fine I have his number. 

So I pick up my phone and call my dad. He picks up immediately. 

Daddy: hey what's up? 

Me: um.... Can I ask you some questions?

Daddy: Sure? Why?

Me: I have a customer who said you'd give her and her friends a free meal. 

I'm not gonna lie the lady's eyes got huge! Inside I'm laughing. 

Daddy: What does she look like?

I give him a description, he answers he doesn't know her but asks to be out on speaker. 

Daddy: Its okay I can be there in about 15 minutes and settle everything or address any concerns you (customer) may have. 

Customer: um... You know what it's fine I'll just pay and um... Leave. 

Daddy: Okay. Well I hope you (customer) have a great day, sorry about that misunderstanding. Redditingnoob, I'll see you at home for dinner. Love you! 

Me: Love you too daddy! Ciao! 

I can honestly say she looked pale and kind of like an *oh shit* look on her face after I said ""daddy"". She pays and quietly leaves.  

After she leaves the waitress said it was pretty funny to hear her say I probably don't know the owner, considering he's my dad.

I was covering a break on front register, a few customers were lazily shopping around, and all was as right with the world as it gets in retail. An older middle-aged lady walked up with a few sundries, and made pleasant conversation as I rang up her stuff and bagged it.

Then the co-worker I was covering walked in the front door. I say hello and ask how her break went, she jokes about it, and continues on her way toward the break room to punch back in.

""She's an employee here?"" asks the customer.

""Yep, she's been here longer than I have.""

""Oh. Can I please speak to your manager?""

Wat. ""I'm sorry, is something wrong?""

""You can't do anything about it. Call him please. Now.""

Trying to keep all the what-the-fucks running through my head from spilling across my face, I page my manager, who comes quickly. ""Hi, ma'am, how can I help you today?"" he asks.

The lady turns and points toward the back, where my co-worker has since disappeared. ""I saw that lady last weekend downtown while I was leaving a restaurant. She was loud and obnoxious, and more importantly, *she was NECKING with another girl*!""

And with that, my poker face fell away as I tried to catch up. I didn't doubt the story; my coworker is distinctive, as she has a shock of multi-colored hair that's hard to miss, and she also has a tendency to go out and drink heavily. And she's an open, unrepentant lesbian, with a very nice girlfriend who comes in fairly often.

""Uhhhhhh..."" My manager too was at a loss for words.

""Well, aren't you going to do something about her... her behavior?""

""Ma'am, we can't discipline our employees for how they act when they aren't here at work, as long as they aren't doing anything illegal.""

""But she was being obscene, and both my friends and I were seriously offended! You shouldn't let people like that work here!""

""Once again, was she doing anything illegal?""

""Well, it was certainly immoral! And disgusting!""

""I don't know what to tell you, ma'am. I can't and wouldn't fire someone for being a lesbian. Is there anything else I can help you with today?""

""You people are unbelievable! I'm going to call your CEO right now and tell him exactly what kind of people he has working for him!"" She left her would-be purchases in her bag and stormed out.

So I rang up the quantity (20) and it came to $10.51. Nbd right?

""Wait! I only grabbed ten dollars worth of tapes!"" The lady angrily accused looking at my screen. 

""Yes you did. You have 20 tapes at $0.49 each. And of course the tax."" Me cheerfully.

""Well that's stupid. Take off the tax!""

""I don't control what is taxed ma'am""

""Well that's a load of b*** s***!""

(I made a joke about how I wished I controlled tax or something here to try and keep things light.)

Now I ring up her books (4 marked at $0.15) and add those to her total.

""Those were *price* right?""

""Mmhmm"" (at this point I am focused on just getting her gone)

""Well are you going to answer my question!?""

Surprisingly still calm, ""Yes ma'am.  Sorry you didn't hear me the first time."" I look up and she's glaring at the total. ""That'll be *total,* books are taxed too. Would you like a bag""

""Yes."" She is finally silent, pays and then leaves.

Now the good. Next lady in line had me call up the manager to let her know how well I handled the rude lady who just left. Said I put up with all kinds of abuse (which makes me think I have done customer service too long as that didn't seem all that bad) and how I deserve a raise etc. She turned to me and said she wished she had said something during the transaction but I was handling it well enough and thought she'd make it worse.

I work at a store that sells a small amount of work shoes. Mainly scrubs and hospitality but some shoes. I usually work in the back office but sometimes my coworkers ask me to assist with belligerent customers as I'm better at dealing with them than the other girls. 



I am working in the back when the 17 year old, part time girl comes in with a horrified look on her face and tells me there is a guy who wants to buy shoes but can't touch his feet.



I'm confused but come to help as the Full Time Manager has gone to take another one of her 45 minute rest room breaks leaving the poor part timer alone.



I see the problem instantly.



The Gentleman sitting in our shoe section was so large that the arm rests on the 2 person bench were digging into his sides. If anyone is a fan of Gabriel Iglasias this guy was 100% an ""Oh Hell NO"" on the fluffy scale. He may have been wider than he was tall. 5'4, at least 400 pounds and sweating profusely from the, at most, 20 foot walk from the parking lot into our store.



He also stinks. B.O and stale pizza and garlic and something I can only describe as ""funk"".



I make sure to breathe through my mouth, put on my retail smile and approach the large gentleman.



Me: Can I help you?



Oh Hell No: I want to try on those *points in the general vicinity of some shoes*



Me: Ok. They are considered women's though, so we might not carry your foot size.



Note: The shoes are technically womens but aren't overly feminine looking. They are basic black clogs and it isn't unusual for men to ask to try them on although it is rare for us to have a pair that will actually fit them.



Oh Hell No: I know but I am only an 8 in Mens so I was hoping a 10 would fit.



Me: Ok, I'll be right back with those.



I fetch the shoes. I grab a pair of 10.5's as well, just to be a good little retail worker. I'm thinking everything is going okay. Yes, the guy stinks but at least he isn't rude.



I hand the shoes to the very large Gentleman, who instantly hands them back.



Me: Oh! I am sorry, did I bring you the wrong thing?



Oh Hell No: You need to put them on my feet.



My face went from retail smile to cranky bitch don't get paid enough for this shit in about 2 milliseconds, I'm sure.



Me: Sir, I am not touching your feet.



Oh Hell No: What?! Why not!!



He's cranky now and the fat on his body has started to ripple and he vibrates with anger.



Me: Because I am not your caretaker, or your personal shopper and it is not my job to dress or undress any part of your person.



Oh Hell No: THAT'S DISCRIMINATION!!!!



Me: You clearly have no idea what that word means nor will bellowing it induce me, or anyone working in the store to touch you. It is against our store policy. If you have an issue with it, you may speak to the owner, she will be in Monday after 10.



Fun fact: The store policy line isn't a lie. A former co-worker had gotten the store in trouble for, poorly, attempting to help a paralyzed woman. I didn't want to touch the exceedingly large Gentleman because he was gross as hell but I, thankfully, had policy to back me up.



Guy is seething with rage now, everyone in the store is looking at him and back to me when a 2nd, large Gentleman walks into the store.



This guy only hits a ""Fluffy"" on the fluffy scale and is the epitome of the jolly fat guy stereotype. Well groomed beard, glasses, big old smile on his face.



Fluffy guy approaches Oh Hell No and, in a friendly, albeit loud, voice asks if Oh Hell NO has been trying on shoes.



Oh Hell No: I can't. She won't put them on for me. (sneered at me)



Fluffy: Why would she? It's not her job and I told you I'd help you as soon as I got back from the boys room, you impatient fuck. (still said in that jovial, up beat tone of voice.



Oh Hell No: *mutters something I don't catch all of but I hear the word Disabled*



Fluffy: You're not disabled! You're FAT!



Oh Hell NO seethes to himself whilst Fluffy looks over at me with that big old grin.



Fluffy: I can say that too him cos I'm his brother. Don't you worry about him, luv. He's just cranky cos he hasn't seen his cock in 17 years.



I had to walk away because I was dying with laughter. I walked into the back, put my face into my sweater and laughed for a solid 2 minutes.

Gather 'round children and hear a tale.  A tale from a long, long time ago. Back when the Earth was cool(er), no Hybrids roamed the land and smoking inside was still (mostly) acceptable.

So my last story was well received so I thought I would throw another one out there for you guy and gals.  

Backstory: I was working as a waiter in a pretty typical restaurant.  We had our entryway in the middle and the north side of the restaurant was smoking and the south side non-smoking.  On this particular day though, I had been asked to cover the host table.

We were pretty busy, I think it must have been a weekend or Friday evening and (as it usually went) the non-smoking section had a bit of a wait, while the smoking section had immediate seating.  I had a younger couple (maybe mid-twenties) come up and the following is a dramatic retelling (cut me a break, it was awhile ago, but I'll do my best to stay accurate) of the following 3 encounters with these people (Man = Chris and Woman = Jennie):

**First Encounter**

Me: Hi, welcome to [Redacted], table for two?

Chris: Yup.

Me: Perfect, do you have a preference for smoking or non-smoking?

Jennie: Non-smoking.

Me: Sure, no problem, it will be about a 5-10 minute wait though, but I can put your name on our list.

Jennie: [Starting to come across a bit bitchy] Are you kidding? Is there any way we can be seated now?

Me: Sure, but the only tables I have open right now are in the smoking area.  If that's okay I can get you seated right away.

(They discuss this for a moment before): Chris: Yeah, that's fine, thanks.

Me: No worries, let me show you to your table.

I proceed to go through the normal spiel and return to my counter. 

**Second encounter**

Jennie: Excuse me, sir?

Me: [Excusing myself from the conversation I was having with a regular] Yes ma'am, what can I help you with?

Jennie: It reeks by our table.

Me [Genuinely concerned] I'm terribly sorry. Would you like me to come check on what it might be?

Jennie: [Huffy, hand on left hip, right hip stuck out, gesticulating with right hand] I know what it is. It reeks of cigarettes.

Me: [Holding back bewildered amusement] Well, ma'am, it *is* the smoking section.

Jennie: But it smells really strongly of cigarettes!

Me: Ma'am, I apologize again, but I'm confused; what do you want me to do?

Jennie: It reeks and there is smoke everywhere.

It's at this point that I look over to check the area and make sure there's not a fire or something.  There was one person smoking.  In the smoking section. ONE.  I get if you are aggravated by smoke it being a problem, but you **CHOSE** to sit there.

Me: I'll tell you what, if you would like I can put you on the list for a table and we will move you when there is an opening. Is that okay?

I usually wouldn't have offered this with a pretty full house as they were already taking up a table.  Typically I would have told them they would have to come back up front and wait then, but I didn't want to jeopardize their waiters tips.

Jennie: Ugh, fine.

After about 10 minutes we get them over to a non-smoking table and we all move on with our days, right?

**Third Interaction**

Chris: Excuse me?

I had no one up front at this point and turn my attention to him.

Me: Yes sir, how may I help you?

Chris: [Gesturing toward his table] Yeah, my girlfriend said her food smells funny.

Me: [After looking where he pointed and understanding the situation more fully] Is there something that I can do? Would you like me to have it re-made? Have you spoken to your waiter? (I was really confused as to why they were coming to me with a food related issue.

Chris: I don't know where he is.  She says it smells like smoke.

Me: Is it possible that they smell is still lingering in her nose after being in the smoking section?

Chris: [Looking downtrodden] ...yeah.

Me: Okay... um...

Chris: Look, I'm going to level with you. She's being kind of a bitch tonight.  Can I just pay you now and then get boxes?

I am left at this point to assume he wanted her to think he got it for free and just avoid the fight.

Me: Um... sure... 

I called over his waiter, got the check from him and rang through his card.  He actually left his server a pretty sizeable tip and apologized again.  But as he is signing his slip, up comes - 

Jennie: What are you doing?

Chris: I'm paying so we can leave.

Jennie: Are you fucking kidding?!

That actually caught me off-guard as even though she had been a horrible patron she didn't look like the ""swearing in public"" type.

Chris: Calm down, we're leaving.

Jennie: No! You shouldn't pay for this fucking shit! (Quite the mouth on her in my memory) It smelled and tasted like crap!

I was getting ready to start damage control when - 

Chris: Shut the fuck up! Jesus. Screw this. [To me] Have a good day man. Sorry about her.

He then took her by the arm and walked out.

I was never more awed/ecstatic about a customers response.

In college, I did about four years as a cashier working the nightshift at Safeway.  Thing is, I'm just not a people person - I can't stand them!  So retail wasn't a good fit for me.  I could never believe how rude some people were, and had a lot of fun trying to give as much back to them as possible without getting fired.

I had plenty of chances to try this, but only managed to pull off the whole thing twice in my career.

Seems very weird, but multiple times a night, every night, I'd ring up someone's groceries and tell them the total, something like ""That'll be $82.04, sir!"" only to be presented with $82.00, as if that was close enough.  Do I look like Mr. Safeway himself?  Are we playing Let's Make a Deal?  

So I'd usually respond with ""Uh...it's not 'best offer,' sir.  I do need that four cents.""

Sometimes they'd ask if I could take it out of the little coin jar, which was great because I got to pull holier-than-thou on them:  ""Gasp!  That's for CHARITY!""  as loud as I could.  That always ended it, but it felt like a cheap win.

But the two golden wins that I mentioned?  Those guys huffed and puffed and rolled their eyes and couldn't BELIEVE I was going to waste their very important time insisting on those last four measly cents.  So they both dug into their pockets and took their time and very very slowly counted out four pennies onto the counter like they were doing me a HUGE favor, one - two - three - four, while sneering at me.

Both times, I took those four pennies by sweeping them off the counter into one hand, and intentionally drop a couple onto the floor, while saying ""Thank you!"" and smiling.  Then I'd ring them up and finish the order and give them their receipt, all while acting like I hadn't noticed I'd dropped a couple of their precious pennies.

Now, it's money, and people are conditioned to think it's important.  So they started off sneering like they'd won a big victory with their slow penny count, but then they'd start to shuffle their feet and frown and worry that I hadn't noticed those dropped cents.  Finally, they'd begrudgingly offer ""...uh, you know you dropped a couple.""  

At which point I'd shrug and say ""So what?  It's just a few cents.  NEXT!""

That's not my problem!,Echo104b,1011,184,132,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/18yi72/copyright_thats_not_my_problem/,"Allow me to start by saying this is my favorite subreddit. I've been lurking for quite some time but never had any stories worth sharing.

Until now.

I work for an office supply retail chain that may or may not be named after a metallic paper fastener. Let's call it Paperclips.

So I am the department head of the Paperclips Copy and Print center. I'm just having a slow day, which is strange in the middle of tax season, when I get a call. I pick up the phone and give my usual ""Thank you for calling Paperclips copy center, Echo104b speaking, can I help you?""

""I just sent a job into your online submission and I want to make sure it came through."" he says calmly.

""Can I get your name?""

He gives me his info and I log into our order retrieval system. He placed the order less than 2 minutes ago. I download the file he needs printed. While that's happening, I look at the order specs. Cheapest paper, double sided, 3 hole punch. That's a red flag. Those instructions are usually for a textbook of some kind, and unless the customer has a copyright release from the publisher, I'm not allowed to print textbooks.

The file download finishes and I look at it. Yep. Textbooks. And right in the middle of page 2 is an enormous block of text prefaced by ""(C) 20XX publishing company INC.""

About 2 minutes have passed at this point and I pick up the phone once again, and prep to give him the usual copyright denial. This happens about three or four times a day and the customers, while disappointed, are usually understanding. Not this guy.

""Sir? I'm glad you called. I'm not allowed to print the file you uploaded because it has a copyright mark on page two. Do you have a copyright release form that would allow us to print this?""

""I don't need one of those, I get these printed all the time.""

""Well sir, this book is copyright and by printing it and selling you the prints, Paperclips will be profiting from the sale of copywriten material and I can't allow that.""

""So the other copies I've gotten from you are illegal? I should report you guys then.""

I do a customer order history search by his name and the last order he placed with us was two years ago. It was canceled with a reason given of ""problem with uploaded file: copyright""

Bingo. This guy is full of crap and he's mad he didn't get away with it. I call his bluff. We've no record of any prior orders being processed and if he did anything off the books through us, Paperclips has Plausible Deniablilty.

What do I do? 

Call his bluff.

""What was the name of the associate that made the copies for you? If we have an associate breaking copyright, I need to review the copy procedure with him.""

""I don't remember. I'm reporting Paperclips for copyright infringement and calling your corporate office to report you for your terrible service.""

""There's nothing I can do to stop you from doing that. Go ahead. They'll tell you the same thing.""

""This is bullshit!""

This goes back and forth for s few minutes and at this point I'm tired of it. Time to use shock tactics. 

""Name: John Q. Customer. Phone number: 123-456-7890. Last order 10/XX/200X. Canceled due to copyright infringement. Previous order 08/XX/200X canceled due to copyright infringement. Membership number XXXXXXXXXX lifetime spending total $XXX.XX..."" 

I go on for a little bit longer, reading off his entire customer history. A few minutes later, I'm finished and the line is silent.

He quietly speaks up ""I'm sorry, good day"" and meekly hangs up the phone.

I come here with a short tale of an exemplary staff member that unsurprisingly did not last long within our company.

Many moons ago I used to work for a well known UK High street health and beauty chain. Our store in particular was a very small store and as such we only usually had three members of staff working on sundays as that was our least busy day. 

This sunday was no different, in the store was myself, the assistant manager and lets call her ""Kay"". Kay was an extremely large girl in her late teens, she was one of the laziest and rudest staff members we had and she would frequently sit her large behind onto a foot stool and shuffle around make up for her entire shift rather than be useful in any single sense.

The day was a normal day and all three of us were there for the 10 - 4 shift. Kay had gone for her break at 12 because she couldn't ""last another minute without some food to keep her going"". This was pretty normal and I was more than happy to go for my break at 1.

Anyway, she rolled back to the shop floor 15 minutes too long from her break and I went for my lunch at 1 o'clock. As per my usual routine I went to the local supermarket to grab a sandwich and the manager had gone out back to do some paper work. This left Kay to man the shop for the 30 minutes I would be gone.

After devouring my sandwich and having a quick stroll to clear my head I walk back into the shop. 

I went to go tell Kay that I would be back out in a second as I just needed to dump my phone in my locker. But Kay was not at the tills as I expected she would be. 

Oh.. well theres a few people waiting at the tills but maybe shes gone to do a price check or something?

I walk round the store and eventally end up on the makeup aisle where a shock was in store for me.

The displays normally brimming full with expensive products were barren.

Strewn across the floor was a single blusher kit which had cracked and thrown it's contents across the aisle.

Shit.

I panicked and went to find the manager out back and told her what had happened. I was sent back to the front to go deal with the customers on the tills and a few minutes later the manager comes to the front and informs me that she had found Kay watching tv in the staff room having her second lunch.

Kay had decided that when I was out of the store on my lunch and the manager was in the office it would be the perfect time to have a break because noone would tell her to go do some work. 

Her laziness and desire to contantly stuff chocolate into her maw had cost our store several thousands of pounds in stock loss.

Amazingly.

Just purely amazingly, she wasn't immediately fired.

TL;DR Lazy coworker desire to stuff face means she leaves the entire shop unmanned for nearly 30 minutes. Thieves have a field day.

EDIT: For those asking on a follow up or more stories, honestly I'm sorry to say that the repercussions were not all that severe. She managed to blag her way out of it somehow with a written warning.

However for some closure, she was fired about a month later when our store manager caught her eating stolen crisps in the bathroom.

*This became way longer than I had expected, but you can learn a trick or two about talking to your insurance company.*

First a little introduction;

This story is from a few years ago when I worked for a big insurance company *somewhere* in Europe, I was 20 at the time. Because the company wanted to have happy customers and quickly expedite claims, I rarely had to ask my supervisor for payment approval, which was nice. If I deemed it fair I could pay ~$3000 without asking my supervisor. If I needed to pay between ~$3000 and ~$15000 I had to mention it to my supervisor and above $15000 I needed approval. This was nice because my employer trusted me and my coworkers with a lot of money and 99% of the time they would support our decision. It was overall an awesome place to work!

One thing I learned pretty quickly was that people tend to overstate things worth and tried to get more money from me because they think I don't know what things are worth. Sometimes people got angry because *I’m too young to know how valuable their stuff is*...

*Now to the story;*

In this case a customer calls and tell me his Mac is broken. 
I'm immediately alert because; 

- 1. I know my Mac's; both older and newer and know what they are worth.
- 2. People ALWAYS assume their Mac is at least worth twice as much as it is. 

I start out by smalltalking with the guy. I'm always starting out with this, since I want to get information about the computer without directly asking. People tend to understate age and use or wear and overstate price, when asking directly. To avoid this I’m trying to be friendly and make him tell me the details without asking. This might seem cruel, but I have to get him to tell me the truth.

So his Mac has water damage, this is understandable since there was a big flood the week before and I accept the damage claim. The computer is about 4 years old so I [look it up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Macintosh_models_by_case_type) while continuing to talk to him. Since it is a desktop I assume this is an Aluminum iMac Core 2. 

I ask him what model it is and he says it is a G4. Here I stop him and ask how he can have a 4 year old [G4 Power Mac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Mac_G4). 

He confesses that he bought 4 years ago, which I tell him makes it at least 7 years old, possible 13 years old. 

At this time I'm already thinking that he won’t get much for his computer. 

He tells me it is worth $2000 and that he would like the money ASAP. 
When people tell me they want money ASAP, alarm bells goes off and, I slow down a bit. His G4 is definitely not worth $2000 and I offer him a replacement G4, which I can get for him on *craigslist-like-site*. This is normal practice; I can try and replace the broken object or give him cash. 

Most people chose cash (understandable). 

I also explain that if he wants cash I can only give him $100. This, I explain, is based on the age of the computer (which I set at 9 years) and the original price. With an estimated original price of $2500 I can subtract 90% because it is electronic and over 9 years old, meaning I can give him $225. But he also have a *self-risk* of $125, that he has to pay every time he has a damage claim. 

He is, of course, not happy. 

If you lost your fine working computer and was offered $100 you wouldn't be happy too. But you have to understand that I can only give compensation for actual hardware, not sentimental value. 

I try and explain that I can't do anything else for him and that I suggest he take the offer of a replacement computer, which I will arrange to have shipped directly to his door. 

He then goes on and explain to me that he need it right now and that he would like to go buy one ASAP, because he can't work without it. 
I become alert by this statement because, if it is a work PC then I can't give him anything at all, since it is a personal insurance and not company insurance.

I directly ask him, even though I could already now reject the claim (on the basis that it is a work computer), if he uses it for work and what kind of work he does. He denies it is for his job and says personal work in general, I accept this because I’m a nice person :)

He again tries to convince me it is worth a lot more and I tell him the price reduction and that I know my fair share of Mac's, which basically means he won't have any luck with me. He sounds pretty bumped out and most of my coworkers would probably have giving him a bit more, since they aren't familiar with Mac's. 

He is not happy at all and puts his mom on (SURPRISE!). I had to mute the phone and say WTF to my coworker next to me. I can see that he is in his thirties and I cannot understand how he believes that his mother can convince me to pay more.

She starts to complain and tell me that his son can't work without his computer. 
Again I ask what kind of work he does on this computer and I hear the guy in the background tell her that he doesn't use it for work.
I laugh to myself and tell her the same as I told him. 

He comes back on and I tell him he can talk to my supervisor who will offer him the same deal. Since I offer for him to talk to my supervisor I seem like the big guy and he believes me. My supervisor who has no idea about Mac's would trust my judgment and tell him the same.

He reluctantly accepts and I transfer the $100 to his bank account ASAP.

I tell the story to my supervisor, who laughs and say *it is good to have young people who knows about electronics*.

Just another day at the office!

I have a lot more stories from my days in insurance; if this one is well received I will post more!

""What were they saying about me?""

""Sir, they really want me to call you a fat-ass. They said they'd give me $10.""

As usual, there will be a TL;DR at the bottom. Strap in!

Right after high school, I took a break from restaurant work to go into the then very new field of video rental. I worked for Blockbuster for a while, helping new stores get set up and staffed. After about a year of this, a local company trying to compete was opening up new stores near existing 'Buster locations. They were cherry picking employees for the management of these new stores. I was offered a ridiculous salary and quite a bit of authority. 

The new company was just a reskinned Blockbuster. same product, same pricing, just different colors. There was one thing a little different, though.

Porn.

This was in Cincinnati, Ohio. A very conservative city. If you've ever seen the film, ""The People VS Larry Flynt"", the man who prosecuted Flynt for obscenity, Simon Leis, was now the sheriff. And he still had a hard on for smut. It was illegal to sell Playboy, no adult films could be had, and his group of obscenity watchdogs patrolled business, looking for filth. 

Blockbuster immediately rolled over and showed their cute, ""family friendly"" bellies. They never carried porn, they refused to stock titles with the new NC 17 rating, and anything that was disliked was pulled off the shelves. They got rid of ""Last Temptation of Christ"" because of the letter writing campaign this group staged. Terroristic threats of arson and vandalism were the norm. 

This new store showed some balls. They carried NC 17, and while they didn't have hardcore porn, they did have a section called, ""Private Screenings"". It was mostly softcore offerings like ""Emmanuel"", and ""Best Chest In The West"". It was all stuff you could find in any R rated movie. But the titles were sometimes a little salacious, and people would see the tapes, shelved spine out instead of flat so no one could see the covers, and wig out. Once or twice a week, someone would come in and blow steam about us being smut peddlers. I would ask for their card, and cut it up, wishing them the best in their future rental endeavors. 

At first, I was amused by the steady stream of customers these tapes brought in. It was squeaky clean smut, something you could get your hands on locally. Customers would be waiting in the lot when I turned up to open. When I would unlock the doors, they'd get their lite porn, cash out, and bolt. As if there were some masturbation emergency going on. One guy would rent three, come back four hours later, and get three more. He did this four days a week for my entire time there. 

Occasionally, people would forget about returning their porn. Nothing was more enjoyable than the daily calls of shame. I would retire to the office with my list, and start dialing. 

Me: Hello. Is Mr X there?

Her: This is Mrs. X.

Me: Hi, this is toxlab from NotBuster Video. I'm calling about an overdue tape on your account.

Her: We haven't been in there in weeks! We don't have any movies!

Me: Well, someone on your account rented ""Prison Island Bitches"" on Friday night.

Her:(in the background, a tiny fire bursts into an inferno) OH. I'LL MAKE SURE YOU GET THAT RIGHT AWAY!


I'm shelving tapes one day, and notice that we have a copy of ""Caligula"" on the private screenings shelf. If you've never heard of it, it's a film starring Malcom MacDowell and other respected actors. It's about the mad Roman emperor, and his wild orgies and other bizarre behavior. After it was filmed, producer Bob Guccione (of Penthouse fame) decided that what the film needed was more dong. So he shot huge, epic hard core orgy scenes. He essentially inserted well known actors into a porno flick. This did not go over well in hollywood. 

I take it home. As soon as it starts, I realize it's the hardcore cut of the film. Distributing this in our city will get you jail time. When I return it, I leave it in the office. The next day, I start looking for other titles that might not make the cut. I inform my employers. Some movies are easy to rule out, just by the distribution titles. Others, not so easy. We had a copy of ""Party at Kitty and Studs"", the porno movie featuring a young Sylvester Stallone. The movie was softcore, but the trailers before it were hard. There are a few dozen titles that I find doubtful. What should we do?

The district manager doesn't want to shut the section down. Complaints aside, the tiny section brings in a LOT of revenue. And usually, people grab a couple new releases before they say, ""Hey, as long as I'm here, I'll grab ""No Muff Too Tough"". 

How do we solve this problem? The solution is that we must screen EVERY LAST ONE of these tapes. We don't have to take notes as the plot develops, just put it on fast forward and be on the lookout for arcing ropes of jism. 

This duty falls to me. 

The manager above me was a 40 year old virgin. He was scandalized when the DM suggested he do it. He had never seen a dirty movie, and didn't know where the lines were drawn. He was an innocent soul. He also had a shrine to The Little Mermaid in his house, but that's neither here nor there.

Every night, I would fill my book bag with tapes to check. TV on. Sound off. One good pile, one bad pile. Away we go.

Asking an 18 year old to look for porn is a good idea. You have a preternatural sense about boobies. You are always happy to see 'em, and you're always ready for more. On occasion, the fast forwarded drama would prove too intriguing and I had to return to regular speed. ""Wait a minute. First she was in a classroom, blowing a teacher, and now she's in prison, having a lesbian three way? What happened here?"" 

This continued for about a month I believe I found a total of twelve tapes that could get us in trouble. We pitched them and continue on our merry way.

One afternoon, a gentleman came in and discovered our naughty treasure trove. He was affronted.

He: How dare you, corruption of youth, jesus is weeping, etc. etc.

I: I can assure you, sir, that every tape in that section meets community standards. The covers may be a little vulgar, but the contents merit no more than an R rating.

He: HOW DO YOU KNOW? HAVE YOU SEEN EVERY MOVIE IN THE STORE?

I: Yessir, I have. Every one of them.
&lt;I suddenly realize how this sounds and start to blush&gt;
Erm, I had to. For work. I was checking them for work. We had to make sure. 

I am now sweating.

I: I HAD TO DO IT! I DIDN'T WANT TO WATCH THEM ALL! Really...I....

He took his tapes and left. Whenever I saw he or his wife after that, I got the strangest looks...

**TL;DR**18 year old me, in prudest city in the country, paid to watch porn

Occasionally we get kids from the neighboring elementary school who come in after school and act like punks. One kid came in yesterday who looked IDENTICAL to the Scumbag Childhood Friend. We walked directly up to the Electronics counter where me and my co-worker were working. He approached this situation all wrong.

We've all seen those topics on 4Chan where people make fake coupons and explain, ""Just bring it to the register when you cash out and if it scans they'll honor it, if it doesn't just say you got it online."" He comes up and immediately hands us the coupons without actually buying anything and says, ""I don't know what this is, my friend gave it to me.""

I now work as a trivia writer/quizmaster for a pub quiz company and roller derby announcer. My jobs have all been outside the norm and because of it, I have stories that many others find entertaining. 

Here's one from being a body piercer:

I was working in a very small body piercing shop, like pretty much all of them are in South Carolina. Tattooing was still illegal at this time, so it was still taboo to even have surface piercings we find common place (e.g. navel). 

Our shop was in a small strip mall that looked more like an old outdoor motel than a business center. the only other business of note was a hair salon a couple of doors down.

I had a woman call into the shop and ask if the staff had experience with genital piercings. I advised her that all of our staff had performed them as part of our apprenticeship and that I could answer any question she had. She said that she would just come in to talk to me with her husband since it was around the corner.

Cut to 30 minutes later and I get another call while setting up packages for autoclaving. It's the blonde that runs the hair salon next to me.

""Um, do you have a couple coming in to get pierced?"" she said.

""Yeah, how did you know that?""

She stammered, ""Be-because they are having sex in the parking lot.""

As I mentioned, body piercing was still coming along in South Carolina and a lot of the taboo was normal, God fearing people didn't have piercings. As I opened up the blinds to see a Chrysler New Yorker do some rocking no less than 100 ft from my front door, I silently cursed them for giving the girl next door some leverage with the property owner come lease renewal. 

I shut the blinds and go back to business as usual. Last thing I wanted to do was have them walk in with me giving them a knowing stare in case they were in fact that oblivious and not exhibitionists. Once they came into the store, I spoke with the woman while her husband sat on a couch. She was interested in a piercing known as a C-Hood, but was unsure on a vertical or horizontal. I said that firstly depended on her amount of hood. I laid out a seat cover for my piercing chair and had her sit down so I could examine her.

After she spread her legs, she had a little bit of a bush...that currently had small globes of beading semen at the end of various hairs as well as a matted patch. 

""Ma'am, I'm afraid your husband is, still on you. That's a biohazard I'm not going to handle even with gloves."" I told her as I backed away. 

""Oh, I can just go into your bathroom real quick."" she said dismissively.

""You certainly will not. You can go home, shower and come back if you'd like, but you're not scrubbing up in my customer's bathroom."" She made a ""fair enough"" facial expression and got up. She went out and talked to her husband (I could barely hear it as I was removing the disposable chair cover, which crinkles like mad). When I exited the piercing room, they were leaving. She remarked with a 'see you later.'

*Yeah fucking right* I thought.

A hour later, I get another customer, and it's totally her and her husband. The balls of this woman. I don't think I could have come back after being told to go wash semen off my crotch. Well, she did, and shaved it as well. I fitted her for a vertical, the piercing going quite smoothly (no shaved pun intended). 

Afterwards, she tipped me $20 in addition to the piercing commission and explained they were under the impression they might not be able to have sex for a while after she got pierced, so the sex in the parking lot was more of a ""Oh shit, how long without sex? Better get us one more in!"" decision.

I have a lot of stories from my various jobs, so if you'd like to hear from a particular field, just ask. Thanks for reading.

She even said that we were paid to listen to her talk. (Luckily I was good at avoiding her like the plague)

We had a poster made of one of our managers and it was put into photo. In fact when I was working the overnight shift it kept scaring the crap out of me because I kept thinking someone was standing in our photo area. 

Well this woman came in and starting chatting with our manager's poster. I sh*t you not she was there for 5 minutes before she went up to the front counter and asked our cashier why our manager wasn't responding to her.

Quick explanation: At this time, I was a lowly cashier, and we have Supervisors (one up) and Managers (two up) in my supermarket chain store, in Australia.

This particular day, was working Front End, which means a small register (no belt), cigarettes behind me, and was placed on the register closest to the door which opened into a large walkway. This area is known as 'Help Desk', mostly because it's closest to the door, but I still have to serve people.

A lady comes directly up to me, not bothering waiting in line, and just demands a refund in a very snooty tone. Call her Snooty Woman (SW). I had a customer, I asked her to wait for me to finish the transaction and I could assist her.

I finish my serving, turn to her, and ask in unwaveringly good-little-cashier-girl voice how I can help her on this day.

&gt;SW: I am demanding a refund.

&gt;Me: Okay, can I see your receipt and the items you're returning please?

Normal store procedure, have to check what's actually wrong i.e damaged, outdated, whatever the problem may be. She fussing, muttering, and plonks a bag on my counter without unpacking it. First off, it's a bag from another supermarket, not my own. This is usually pretty normal, I don't expect loyalty to this chain, so I'm like whatever. 
I'm forced to get three cans of diced tomatoes and a VERY long receipt out of the bag while she huffs and watches me.

Straight up, I realise something is wrong. We definitely do not stock the brand of diced tomato she has with her - I knew this as a fact, as I used to also do packing. I then looked at her receipt - IT WAS FROM AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT STORE. At this point, I'm confused, but being a nice person, I assumed maybe she'd perhaps grabbed the wrong receipt or something. 

&gt;Me: Ma'am, can you point out where the purchase for these cans are, on the receipt, please?

&gt;SW: RIGHT THERE *angrily stabs her finger randomly

&gt;Me: On this receipt?

&gt;SW: Yes, this one. I bought them here within the week. You have to give me a refund, it's all dented.

The can was a tad dented, sure, but how does that make it bad in the slightest? I manage to find the cans on the receipt, so she has bought them... but not from our store.

&gt;Me: Ma'am, I'm sorry, I think you've confused this store with [Other Australian chain]. This is [my store].

&gt;SW: Don't be stupid, girl! I bought them here! Now are you going to refund me or not!?

&gt;Me: Ma'am, I'd like to point out that the receipt you have here is **not from this store**.

&gt;SW: OF COURSE IT'S THIS STORE! I BOUGHT THEM HERE! ARE YOU TRYING TO CHEAT ME FROM MY MONEY?

&gt;Me: The receipt clearly says [other store] at the top! You have to have the correct receipt if you want a refund.

&gt;SW: GET ME YOUR MANAGER THIS INSTANT AND THEY WILL GIVE ME A REFUND!!!

Typical customer fallback. I'm mad, but really, she's an idiot, I wasn't shaking or furious. I page the manager for 'Urgent customer assistance' and he comes straight away. This is K, from a previous post some may remember.

&gt;K: What's the problem?

&gt;Me: She brought in a receipt from [other store] and is trying to get a refund when we don't even stock the same item.

&gt;*K starts laughing*

&gt;SW: I want a refund for my purchase, FROM THIS STORE, for your apparent disregard for the appearance of my items. IMMEDIATELY. 

&gt;K: I'm sorry, but we don't even stock this brand, the receipt isn't from here, and we're not giving you money for this scam.

&gt;SW: YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME A REFUND! I BOUGHT IT!

&gt;K: You did not buy it here. *swipes can over scan, it beeps a negative* I'm sorry but you'll have to take this scam somewhere else, hope it works out better for you.

And at this beautiful moment, K throws the (already dented) can *out of the store* in a perfect curve, where it lands outside in the walkway and rolls away. K then stares at the woman and just says

&gt;I think you'd better follow.

She leaves, grabbing her things, while screaming incoherently.


**TL, DR: Customer tries to get a refund for an item we don't carry, tries to say she bought it at my store by showing a receipt from another store, Manager then throws the item out of the store and tells her to follow.**

The first of these stories I have added below.

Our procedure for new rolls where they have to be baked for 15min and then frosted and put up on the hot plate for twenty minutes and then they get replaced with new fresher rolls. 

When working towards the back end of a dinner rush we had one customer come in and ask us very politely if we had any non frosted rolls as he was a diabetic and could have a little bit of a roll and give the rest to his son. I told him that wouldnt be a problem but it would take about 7 minutes for the next set of rolls to come out. 

Well apparently that was the code word for him to lose his mind, he looked at me and turned a bright shade of red and demanded to know why he had to wait at all. I explained the companys policy and that we didnt keep rolls unfrosted unless they were special large orders. He demanded to see the manager which unfortunately was me at that moment being the shift lead. Of course this makes the man more irrate and he threatened to call the local news watch dog program, that investigates corrupts businesses and sketchy business practices, and report me specifically to them for ""diabetic discrimination"". 

After all his yelling and everything he failed to notice the fresh rolls pulled out of the oven or the slightly mentally handicapped kid carefully cut out an unfrosted roll and place it gently in a box like it was a newborn baby that would bruise if jostled to much. This kid, we'll call him Dave, walks right up to the counter between me and the diabetic rage monster and hands it to him and says, ""Excuse me sir, I have your r-r-roll r-r-right here. And I want you to know that these guys r-r-really dont discriminate anyone here. I should know."" 

The man was visibly stunned and put a 10 dollar bill down on the counter and hurried off, child in one hand and unfrosted roll in the other. I didnt bother calling him to come get his change back and gave it all to Dave for saving me from what I'm sure would have been an endless tirade about how skewed my moral compass was.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,1364420547.0,,,True,t3_1b4wbh,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1b4wbh/what_do_you_mean_i_have_to_wait/,

Anywho, I'm running some returns, and there are 2 siblings in the store, one is a 15 year old girl and her younger brother, probably 11 or 12. I catch the brother trying to stick a video game manual into his shorts and I just stare at him with murder eyes till he puts it back, and I go about my return running, mulling over how to exact delicious justice. The girl comes up with a rental, so I go behind the counter and help her. After I tell her when her movie was due back I said ""Oh, and tell your brother the next time he tries to steal video game manuals, I'm not renting to him anymore."" She looks shocked, gathers him up, and walks out of the store.  I worked in a pretty affluent area so its not like this kid needed to steal.

About 5 minutes later, the brother is being dragged into the store by the arm by his mother. She comes up to me and asks if he really attempted to steal, to which I reply ""Yes, it was the manual for a wii baseball game."" The woman starts hollering at her son, grounds him for a month on the spot, apologizes profusely to me, smacks him upside the head, and walks out, all the while berating him.

1362422204.0,790,self.TalesFromRetail,19ngr1,Security Shenannigans: How the difference between the #'s 5 and 6 can lead to Tranny Porn.,Drunken_Black_Belt,1026,236,151,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/19ngr1/security_shenannigans_how_the_difference_between/,"So I work as a Security guard in a big corporate office. It's shit. Awful job.  But sometimes, we get to create a little fun with ourselves.  For example, our phone number is (XXX) XXX-5555.  The local CableSight office has the same number, except the last 4 digits are 6666.  Needless to say, about once or twice a day, we get calls meant for Cablesight. (Hopefully the mods will allow this post since it's customer service *related*)

Now when we answer the phone in the office, we typically say ""*NameofBuilding* Security. This is Drunken_Black_Belt. How can I help you?""  Now for most people, this is a BIG clue that they in fact didn't call Cablesight.  Some will hang up, but most will go 

Person: I think I have the wrong number. I'm trying to reach Cablesight.

Me: You want to dial 6666, this is 5555

Person: Oh ok thank you.

Simple as that.  And they are off on their merry way to complain about whatever issue they are having, to the right people.  However, every so often, you deal with someone. Someone so stupid, it hurts you way down in their soul.  And naturally, you must fuck with those people. Take them down so many pegs, that they will be envious of pirates with peg-legs.  This, is a story of one of those people.

So it's an average day. I'm in the office, working, being a boss. Looking sauve, in my cheap, standard issue suit.  The phone rings. A random number.  My hand, deftly reaches out for the phone. I tense up, ready to spring into action! Is there a fire?  Someone having a heart attack? Or, god forbid, did someone ignore the stop signs and run their $100,000 Audi into another car. (Happens WAY more often than you'd think).

Me: *Name of Bulding* Security. This is Drunken_Black_Belt. How can I help you?

Gullible Idiot:  Yes Hi my name is Gullible Idiot and I'd like to know why I have so many charges rental charges on my bill.

Me: Oh Ma'm Im sorry this is a security office. You have the.

GI: (Not paying attention)  We don't ever rent anything, so I don't get why there is a $55 charge extra on here.

Me:  Ma'm. You have the wrong number.

GI: What?

Me: This is 5555, you want 6666.  

GI: Thats what I dialed.

Me: Obviously not, as we are currently talking and I am not a Cablesight employee.

GI: Well I just want to talk to someone about my bill can you transfer me to the bills department?

Me: One moment ma'm.

So naturally I turned to my co worker, and gave him a devilish grin. The time for fuckery had begun.

Me: Hi Ma'm I understand you are having issues with your bill. I'm looking at the charges right now.

Now I assumed, correctly as it turned out, that this woman would think I somehow knew her account without asking her any questions.  Somehow the fact that no cable company in the history of ever has picked up with a live person on the first ring had escaped her notice, so maybe she wouldn't notice I just magically knew who she was.

GI: Yes I just don't understand why there is this charge for $55.

Me: Well it's typical for a rental fee for some movies, let's check them out.  

GI: Well we didn't rent anything.

Me: Well give me a second.  Ok it says here that last weekend 2 movies were rented from your cable box. Each film was $26, plus tax would make it $55.

GI: What movies? And how come they are so much?

Me: Well, says here one was titled ""Chicks with Dicks 7"" and the other is ""Tranny Heaven vol 18"".

GI: What?  What type of movies are those?

Me: Well ma'm, they are adult movies, featuring Transexuals.  

GI: WHAT?  WE DON'T WATCH THAT KIND OF FILTH!!

Me: Ma'm I'm not here to judge.  All I know is that last saturday someone rented these movies on your cable box.

GI: That's impossible.

Me: Your phone number is *reads phone number off caller ID screen*?

GI: Yes.

Me: Well we have cable box *makes up random serial code* assigned to that number and that's where the rentals came from. Perhaps you'd like to talk to your family and see who rented these?

GI: Well I'll have to, it has to be a mistake.

Me: Well ma'm, hopefully they'll listen to you, because you sure didn't listen to me in the beginning of the call.

GI:  What?  I don't follow.

Me: Anything else I can help you with?  

GI: Umm... no thank you.  I have to go sit down for a bit.

Me: Welp, thanks for calling Cablesight, have a wonderful day!



At which point I hang up and start losing it. My cowoker had stuffed his tie in his mouth to keep from cracking up.  I was expecting her to call back all day yelling and screaming when she figured it out, but nothing ever came of it.  

**TL;DR  Dude looks like a lady! YEA YEA!**


**Edit:  So I've been messaged asking to take down this post, and change the title and repost.  Apparently a lot of people are reporting it as offensive. And the the subreditt /r/TransphobiaProject has made a post about me [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TransphobiaProject/comments/19oe1b/casual_transphobia_in_rtalesfromretail/)   So this is my response.  I feel bad if anyone took any offense to this.  None was intended.  However I won't remove it of my own volition. Hope this doesn't put pressure on the mods.  But I don't see anything offensive about it.  To me, Transexual porn is no different than any other fetish porn involving a physical preference.  If I had said it was Pegging Porn, I'm sure I'd be getting messages from Pro-Peggers, saying they feel I'm being offensive to their preferences. (Also that's just a general point. I realize there is a difference between being born transgender, and enjoying a physical act.  You all hopefully see my point though).  In my different jobs, especially when I worked LP in a store that sold lingerie, I've had to deal with Straight, Gay, Lesbian, Trans, White, Black, Tall, Short, (etc etc) people.  At no point did any of it make a difference to me.  Only time it ever caused an issue was when I had to write up an employee for some remarks after we had a man who lived his life as a woman use the fitting rooms in the lingerie store.  A buddy of mine is someone who feels like he is a woman in a man's body. But I don't even think of that, except the time he told a girl at work she had a hairier chest than he did. Now that was fucking funny.  My point here, is that I think it's a little ridiculous that people are getting so bent out of shape over this. I can't even begin to pretend that I can sympathize with someone who is living transgender.  It's just not physically possible for me. I can empathize though. I'm sure it's a tough, confusing issue to have to live with.  But at the same time, that doesn't mean that every mention is a jab at you.  If I had said something like ""Transgenders are mutants and deserve to be killed"", then yea, bring on the hate mail. That's a bigoted, hateful statement.  And anyone who would say that deserve to be hated.  But I would think we can all agree that that is not what I said at all.  A veiled *CLERKS* reference, while mentioning a type of porno that is outside of ""Vanilla"" porn, but still available for rental (as far as I am aware) from cable companies.  All that being said, I will freely admit that I am the type to find nothing taboo as far as humor.  I'm a fat guy, but love fat jokes.  I firmly believe humor will get you through anything. I really hope this has cleared things up, but urge anyone who has found this offense, or anyone from /r/TransphobiaProject to contact me if they have any questions and wish to discuss this like reasonable adults.  Sorry again to the mods. Remove it if you must, but it's my choice not too.

The hotel that our company was staying at was kind enough to offer free drinks at their bar from 3-5 pm during happy hour and we are talking unlimited free drinks. Most of the days that we were there I had to work past the cut off time but finally I was able to get out early enough and run back to the hotel just in time to make it before 5. 

I was literally the last person in line at 4:55 when a security guard stood in behind me to cut off the line as it would be past 5 by the time I made it to the front to be served. Cue asshole douche bag (we'll call him ADB) who walks up to the security guard at 4:59 demanding to be served. The security guard informs him politely that the line is cut off for today and he is more than welcome to come back tomorrow for free drinks.

ADB wasn't having any of that and starts berating the security guard for being too stupid to tell that it wasn't yet 5. He demands to speak to the manager of the hotel (a small and soft spoken woman) who gives him the same reason why the line cuts off before 5. He continues to screech and his voice only gets louder as I'm standing right next to him waiting for my ears to start bleeding. Next he dials their corporate office on his mobile and continues to scream about the lousy customer service and how stupid and rude the staff have been. 

I was about half the size of this guy and not a very outspoken person but I have worked many waitress jobs in my time and have experienced firsthand how awful and embarrassing it is to be berated like this in public and still have to be polite and courteous so something in me just snapped. ADB was still on the phone at this point and before I knew it I was in his face shouting at him, ""Shut the FUCK UP OK?! Just shut the fuck up!! You're obviously getting your drink after treating the waitstaff like dirt so quit screaming in my ear, quit being an asshole, AND SHUT THE FUCK UP!!"" 

He was instantly quiet with his mouth open and his phone just dropped to his side. Clearly no one had ever put him in his place before. I turned around, a bit red once I realized the whole bar was staring at me but then the person in front of me turned around and thanked me. I apologized for being so loud but they insisted that they wished they had done the same. I explained that I know how it feels after working in restaurants for so long at which point ADB piped in to try to say he had once worked in a restaurant too. I turned around and said with as much venom in my voice as I could muster, ""then you should know to treat people with a little decency, shouldn't you?"" which shut him right up. 

I was still shaking when I ordered my TWO drinks (I needed it after that) and sat down at a table but it felt pretty awesome to put a rude asshole in his place. I was met with smiles and winks by other people in the bar for the rest of the night. 

**TL;DR Asshole douche bag treats hotel staff like garbage and I snap and shut him down so hard I even surprised myself.**

We had customer about a year ago try to commit fraud using bottled fragrance oil (the kind you put reeds in to make a room smell like a garden took a shit). I watched her pick up a display bottle, look around shadily, then pour it on the ground. I called stock to bring comet and paper towels out as I watched her sit on the display ledge (16"" high), then slide herself down to a sitting position on the ground, then lay down on the floor and start moaning. I just started laughing, as did the customer who watched it happen. As she's laying on the ground moaning (no one cared, seriously [*I'll explain in a minute]), I first call the ASM from the back, then the municipal police who are in the mall, and asked the customer I was helping to stay (so we can file an incident report).

Well my ASM comes out, sees her, and also starts laughing. He laughs even louder when I explain everything. The louder he laughs, the louder she moans. The cops show up maybe two minutes after I called, see her on the floor moaning, and must choke back laughter. They ask what's up and I tell them, at which point one of the cops also starts laughing.

This woman is over it. She starts yell-moaning, ""I'm gonna sue!"" The cop who managed to not laugh asks if she wants to file a report, and the woman says yes and makes up some story which the cop writes down. Then her partner walked over and said to this woman, ""You have two options: get up and walk away or we will file this report then arrest you for filing a fraudulent claim."" Of course she tries to kick up a fuss, ""You can't do that! I'm injured! Blah blah blah."" That's when the cop breaks to her the very thing that had us all laughing, ""Ma'am, these floors are unfinished concrete, the oil makes it sticky, not slippery."" He then sticks his shoe on the oil spot and tries to slide it, but it doesn't move. She tried, ""That's what I meant! I tripped because my shoes got stuck!"" The officer then walks straight across the spot, no problem. He stares her dead in the face and says, ""I gave you your options, you have thirty seconds to make a choice before I arrest you.""

She figured the jig was up and started toward the door, her back and side saturated in oil, she reeked from 20 feet away. As she makes the walk of shame out of the store, the ASM hollers, ""We have your information, never set foot in this store again!""

I took solace in the fact that her car and clothes would smell like mission fig forever, and cleaned the damn oil off of the floor.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,1357096247.0,,,True,t3_15syvf,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/15syvf/if_youre_going_to_commit_fraud_at_least_do_it_well/,

Ballsack Billy

'Tis the holiday season in Lingerie Land, little bras all hang in a row, tinsel decorates the sales register and I am serving gifts with a smile. It is two weeks until Christmas a.k.a it's busy as fuck in retail world, new employees scatter the store like headless chickens while the veterans rake in the sales (trying to get that raise ohh yissss).

Being as it is a Saturday at around 3pm the place is ""bumpin"" I have children under racks, old biddies clipping coupons and men awkwardly looking at negligee for their aging wives. I am calmly yet quickly checking customers out and wrapping gifts like a madman when he comes sauntering down the isle. We'll call him Billy. Billy is about 50, 6ft tall, sporting a wonderful white beard just like St.Nick himself and he's in a dress...and has boobs???. I do a double take, oh yes he is indeed wearing a dress and has a bra on, get back to business (for the record I am totally ok with whatever you want to be gay, bi, lesbian, trans, blue, banana, whatever is awesome). I notice the customers are slightly alarmed, we're kind of in the bible belt so its expected but he's not doing any harm and has a lovely dooney and burke purse so I ignore him and let him wander among the bras.

It's 2:45pm and the coupon ends at 3pm...Utter madness erupts, I have lines of customers out the wazoo and my coworker (we'll call her Evil Bitch) isn't doing much to help. Evil Bitch starts telling customers that I'm going to hell because I don't believe in God and I don't celebrate Christmas. WUT?? EVIL BITCH SAYS WUUUT??? Not only is that entirely unprofessional her baby making evilness can't say shit about me. (Insert rant about having too many kids at 22 and having cps called yadda yadda yadda). Be generally pissed off now but still smiling like a champ. Billy's still hanging around the bras holding them up to himself in front of a mirror. cool.

Evil Bitch fucks off 20 minutes early for her break leaving me all on my todd trying to deal with the shark tank of customers; awesome. I'm doing the best I can when Billy ventures out of the safety net of bras, he is now directly to my left (yes by the trash can). On the left side of the registers we have a tall spinny tower of hair bows and shit for girls (mainly little girls) but whatever he can look at the bows and headbands I'm trying to fight this Chinese lady over an expired coupon.

Coupon lady buggers off after a stern word and I serve the next in line. This customer had no problem immediately telling me that Billy needs to leave..NOW. I start my spiel about how everyone is entitled to shop no matter what race, gener, sexuality...blah blah blahhhhhh. She cuts me off with a slap to me register and says no no NO. He's a pedo. It took me a while to figure this out she pronouced it like peh-doh and being scottish I'm like wtf is a pedo but then it clicks ohhhh you mean a pee-doh. Oh fuck WUT??? 

I press this lady for info quietly cause Billy is still to my left bending over looking at bows. She tells me to go look so I do...I wander away from my register (going towards my left) making an excuse out loud such as ""I'll just go get that for you ma'am"". I walk behind Billy and KABOOOOOOOM. HOLYMOTHERFUCKINGWHATISTHATOHMYGOD.

I'm staring at his ballsack...Billy is bent down so far in a shortish flowy dress that the back of the dress has lifted up his tall frame letting his ""Christmas bobbles"" dangle for all to see!!! What a gift ladies and gents..what a gift...

Anyways, professional mode activated, get back behind register nod to complaining lady and pick up the phone. Call LP (loss prevention) ""Hiiii this is HowlingBukowski in lingerie/juniors...Can you see me on your camera?""

""yeah why"" - LP doesn't like to be bothered on busy days, trying to catch thieves and shit...

""Do you see the bow/headband tower?"" Add in a little cough for good measure.

""Yeah, the beard guy?"" 

""Uh huuuuuuh look at back lower."" trying to be subtle cause billy is still there O.O

""Yeah yeah...Oh good lord. we'll be right there.""

""Thank youuuuuu""

Nod back at complaining customer give her coupons out the arse because her little girl just saw a ballsack before age 10. I see LP storming the gate (aka leaving the office) and breathe a sigh of relief phewwwwww. But what do I see out of the corner of my right eye???? Ballsack Billy is leaving, that bugger is getting away scot free, AND touching every piece of negligee on the tit on the way out. Slightly weirded out but it's better than winking at one eyed willy....LP is casually following him about 10-15ft behind and then he cuts through the dress department and disappears into the mall!!! We lost him. LP calls mall security as a heads up but that's all can be done.

I can firmly say this is not the last of Ballsack Billy.

I was helping the associates in window coverings because they were slammed -- all of them were with special order customers, cutting window blinds/shades, etc.-- when I noticed a kid messing with the blind displays. It was basically a free-standing window frame with a different working blind inserted on either side of the frame, sturdy but meant to be used the way you would use a window covering.

This kid, about 7yrs old, is holding onto the cords on either side of the display as if he's waterskiing, leaning waaaay back with all his weight on the cords. I look around for a parent, but of course the kid is unsupervised, so I walk over and say, ""Hey, kid, you can't do that. You might get hurt."" The kid stares at me, stands up straight and drops the cords to run off towards a 30-ish man looking at display books.

I think nothing of the whole exchange and get back to trying to help out in the department when I feel a heavy series of tap-tap-taps on my shoulder. ""Did you just tell my kid to stop playing on the display?"" I turned around and this man is looking at me with a very neutral expression. ""Yes, he was pulling so hard I thought he might pull the display over onto himself,"" I said.

""DON'T YOU EVER TALK TO MY KID LIKE THAT! EVER! NEVER! YOU GOT IT?!"" he screams into my face, spittle flecking my glasses and his finger stabbing towards my chest.

I was gobsmacked, as they like to say across the pond. Just... wow. I didn't even know what to say.

For like, ten seconds. Then it came to me.

""Sir, first of all - if you're not going to supervise your children, don't bring them into the store; there are too many things they can hurt themselves with. Secondly -- don't YOU ever speak to ME in that manner, ever, ever again. It's not my fault you're embarrassed because your kid doesn't know how to behave or won't listen to you when you shop. Now, I have to get back to my customer. Please make sure your child understands that these are to look at, not to play with, okay? HAVE A NICE DAY, SIR.""

I turned back to my customer and ignored him as he began ranting about rude service and how he was never coming back.

They told me to leave her alone and not offer her assistance so that she could just do her thing because they really wanted to catch her this time. All they told me it was an older lady with glasses.

This lady steps off the elevator and it's a lady in her 70s wearing a brightly colored muumuu. Definitely not what I was expecting. She is carrying reusable shopping bags and walking with a limp. I do as I was told and leave her be while trying to hide and watch her in action. I just can't believe this is the woman they are talking about.

She goes in a corner in the home department and takes a Wahl clipper set off the wall and puts it into one of her bags. She then proceeds to walk around the department grabbing miscellaneous items and putting those into her bags. She doesn't even look around to see if anyone's watching her. This lady had some balls. Guess she figured no one would expect an old woman to be stealing.

She then grabs a body pillow and brings it up to me to check out. I ring her up and as I am handing her the bag, I look down in her other bags because I am curious to see all that she grabbed. There was all kinds of kitchen items and small electrics. I finish up her transaction and she starts to head towards the elevator. She picks up a set of sheets on the way and puts those in the bag with the pillow.

I can't believe she has taken all of this so far and so I call LP and let them know she is on the elevator and give them a list of everything that I saw her take. Once off the elevator, she starts walking toward the exit and pulls out some wire cutters and clips the wire on the Michael Kors handbags and grabs the one she wants and keeps walking.

As she steps outside, LP is waiting for her. I hurried downstairs to watch them catch her. She is playing dumb the entire time. She is taken into the office while the cops are called. She ended up with about $700 worth of merchandise on her. She claimed she has Alzheimer's and doesn't know what she was doing.

She was given a court date but not arrested. When her court date comes around, LP is there to testify. It seemed like the judge was just going to fine her and let her off. As LP is walking out of the courtroom, the lady flipped her off. Luckily the judge saw and had her arrested on the spot.

TL;DR-Even old ladies in muumuus shoplift.

I work in a shop that specialises in board games. I always get customers who think they have the brightest kids in the world. So when it comes to games that are suggested to be more suitable for children a few years older than theirs, they think it should be fine because they are smart enough to figure it out themselves.

Had a customer come into the store and ask about a particular board game that she saw in a news article the previous week called 'Ticket to Ride'. 

I told her it was an excellent game, as I have played it heaps and have thoroughly enjoyed it. Then, she starts telling me that it was for her grandchildren to play with her. 

I ask for their age and they were about 2-4 years younger than the suggested age for the board game. I go on to mention this and start recommending games that I believed would be suitable for their age and that they would really enjoy. 

She keeps going back to the original board game she came in for and questions me as to whether or not her children would be able to understand the game. (How am I supposed to know?!) 

I politely replied by repeating the recommended age as shown on the box and repeated my experience with the game in saying that the rules are fairly straightforward, but it was the strategy that was needed to be put in the game that required older players. I said that the kids might get disinterested by it since they will probably lose most of the games against adults and not be able to understand why and how they could change the way their strategy in the game. 

She dismisses my argument and says, ""they are really bright for their age and so it should be fine,"" then proceeds to the counter to purchase it. 

2 weeks later, I answer a call in the store and a lady asks about Ticket to Ride and how she had purchased it and couldn't understand the rules and was too complicated for her and her grandchildren to follow and wanted a refund for the game. I suggested watching some videos online of demo games if the rule book was too complicated (which, frankly, isn't; the rules are very straightforward and easy to follow). She claims to have done so and still couldn't understand and asked for a refund for a game that she had opened and attempted to play because apparently, the girl serving her in the store (me) told her that it was suitable for really young children (which I never said). 

I confronted her and said that I remember serving her and I did recommend other games more suitable for her grandchildren's age and that I could not do anything once the product has been opened.

She sounded pretty angry and hung up the phone.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_19iptc,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/19iptc/oh_that_should_be_fine_my_kids_are_very_smart_for/,

The kid runs out and I realize what just happened, he humped my head. He rubbed his dick against my head. I chase after him and scream ""You are a disgusting excuse for a person!"" but he was running away. I ran down to security and retold the events, gave them a description, and all the guards on force took  action, I mean, this was the most exciting thing that had happened in our mall in god knows how long. After about 20 minutes of them searching, one of them runs back to my store and tells me to follow her. She starts running so I run after her to where all the other mall cops were. They point down and ask if that was the kid that assualted me. I confirmed. They took him into custody and the city police were called. 3 hours later after much questioning, retelling of events, and information being taken down, the kid was arrested for battery. As he was only 14, I expect nothing to be done about this (thanks to our great system!!) but I'm glad I at least did all I could to get justice.

It was a reletively peaceful day for a Friday, but there's always just that one customer that comes in and ruins everything.  

Customer is buying 2 cartons of cigarettes and some drinks.  The total is about $100.

**Me** - Ma'am, I will need to see your license since you are using a card and the purchase is over $75.

**Customer** - No you don't. (proceeds to swipe her card)

**Me**- (canceling the transaction)Actually I do, as it is corporate policy, may I see your ID for this purchase?

**Customer**- Why do you NEED to see it?

**Me**- I just need to verify that you are the account holder, I promise it is solely for the security of the account.

**Customer**- Well, it's in my car (swipes her card again)

**Me**- I apologize ma'am, but I will need to see your ID for this purchase (I remove the items from the counter and suspend the transaction)

She leaves in a huff and stops at the door to say something.

**Customer**- I don't understand why you have to see my ID, you are not allowed to do this. (walks out to her car)

I start to get a line, so I call for my coworker to come up and help, and the woman returns.  Presumabely seeing that there is someone new at the register, she decides to wait in her line.  About 30 seconds later, it's finally her turn and she even adds $50 in gas to her total.  I reach over to my coworker's register and hit the cancel button after I see her swipe her card. 

**Me**- Again, I apologize, but I WILL have to see your ID for this purchase.

**Customer**- Oh, butt out, I'm dealing with this girl, not you.

**Me**- She is a new hire, and is still in training.  After today she will now know to ask for ID for purchases over $75 and using a credit card.

**Customer**- You can't do that, I work in the banking system, and it's against the law.

**Me**- I assure you ma'am, this is not only corporate policy, but that it is not against the law.  This policy was put into place by our merchant.

**Customer**- I work for Visa, we are a merchant, and our rules supercede yours.

**Me**- Our merchant processes our transactions through Visa, and Mastercard.  Visa has no bearing on our current policies and again, I ask to see your ID.

She finally shows it to my coworker, and that was that.  5 freakin seconds to look at a piece of plastic, and she was on her way.  I know what it's like to be inconvenienced, but damn, grow up.

TL;DR - Customer argues about a policy at my store, creates a little scene.

**EDIT**

I seem to have struck a nerve with some people here regarding the legality of such a request on my part.  As it stands, yes, I was doing what I was told.  However, I did shoot an email over to our director of loss prevention, the same person that set this policy in place over 2 years ago, asking about this very same thing.  I will update on Monday when that person is back in the office and sends me a reply.  

I did look over the Visa Merchant Agreement, and it does say that they don't have any problem with me asking for ID, just that it shouldn't be a regular routine.  Maybe it's ok if we only do it when the purchase is over a certain amount?  I don't know.  If the card is unsigned, which most cards ARE unsigned from what I see, then it is actually required to ask for ID.

She had to make two attempts to get around the guy, since he was pacing back and forth at the end of the aisle, and didn't even notice that he almost walked right into the stroller. Just as she starts to go by him though, his arm knocks several of these heavy metal sculptures off the shelf, making a huge amount of noise. Two of them land right next to the stroller, waking the toddler up.

Now, the kid had clearly been fast asleep, and being startled awake by a couple large, heavy, metal objects smashing to the ground right next to you can be pretty upsetting. So he starts crying, and the mother stops a couple feet away to try and soothe him. Apparently this annoyed the guy on the phone, since he turns around and almost yells at her, ""If you can't keep your f---ing little brat quiet, you shouldn't have opened your f---ing legs, you little slut. Now shut that f---ing kid up.""

I couldn't believe that he'd actually said that to her, and the mother was cleary shocked as well. She looked on the verge of tears herself, so I took her straight over to the customer service area, where my manager was. I told him what had happened, and he kicked the guy out of the store, and banned him from our store.

We gave the kid a pack of cookies to help cheer him up (with the mom's permission), and gave her a gift card for our store.

Before I begin, I need to say that people have tried to guess the location of my station in the comments section of my previous stories.  Please don't.  It's against the sidebar rules and I'd like to maintain a little bit of anonymity.  If you think you've figured out which station it is, just smile to yourself and feel good about your detective work, Lou.

*Today, on a very special episode of* ***Gas Station Adventures...***

My previous stories have all involved law enforcement.  This one, thankfully, does not.  It involves a nice summer day, a father with his young son out for a walk, and years of Boy Scout training being put to good use.

I had only been working at the station for about 6-7 months, and spring was getting ready to move out so that summer could move in, turn up the heat, and eat ice cream sandwiches on the couch while watching re-runs of Ren and Stimpy.  As I stood my vigil behind the cash register, a small fan blowing still-warm air across my face, a man came rushing into the store carrying a small boy.  The man's face was that of near-panic; eyes wide, pale, muscles taught.  His voice shook as he quickly explained to me that, as he and his son were out walking, they ran into a bee's nest.  The boy had been stung, something that he had not experienced before, and had very quickly started to show the signs of an allergic reaction.  Could I please call 911?

Sir, you just walked into the right store.

I vaulted the counter and checked on the little boy.  Yep, he was in trouble.  His face and neck were swollen, he was wheezing badly and obviously having trouble breathing, he was covered in hives, and his heart rate was insanely fast.  He whimpered in that pathetic manner that a young child will when they are very scared.  Damn.  I opened the door, and yelled for Alan (name changed) to run over.

Me:  ""Alan, do you have your cell phone?""

Alan:  ""Uh, yeah, why?""

Me:  ""Good.  Listen closely.  Run up to the fire station, and knock on the door.  Tell them they have a male child suffering from bad anaphylaxis due to a possible bee sting here at the station, and they need to get down here right away.  If you cannot get a hold of someone at the door, or the engines are gone, call 911, and tell them the same thing, then bust your ass back down here.  Now, repeat that back to me.""

Alan:  ""Run to the fire station, boy, anaphylaxis, bee sting, call 911 if no one is there.""

Me:  ""Good.  Now, RUN!""

And off he went, doing his level best to make Usain Bolt look like an asthmatic sloth with some heavy shopping.

*But Osiris32, why didn't you call 911 right then?  Isn't that what you are supposed to do in those kind of medical emergencies?*

A very good question, Timmy.  And, normally, that is exactly what I would have done.  However, in a situation like that, time is your enemy.  Had I called 911, it would have taken a minute or two to get on the line with the dispatcher, relay them the information, and have the dispatcher call out the emergency.  Two, three, maybe even four minutes before the firefighters start rolling.  However, in this case, the fire station is quite literally 125 yards away.  Alan could run there in under 30 seconds and talk to the firefighters directly, shaving off a ton of time.  And since I hadn't heard the fire trucks leave at all that day, I was pretty certain they were still there.

As Alan was doing his Jesse Owen impression, I ran out to my car and grabbed my first aid kit.  My lovely, hand-assembled, nearly-$1000-investment first aid kit.  In it were the finest medical tools money (and a civilian) could buy.  Blood pressure cuff.  Pulse oximeter.  Stethoscope.  Medications.  Hell, it even had a suture kit.  (It got stolen out of my car two years ago, and I'm still pissed about it).  I got to work monitoring the kid's vitals, while writing down everything I could from the father, who was in tears.  Within seconds, I heard the wail of a siren.  Proper help was on the way.

Moments later, several burly firefighters came through the door in that very business-like manner that firefighters have when they are facing a serious situation.  I got out of their way, and started relaying information to the supervisor.  They pumped the kid full of epinephrine, got him on an oxygen mask, loaded him onto a gurney, and rushed him out to the rescue truck.  Total time elapsed from the moment the father walked through the door to being in the truck, maybe 4 minutes.

I went outside and lit up a cigarette.  My hands shook.  I hadn't had to perform any sort of emergency medicine like that in years.  Kind of amazing how all that stuff I learned in Boy Scouts instantly came back to mind, even though I had been out of the program for almost 10 years.  I kept thinking about that little boy, hoping that he would be alright.

I had the next three days off, during which time I was busy with school and a girlfriend.  But upon my return, the father was there with the boy.  The father thanked me profusely, first by giving me a big hug.  He offered to reward me for what I had done, which I of course turned down.  I explained that, as an Eagle Scout, it was my duty and pleasure to help other people at all times.  Seeing the little boy happy and healthy was more than enough reward.  The boy himself was a bit shy, but still said thank you.  I smiled all day long.

I work as a Salesperson in a major UK electronics retailer, based in Ireland. We're perceived as being the bargain store of the group that we're in, so we get a lot of customers in buying the cheapest electronics they can, trying to get bigger discounts and generally kicking up a fuss over €5 or €10 here or there.

One Saturday, when the store is super busy, a Middle-Aged guy comes in. He tells me he's in a rush, but he wants to buy a Home Entertainment system. He keeps me busy for about half an hour, asking stupid questions, before deciding to go for the cheapest model; a display model that has €90 off.

Normally the problem with display models is that they've been used, but these Home Entertainment systems only sit on the shelf, so they're like new, just without the box. I tell him as much, and he starts to get angry, insisting that I give him another €20 off, which I refused to do, because we'd lose money on it. To placate him, I said I'd wrap it all up in bubble-wrap, and get all the accessories for him (normally, we don't bother, because they're all just thrown in a box in the warehouse).

So I go out the back, and get everything together as quick as possible, so I can get rid of this guy.

When I come back out with everything, he's giving out to my manager, saying that I'm wasting his time, and that he should get a discount for his trouble. Manager is having none of it, and says that the best he can do is offer him a reduced price on insurance/warranty, to which he very rudely declines, saying; ""I'm not planning on f***ing breaking it"". Manager tells him there's nothing else he can do, but it's a very good deal, so customer says he'll take it anyway. The whole conversation took about 10 minutes.
So I bring him up to the customer service counter to skip the crazy queues, and bag his bubble wrapped Home Entertainment system, and he pays. He insists that I bring out his purchases, even though he can see we're now very busy, and I'm needed. I'm still trying to be helpful, just to get rid of him, so I oblige.

""Are you parked far, Sir?""
""No, I'm parked right in front of the store""

I'm kind of surprised, since the car park is crazy today, and the only non-disabled spot out front is usually taken by my co-worker, but I brush it off. I carry out the goods to his car....

And he sees the wheel of his car has been clamped.
With a €90 fine to remove it.

I put down his bags, and he turns to me;

""I don't have a phone with me today, can you call this number for me?""
to which I reply;

As you can tell from some of my other stories, I don't take shit. It's probably due to the fact that at this point I was a veteran and just didn't have time for your stupid customer BS. After you've been through some of the shit I've been through, the customer not having the correct amount of ice cubes in their beverage just doesn't seem to matter much to me. Just don't be doucher and we'll be cool. 

Now on to the tale: 

I knew the table was going to be about as fun as a bag of razor blades when I walked up to greet them and instead of returning my greeting they just barked out their drink orders. Nothing says ""hello, nice to meet you"" quite as eloquently as ""I'll have a diet, she'll have a diet, and he wants an iced tea"". But what can you do? They're not sociable people, fine, I still have a job to do. I went and fetched their springs. Apparently I've been relegated to wench tonight. 

When I returned with drinks there was 10 dollars in singles sitting on the end of the table. The clown who was obviously in charge of this bubbly and outgoing crew had placed them there. He said to me gruffly, ""This is your tip tonight. You'll start off with 10, every time I think you screw up or do something I don't like I'm removing a dollar or two"" 

In my head I said, ""I""m not a stripper, I'm not dancing for your dollar""

What I really said, as I scooped up the singles and placed them back in his hand was, ""Sir, you want to hold on to this, the bussers might get confused and think it was left from the table before you. I will give you the same service I give all of my tables; excellent. At the end of your meal when the bill comes you can then decide what amount of tip you'd like to leave."" And before he could respond I added ""Would you guys like to start with an appetizer?"" 

I could see in his face that he was going to object, but before he got a chance his wife, reading the situation correctly (that I wasn't going to put up with her husband's shit) gave me their app order and I was off to my next table. I watched him grumble at her while he put his money back in his wallet. They were tolerable for the rest of their meal not outgoing or friendly by any means, but they didn't request anything out of the ordinary or ridiculous. 

At the end of the meal I ended up with a 9 dollar tip. Not sure what random wronging I could have done to lose that dollar, maybe it was throwing his bullshit back in his face, but I wasn't even mad, that was still 20%.

She starts laughing as the old lady behind me (who I didn't know was there) starts complaining that ""that was inappropriate"".  Jolly gal told the old lady that it WAS appropriate, and she's going to take me home cuz she had such a good laugh.  It was an offer I declined.

The old lady told the chief liquidator what I said and he nodded sagely and declared ""Yes, that's exactly right.""

**2. Thank you, please come again.** Since the bankruptcy sale signs went up we've had 'new' regulars.  These folks are in the store every day or two, they must know the stock better than I do by now.  I figure they're scoping out what they want, hoping the discount increases again, so for the most part, I ignore them.

But this irate shopper, for a week has been complaining to all the staff that there's nothing left in the store worth having.  It's been explained to her at least 12 times that the store is closing and everything is being sold.  Yesterday, she decided to complain to me.

""There is nothing left in this store.  You can't run a store this way.  When are you getting new stuff!?""

I lean in close as if I'm sharing a secret ""We have to get rid of all of this first, then lots of things need to be changed.  It isn't worth coming again until June 1st.  Make sure you come back June 1st.""

""Really?""

""Oh yes, you'll be surprised to see what's here on June 1st""

She continues to wander around then as she's leaving calls out to me ""I'll see you June 1st!"" which meant I had to explain to my co-workers and the chief liquidator what I had done.  They told me I'm an asshole, but I'm their kind of asshole.

**3. You're Fired**  We close at 6.  At five to six we send everyone to the till.  We block the aisles so people can't go to the back of the store and waste our time, but it didn't work with the Hellion family, Granny, Ma, and the two little hellions (about 9 and 7 years old).  This is a family that has been wandering the store for an hour.  The nine year old nearly tipped over an empty shelving unit onto another unit of breakable stuff and Ma doesn't care and gets irate with me when I tell him to stop. 

They are pushing past the polite staff, ignoring the entreaties to go to the front (they avoid me, big, mean looking guy that I am, but they're doing end runs).  So I go to the chief liquidator and tell him he'll need to fire me in just a couple of minutes.  ?? is his response.

It's now 5 after 6 and I go back to ma and grandma hellion and I quietly say ""Ladies, it is five after six and the liquidator doesn't pay overtime.  If you aren't done shopping, come back tomorrow.  If you are done, go and pay for your shit and get out.  If you keep wasting my time, I will go into the back room, grab my vial of holy water, and spray your children until they disappear in an unholy smoke.

They ran to the chief liquidator screeching about how awful I was...he doesn't let them build up steam, he looks at me and says ""You're fired.  Ladies, you need to check out now"".

To begin, I worked for a small fast food 50's-themed restaurant. I can't say where due to the intense nature of this story, but we served steaks and shakes. I'll let you dwell on that little riddle.

I'd worked there for 5 months and absolutely hated the job. I'd been at bad jobs before, but this was just a shitty place to be. It paid poorly even for fast food, the work was physically-intense, the business was constantly in the red and there were so many restrictions on what employees could do just for themselves that it really did make my head spin.

My boss was to evil was Jack Nicholson was to crazy- she immortalized it in such a way that I often wondered if she had either a learning disability, or was simply trying her hand at interpretive dancing, but with being a horrible person instead of the ""dancing"" part. It's probably an avant-garde niche...

This woman outright hated me and pulled no punches telling me. When I was happy, she told me to stop being happy. When I was having fun at work (I tried very hard for those moments) she told me that work wasn't the place to have fun. When I tried to befriend her in any regard, she would shoot my offers down with lightning precision using hate and spite for ammunition.

I think it was because I was full of hope- I was young, still a teenager, and had my entire life ahead of me. This restaurant was just a job and nothing more to me. She, on the other hand, was trapped. She'd moved across the country to work here, her husband worked here, her oldest son worked here and she had no real viable options elsewhere because of that nasty attitude she couldn't shake.

I decided to quit when my mother was in the hospital and my boss outright refused to let me leave on my scheduled time because she wanted to hold me later doing busywork. I wanted to visit my mother, but my boss just wasn't having it. So it was at that moment I took a long, hard look at my life and decided that unemployment wouldn't be so bad. I wasn't a stellar employee- again, it was just a job, but I tried to be upbeat when I could and do my job. What more can you ask from a mere human being? Devotion for $6.50/hr?

The next day, we'd been slammed. Customers were not only inundating our lobby, but our drive-thru, and a full moon was in full swing, since every customer had some generic complaint, or had some special request that made a typical order impossible.

One customer came to the window (I was working the drive-thru, you see) and when I'd explained that his coupon had expired, began to swear at me. Oh, he called me the typical names- ""faggot"" for my long hair, and ""kike"" for my necklace (I assume?). It was at that point that I decided I was going home early;

""You wanna talk to my cunt of a boss?""

He just stares at me. I'm not yelling when I speak, but he sees that I'm no longer fucking around- that my job is essentially forfeit and I'm no longer some sales associate that he can belittle- I'm a living, breathing human being who is capable of starting confrontations.

""Y-yeah... Yeah, lemme talk to your manager."" His tone straightened the hell up.

So I get on my headset; ""This guy wants to talk to my cunt of a boss. Amanda (not her real name), can you come talk to this guy?""

Amanda stares daggers at me storms up to the window. Without even asking if she could help the man, she flings open the window and leans out- ""Did you call me a cunt?!""

""He did!"" the man says, now frightened by the situation. My boss looks to me and asks me if I called her a cunt. I'd just been leaning against the counter at that point;

""Me? Yeah, I did.""

""Get out.""

""Well, fuck you, too.""

""And don't come back! Leave your bowtie on the counter!""

I complied. I complied and laughed my way out the door to leave them fending for themselves. A bit of a cold move- I liked a few of my coworkers... Most of them were chain-smoking teens, meth addicts, or my ex-fiancee, but there were a few people I didn't mind working with.

Take the high road, ladies and gents of retail. You can only crawl deeper in the mud for so long until you realize you're in over your head.

Edit: Wow! Top post?! You're all FAR too kind to me! :D

My ending bit about ""Taking the high road"" shouldn't be misconstrued with good manners- I was trying to articulate not cheating yourself out of happiness. Don't stay in a job you hate, under obligations you don't actually have, for reasons you don't understand. I won't bore you with the ""life's too short"" route, but there are better jobs. Better jobs that pay the same, or better, and with better people to work with.

1367524305.0,747,self.TalesFromRetail,1dkkt1,"""Oh ja, too thin!""",KillerKino,893,146,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1dkkt1/oh_ja_too_thin/,"I used to work as a butcher and counter clerk in a small family-run German deli. We made and sold sausages and cold cuts, and a popular item that is in this story is leberkase - essentially a German meatloaf made out of very finely ground meat(think the consistency of bologna). Leberkase is generally ordered either as a big slab to eat on it's own or to make what is essentially a meatloaf sandwich, or sliced thinly for use as lunchmeat.

In my deli, we used outdated and imported shitty slicers with mismatched measurements so I would always show customers how thick I was slicing things with distance between my fingers, and I usually also showed them the first slice to double-check. A customer came in who wanted leberkase and per her request, I sliced it thin after showing the first slice. Everything is normal here.

Cut to two hours later and it's very busy(the holiday season always is for this place). We handle customers as we see them and, as I'm the only available clerk, I offer to help the next customer. He refuses quite rudely. I'll take a moment here to note that there is a lot of racial prejudice in this store towards non-Germans - I'm not saying the German community at large is full of ancient ex-Nazis that don't associate with non-German speakers, but my local one was, so this wasn't totally unexpected behavior. I do inform him that it may be a while before he can expect any help from anyone else due to how busy it was and then he tells me that he wants to talk to my manager about my attitude. Now we've got a problem.

See, the problem isn't with disputing my attitude, or being a racist prick, but with talking with my boss. He owns the store, he's 60 years old, he's bald, and he's taking a nap. He sounds like a bad Arnold Schwarzenegger impression and, very consistently, holds mild discontent for anything other than his infant grandson and the almighty dollar. I let the customer know that the boss doesn't want to be disturbed and that I'd be happy to resolve the dispute myself but he insists, and then yells in German for the boss(his office is next to the kitchen and he can hear what goes on in the front fairly easily).

The boss bellows for me from his office(SAMMYYYYYYY, as that is how he refers to me). I run to the boss's office and say ""Boss,"" as that is how I refer to him, ""this guy wants to talk to you about my attitude.""

""What why this.""

I shrugged and he got out of his chair. I continued assisting other customers while keeping an eye and ear on the interaction. It was the husband of the thin sliced leberkase lady! Apparently she had asked for the big slab slices(she hadn't), I was rude to her(I wasn't), and I had charged for what she wanted, rather than what she got(literally impossible). The boss pulls me off what I was doing to confirm that none of this was true, and then proceeds to mock the customer in front of the entire store, probably like 12 customers.

""OH JA, TOO THIN, TOO THIN, YOU WANT THIN YOU GET THIN, HE SAYS THIN AND SHOWS THIN AND YOU SAY 'JA, THIN!' AND HE CUTS THIN! TOO THIN, HAHAHAHAHAHA!""

""Well we're never coming back here!""

""OH JA, JA, WE MISS YOU, OH JA. YOU GO, GOODBYE, HAHAHA!""

Then he walked back to his office and shut the door. The customer took his meat and left, embarrassed, and never returned.

Here is one of the Gems.  

We use to have an employee that worked with us who's sole job was to rip tickets.  Her only duty was to sit at the entrance of the hallway, rip the ticket and point in the direction of the corresponding theater while also looking for people sneaking in food and drinks (during her shifts we have found anything from a med pizza hut pizza to a 30 pack of PBR).  This was the only job she could do because she had cerebral palsy and could not stand for extended periods of time.  I get that.  I was glad she was able to do that job for us.  However, she was one of the meanest bitches I have ever known.  Unrelenting bitch.  She prided herself at being an intellectual.  And I admit she was extremely intelligent.  But any chance she could to rub that shit in our faces or tell us what to do she would.  I think most of us honestly felt bad that she had cerebral palsy and took her nonsense with a grain-of-salt.  

This one day we were busy as hell with a bunch of sold out showings of one of the Harry Potter movies and all of us were busting our asses to stay on top of the rush.  During some downtime while the movies were playing we were all cleaning up and chatting.  Another employee was telling us about a date he had gone on with a girl he really liked while cleaning the counters.  The ticket ripping bitch decides to tell this employee that he was doing a shitty job cleaning the counter.  He shrugged it of and continued with his story.  Again she interrupted and said said something like ""you are so stupid you can barely clean a counter.  If I was this girl, I would be a complete idiot to ever go on a second date with you let alone the first.""  

The employee stopped wiping the counter took a deep breath and calmly told the ticket ripper to please not talk to him the rest of the day.  The ticket ripper began to interject but before she could utter a sound the employee cut her off by loudly proclaiming ""[ticket ripper] IF YOU DO NOT SHUT THE FUCK UP RIGHT NOW I AM GOING TO BEND YOU OVER THAT TICKET HOPPER YOU CALL HOME AND FUCK YOUR LEGS STRAIGHT.  THAT'S RIGHT [ticket ripper] I AM GOING TO HATE FUCK YOU TILL YOUR LEGS START WORKING PROPER."" 

The room fell absolutely silent as everyone waited for the employee to apologize.  Instead he put both middle fingers in the air and mimicked her walk all the way into the back room.

The employee was sent home for the day and written up.  He later ended up becoming the head manager a few years later.

Shortly after this both companies decided to find out who had the best customer base by sending out coupons for free cups of tea to both customer bases via email, social media, and mailers.

The coupon's are all the same, and theyre for the same hot cup of the same tea. There has never been a coupon for another type of tea. 

Cue Angry Customer last night. Its been a crazy day my computer went down twice, had our IT department in and out of the store upgrading our scanners, and had already had four people come in just to rant about nothing, as if my job title was ""Psychologist"" and not Team Lead.

Im working on getting paperwork filled out and in comes a guy with a free cup coupon. One of my staff fills a cup for him and then he asks if its caffeinated the following is what happens.

Associate: Yes, its caffeinated.

Angry Guy: I cant have it then, Im allergic to caffeine. Can I have another cup that isnt caffeinated?

Associate: Well the coupon is only for this tea, if I give you a free cup of anything else I could get in trouble.

AG: Let me see your manager!

Me (Since Im within earshot of it all): Im the current manager on duty, how can I help you?

AG: Your sales person is lying to me! She says this coupon is only good for this kind of tea, and thats discriminatory against people allergic to caffeine! The coupon doesnt specify that its for this kind of tea, and thats illegal, Im going to file a report with the BBB, and sue you.

Me: Sir, the only coupon for a free cup that's gone out in the last month is for this specific tea, while I agree that its not fair to people with caffeine sensitivities and allergies, Its beyond my authority to change the coupon. If you'd like I can give you the number for corporate and if they say its ok I'll gladly change it.

AG: FINE! I'll call corporate, and Im going to get you all fired!

~AG Puts phone on speaker, while still in store and calling corporate. He proceeds to threaten corporate with taking his business elsewhere (He's spent nothing in my store in the last 2.5 years I've been there.) Then says if they dont honor the coupon that doesnt exist he'll sue the company and win. Corporate informs him that the only coupon that will be honored is the one for the aforementioned tea. He calls my staff, the person at corporate, and myself liars and hangs up saying they'll hear from his lawyers.~

Me: Alright sir, lets look at your coupon again. 

AG: No! You'll just make up another lie to not help me!

Me: Sir, I'd like to help you out, but first I'd need to see the terms on the coupon. If you're right, you're right and regardless of corporate saying they didnt put out a coupon with no stipulations, Ill get you a cup.

AG: Alright! 

~AG Shows me coupon, it absolutely says its for the exact tea my staff member, corporate, and myself said it was for. I point this out to him.~

AG: Oh... I guess I just didnt read it. Its still stupid. I was looking forward to my free cup of tea. 

Me: Sorry. However, I will say this much, in the future when dealing with sales people niceness works a lot better. If you didn't jump straight to calling my staff liars, and threatening us, I would have probably given you a cup of whatever you like.

AG: So I can have a cup of whatever I want?

Me: Absolutely not. Have a nice day!

AG: I'm never shopping here again!

Me: So pretty much the same as normal?

AG: $%^ YOU!

_____________________________

I work in a processing centre for mortgage applications, there's a call centre above my office and we have like 3 buildings in this one location. Anyway, in my office we're not really trained to do ""call centre"" style work, taking shit from customers all day, getting screamed at when things don't go their way, etc. We're just the processing guys, right? We look at all your documents and decide whether or not you can have a mortgage.

So, we do have like 2 phones that take ""external"" calls. I.e. calls from other departments, not from customers. So some fucknut from the actual call centre is getting screamed at by this one dude, so she transfers him straight through to my department.

Enter my colleague, we'll call her McPreggers, you get 1 guess as to why. I'm sat opposite her and can hear this dude on the other end of the phone just fucking UNLOADING into her ear canal (wasn't that sexy sounding, I assure you), until it happens. She starts to weep. No sound, no sniffling, no reaction whatsoever except a constant stream of tears.

Now, I've been in similar situations when training call centre staff and customer facing staff before, generally you have to help people find a way to deal with shit like this on their own and build up their own defenses for it. This is a 24ish year old pregnant girl with no business being screamed at, being screamed at by some asshat.

I get up from my desk, walk around to hers, take the phone away from her and hit the ""hold customer"" button:

""McPreggers, take five, stop worrying about it and come back when you're ready""

She walks off. Now, to Asshat on the phone:

""Good afternoon Sir, my name's The-Average-Gatsby and I'd like to help you resolve your query as efficiently as possible. Before we continue, I'd like to apologise for abruptly putting you on hold like that, but here's why. McPreggers, the girl with whom you were speaking to in a completely unacceptable and childish manner just now, is heavily pregnant, and you have reduced her to tears. What can I help you with today?""

Asshat tightens up right quick. His issue is sorted within 2-3 minutes (wasn't a tough one, just a tough customer) and he's trying to get off the phone again.

""Before you go sir, can I just ask you to hold for one moment please?""

HE ACTUALLY FUCKING STAYS ON THE LINE. I go get McPreggers.

""Hello sir, thanks for holding, I'm just going to pass you back to my colleague to whom you may apologise if you feel it necessary. Thank you and have a lovely afternoon.""

All I hear is McPreggers:

""That's okay, it's ok. I'm fine, thank you. Thank you, have a lovely day.""

I had worked there for almost a year as a cook, and though I hated the job, I generally got along well with my coworkers and supervisors.

One day an old middle school friend calls me up to tell me he's coming to visit for the weekend in a couple weeks, and I told him I'd request the weekend off so we could hang out. The next day I put in my request and it's granted, no questions asked.

The night before my friend is supposed to arrive I report to work for my shift and walk into the manager's office to check my schedule as I always do. Immediately, I notice that my two requested days off now have ""12pm-8pm"" hastily scrawled onto them in pencil in the manager's handwriting, who was sitting a few feet away talking to the assistant manager. Before I even had a chance to react, I blurted out ""What the hell!?"" 

The two managers paused their conversation and said ""Something wrong, Dcoil1?"" 

""Uh, yeah, I requested these two days off two weeks ago. Now you've penciled in that I'm working 12-8?""

Store Manager: ""Yeah, So-and-so quit yesterday and we need someone to work that shift.""

Me: ""Well, I'm sorry, but I have a friend coming into town this weekend and we made plans. I don't think I can work this schedu-""

Assistant Manager: ""It's not a question of whether or not you *can* work that shift, Dcoil1. You're GOING to work that shift!""

I was furious. I couldn't even say another word, I just scowled at them and stormed out. I spent the whole night fuming, not saying another word to them and weighing my options and trying to decide if I really needed this job or not. At the end of my shift, I didn't stick around one extra minute. I punched out at exactly the time I was scheduled off.

The next morning I called in, and the Assistant Manager answered. I said ""Hi, this is Dcoil1. I'm not coming in today, because I asked for it off and was approved, and you guys put me back on the schedule without even consulting me or asking whether I can work the shift. I don't appreciate being told I *have* to work a shift. You can fire me if you want, but I'm not working today.""

ASM: ""....fine."" *Click*

I thought surely I was getting canned, but I had a great weekend despite of it with my friend, and when my next shift rolled around, I walked in and punched in like nothing happened, and no one said a word to me.

Orange Bitch Be Trippin'

It is a steady afternoon in the world of thongs and titty slings, general crowds milling about and I'm not working alone...for once (yay for that social interaction!).Being the occasional casual slacker I find myself walking around touching bras, yes just ""touching"" them, acting like I'm doing important bra inspection shit so I don't actually HAVE to do anything. 

Greeting customers like a pro and got that plastic retail smile on my face; I got this shit down to an ART. Hiding behind a rack scanning the perimeter and I see Orange Bitch (OB) and her mother (Nice Lady Mum/NLM) looking at the push-up bras, time to make that sale and I swoop in like Jesus.

Orange Bitch is about 15-17 (I'm guessing the younger end of the spectrum), 5'6, fake blonde hair (I know it's ""fake"" cause you can see dem brown roots!), white *insert popular brand name here* v-neck, silver necklace with what looks like a cross on it or a T, navy *insert popular brand name here* shorts which are in my humble opinion too short, some damn ugly gladiator sandals and her cell phone glued to her plastic nails. Oh and I forgot she's fucking orange. No she's not fucking an orange. She embodies the colour orange; she IS orange. While her mum is short, plump, rosy cheeked, smiley, in typical mom capris and plain t-shirt.

Anyways, I swoop in like the messiah, put on my sweet buttery retail voice and ask if they need any help. Orange Bitch is giving me the stink eye stating that they don't need help while nice lady mum is explaining that her daughter needs a strapless bra for homecoming. Easy enough right. Ha. I wish. Nice lady mum is assisting me picking out bras for OB while OB herself is looking like either a. She has to fart, b. She just smelt a fart, or c. She just did fart. Nice lady mum and I get a small handful and send her on into the fitting room with varying sizes because Orange Bitch doesn’t know her size and doesn’t want to be measured.

The minutes drag on and nice lady mum has to go meet grandma at the other size of the store so Orange Bitch stays with me while I continue to try to help her. 10 minutes pass and she emerges out of the fitting room so being nice sales girl that I am I ask if it went ok.

OB replies, “Nooooothing fits me. I want to try some more on.”

Fair enough, sometimes I can’t nail down a customer’s expectations the first time….it happens (very rarely but still happens). So I’m walking around with OB while she picks out bras to try on (totally deviating for the strapless bra she actually NEEEEDS but whatever). I’m being polite to the carrot-like humanoid while she waves her phone in numerous directions pointing me where to go like a mule with a carrot, no big deal nice lady mum will be back soon. Out of the wild blue yonder OB see’s THE bra, OHMYGODSHELIKEHASTOHAVEIT, so she makes her first mistake (other than being a general cuntybaws to her mother) she snaps her fingers at me above her head three times while calling, “Bra girl.”

No Way. Keep calm and don’t kill the sloot with your highland rage.

The problem with THE bra is it is on a 5ft mannequin…on a 5ft shelf…above the 5ft racks…on a wall. Being 5’2 I’m like sheeeiiiittttt, I can’t reach that but whatever customer comes first so I tell her I’m going to put the bras we already have selected in her fitting room and while she tries them on I’ll be out here getting this one. Orange Bitch just looks at me like I’m a one legged dolphin, “Ummm no. I WANT to try on THAT bra First.”

All right all right calm your pants.

Not being allowed to have a ladder (some other coworker fell off one a while ago so now no one in lingerie can use ladders) I tried to figure out how to go about this. The mannequins were legless and attached to a wide and heavy metal base on top of the shelf. So I had to slide the mannequin and then brace myself for all it’s weight (those bad boys are heavy….good thing I’m a beast). I’m teetering back and forth like a weeble wobble, while my face rests on the soft microfiber crotch that was hiding the mannequins plastic shame and my childlike hands were clinging onto its arse for dear life. All the while Orange Bitch was telling me that she doesn’t have a lot of time yadda yadda yadda…I drop the mannequin, tear off its arms like some savage beast (they’re magnetic, relax), strip it faster than Jim Levenstein stripped himself in 1999 and toss OB the bra, disgusted at this animalistic act of speed and agility OB retreats into the fitting room.

It takes Orange Bitch about 3.5minutes to reappear, NO WAY has she tried on ALL of those bras, dangling THE bra from her over privileged finger.

“Ummm like… I don’t like it so I’m gonna look some more.” She queefs in a nasally voice.

Sure fine whatever. I ask if she’s done with the previous bras, she says yes, I trot into the fitting room to clean them up. I was not prepared for this.

I go into the first stall on the left (Orange Bitch’s Room) and holy flying fuck monkeys it looks like a lingerie dealership threw up in there whilst pissing a Bombay hooker’s bodyspray. There are about 17-22 bras ON THE FLOOR, orange marks on the light coloured bras, a coffee cup on the ledge, lipgloss smears on the mirror, ANOTHER coffee cup on the floor AND WHAT LOOKS LIKE PERIOD BLOOD ON THE FLOOR. You must be thinking oh it may not have been her, lots of people use the fitting rooms on a daily basis…We check out fitting rooms every 30 minutes (at the very least) to make sure this isn’t an issue. I was on fitting room duty that day, I checked it, and so I bloody well know it was her.

I slouch out of the room with my arms full of countless items, grumbling to myself, and then I see the hand and hear the snap. Awww hell no….

snapsnapsnap

“Bra girl. Braaaa girl. I need this bra.” Orange Bitch chirps pointing to yet ANOTHER 5ft mannequin on a 5ft self above a 5ft rack. You have got to be kidding me.

So I drop everything on my cluttered register and go to assist Orange Bitch. Keep in mind this bitch probably can’t even drive yet and is snapping at me and it is taking all my self-control not to push her down and sit on her ‘til she cries. I wrestle/molest yet another mannequin and hand her the bra and she floats off into fitting room.

FINALLY nice lady mum comes back and asks if we have a bra to buy yet and I politely tell her that I am unsure because Orange Bitch has been trying on more than strapless bras, nice lady mum does not look happy and marches into the fitting room. I wait outside and listen.

“Orange Bitch, I’ve been gone half an hour and you still can’t find a bra???” – NLM

“It’s not myyyyy fault MOOOOOM. That stupid chunky bra girl doesn’t know what she’s doing.” – OB

WUT. You have the nerve to call me stupid when you can’t even contain your own menstrual blood??? And don’t even get me started on the “chunky” accusation. My rage is showing but I keep listening.

“The bra girl knows what she’s doing, she’s helped me before, she told me you were trying on more than strapless bras.” – NLM

“NO she doesn’t MOOOOOM. She practically threw one of those model ladies at me and made me go in a dirty fitting room.” – OB

AWWW HELL NOOOOO….ORANGE BITCH IS ABOUT TO BECOME ORANGE PULP.

“I saw you go in it looked fine. And I doubt anyone could throw those mannequins.” NLM (total GGG)

“It was after youuuuu left that she made the room dirty, goddamn it I don’t want anything anymore I wanna go home.” – OB 

Now I generally don’t care about disrespectful customers but it irks me when a child is rude to a parent especially a lady as nice as nice lady mum, I’ve served nice lady mum before and she’s wonderful and sweet and just awesome, pleasure to chit chat with. Nice lady mum gives into to Orange Bitch and tells her to get dressed and they’ll go home. Leaving Orange Bitch to get dressed nice lady mum wanders down to the towels.

Showtime. I meet Orange Bitch outside the fitting room.

“Did anything work for you ma’am?” I say cheerily.

“No. Nothing in this stupid store fits, I’m going to go to *popular bra store*.” Orange Bitch replies while handing me bras…well she doesn’t hand me then as much as drop them at my feet.

The rage is coming.

“But I’ve been helping you for over an hour now and you didn’t find ANYTHING?” I push, waiting for the right time.

“God I told youuuuu, nothing fits me here.” – Orange Bitch sighs trying to shrug past me.

I keep my footing strong.

“So I cleaned your fitting room and will probably have to again, took down two large and heavy mannequins that need 2 people to lift, waited on you hand and foot and you still didn’t find anything?” I politely stated.

“Well that’s your job. You’re a BRA GIRL. You’re SUPPOSED to wait on people like me so you get paid.” Orange Bitch said snidely while looking me up and down like I had leprosy.

Fuck it. 

“Listen Missy, just cause your mother puts up with your shit doesn’t mean my job is above smacking you in the mouth.” I said, lowering my voice.

Orange Bitch didn’t say anything just stood there with her mouth open looking like a hungry catfish, so I decided to add on a little more.

“Plus who’s my manager going to believe? Me? An employee of over 2 years with good standing? Or a whiney spoiled little girl?”

Orange Bitch spluttered and stuttered while marching off in a huff. Victory was mine.

TL:DR My jimmies get in such a bunch that I physically threaten a customer.

Nice days mean nice cars at the station.  And given the wealth of the neighborhood, ""nice cars"" mean stuff the rest of us only ever see at car shows, race tracks, and while playing Need for Speed.  The car that BDB1 (Bald Douche Bag 1) drove in that day was no exception.  A gloss-black, 630 hp, 6.5L V-12 Lamborghini Murcielago LP 640 Roadster.  A car worth more than most people's houses.  Also something completely unreasonable to own in a residential location with a relatively low highway speed limit.

I definitely noticed the car drive in, because it's impossible NOT to notice the throaty rumble of a Lambo as it idles up into a parking lot.  I watched as one of our attendants goes over, greets the driver, does the usual she-bang to figure out what to get him, etc etc.  But things get a pit odd when the attendant goes to the pump and tries to use the card given to him.  He's obviously having difficulty with something, but he's a bit too far away to see what.  He goes back to the driver, speaks with him for a moment, and then hurriedly backs up as the driver flings open the door and starts storming towards the store.  BDB1 then rants and gesticulates towards the pumps, to which the attendant quickly moves and begins punching in the codes for a pay-after-the-fact.  Great.  Entitlement, thy name is Lambo owner.

Now BDB1 is very easy to describe.  Imagine Mr Clean.  Same bald head, same tight white shirt, same tight white pants, same musculature.  Now, replace his face with that of Christopher Titus.  You are now 99% accurate.  Oh, and have him doing this rather amazing scowl/sneer to get his mood right.

""Your guy out there can't seem to make my card work!"" he loudly states, slamming what looks like a credit card but doesn't sound like plastic down on the counter.  Ah.  The Black Amex.  Yes, one of those rare and mysterious things that are semi-legend in the retail community.  If you are not familiar with the Black Amex, it's a variation of the Platinum American Express card that you are invited to have.  The minimum monthly payment is $2,500 and it's limit, while not actually being infinity, is EXTREMELY high.  They are very rare and only owned by people or businesses with tons of money.  They are also made out of metal and slightly thicker than standard plastic credit cards.

Which is why it wouldn't run out at the pump, because it physically wouldn't fit in the credit card slot.  A delicious bit of irony, I must say.

""No problem sir, it just seems that your card is a bit thicker than most.  Let me run it here for...ummm...well now, it doesn't seem to fit through this one, either.""

It didn't.  I couldn't get it to fit through the slot on our card reader.  BDB1 then snatched the card out of my hand, and tried himself, but it was pretty obvious it wasn't going to fit without a crowbar being handy.  I smiled apologetically.

""Well then, just type the damned numbers in manually!""

""Sir, I'd like to do that, but in order to do so, I have to run an manual imprint of the card."" (*Aside:* I was quite used to doing this, our satellite connection went down all the freakin' time).  ""I can't do that with your card, because the numbers aren't raised, and they won't allow me to just write them down.  I'm terribly sorry, do you have another card you can pay with?""

Cue a long rant about how this card was supposed to be accepted everywhere, he was worth blah blah blah, he's so important, the usual drill which I quickly tuned out.  As he was stroking his ego to near completion, I was continuing to monitor what was going on outside, just in case something more important could offer me an excuse to dismiss this guy, such as someone dropping a piece of paper on the ground.  But what I instead saw was one of the local cops, pulling up to the store.  While I took note of it, it did not fully register in my mind, since nothing illegal was happening, nor did I expect anything illegal to happen.

So the cop walks in while BDB1 is in midbluster, stops, crosses his arms, and leans against the counter as if to say, ""Boy, I've had a boring shift, but here's something entertaining I can watch for a few minutes.""

I recoalesce my attention on BDB1, and again apologize and ask if he has any other way to pay.  He doesn't WANT to pay another way, he doesn't HAVE to, he's a BLACK AMEX HOLDER.  I explain that since I physically can't accept the card due to equipment issues, I'm going to need another form of payment.  At this point, BDB1 opens his mouth and says something that gives me one of the greatest openings in the history of things being open:

""Well what would you do if I just drove off right now?""

I tried, I really tried not to smile.  But it was too much, and the smile I had was quite broad, as I replied, ""Well sir, I wouldn't be able to do a lot.  But the guy behind you might do something about it.""

BDB1 turns around to see the local cop, standing there with a big feral grin on his face, nodding emphatically.  The color on BDB1's face drained away as his ego deflated down to much more tolerable levels.  In stony silence, he produced a different credit card, ran it, signed for it, and stormed out of the station.  As soon as the door closed, the cop and I both started laughing like crazy.  When I could finally speak again, I told the cop, ""You should go pull him over for having a tail light out or something!""  At which point we cracked up all over again.  Never did see BDB1.

Here's one of my favorites!,supasanic,912,178,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1j3meg/i_work_at_a_pawn_shop_and_just_found_out_about/,"So I was military, and since getting out, I've been working in pawn shops while I've been in school. 

Now, this one kid, probably around 13-14, comes in fairly often with his cousin and sells stuff. We normally don't accept items through a proxy (someone other than original owner), but I've been dealing with him for a while, and it's whatever. 

We'll call the kid J and his older cousin W. 

So J and W come in, and they want to sell a bike. Cool. I look up our inventory of bikes, to see how much I could put into one. We have a few. A co-worker of mine pulls me aside and tells me that they have sold about 5 bikes in the last couple of weeks. This is an issue. If we buy too many of a similar item from the same person in a certain time frame, Pawn Unit Detectives come and do an audit. Ain't nobody got time for that. 

So I inform J and W that I wouldn't be able to purchase the bike. W says ""That's cool, makes sense, I'll come back some other time"" and gets ready to leave. I don't really suspect any wrong-doing, but it's sketchy. 


W is all about leaving, but J decides he can't have that, and proceeds to challenge me. Now, this kid is about 5'4"", maybe 100 lbs soaking wet. I'm about 6'1"", 245, fairly built, and bearded. I'm no where near tough or intimidating, but I can make people think twice about getting loud. 

J then accuses me of being racist (not the first time, won't be the last...happens a lot in this business) and that I won't buy because I think they stole the bike. I tell him, that I don't think that, and repeat my original explanation. 

He continues to get loud, and over and over tells me this is ""fucking bullshit, you don't want to buy from me because I'm black, and you think I stole this shit"" 

Well I didn't, but I'm starting to. So I tell him I wouldn't buy the bike, and he could leave, or I'd stop letting him sell to me altogether. He didn't like that. He got louder and more obnoxious. There were ~4 other people there waiting, and it was getting embarrassing. 

I asked him to leave. I was very polite about it. W was telling him to calm down and just leave. J was not having it. 

Tells me to fuck off. I say okay, and go get my manager. Now. My store manager is all but 5'2"", about 100 lbs, little skinny lady. Nicest person you will ever meet until she gets pissed. So she comes out into the buy shop, and takes a look at the kid. Asks what the issue is. J starts yelling. 

She looks at him, and tells him that unless he's 18 (legal selling age), he can stop talking, and let the grown ups talk. 

So my manager starts talking to W who is visibly nervous/embarrassed. J is still yelling. Myself and another bigger co-worker escort him out. 

As we're walking out the door, a lady gets out of her car and starts screaming at us. Oh great.

Woman starts yelling at us, wondering why we're rough handling a little kid. I explain the situation, being as vague as possible. W comes out of the store. 

Turns out this lady was W's mother, J's aunt. She looks at them both, and proceeds to ask W what happened. He spares no details. She smacked the hell out of J in the parking lot, and tells him to get in the car. Pretty sure J starts crying at this point. My face hurt.

They get in the car and get ready to drive off. The lady apologizes to us, and tells us she doesn't know where he got that kind of attitude from. She drives off, and we can see her losing her mind just screaming at this kid.

1371606743.0,728,self.TalesFromRetail,1gml24,The dread lobster cart,toxlab,956,228,160,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1gml24/the_dread_lobster_cart/,"Something reminded me of this tale of uncomfortable nonsense, thought I'd share:


I was working at a very high end steak house as a cook. The prices were high, and most of the clientele very well behaved. It was a premium joint: the folks who made it past the ""sticker shock"" of the menu were often quite appreciative of our efforts. We were providing cuisine, not food. 

The menu was very simple. Four or five cuts of steak, one chicken dish, and live Maine lobster. A few circus sized veggie portions, and that's all. We were very good at what we did. 

I was on saute, which meant I cooked the veggie sides, the chicken, and the lobsters. The lobsters were HUGE. I mean, bigger than your head huge. A fairly well known musician once described them as ""bigger than a puppy"". I think the smallest one I saw in a year of working there was four and a half pounds.

I had to dispatch these brutes. 

No simple trip into boiling water for these guys. You had to split them down the middle, put the halves on a baking tray, melted butter on the tails, remove the pouch like stomach from the head cavity, and add in heavy cream. 

The tasty bugs would still be flailing their legs around as you set them in a broiler. The cavities would release air as they died. This meant you were sticking a screaming animal into a fire. The tiny little ""aaaaaaah"" that came out was disconcerting. Especially after you poured in the cream. Imagine filling a screaming animal's face with liquid. You got ""aaaaaaaahgbgbgbb"". 

***EVERY. FREAKING. TIME.***



But, like anything, it comes easier with practice. You stop flinching after a while. 

Now, this steak house doesn't have a printed menu. Instead, the have a cart that is rolled up to the table. Well heeled servers describe each item, even providing a provenance for your beef... (holding up 18 oz steak) ""This meat was raised by XYZ in XYZ town for our exclusive stockyards.""

The ""great reveal"" was the lobster. After describing everything else, They would swoop the five or six pound critter off its silver tray. Lobsters do not enjoy being held. They show this by opening and closing their tails toward their bodies. Underwater, this allows them to escape from predators. On land, this means they are slapping their tails against their bodies as you struggle to hold on. A food critic once called it, ""being threatened with a live animal."" It was certainly dramatic.

The servers would call it back. ""Whack a six."" This meant dispatch a six pounder. I did this all night long. Lobster blood is thick and grey, and once it hit the cutting board (or your jacket) it turned into grey jello. You are covered in slime, putting a bisected arthropod into a firey furnace. 

Whenever new hires were shown around the restaurant, I would make sure to have a lively one ready for the knife. ""Hey, welcome. I'm toxlab. I kill lobsters. Like this guy, here. His name is Kenneth. Hi, Kenneth! How are you? Would you like some lemons and melted butter? Sure, I just have to do one thing first..."" **WHAM!** Knife through the carapace. Split the tail. Swing it around. ""What's that? Not your head? but what if I just...**WHAM!** Butter, cream, oven. Hey look, he's dancing in the broiler.

I would amuse myself with these little dialogues. Especially when they got to the ten pound and up range. Those suckers fought back. I would pet them and make up back stories for these guys. Whole telenovelas were acted out for the amusement of my cohorts. 

One week, we got the biggest lobster I'd ever seen. I was dying to whack him. It would be like landing a marlin. I made sure he was covered with wet newspapers to keep him feisty. He wouldn't be an easy sell. The price per pound put it almost into the thousands. He would be a gourmet treat for four people or more. 

The order finally came through. Time to dispatch Big Daddy. YES! I ran to get him. 

I cradled it with both arms. My coworkers were amused. They knew I had been waiting for this.

Little did they know, I already had a scenario figured out. He was the ""new fish"" in jail, and I was the sexually reprehensible Victor Wolf. ""Hey there"", I patted his shell. ""things in here is mighty dangerous. I can help you out, if you know what I mean...""  The other cooks are snickering. It moves forward a little. I drag it to the edge of the board. ""Oh, yeah. Feisty. I like that."" I drag it to the edge and start humping the back of it's tail. ""Say my name, baby. Call me daddy. Yeah. Yeah."" Knife goes up, overhand psycho style. **WHAM!** I pin him to the board. I look over. My coworkers are looking back at me, smiling.

And then I notice. At the edge of the serving window, behind us, is a little girl.

She is petting one of the cart lobsters.

She has a look of pure horror on her face. One hand is by her side. The other is touching the cart lobster's back. Her mouth is wide open. 


""Oh!! Oh God! Oh God!"" I stammer. The giant lobster is trying to flap his enormous tail. I have to finish cutting him in half. Then the butter and the cream. By the time I've finished this, she was running across the room. I wince in preparation for the biggest ass chewing ever.

My guess is she just didn't have the words to describe what she saw. They ate, paid and left.


I toned down my act after that. I imagine it made for some very entertaining therapy sessions down the line...

I understand sales, really, I do. I've had to do them, no one enjoy them, yada yada. But I work in retail. I know what I want. And I'm a customer. So here I am ready to drop big bucks on a mattress, I do online shopping, investigate the deals, visit the smaller stores like ""Drowsies"". I figure the best and most straight forward deal will be at a semi local furniture outlet, known for the three guys that started it Nick Ron and Pete. So come holiday weekend, sale begins I go in. There's like five dudes on the floor in mattresses alone. I walk in and it's like being cornered by lions. I very loudly and very clearly state ""This is whats up, I need a mattress. I already did my bargain shopping, I know I'm buying it here but I really want to make sure I get the RIGHT ONE. Which means I am going to lay down on the mattress for a minimum of five minutes, in different positions, and ensure they are comfortable. I do not need assistance at this moment.""

Long story short, all but one dude in there comes up and bothers me while I'm trying them out. Telling me I should buy this I should buy that I need this one have I tried that one over there? What about this? Each one I politely rebuff, say no thanks, don't need help. They are persistent to a douchebaggery level until I snap at each one and tell them when I need help I'll friggen ask for it now back off. It's like a contest to see who will win my sale.

Maybe 45 minutes later, I decide on a mattress. I walk up directly to the guy who did not offer me assistance after my proclamation of leaving me the fuck alone, and tell him I'm ready. Other salesmen behind desk go APESHIT. I can see the whispers. The guys asks why me? I tell him he's the only one that listened to my needs as a customer.

Threatens to strangle me because of it.,ImAMattressSalesman,906,176,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1htliq/customer_doesnt_know_how_an_exchange_works/,"I have been working for a large mattress retailer, managing and selling mattresses for the last 10 years. As you can assume, I have amassed a large number of stories from ridiculous and unbelievably stupid customers but this one is one of my favorites. A customer came in to our store one afternoon and explained that his current box spring was deemed defective and he wanted to exchange it for a new one and buy a new mattress in addition to the exchange. Not a problem, one of my sales associates took care of him and being new to retail sales ended up giving way too big of a discount on the bed, but whatever, the customer is happy. Or so I thought... About two days later I am leaving my shift and headed home to change and take my gf out to a concert for the night when I get a call on my cell phone from a number I don't recognize. I decide to answer it, and Immediately regret this decision as my casual greeting of ""hello"" is met with a barrage of insults and demands of someone who is in a crazy fit of rage. Keep in mind, I am off of work and do not give customers my personal cell phone number so I am extremely confused as to not only what this person is talking about, but also how they were able to get my number. I begin to piece together that this is the customer who had set up a warranty exchange the other day, and he has been berating my sales staff all afternoon and one of them has cracked and given him my number under duress (big big no no, but one problem at a time). Being the customer service professional that I believe myself to be, decide to hear this angry customer out and find out how we have wronged him. By the way he is yelling at me, I'm assuming we have killed his dog or brought some sort of irreversible shame upon his family, but it turns out that the drivers had refused him the exchange we set up a few days ago. After listening to this customers opinions on my management/business skills being shouted at me for a few more minutes I'm able to find out why the drivers had refused his exchange... The customer gave away his defective box spring. There was nothing to exchange for because he got rid of it. He didn't know he had to keep the defective product for the exchange... ""EXCHANGE! Meaning we take the old product and you take the new stuff! That's how an exchange works you fucking dipshit! It's called a fucking exchange!"" Is what I wanted to scream into the phone, but I calmly tried to explain to the customer as if he was a 4 year old, how an exchange works and why the drivers weren't going to give him a new box spring for free. This still didn't make sense to him, and he had become even more angry because ""he owned his own business, and would never treat his customers this way."" Really guy? So if I buy a refrigerator from you, call you up a year later and tell you that it's broken, I can come in and get a new one free of charge without giving you back the old one with no proof of any defect? Yeah. Once I put it in these terms the guy decided to end our call by telling me that he is going to come strangle me. 

He never did, and he never got his exchange. Fuck that guy. 

TL;DR: Customer thinks an exchange is a one sided transaction, and berates my sales staff and I about it. Ends up threatening to kill me because of it.

Back in the late 80s, when the Japanime craze was just hitting the states, our shop was the only place in the city to purchase merch. imported directly from Japan.  Manga, videos, magazines, model kits...you name it, the boss was bringing it in.  This was just about the time that ""Robotech"" had hit the airwaves, and we couldn't keep those kits in stock to save our lives. 

So...one day, a mom comes in with a huge Robotech model kit that she had purchased during our Christmas sale...two months prior.  Big sucker, over $100 retail.  

**Mom**: I need to return this model kit.  It's broken. I need my money back.

**AX**: Broken?  I'm sorry to hear that.  I'll need to see your receipt and the model kit. 
(Now, she actually had the receipt.  I opened the box to see what the problem was...)

**AX**: Ma'am, you do realize that over half the kit has already been put together, right? 

**Mom**: That doesn't matter.  The pieces have broken off and I want my money back.  

**AX**: The pieces are supposed to break off.  See, this is called a 'sprue.""  The pieces for the kit are attached to it until they are broken off by the builder to put the kit together. 

**Mom**: No..the model kit is broken.  I want my money back. 
(The entire time, the kid (""Bobby"")who had been building the thing was standing there, just staring at Mom). 

**Bobby**: Mom, you're really embarrassing me...

**Mom**: Shut up! I'm trying to get you some money back so you can build a better kit.  One that won't break!  (to me) Now, are you giving me the money back or not?

**AX**:  I'm sorry, but not only has this kit already been used, but you'll note the sign behind me that says ""No Refunds - Exchanges Only, Within 30 Days.""  I couldn't give you anything for it in any condition. 

**Mom**: (comments of outrage and shock).  We're never coming here again!  
At that point, she scoops up the box, the kid, and storms out. 

...fast forward...1 week later...the kid is back, this time with his dad. 

As you might guess, he also had the kit.  The conversation that ensues creates an atmosphere of deja vu for the employees, who are observing from afar.  Finally...

**Dad**: I don't understand why you won't give me my money back.  This kit is obviously broken.  I just bought it last week! 

**AX**: Actually sir, your wife came in with your son and tried to return this just last week, and I...

**Dad**: Quit Lying!  My wife has never been in this store before in her life.  I'm the only one who ever comes in here! 

**AX**: Sir (I say, pointing to the boy looking at our other model kits) is that your son? 

**Dad**: Yeah, so? 

**AX**: Hey, ""Bobby,"" how's it going? 

**Bobby**: Fine, AX.  (with an ""i'm really sorry"" face)

**AX**: So.....

Dad: (also grabs the box and kid and storms out).  You're all a bunch of cheats! 

**Bobby**: See you next Friday! 

**AX**: You bet! (thumbs up!) 

And even thought Mom said they'd never come back, ""Bobby"" was in every Friday when the new kits came in.

The job is easy, basically I'm a janitor that does my job plus whatever other random nonsense management feels the need to assign me.

Now, the rant:

I am grateful to have this job.  I went quite awhile without any gainful employment, and I wash the bathrooms with a smile on my face because I'm grateful to be earning a paycheck.  My complaint isn't (surprisingly) with management, but with other associates, specifically one certain cashier.  We'll call her Jane.

Jane is lazy.  She wanders off from her register and somebody has to hunt her down when she has customers.  She's no-called/no-showed three times, and she's still employed for some reason. 

If something is spilled, no matter how small, she'll call maintenance to the register.  She did this for a spill the size of the palm of my hand.  Management has told her multiple times that I have a list of things I need to complete by 7am, and that if it is a small manageable spill, she's to grab some paper towels and clean it up herself.  I work hard at my job, and I dislike her for being lazy at hers.  I don't mind cleaning up a quick spill for anyone, usually it is part of my job (at least the big spills), but I'm not the Store Slave.  She seems to think otherwise.

/end rant, and on to the sweet, sweet justice. 

There is no first shift maintenance this morning, so I had extra duties to complete before my shift was over.  No problem, I finished everything at 6am like I tend to do and started to help a friend wrap up stocking his aisle.  7am rolls around, and I swipe my name badge and I'm off the clock!

Now, the company I work for has a very strict 'Do not work off the clock' policy.  I follow this policy very closely.  Just as I walk out of the back room after clocking out, I hear Jane's voice over the intercom, ""Maintenance to register 7, Maintenance to register 7.""  I was headed in that direction anyway, but not to clean.  At this point, I was shopping, so I was a customer.  She sees me, and with this really nasty attitude, snaps ""Register 7, maintenance!""  I grinned back and as 'fake nicely' as I could, waved my badge and said ""Off the clock!""

Turns out, because there was no first shift maintenance and no 3rd shift maintenance clocked in, she had to clean up a big, broken jar of jalapeno peppers that had been dropped right next to her register.  I realize that she was clocking out mere minutes after I was, but the fact that she had to clean up the mess sent delicious shivers down my spine.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1k0tkl,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1k0tkl/a_mini_rant_and_some_sweet_sweet_justice/,

Short background: 
I work at the local movie theater, usually behind the concession stand. During the summer we usually get a few day cares a week that take the kids out to the most recent childrens movie. It's great when they call ahead to let us know they're coming, even greater when they say they're not buying concessions. I know it's better for the theater if they do buy stuff, but honestly I die a little inside when I hear I'm going to have to make snack packs for 100 kids. 

Story:
On a fine Thursday morning, we get a call saying there's about 27 kids coming to see one of the morning showtimes of Despicable Me 2. Great, easy enough. However, the kids are bringing their own money to buy concessions. Not a problem, mornings usually aren't that busy and children are usually some of the nicest and most polite customers we get. 

The day care arrives, and I go through about three kid's orders when this one kid comes up with a decent sized wad of bills in his hand. He orders a drink, some popcorn, a hotdog, and a box of candy. Now, this kid is about 9 or 10 years old and I know he can't carry all that himself. I ask him if he would like a tray to help carrying that to his movie, and naturally he says yes. So I go get a tray and help him put all his food and drinks into it. As he turned from the concession stand I saw all of the kids' faces around him light up with amazement. Many began to whisper about the kid and his tray, ""look at how much Billy got!"" 

The next kid asks for a box of Sour Patch Kids. I get the candy and am finish ringing him up when he sheepishly asks for a tray. Even though we both know he doesn't need it, his face is full of hope and I just can't crush this kid's dreams. He gets his tray and has the widest grin as he goes to stand by Billy. For the remaining ~10 orders, about 8 or 9 of them asked for a tray even if they only just had a drink or a box of candy. I smiled and watched them all go off to their movie feeling all warm and fuzzy inside.

I have shared many of my Loss Prevention shenanigans over the few weeks I have been on here, but I wanted to share with you the one story that always gets a shocked response whenever it's told.  Now over my LP career at different institutions, I have been assaulted, spit on, seen a large woman remove $600 worth of clothes from her fat rolls, and even ran a couple of miles to grab a suspect.  But this is the only time I have ever seen a parent neglect a child.

Now shoplifters using children is nothing new.  And usually it incurred a charge of child endangerment.  However sometimes the cops would let it slide if the person co operated and the child was so young they had no way of knowing what was going on.  That being said, we begin our tale.

One fine sunny afternoon, I am working at (a store we will call GdNickels), doing my LP thing.  My female co worker, ""Stacy"" is watching these two teenaged girls, pushing baby carriage around, with a blanket covering the inside of the carriage.  The two girls are acting suspicious, removing clothing without looking at size, style, or price, and taking multiples of each item. Classic signs of shoplifting.  The two girls eventually proceed into a female fitting room, and my co worker goes to get ready to verify that they did not exit with the items and that the fitting room was empty.  

Now our store was two stories right in the middle of the mall, and this fitting room was in the top story right near the exit into the mall.  Sure enough the two girls exit, not a single piece of clothing to be seen. Stacy goes in, verifies the stalls are empty, and right at this time the girls are exiting.  I tell Stacy that the STOP is good, and to proceed.  Now our LP office was on the other side of the store, near the parking lot. So I had to exit the office, and proceed through the store to get to my co worker in case anything happened, without running or causing a scene.  As I am rounding the final corner at a fast walk, I hear Stacy yelling ""HEY STOP COME BACK"".  I round the corner, and out in the mall, about 40 yards away I see Stacy with the baby stroller, no suspects in sight.  I run over and Stacy is standing there going ""They both ran, opposite directions, but I didn't go because theres actually a baby in here.""  

Wat?  

They actually left a real live baby, presumably one of their's, in the stroller when they ran.  I told Stacy to call the cops, bring the kid inside and take care of it, and I'd chase after one of them. Stacy pointed the way of the food court and said ""The fat one went that way.""  Like a slightly overweight lion, chasing after a gazelle the size of a hippo, the chase was on.  

Now our company, as do most, have rules of when you can and cant engage a shop lifter, and when you can and can't give chase.  As with most stores, if they go into the public parking lot, you can't chase, as its a liability.  However in the mall, we had a good standing, so as long as they were in public mall space, and I wasn't knocking old women and 3 year old out of the way, I could chase them to my hearts content.  At this point, Suspect A, who we shall name Queen Hippo, had a 20-30 second head start.  So But our mall was straight, so I could see her waddling in the distance.  I take off, gaining ground trying to not run into anyone. Mall security sees me and starts squaking on the radio.  At one point, I almost hit someone and end up stopping short and falling head first and sliding a short distance, at which the phone kiosk guy yells ""HE'S SAFE"" to chuckles all around. I admit I had a laugh too as I got myself up and took off running.

Anyways, I catch up with the girl right in the food court.  As I'm commanding her to stop, she turns and starts attempting to swing at me.  Fortunently for her, the police who are always in the mall have been alerted and are right there, so they grab her before I can.  She starts yelling that I am chasing her, tryna ""grab on her goodies"", and they should ""get dis white boy offa me"".  The cops naturally just look at me and say ""What have we got Drunken_Black_Belt?'  I tell them shoplifting pants and such.  She of course continues to say she doesn't know what we are talking about and that I'm tryna rape her.  So thats when I drop the big bombshell:

""Ok, we will get this sorted out, but first we need to know. The baby you abandoned, is it yours or the other girls?""  

The cops naturally have a look of ""WAT?"" on their face.  I explain the two girls left a baby behind, and that  Stacy had it.  The girl starts saying its her baby, and that her friend said she'd watch it while she ran from me tryna grab her goodies. I explained that her friend took off too and left her baby there.  She says she doesnt know what I'm talking about and I'm lying. The cops naturally tell her to shut up and start dragging her back to our office.  

I radio Stacy en route, let her know we are on our way back. She informs me the kid is ok, and we have Queen Hippo's license in her purse so its even more proof.  We get Queen Hippo back in the office, cops search her, we sit her down.  Show the cops everything we have, they interview Stacy to get her side with the baby, who was like 8-9 months or so.  So the cops sit down, and explain to Queen Hippo that Department of Child Services are already going to be contacted for an investigation.  But if she lied to them even once, and didn't tell them everything, then they would call them now to have the baby taken away within the hour.  Naturally Queen Hippo broke down, told us who her friend was, who they were stealing for, and even where they were fencing the goods they stole.  Full on ORC info that was gold to us.  Her friend was contacted and told to turn herself in by the end of the day or she'll be charged with child endangerment as well.  Queen Hippo had her kid taken away while they did the investigation (Sorry no info about how that ended up), we got our merch back, a ton of ORC info, got to play with a cute baby for an hour while the cops did their thing, and a quick workout on my part.  All in all a good day.

At my place of employment, we have two titles for workers. You're either a manager or an associate. Managers, their job is pretty straight forward. Paperwork, talking with the owner, and arranging product on the floor.

Associates do everything else. Stocking, checking in product, straightening, and all the janitorial work. That last bit, the janitor stuff, involves cleaning the bathrooms.

Now, I don't mind cleaning the bathrooms. Heck, I actually almost enjoy it. I'm on my own for once, and the bathrooms have great acoustics. So I can sing while I work. But one night... One night, I just couldn't wrap my head around it.

The shift itself had been normal enough, with an steadyish flow of customers. Come closing time, my coworker and I divvy up the closing jobs. Seeing as everyone else hates cleaning the bathrooms, I'm home free. I grab my cleaning bucket, cross the store, and get to work.

The women's room was perfectly fine. Felt a little weird being there, as I'm a dude, but you get used to it. The men's room though....

At some point in the day, a customer must have decided ""This toilet isn't smooth enough."" The only reason I've come to that conclusion is because the men's room toilet was *COVERED* in hand lotion. Tank to base, the lid and the seat. Covered. In lotion. It was such a shock that I actually had to sit down on a cabinet just to contemplate it. After a few minutes, my coworker comes in to grab the garbages, sees me sitting, sees the toilet, and promptly joins me on the cabinet.

Now, I'm not a janitor. I don't know what's best for cleaning up hand lotion. Naturally, I default to my manager. After doing my best to explain the situation, she's forced to come to the bathroom with us to see for herself.

Never in my life would I have guessed I'd find myself in a five minute silence as me and two other people stared at a toilet. I also never guessed I'd have to wash an entire toilet with Pinesol.

I ask him if which one he was after, offering him all his choices. He seems interested in the 5 pack. I explain to him that it does not include the newest game, and it is just a collection of the first five. He says ""That's perfect!"" and off he goes.

Cue to yesterday. I open the store, and right at 10am I get a call from this same guy, ""Yeah, I want to return this game."" So I ask, ""Was there something wrong with it?"" 

""No man, they wanted the new one."" 

""Did you open this one? Is it still wrapped in plastic?""

""Yep, still wrapped in plastic.""

""Cool, if you have the original receipt, I can get you a cash refund or put the full amount towards the right game, whichever you'd like. Otherwise it will be store credit.""

""Cool. I'll see you in a bit.

Cut to a few hours later. The guy comes in, the game is unwrapped and looks like it was chewed on by a dog.

""So can I get my cash back?"" He says this shoving the receipt at me.

""Sorry sir, this game has been opened and it is damaged. I'm not going to be able to do anything but a trade in on it.""

""Well what is the trade in worth?""

""Up to $18 store credit, $8 cash.""

""BULLSHIT! You told me if I brought it in with the receipt, I could get a cash refund!""

""I also asked you multiple times if the game was still sealed up in the plastic, and you told me it was.""

""NO NO NO! You asked me if *I bought it sealed in plastic* I want my cash!""

""Sorry sir, I can't do that. This game is no where near the condition you bought it in, it has been played and it is destroyed.""

""Sir, I heard him speak with you on the phone, and he asked you if the game was still wrapped in the plastic. Since you lied to us about the condition, we cannot honor what the receipt in your hand says about returns.""

He starts swearing at us, calling us cock suckers, mother fuckers etc. There were customers starting to look uncomfortable. It was hell. That was when I remembered that my tenure with the company was at an end, and that if this guy files a complaint it isn't going to matter to me.

I thought I had heard every lie, endured every sob story, shouldered through every curse word hurdled at me. I've bitten my tongue, restrained snarky replies (to a limit), and pushed down every ounce of fight in me. I used to be happy. I used to trust people. 

But then I worked in retail.

I've seen the cops called on my employers because they would not honor a return without a receipt or any proof that the product is even from us. I've listened as one man went on a screaming tirade about how he was going to hand out balloons that said how much our business sucked because we wouldn't let him use a coupon that expired a year ago. I thought I saw everything.

But then yesterday happened.

Yesterday I caught a woman trying to steal.

Now theft is an issue at my store, a nursery/garden center. Inventory goes missing in people's pockets, their purses, underneath their massive bags of topsoil. There was even one lady who made the owner load her car with stolen goods. He thought he was helping her and he never asked for a receipt. When he came in to yell at me for not stickering her items as sold, I informed him that I never rang her up. 

Needless to say, my boss broke several world records sprinting back to the parking lot and was almost run down by the woman. She stopped. I guess she didn't want to add vehicular manslaughter to her shoplifting charges.

But this was a first for me. Sure I've found the occasional ""forgotten item"" tucked in the corner of a cart, but this time was new.

Due to the main greenhouse being hotter than a Ghost pepper in the summer, the main registers have been closed down for two weeks, and my cashiers and I have being enjoying a slightly cooler location. More like a Caribbean Red Hot pepper. These side registers open to our parking lot and are hardly manned in the summer/winter when there is only one cashier on. Because, regrettably, my boss has yet to find a way to clone me so I can work two registers.

I was working on some managerial stuff and online dress shopping, when a woman in bright blue pants caught my eye. Mainly because the blue was so blinding that when I closed my eyes it remained burned on my retinas. I watched as she approached the open register (where the other cashier was ringing up a sale) and then continue on past it right for our exit.

No ""Thank you for your patronage"" sticker hung from the expensive hanging basket she had in her cart. The other cashier shook her head ""no"" when I inquired if she had rung her up. So I hopped from my post, plastered on my best ""bitch it is on"" smile and approached her.

Me: Hi M'am, sorry to bother you before you leave, but can I check your receipt?

Her: Oh! (starts rummaging in purse) You know...I...I was just thinking....I think the cashier inside didn't give me the receipt. I thought receipts were optional anyway!

Me: Inside? I'm sorry m’am; we don't have a register open inside today. And a receipt should print out every time payment is tendered.

Her: But...there's...well...ummmm....there's a man! Inside by the desk! I saw him.

Me: Do you mean (employee's name)? He's not a cashier; he's at the garden supplies desk. Did he take money from you m'am? Because he shouldn't have.

Her: Yes!! He took my money. I assumed he was a cashier. He said he was.

Me: I can't believe he would do that. He is my brother (true story). Let's go inside and talk to him to get your money back.

Her: No he didn't!! I mean, he told me I could put this in my car and then shop more. I don't have enough room in my cart to shop more.

Me: I’m sorry m'am. I can't let anything leave the premises without being paid for.

I escorted her to the line and stood by her side smiling until she made it up to the cashier (about a two minute wait). She was sweating uncontrollably but I chalked it up to the heat. The other cashier rang her up and gave her the total. Ms. Blue Pants opens her purse and all of the sudden ""Oh no I left my wallet in the car, let me go get it!"" She tried to take the plant with her but I stopped her ""We'll hold it right here until you get back.""

She never came back.

But she did make her husband call and complain that we harassed her and accused her of being a thief.
The owner told him that they had security footage of her leaving the store with unpaid products. He got all flustered and said the boss that maybe she forgot to go to the register. The boss told him next time we won't forget to call the cops.

This is a story back when I was the floor manager at a college food court/convenience store. One entrance that leads to a burger place, a sushi place, pizza, taco bell, and express sandwiches. Also a bunch of energy drinks and snacks. You know, stuff you could probably get at a gas station. Although it was at a college so it's all extremely overpriced.

My job, in addition to being the manager, is to watch out for theft. The college I worked for had a very strict policy. Students caught stealing from the college were promptly dropped from all of their courses with no refunded and expelled from the school permanently. No excuses.

This is actually posted on a sign under our hours. Two and a half years into the job and I never caught anyone stealing. Until the winter, when some douchey frat boy walks in. I see him walking around the food court, looking around. This isn't the looking around that you look at the menus, trying to figure out what you want. This is the looking around you do when you are trying to steal. When he thinks I'm not looking, he puts energy drinks into his jacket. I put a quick call for the campus security to show up on the radio, just in case. I know the guy, he's downstairs and at the door in two minutes.

However, I don't find it in good taste to kick a kid out of college. So, I give the kid a chance. After pocketing about ten energy drinks, and every cashier has noticed him stealing by now and is giving me looks. I wave it off, giving them the signal that I'll handle it. He looks at this cell-phone, saying ""Shit, I gotta get to class!"", and proceeds to power walk down the ramp out of the store. I'm already at the railing, and I grab him by the arm. Here's how the conversation went.

Me: ""I honestly didn't think you'd try to walk out with it all. Are you insane? Did you think I wouldn't notice?""

Him: ""W-what are you talking about?""

Me: ""Look, I know you have a bunch of energy drinks in your jacket. In case you didn't know, if you get caught stealing from us, not only do you go to jail, you also get kicked out of school permanently.""

Him: ""Bullshit! You can't prove I stole anything!""

Me: ""Look. I won't tell anyone if you just put the drinks back. But if you try to walk out that door with all that, your life is going to be ruined.""

Him: ""Fuck you, you can't tell me what to do!""

He then proceeds to walk out. I quickly do a quick call on the radio, and my campus security promptly arrests him about 15 feet away from the store. I walk over there, and the officer assists me in taking the drinks out of his jacket.

Me: ""You really had to call my bluff, huh? Don't say I didn't warn you.""

Him: ""FUCK I DIDN'T MEAN IT! YOU CAN'T KICK ME OUT OF SCHOOL!""

Me: ""Sorry kid. Maybe you can still get a good degree at community college.""

I promptly cleaned off the energy drinks and put them back on the shelf. About a week later my security campus friend tells me what the kid's fate was. Kicked out of school.

Tl;dr: Kid stole from a college store and got kicked out of college for it after being warned he would be kicked out for it.

God I fucking hate dumb-ass college kids.

1367567864.0,707,self.TalesFromRetail,1dlx0r,The one where I shoved 2500lbs of flour into a customers compact SUV,claytoris,848,141,140,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1dlx0r/the_one_where_i_shoved_2500lbs_of_flour_into_a/,"I work at a grocery store. We have this regular customer who comes in once a month and orders a pallet of flour, which works out to fifty 50lb sacks. The customer shows up several days late to pick up her order, so it gets buried behind several stacks of empty pallets in our back room.

The customer comes in and is in a hurry, as always. Blocking her pallet is a stack of empty pallets 30 high, as well as several bales of cardboard that are going to be picked up by our freight driver later in the afternoon. I start to move the stack of bales and notice that 3 of the 4 wires have snapped and the boxes are falling apart on the bale in the middle. I restring wires around the bale and attach it to the pallet on top of it so it's all secure. This takes about 10 minutes and requires the assistance of another employee. 

Then I attempt to move the stack of 30 pallets with the power jack, but upon shifting it slightly to the right, the whole tower starts to lean and is going to crash through the wall. I drop the stack quickly and it straightens out. Okay, I'll just use the forklift to separate the monster stack into two smaller stacks.

By now my manager is calling me on the intercom to bring this stuff up to the front and I talk to her briefly to explain the situation. She gives me shit but lets me get back to work. She gives me shit about everything, but always in a funny way. Good boss, that one. 

I finally get the empty pallets out of the way and start to bring out this pallet of flour. I get it almost out onto the sales floor when I notice that two of the bags have ripped wide open and flour is spilling everywhere. Two of the bags on the BOTTOM of the pallet, of course. 

No way to get to those other than unloading EVERY. SINGLE. FUCKING. BAG. 

So I am sweating like a slave hucking bags of flour onto the floor. I get the two broken bags and set them off to the side, then restack the remaining 48 bags onto the pallet. If I wasn't a strongman competitor in my spare time and reasonably strong, this would have been even more miserable.

Pallet loaded, boss is screaming because customer is screaming, and I'm covered in sweat and flour as I make my way up to the front of the store. Boss laughs at my appearance, which actually calms my anger a bit. I grabbed two bags of flour from their regular spot on the shelf to bring my pallet total back up to 50.

I follow the customer out to her car because I'm the only jackass available for the carryout apparently and she opens up the hatch to this:

http://media.caranddriver.com/images/media/194106/2009-chevrolet-traverse-interior-photo-194130-s-1280x782.jpg

By now, I had already assumed that she drove a tiny ass vehicle because fuck me that's why.

I start loading bags into the back and she is playing armchair quarterback about the positioning of every bag. I get about 30 bags into the back, close the hatch because I think she has a second vehicle or some stupid fucking reason, and then she says that whatever doesn't fit in the vehicle she will need to return back to the store for a refund.

Well, hell no.

I open the hatch back up and start getting creative. Years of Tetris have prepared me for this moment. I manage to shove another 10 bags into every crevice I can find. I stack the remaining 9 bags on the front passenger side. And I've got one bag.

One.

Bag.

I crawl into the driver's side and shove the massive stack around so I can stand up the last bag of flour behind her seat. 

When I walk back through the front doors of my store with the empty pallet on the pallet jack, I daydreamed that all my coworkers and managers would be there cheering for me and holding up ""YOU DID IT"" banners. They weren't, of course, but I felt victorious nonetheless.

The store I work for, like most others in the UK, has a policy known as 'Challenge 25', which basically means that anyone buying age-restricted products who looks 25 or younger should be challenged for ID to prove that they are old enough to buy them.*

A couple of weeks ago, a customer came through my till who was clearly under 25 and trying to buy only a bottle of wine, so I challenged her:

Me: ""Do you have any ID on you?""

Customer: ""Please, I'm in a hurry.""

Me: ""I'm sorry, but I need you to prove that you are old enough to buy this product.""

The customer then proceeded to give me one of the dirtiest looks I have ever received.

Customer: #sigh# ""Reeeeeally?""

Me: ""Yes please.""

The customer then made a huge show out of what was essentially taking her purse out of her bag and getting out her driver's license. She showed me her ID (showing she was 22), and shouted ""There! Happy?!""

Me: ""Thank you very much. That will be £xx.xx.""

Customer: ""...hold on, are you even old enough to sell me this?""

I was, and so I replied to say that I was. Then, with a smug grin on her face, she replied, ""Well then, can I see *YOUR* ID?""

After a moment of stunned silence, I replied: ""Sorry, I am not allowed to have anything like that with me whilst working on the shop floor.""

Customer: ""Ha! I've caught you out, haven't I? I want to speak to your manager!""

So I rang the bell and my manager walks over.

Me: ""This customer wants to see my ID.""

After a few moments to take in the situation, it clicked. His face turned bright red, and he was quite visibly fighting the urge to burst out laughing when he replied that I was indeed authorized to be selling her the wine so long as she was old enough, then turned to me and asked if I had made sure to check her for ID. The customer was not impressed at all by this reaction, and continued to pay (by card, which was in her purse behind her ID), and my manager walked away into the back room and shut the door.

Just as I was handing her her receipt, audible through the door leading to the back room, my manager could not hold the laughter any more, and burst out into hysterics. Her face went red, she snatched her receipt, turned and stormed off.

Me: ""Excuse me!""

The customer turned back, giving me the same dirty look from before.

Me: ""You forgot your wine.""

I have a bachelor's and a 9-5 job that pays pretty well and that I like. I worked retail in an upscale store through college and still take some shifts there because it's extra money and a lot of my friends that I made there still work there, so it's an excuse to hang out with them. Also, I have a few visible tattoos, nothing crazy but totally noticeable.

Anyway, one night I'm out to dinner with my best friend. We like to dress up nice and go out to fancy restaurants and sip wine as we swap terribly inappropriate stories. So here I am, enjoying my second glass, when a woman approaches the table. This woman is a regular at the store I work at part time and is a huge pain in the ass. I somehow always end up being the one to deal with her, and I can't tell you how frustrating and painful my interactions with her are.

CB: Your friend is taking you to dinner?

CB: But you can't afford this restaurant. And where did you get those clothes? You can't afford those.

Me: What makes you think you know anything about my financial situation or what I can and can't afford?

CB: You work at [retail store]! You can't make enough money to eat here!

Me: I work at [retail store] part time, but I have a full time job with [well known corporation that everyone in the world has heard of and knows is making tons of money].

CB: You can't have a REAL job! You have tattoos!

Me: Yeah, the company doesn't care about those at all.

Morning is going along rather quietly, i scanned in all our new inventory, did a soft check on everything else, and scanned the new clearance items into clearance and set them out in the clearance section. 
11 am comes around and this little old lady just starts stacking boxes of orthopedic clearance shoes into a chair nearby. Seems to be stockpiling them all to try on, whatever. She is the only one here and i dont care because clearance means i dont have to run up and down our two floor stock room getting shoes in her size from the displays. Me and my coworker are casually chatting about our weekends. Old lady number one is trying on shoes from her little old lady shoebox fort. She finds one to her liking and toddles on over to the mirror to check her bad self out.
In swoops old lady number two. She strolls into the department and sees the treasure trove that is clearanced orthopedic shoes on the chair. She teeters over and starts rummaging through the pile. Old lady number one turns around, and upon seeing her bounty being trifled through, lets out a squawk. She toddles as fast as those orthopedics can carry here (which they must have been good orthos since she toddled pretty damn fast) and starts screaming at old lady number 2 to stop stealing her shoes. Me and my coworker are behind the register in our section, an odd ten feet away. The two old ladies begin screaming at each other, about how the shoes dont belong to anyone, but they were hers to try on! Yadda yadda, old lady squawking. all of a sudden boxes start flying and theyre throwing shoes at each other! Me and my coworker are in shock, dont know if we should stop it and laugh. We choose laugh. I ask her if we should call store security. At that moment the phone rings and our security lady is on the phone, asking us what the hell she is watching on the monitors. I give her a rundown of the situation and she starts laughing out loud. She said if they dont tire out in 5 minutes she will come out there. 5 minutes pass and theyre still going at it, rather half heartedly though. Both of them get escorted out of the store without any orthopedic shoes, and i dont even mind having to rebox and stock the mess they made because it was priceless to watch.

TL;DR One old lady starts shopping another old lady's clearance shoe stack stash, and grannies go wild slinging shoes.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,standard,True,t3_1f13e2,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1f13e2/grannies_gone_wild/,

I retrieved her cigarettes and asked for her id because our policy is to request id from anyone who appears under 40. Oh boy, what have I done!?!? She started huffing and puffing and said she'd have to go to her car to get her id.

After about 30 seconds she returns to the counter. She throws the id onto the counter with such force that it bounces off, hits me in the stomach, and falls to the floor. I pick it up and enter her dob into the computer. At this point I'm beyond pissed off. It's that anger where your vision gets blurry and your hands start shaking. Customer service stopped the second her id hit the ground.

After entering her dob into the computer I tossed id back at her not with as much force as she did, but enough to let her know, ""Fuck you."" She starts ranting about how we never id her and asked when are we going to learn that we don't have to id her. Without missing a beat I answered, ""Probably when you start acting like an adult."" The fact that I had the audacity to talk back to her really caught her off guard. She had a look of surprise for about a second before she responded, ""Oh, blow it out your ass!"" 

I provide excellent customer service, but I have no problem putting a person if their place when they disrespect me.

My main job is in the fashion's department, however I (along with many of the GM team members) often get called up to run a lane when it gets backed up. It sucks, it's annoying but it's my job so I do it without complaining. Much.

Today I get called up. I'm a little annoyed because I've got a few things that need to get done before I get to go home, but it doesn't bother me too much because I was closing with K, and K is awesome.

So I'm up running a lane, scanning groceries and whatnot and I get to the end of the order. ""Alright, your total comes to $76.89.""

This lady takes out a bag of change, hands it to me and smiles. I look at her, look at the bag, look at the lady again and sigh. The entire bag is filled with quarters.

""You wouldn't happen to have any other form of payment would you? I'm technically not allowed to accept this much change."" Which is complete and utter bullshit since we're not allowed to tell customers no to anything.

The lady smiles, shakes her head and says, ""Sorry, I don't.""

So I spent the next five minutes counting out $77 worth of fucking quarters for her fucking order. WHEN WE ARE BACKED UP AND BUSY. There were three people behind this lady for gods sake!

I wanted to hand her back the bag, shake my head and say, ""Sorry but I'm not allowed to accept this much change. If you don't have another form of payment you can go to the Coinstar machine and have it count it for you."" But I couldn't. Because the stupid management and rules at this stupid place are ridiculous.

The three people who ended up waiting in my lane were really nice to me when it came to be their turn, thank god. They were understanding towards me, kind of pissed off at the lady.

But seriously. $77. In quarters.

A middle aged man walks up to the counter with a few items acting generally friendly as I scan his groceries. I finish the transaction and hand him his receipt and bill part of his change. He studies the receipt for a few seconds turns to me and asks ""Do you go to school around here?"" in a friendly tone. I respond with a yes telling him where Ill be going to college next semester.
     His response caught me off guard. His tone switched from genuine interest to disgust as he said ""Good, because you owe me 66 cents."" I could see it in his eyes. This man thought he had called an eighteen year old stupid in the most clever way possible. The man had a smirk on his face as if he had just beat me in a rap battle. I was taken back at first but quickly realized how truly wrong he is. With a smile on my face I pointed to the remainder of his change in the coin dispenser cup.

Lets go back in time to a time of wonder and cheer.  Clinton was president and I was working at a big box retail store.  I worked in electronics and, come October 2000, the gaming world was turned on it's side by the Playstation 2.  

As with all large corporations, our company had set protocols, limits, etc on how to handle the release of the machine.  I was excited... I couldn't buy one yet but I volunteered to work the release just because.  We get the typical speech.  Employees can't buy them if on the clock, no putting systems aside for friends, all stock must be sold, etc.  

So, I forget how much we had but it wasn't much.  I want to say 9 or 10 systems.  We sell the systems, sell some games and peripherals and whatnot.  Almost as quickly as it began, it was all over.

****Tangential note****  most amusing was the Hot wheels collectors who argued with management that it was unfair to let the PS2 line people in first (huh?) and they were afraid the people in that line were LYING about being there to get a PS2 in order to get in first to get to the Hot Wheels.  Yes... that happened.  Look, I'm a geek, I collect GI Joes... but Hot Wheels people are, by far, the biggest freaks of the collecting world.

****TANGENT OVER****

So, the PS2 rush is over and the people in my department just take that moment to chat... even the supervisor, who we will call SH for Scandalous Ho.  Another team member walks up, talks to SH for a minute.  SH asks me to go to the back room, the games cage and tells me where to find 2 PS2's in there.  Huh... I kinda laugh to myself... thought that wasn't allowed but whatever... it was her call.  Transactions made, go about my day.  

Forward to the following week.  I get to work and almost immediately am called up to the offices where I'm introduced to Katie, the regional head of Loss Prevention.  Her and the head of the store's LP team have a few questions for me regarding the PS2 release. 

Uh Oh.

Well, they ask some general questions... how did I think it went, did I feel safe, were people pushing, etc.  They asked if I had any concerns or anything to say regarding the release.  That's when the pit hit my stomach.  I knew they were fishing about the PS2's that had been held but I answered the questions exactly to what was asked and offered little else... not being evasive, but rather just taking the question to be straight-forward and answering in kind. 

Then, it comes.  Katie asks me what I would think if she said they have me on camera getting 2 PS2's out of the stockroom and selling them after the initial rush, that they had been held for certain people.  They hint, very heavily, that I was the one that put them away and even point out that I was smiling on camera.  I explain, first, I' am a gaming fan and was just excited so that explains my smile.  It dawned on my pretty quickly the cameras are the entire reason my supervisor, SH, had me get the PS2's from the stockroom... and had me ring up the transaction.  I don't think she did it out of spite or hate... simply I was the newer person to the team and easier to set up.  So I tell Katie and LP guy exactly what happened.  I wasn't going down for this.  I didn't do shit and I'm not going down for her.  Katie says she believes me completely... asks me to write down everything I've said. 

We finish our meeting and she says I can go back to electronics but instructs me not to talk about what happened with anyone.  

the next day I go to work.  After clocking in, I'm headed back to Electronics and I pass SH.  She's walking but looks absolutely sad... shaken.  She's also carrying her purse and a box with some stuff in it.  It was pretty obvious what happened.  

She was fired.  People talked.  I played dumb... didn't know what happened.  There was one guy I worked with I got to be very good friends with that I eventually told... but I think that was after I left that job.

Time for some more tales of a porn store manager.

This happened awhile ago, I was the new manager after the last one was arrested on drug related charges (explains why he was always so off). The owner, I call ""Boss Man"" is a strictly business kinda guy. He's rich and arrogant with a shady past and shady friends.

I'm getting paid better then what I would at any other retail place, and I don't have to do much. Boss man comes into my office ""Porno Manager, we need people. We need people now. Hire someone within the week or I'm replacing you"". I tell Boss Man, ""okay, but, I need to know what to do. What kinda questions to ask"". Boss Man looms over me and then gets in real close, his breath smells like booze and he reeks of old cigarettes. ""Porno Manager just ask standard questions. Make some crap up. I have some ""important"" business to attend too"", he explains, and then as he's leaving he shouts out ""Don't make me regret this!""

A week to hire some rookie on, no pressure, eh? Within a day we get 3 resumes submitted. First one I see is poorly written and not even filled out. Into the trash it goes! Second one isn't even english...right into the trash! Third is terrible, the guy has little experience, and lists ""porno watching"" as his hobby. A sad thing to say he's the least terrible applicant, i save his resume and wait till better ones come in.

A few days go by and a few interviews, i reject every last one of them for various reasons. With time running out and me being desperate and going against my better judgment I decide to give the ""porno watcher"" a call. I should have known this would have been a bad idea, I really should have seen the writing on the wall. 

He comes in the next day well dressed and on-time. He gives me a firm handshake and manages to impress me in the interview. Success! Maybe things would not be so bad, maybe I was being too judgmental, I mean it's not as if our job is difficult. How bad could this be? Really? We get him started by Friday, he comes in an hour late. That pisses me off, but, I'll allow it to slide just this once considering it is daylight savings and maybe he made an honest mistake. 

I get him started on the register and just up to date on the products. it'll just be me and him today so I can give him the training he'll need. Today's going to be a slow day today, we'll be lucky to get even one customer, but, who knows. Out of the blue he comes up to me and says ""So, this is a porno store, right? Do girls come in here and get naked and get f-d? Do we got glory holes"", he says, I explain to him that we are not a ""porno store"", as we focus on improving peoples sex lives. ""You mean a porno store, right?"", I just sigh and go off to doing my work. I'm not going to like this guy.

All through the day he keeps asking me stupid questions like where all the girls are or why aren't there any people having sex. As best I do to explain, he just keeps asking more and more questions and he won't stop talking about porn. I'm just glad no customers have come in. Lunch break! I ask if he'll be able to handle the store while I'm gone. He says yes, he'll ""manage somehow"", he says in such an odd tone suppressing a giggle. I tell him if he needs me he can call me on my cell, I'll be across the street at McD. With that I walk off.

After getting my food, I walk back to the store hoping he'll have gotten everything out of his system. I hope he would stop it with the annoying questions. I walk in and he's not at the register. I walk around and hear a moaning sound coming from my office. Oh god, I think, please don't be what I imagine it is. I open the door and there he is with his pants down watching a porno movie on my computer.

""Please tell me you aren't doing what I think you're doing..."", i yell. He looks up and says ""hey man shut the f-ing door"", I don't let him finish. I unplug the PC and yell at him to get his pants on. He rushes to get them on all mad at me ""Whats the big idea anyways"", he says confused as to why I'm so mad. I tell him to get out, he's fired and he's lucky I don't call Police. New Guy is all huffy, and confused ""Whats your problem man? i'm on break. This is a porno store man, why can't i do that here? I'll call your owner and tell him to get me my job back!"", I laugh and rush him out the door ""Boss Man would probably kick your ass. Don't show your face here again"", and i slam the door behind him.

EW looked good on paper, but she was not a nice person. EW worked mornings with a lady I will call Ann. Ann's son John worked afternoons with me.

One day, John told his mom something rather surprising and his mom, shocked, confided in EW. By the end of the week, EW had outed John to the rest of the staff and embellished how Ann found out to include her walking in on John and another guy. Fortunately, the staff loved John and rallied around him, but what a nasty thing to do!

In addition to being a bitch, EW was also an alcoholic. (One time, she brought her six-year-old son to work, where he spent the balance of the day whining that he wanted a lemon drop. Finally, a coworker - a sweet girl who liked to make people happy - bought a bag of lemon drops for the kid, who informed her that she must be stupid because a lemon drop is vodka, lemon juice and sugar.)

Anyway, although things started out alright, eventually it got to the point where, if we scheduled EW to work on a Monday morning, she failed to show up a full 50% of the time. It had been about 6 months since we hired her, which, coincidentally, was how long she needed to work before being eligible for unemployment benefits again, when we stopped scheduling her for the 6-2 shift on Mondays. We gave her the 11-3 instead, which, obviously resulted in her losing some hours. EW did not like that.

It was about 11:00 at night and I was at home when my phone rang. It was EW, drunk and yelling at me about her hours. She called me a stupid bitch a few times and kept repeating a simple mantra: ""FIRE ME FIRE ME FIRE ME!""

So I eventually hung up and I called my boss and told her what had happened. We talked a bit and decided EW was more trouble than she was worth, so I called her back and said ""I've thought it over, EW, and I have decided to take your advice and fire you. Goodbye.""

But that isn't the revenge bit. The revenge is when she filed for unemployment. I know a bit about how bureaucrats work, so I decided she wouldn't be getting unemployment benefits this time around. We contested her claim and gave the Unemployment Office my contact information. When they called, they asked me why I had let her go. It went something like this:

Unemployment Guy: ""EW says you cut her hours. Can you explain why that happened?""

Me: ""Well, EW does a good job when she's there, but unfortunately, I think he has an alcohol problem. She hasn't been dependable on Monday mornings, so we decided to let her sleep in.

UG: ""But she was a good employee other than that?""

Me: ""Yes and no. She's good at the work, but she outed a gay coworker to the whole company last month and the last straw was when she called me at home and started swearing at me. She called me a bitch while I was in my own home. I don't have to put up with that! I was in my living room and she's yelling at me saying 'Fire me, you stupid bitch,' and I am not going to be called a bitch in my own home.""

UG: ""Wait... she asked you to fire her?""

Me: ""Yeah. While calling me a bitch. In my own home, no less!""

UG: ""But she said the words 'fire me'?""

Me: ""Over and over again. But I seriously don't need to be called a bitch in my own home.""

UG: ""But she asked to be fired? Okay, I think you've answered my questions. Thank you.""

I hung up with a huge grin on my face. It was a week or two before the letter from Unemployment came: EW was denied and would have to get a job. Boo fucking hoo.

I had been asking for training here because it's a higher level of difficulty and I'm not at this place to shell coffee and not move up any ranks. I'm here to prove myself in every aspect and climb, for my resumé's sake. (Worth noting this is my second job. Ever.) The supervisor, Helga*, pulled me aside before my shift began.

Helga: First I'm going to speak to you as your supervisor. What you did yesterday was unprofessional. You do not speak to customers with a raised voice. However, because you didn't use any profane language and even while you blew up you managed to keep a little bit of cool, you get this ""verbal warning"" (finger air quotes included). Now I'm going to speak to you as a witness to the event. That was fucking amazing and I'm glad it was you of all the employees who gave that shit-eater what for, because you would have done it best. I know you've been asking Horatio* and Shanaynay* for training in sandwich station, because eventually all of us absolutely cannot tolerate the drive-thru speaker anymore. I know you hate it now, I can see it, and yet you still have the same enthusiasm and radio worthy voice we love. You are our best order-taker. Because of this, you are cursed with the speaker box job. However, I'm now going to do my best to get you over to sandwich a couple of times a week for a much needed and deserved break. Go punch in, get to sandwich, and show me what you can do.

Friday afternoon a customer and her son come into the store and purchase, 2 PC games - One thats require online activation (Steam, Origin, Uplay etc.) I question if they have the required PC specifications and an internet connection to get the game up and running. Yes Yes Yes! The kid was all too eager to get home and play.

**Me:** Okay, ma'am. Since we are not allowed to do an immediate swop on PC software I am going to have to ask you to, phone the supplier and ask if the code is in fact in use or it was not activated by your son by accident.

**Mother:** How is that my problem, you sold it to me. Why must I do all of this Sh**, you must fix it. NOW! I am not coming in there again to fix it I want it fixed NOW!

There is a slight pause. I'm getting agitated at the mothers response.

Monday comes, my manager comes in a bit late. Due to driving about 50 Km (31mi) to give them their game. I asked him how it went, all he could say was. ""When I get home I am going to burn my clothes and take 3 showers of disinfectant, those are the filthiest people I have ever seen"".

Needless to say I took the copy of the ""already activated game"" Called up the customer support and had the key to whom ever the account was linked to suspended on suspicion of theft. Fast Forward a couple of weeks I was not working till that day but the son walks in again takes the same game and says to the cashier ""Yea it's for my brother... Yea his account got hacked, so I gotta get him a new copy. Sucks that it happened the day I got mine"". 

Lying bastard.

TL;DR: Customer tried to swindle free game off me, called me a liar and still came short in the end.

I worked at a very large retail chain all through high school, usual big box store with clothes, home goods, prepared food, and a pharmacy.  I worked in the fitting room most of the time, but was also cross trained for the various clothing departments and cashiering.  Typically we had about 7-8 employees helping customers on the floor, 3-4 cashiers, a few people at customer service and a few managers.  It being a relatively large store, we all used walkie talkies and had various short hand for emergencies, ""code yellow"" for a lost child, ""code red"" for a fire, etc.

One fateful day, I heard a flicker on my walkie talkie.
A fellow employee, cool girl Carol*: ""I just, I don't even... I think we have a... a Code Brown...""  
This was uttered on the main frequency that goes through all walkies in the store, we a have a secondary frequency for longer and more private conversations.
""Carol, go to frequency 2!"" barked the manager of the evening.

Whenever something juicy goes down in the store, the manager and whatever employee brought up the issue go to the secondary line to discuss the matter in more detail.  The rest of the employees are supposed to keep their walkies on frequency 1 for general matters (""what aisle are pillow cases in?""/""Need more cashiers!""), but many succumb to curiosity and check into frequency 2.

Manager: ""Carol, what are you talking about?""
Carol: ""In Aisle X, there's just... I think it's poop.  It is poop.  There's so much, it's everywhere, I just don't even...""
Manager: ""What the f*ck?!  I'll be right over!""

Naturally, anyone who heard the quick conversation on frequency 2 dropped what they were doing and ran as fast as their little khaki'd legs would carry them to Aisle X.

Luckily, I was on a break and not trapped behind the fitting room desk, so I dashed to the scene of Code Brown.

I don't know what I was expecting.

First I smelled it.  I saw Carol's face, ashen white with a thousand-yard stare, and then I saw it.  

Human diarrhea.  All over an end-cap in the make up aisle.  It looked like someone filled a super-soaker with liquid shit and just sprayed all down the shelves, creating a brown waterfall about 3 feet tall, ending in a large semi-liquid poop lake, and topped off with a firm shit coil glacier floating regally in the center.  The extraneous splatters wrapped around the whole corner of the end-cap.  So many dainty beauty products, little tubes of lip gloss and smooth discs of powder and tiny brushes and mirrors, small treasures I lusted over and would collect with the odds and ends of every paycheck, now liberally coated in a dripping layer of human feces.  

At this time, about 6 employees, included the manager and assistant manager, all just stood in silent reverence, no one knowing exactly what to do or say.

At this time, the lowly floor peons all shuffled around to one side, and looked expectantly at the manager and assistant manager.  They weren't the worst bosses, but the certainly weren't the best, and each had histories of stirring the pot, playing favorites, and general retail-boss unfairness. 

""This is a biohazard.  This is not in our job description.  I'll help take apart the end-cap and file damage reports, but I'm not touching shit.  I am not paid enough to touch shit.""  Said one of the brave floor peons.  We stood behind her in solidarity.  

The manager and assistant manager looked at each other.  We were all quite queasy and pale in the face due to the stench at this point, and the store still had several hours before we could close.  So they had us block off the area with all the wet-floor signs in the store, and put us all out to redirect the curious onlookers and onsmellers that began rubber-necking at the scene of the Code Brown.

Then, we got to watch on as our prim assistant manager, with her impeccable tan and expensive hair extensions, and our manager, mister big tough guy himself, snap on some giant rubber gloves, grab tens of rolls of paper towel, many large trash bags, and a few plastic dust pans, and begin scooping the shit by the dust pan-full into the bags.  They were gagging and dry-heaving so hard I could see tiny veins exploding in the whites of their eyes.  

After 2 hours of clean up, and throwing away hundreds of dollars of make up and shelving, we had a store meeting.  Which consisted of all 10 closing employees sitting in silence, staring at the ground for half an hour. 

Several people threw up.  We never found out who the Code Brown assailant was, after our assets protection guy spent hours pouring over the security camera footage.

Dude: ""I got this bill. I don't want to pay it.""

Me: ""Okay, is there a reason you're not wanting to pay it?""

Dude: ""I don't want to pay it.""

Dude: ""No, it works. But I've been a long time customer and I don't want to pay this. Do you want to keep me as a customer?""

I snagged a couple pairs of pants that I had my eye on previously, the super skinny ones. 

I go to the register to pay and the cashier asks me if I want to apply for an Old Navy credit card. She told me that if you apply and get denied that you still get 20% off and if you are approved, you get an additional 10. This sounded great to me, so I signed up. I entered in my information and guessed my monthly income. I'm a full time college student, so I obviously have a very small monthly income. 

The application is almost done processing when the cashier's computer freezes. She calls tech support and is on hold for at  least 20 minutes. After that, I have to talk to tech support about my application (after another 20 minutes of the cashier talking to them), to which the nice fellow in India asks me if I have any property, assets, stocks, etc. I tell him no, I'm a poor college student and I live with my parents. I have no money, I just needed a couple pairs of pants! He tells me that my application cannot be processed and that I should look into getting a job that pays well. Thank you, good sir. 

So after a total wait of about 1 hour, which included the silly conversation I had with tech support, my transaction was finally processed. The cashier gave me a total of 30% off because I was so patient and another cashier gave me a $20 Old Navy bonus buck coupon. These ladies were so sweet! I thanked them happily and told them that next time I would speak to their manager about how awesome they were. It pays to be patient!

Sweet deal.

I get to the store and they're having a sale.  All their already marked down clearance stuff is half off.  Also sweet.  I try a bunch of stuff on, including the jeans, sold at regular price, that I knew I wanted before I came in.   Each pair is 59.99$, and they're my favourite style and fit, so I picked up two pairs and I selected a few other items from the clearance rack.  (7.50$ for a pair of last season's capris, woot.)

I parked my truck near the back of the lot and was just returning after shopping, just in time to see a small car parking beside my truck. From the distance it looked very close, and as I got to my truck I could see that she literally parked within about 2 inches of my drivers side door. 

The woman who owned the car got out just as I got behind her car. Our conversation went like this:

Me: Are you seriously leaving your car like that?

Her: uhhhhhh...

Me: Please move your car so I can get in my truck.

Her: Sorry. (begins walking towards store)

Me: Wooo Wooo Wooo. Get back here and move your car.

Her: Sorry. (continues walking towards store, fortunately forgot her purse and returns to her car).

Me: Why would you park like this? There are three spaces open to your left. 

Her: I'm handicap. (begins walking towards store again).

Me: (despite her walking fine, parking in the furthest spot, and not having a handicap sticker I say) What does that have to do with anything?

By this point she was ignoring me. The problem is I would normally climb in from the passenger side but I just pulled my hamstring at the gym and while I could walk fine, making odd bends and stretches hurt far to much. 

I seen a cop going through the lot and flagged him over. I explained the situation and he was sympathetic and wrote her a ticket and called for a rush tow. Within about 15 minutes a tow truck arrived and took her car. The cop said she would be forced to pay the tow and impound fee's in addition to her parking ticket. The tow truck left the lot and the woman came out just as the cop drove away and I was getting in my truck. 

She was running towards me so for safety sake I stopped (and I wanted to rub it in a little). I rolled down my window and she asked what happened to her car. I answered her question with a question of my own ""what gave you the right to park so close that I could not get in my truck?"". She didn't answer. I explained her car was towed by ""some tow truck"". Now she just needed to figure out which truck. I'll leave the ticket surprise for her to get later. She asked ""what do I do now?"". I told her she should have thought of that before parking like a cunt, then drove off.

Please excuse my wall of text, as I thought this would be a nice fit here.

I'm no longer in the retail business, but when I was working there I had some fond and not-so-fond moments. This is one of those moments I just remember feeling so good to tell someone 'NO.'

I was working at a great company in the mall that lets you choose your stuffed animal and we stuff it up for you to your specifications. I can honestly say until now this was one of the funnest and most fulfilling jobs I have ever had. To be able to watch a child's face light up with joy as you help them make a new friend is an amazing thing.

We were slammed one particular day, and it was just three of us in the store. The manager was busy with a 10-girl birthday party on the back stuffing machine and keeping them occupied. Our part-timer was on the main stuffer helping customers as they came up and had quite a line forming. My job was to monitor the sales floor and the register, so I walked about and helped customers find clothing, and then would bring them to the register for final purchase.

Cue our main character. Classic trophy wife type in a nautical style suit and high-end sunglasses with shoulder-length bleached blonde hair . She entered our shop and perused the line of flat animals. I'm with a customer, but my associate has a line 7-deep so I look up from my register and give a happy 'welcome to Fluff-A-Pup!' Being ignored I figured it's another window shopper and finish my transaction.

This woman continues looking along the aisle of animals and then grabs an empty skin, and walks up to my associate. She says something but I can't hear it from where I am, but my associate is busy helping a little 5 year old girl and this woman keeps trying to stand in front of the little girl and trying to talk over her. The woman huffs a bit, then walks over to me; I can already see where this is going. I put on my best smile and greet the woman, 


""Hello Is there anything I can do for you today, ma'am?""


""Yes, you can hurry up and stuff this animal.""


 She then proceeds to drop it on the counter in front of me.


""Of course, ma'am, we will be able to stuff it up if you wait in that line over there.""


 I point to my associate, where two other people have joined the line. 


She looks at me in disbelief and starts to tell me in a harsh tone,


""No, that won't do. Do you see this? :flashes Back Amex: I want my animal stuffed now.""


I calmly reply back,


""That's nice, ma'am. I'm glad to see you have a method of payment. Unfortunately I can't stuff anything here, and both of our machines are occupied so you will need to get in line.""


She looks at me like I have literally thrown up on her, and continues to demand that I stuff her animal.


 ""You don't understand what this card is. I DON'T WAIT!"" 


Cue my sweetest customer smile:
""Well today you do, ma'am. Please wait behind the line of children so you can get your toy stuffed. We will make sure to put extra love in it 
for you!""


She threw the animal down on the floor and stormed out. She was so loud my manager was able to hear her from the back of the store; he just gave me a sly smile and continued his party.

Aside from gasoline, we refilled propane tanks, and sold cigarettes. There was no c- store; these were fuel islands (four self-serve, one full-serve) at a repair shop. 

As you might imagine, we had a great number of regular customers. I mean no misogyny, but the overwhelming majority of full-service customers were older women. One particular lady, we'll call her Mrs. R., drove a blue Mercury Sable. She was the nicest lady, nearly always cheerful, always told me about her family, and asked about me, and always remembered the things I'd told her before.

One Thursday in November, I was at work as usual, but was sick as a dog. I stayed inside the booth as much as possible; my joints hurt when I moved, and just the exertion of walking would make me cough my brains out. (This was 1998, before the ubiquity of hand-sanitizer. I had a package of alcohol wipes I would use to sanitize my hands before handling a customer's credit cards or cash.) Lucky for me, no one pulled up to full-service that shift, until about 8:30, when Mrs. R. rolled in. I went out to meet her.

""Dawnsteel, honey, you look like Death warmed over!"" she says as she hands me her card out of her window.

""Thanks, Mrs. R. I feel about that well, too.""

""Well, what're you doing at work? You should be home in bed!""

""About three more hours, and then two days off. If I have to sleep the whole time, I will, Mrs. R.,"" I said.

""Is your bride-to-be going to feed you chicken soup? Nurse you back to health? She should!"" she declared. I'd told her that I was engaged a couple of months before.

I finished pumping her gas, cleaning her windows, and so on, and sent her on her way. I noticed that when she left the parking lot, she didn't turn toward her house, but I didn't think anything of it.

About a half-hour later, I see her car pull back into the lot, but instead of stopping at the fuel island, she drives past it and up next to the door of the booth. She rolls down the window, and as she hands me a brown paper bag, she says, ""Get well soon!"" and she drives away.

I got back inside and look in the bag. I found a bottle of Advil, two bottles of orange juice, two small bottles of vodka, and a roll of wintergreen Lifesavers. There was a note inside that read, ""The mints are so you'll have fresh breath for get-well kisses.""

**The Shuffle**
In one of the stores I used to work in we would sit behind the counter and watch people come up to the door and do what we liked to call the ""are they open?"" shuffle. (done to the beat of ""We will rock you"") 
March up to the door, pull twice, cup hands around eyes and lean in to see through the glass, (wonder why the lights are off) pull on door twice, lean over and see operating times,(it should be closed... but I""M here so they must be willing to make and exception) pull on door twice, look up at open sign (clearly not on) above door. pull on dor twice, knock and call ""HELLOOOO!"" Pull on door handle two final times, wander away mumbling obscenities while we all sat and stared in awe until Either me or my manager would ask, ""WHY do these people exist?""

**I""M SPECIAL**
One night back when i was a third key, I had been working at a store for a few months that was very prone to robberies (read: five times within as many months) so we closed an hour earlier than most of the other stores i nthe district, and had live monitoring from a security company that checked in with us over intercom every hour and could tap into our camera feed if we had an issue (which  has some fun stories all on it's own)

So one night we are closed, I'm counting down the tills and my two GA's are recovering the walls etc whe n I hear a knock on the window, sounds like metal on glass.

For a few heartbeats I think... That's gonna be a guy tapping his gun on the glass and I'm about to get robbed again... FUCK. But I glance up and it's a man in plain clothes tapping a police badge on the glass right next to our operating hours sign (right next to the door)

One of my GA's heads over towards the door and I call him back ""dude, I've got money out on the counter and we've been closed for a half hour!""

""yeah... but it's a cop....""
""I don't care if it's the pope man we DO NOT open the doors after hours, approach the doors till we have the gates locked and the alarm on, or let ANYONE in the store with money out"" (rules we have all discussed many times bc of the afre mentioned robberies)

So I make eye contact with the cop (or maybe imposter, how do i know?) and shake my head while hollering we are closed sorry blah blah. He continues to tap his badge on the glass and shouts ""I'm a cop!"" I just look back down continue counting and eventually my GA tells me he left and we close up and go home for the night.

The next day I had to open (shitty schedules) and my ASM and I are working on distro, I have my back turned and I hear someone come in, as we turn to greet him sure enough, it's the cop from last night. awesome.

He sees me and smirks to himself, makes a bee line right for my ASM and once again pulls out his badge and sets it on the counter this time while sneering out, ""I am a cop, I came here last nigth to get a game for my nephew and this jerk wouldn't let me in"" 

My ASM, who i kind of based my Management techniques on once I became a SM doesn't even look at me and goes ""well if he didn't I bet you there is a reason, because I know my staff doesn their job right"" and the cop says ""yeah I know you guys were closed, but I'm a *cop* so it's not like I was gonna steal anything"" 

My ASM and I both kind of grin, and he and I both rattle off in tandem with one another

This story is from when I worked at a high street shoe shop in the north of England.  The shoes were fairly high end (up to around £150 a pair) so the sales were always really popular.
During one sale period, a woman in her 50s came in with her daughter and her husband. I greeted them at the door and they seemed friendly, except the husband who kind of grunted at me. I did feel a bit sorry for him being dragged round the sales. The woman picked up a shoe and said to her daughter 'I've been looking at these for so long, I can't believe they're in the sale'. She turned to me to ask if we had them in a size 4. We usually just tell customers that all sale stock is out on the shop floor (which it usually is) but as she seemed so excited, I agreed to look in the stock room. Lo and behold, in the deepest recesses, I found a pair in a size 4. The woman was ecstatic and tried the shoes on. Her husband was sat down silent. She walked up and down the shop while her daughter oohed and ahhed, both of them laughing. She looked again at the price and said 'I can't believe these are such a bargain!'. She turned to her husband and asked him what he thought. Mr Previously Mute suddenly pipes up in a monotone voice 'They make your ankles look fat'. The atmosphere completely changed and the woman boxed up the shoes and handed them back to me, then promptly left. It made me really sad for the rest of the afternoon.

We were a co-op, so pretty much all the staff there were at the same level of responsibility. That is, until things get weird, in which case you grabbed someone else to back you up.

My co-worker was running front of house, and I was in the back room. Pretty quiet day, and we're just getting on with things. Just after lunch she comes and grabs me .. ""Feral000, can you come and talk to this customer for a minute?""

I head on into the shop, and there's a chirpy woman stood at the counter with a half drunk bottle of fairly expensive organic rum. This is stuff we had stopped selling at least three or four months ago, as it tended to linger on the shelves for ages. She couldn't have bought it recently.

""This rum tastes odd. I'd like a refund please.""

Wha..

Ok, so our shop attracted a wealth of crazies, but that caught me off guard. I can't imagine ever thinking that would be an acceptable thing to do to any establishment. It tastes odd? You drank HALF of it..

""OK .. so, what's up with it?""

""I dunno .. it just tastes wrong. Here, you try some!""

Shit. Really?

""I'm not sure that's entirely appropriate, and besides, I'll take your word for it. The thing is, you've already drunk half of it, and we've not sold that for months. I can't give you a refund.""

""Well, can I just change it for another bottle of something?""

""No. That's actually ridiculous.""

At this point her complete OUTRAGE was bubbling just under the surface. She was indignant, and stubborn. Convinced she was still within her rights to a refund, she demanded to speak to the manager.

At this point, my co-worker was stood off to the side, looking awe-struck at this glorious display of entitlement.

""Well, I'm a director here, we don't have a manager. We're a co-operative. I'm the most senior here today, so I can deal with your problem. Your request is highly unreasonable, and there's really nothing I can do. If you'd have brought it back right away then maybe we could have given you a refund, instead of months later having drunk half of it.""

""I ... I ... I'm going to WRITE A LETTER OF COMPLAINT about YOU. I'm NEVER SHOPPING HERE AGAIN.""

I'd never seen this woman before in my life, it's not like she was a regular. As for the letter, well, that'd come straight to me and the other directors, who would certainly laugh it off as ludicrous.

""OK, be my guest. Do you want me to bin that bottle for you?""

""NO. I'LL DRINK IT.""

At which point she stormed out of the shop and slammed the door. Safe to say, we both burst in to incredulous laughter before the door had even shut. Dumbfounded.


TL;DR : Woman gets upset we won't refund her for the drink she drank. Makes threats, storms off. Laughter ensues.

(adult store, NSFW)",K-hole,834,176,126,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1hsm9t/yes_officer_the_store_policy_is_clearly_stated/,"As mentioned in the title, I work in a sex store. A sex store in a downtown metropolitan area that is fully stocked to (almost) every customer's wants and desires. We sell dance (stripper) clothes, lingerie, platform shoes, a wide variety of toys, DVD's and have a booth area for customers to either insert bills by the minute for preloaded movies or pay a set price to select a DVD from our stock.


As a shift manager I come in either mid-day or at night, so I get to witness the full array of crazies, drunk, irate, bitchy, or occasionally absolutely awesome customers. Expect me to be posting often.


Today I had a nice selection of irate. 3 stories from a Saturday, so this is going to get long.


I come in the store around mid-day and before the door even shuts behind me the opener (we'll call him Jon) starts telling me about a near assault that happened not even an hour prior.


A customer came in, checked his bag and headed back to the pay booths and came up to turn his change in to 2 dollar bills. About two minutes later he calls for Jon because he claims the machine ate his bills. Jon says, alright, let me grab a dollar and I'll test it out (note: this is a common scam). The ""customer"" starts yelling at Jon, saying that Jon has worked here forever and knows the booths don't work. Jon calmly explains that, yes, sometimes they do malfunction, in which case we happily reimburse the customer, but it's customary to check the booth. At this point the customer starts yelling and becoming increasingly aggressive. Jon quickly heads back to the counter to be next to the cameras, the phone and the giant mag light we have behind the register. The ""customer"" runs up to the side and begins advancing up to the counter while calling Jon a peckerwood (seriously?). Jon grabs the mag light as the ""customer"" is going at him with a large item in his hand. Thankfully we have a slightly crazy cleaner that is in the store for about two hours every day that backs up Jon and the ""customer"" leaves. The slightly crazy cleaner grabs the guys bag from behind the counter, follows him out and throws it at him.


So I get in, hear the story and watch the video of the incident. Alright, it's going to be one of those days.


About 20 minutes later I'm working on processing new inventory and Jon is calming down a little bit. And then there's a bang on the windows. Alright, probably just a dumb kid walking by. NBD. 30 seconds later, BANG. I walk up to the windows and don't really see anyone, go back to my business. BANG. I go outside and there is a 6'3 drunk man with serious crazy eyes holding a brown bag and punching our windows.


""Hey. Stop hitting our windows.""


The 6'3 drunk crazy eye guy turns. ""what's it to you?"" He advances towards me, the slight, 5'2 manager of a sex store who decided to also advance because wtf.


""I work here and stop hitting the fucking windows.""
""Oh, you work here? What the fuck are you going to do?"" So at this point he is essentially standing on top of me and its kind of scary. But also the police station is a block away.


""call the cops for harassment, being drunk and belligerent and possibly assault."" He high tailed it out of there pretty quickly, but apparently he was hanging out in the alley an hour later.


After that everything is going pretty smoothly. Have a nice couple come in, work on my project, eat lunch. And then a dancer walks in with a shoe box. And this is the worst thing ever.


We do not do returns. We only do exchanges for defective items. This does not include shoes as some girls severely abuse their shoes or are only wanting to wear them with a specific outfit on a busy night. The only cases in which we waive the policy is if the customer called within 2 hours of purchase.


The dancer bought a pair of the most expensive boots we have. Black, glittery thigh high platform boots running $120. I was there when she bought them the previous night.


She opens the box and shows me that the heel became detached from the platform and I say I'm sorry, but we are not taking them back. She is mad and I don't care. She yells at me for about ten minutes, telling me she put them on, and went on stage and got on the pole and they broke. And I don't care and repeat the policy. ""call the store manager.""


So I call her and explain the situation, knowing that the answer will be a solid no. The customer is yelling and a couple is staring. I keep saying no and half saying sorry. 


""But they broke. And you're going to put my money back on my card.""
""No. I'm not going to do that. It is clearly posted that we do not do any returns at all, and we don't do exchanges on shoes. We have no proof that you did not dance in them and if you abuse your shoes its not our responsibility.""
""I'm going to file a complaint with the better business bureau. I do this all the time."" And she smirks.


I realize that she's not going anywhere, so I go back to my work and she starts making phone calls. Putting on a nice voice and stating her location. And then she just stands at the counter.


I'm thanking her for saving me a phone call.

As stated earlier the police station is down the street and they get here pretty fast. One of the two officers I've dealt with before, he's a pretty nice guy.


He gives me an ""are you fucking serious look"" and I hope my look conveyed, hey, I wouldn't call you for this.


She explains that we stole from her because we're not refunding her money. I explain that we have a strict no-exchange policy on shoes. 


""is it clearly stated?""
""yes, officer. Above both shoe displays, by the register twice and where you pick up your items""


Both officers stare at her and now she claims she only tried them on. The officer I haven't dealt with before is left to explain that, while it sucks she broke her shoe, we're under no obligation to refund her money as we have a very plainly stated policy and that she has the option to go to a shoe repair shop.


She packs up her shoes in a hurry, adds a few obscenities, and is now in the banned book. Both officers said I handled the situation really well.


Also, I should note that I am probably the most forgiving person in the store with exchanges. However, it looked like she danced in the boots for a night and then tore the heel off. I have never seen a natural, one day heel break like that one.

Today was the Morning bookkeeper shift, which lasts from 5am to 1pm. I finish all my paperwork usually around 8am so the remaining 5 hours I am a guest service supervisor. This is an easy job; I just send cashiers and sackers on break and do Western Union transfers, Money Orders, etc. 

Story: So it was a pretty slow morning and I was really bored just finding ways to stay busy when a customer (maybe 30 years old) asks if he can pay a bill here, already complaining about how he's tried to call Energy Company and they won't pick up the phone or something. I say no problem and begin to start the process. The guy is still talking and says that they turned of his electricity because the bill is over due. Our policy is that we do not process bills within or after 3 days of the due date. I forgot to check the date before agreeing to help him, but policy is policy. So I tell him this, and he flips shit. ""What the fuck am I supposed to do then?"" he almost-screams. I reply with, ""Well, you'll have to try calling Energy Company again."" I hand him his bill and he storms off. No biggie, I've definitely had worse customers.

Fast forward 30 minutes, I'm counting some money that just arrived from the bank, and my cashier who answers the phone says it's a call for service desk. I answer it with my shpeel and he says, ""Yeah I was in there earlier trying to pay a bill and I just wanted to apologize for the way I acted"" I was shocked. I mean, he was *kinda* rude, but like I said, I've definitely had worse. ""I'm not usually that rude,"" he continued. I graciously accepted his apology. The rest of my day went great. Definitely felt good talking to a decent human being who was just frustrated with having no electricity. Thought I'd share with you guys a happy-ending story.

I'd been working retail for nearly 10 years, and almost every store I've worked at has shut down, I seem to have terrible luck in that regard. Anyways, I have never worked a register, and so the manager puts me on a register assuming I had worked one. I ask for training and he says ""It's not hard, push a few buttons and money comes out. Are you a moron""?

See my manager is 52 years old, and seems to think yelling at everyone from the comforts of his office is what his job is. As I was saying first day there and we were busy, he puts me on a register as we were understaffed that day and only 2 registers were open. I have no idea what I'm doing, and I ask my co-worker, she just shrugs and my manager looks out of his office and says ""Derp, I don't pay you to talk. Talk again and I'll have you written up. Get back to work"". 

Customers start coming in, and I get a long line. I'm struggling to work the register as it's slow and customers are starting to complain. Then I mess up and charge a customer 199.99 for a 19 dollar item. I already made the transaction and can't undo it without a manager permission. The customer goes ballistic, and more people are waiting in line. 

I call my manager over, and he's fuming mad, red as an apple. He shoves me aside, and says ""how fucking hard is this? Working a register is not rocket science. Push a few fucking buttons and presto you're done. Are you mentally retarded""?, the customer is agreeing with him saying ""The quality of your employee is astounding, these people are lazy and stupid. How can you stand them""?, I look over his shoulder, and he's starting to sweat. the customer asks ""hey, what's taking so long?"", and now it's obvious he has no idea what he is doing, he's going through the menus, and finally he breaks down and calls over my co-worker, who shows him what to do.

After 12 minutes of him screwing with the register, he finally can's the transaction and he restarts it, much to his embarrassment. I sit there laughing to myself.  He mumbles to himself, and still manages to screw the transaction up and ends up giving incorrect change back to the customer. he gave 3 back to the customer, when the register said 5. When the customer confronts him about it,my manager denies it. The customer shows him the receipt and my manager turns bright red and looks over to me ""It's her fault, she had distracted me or screwed up the register to display incorrect change"". The customer then says ""With a terrible manager like you running the place, is it any surprise the employees are terrible? I'll be writing a very scathing complaint to corporate"" and then she walked out.

He then looks to me and says ""This is not my fucking job. This is y-your fault obviously. You obviously did something to the register. I don't know what, but, I'll find out. Y-you're lucky I don't fire you on the spot. If you need anything, go ask an employee, not me I'm not your baby-sitter"".

My cross dressing best customer (Long story but a GOOD one),Maevora06,826,173,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1j5j2a/feel_good_story_my_cross_dressing_best_customer/,"I worked at a young women's clothing chain. I was the assistant manager at the time and as such had to open the store sometimes. I usually closed because the manager worked days and would only work nights on the required day (Friday night). but company rules said I had to open 2 days a week so I got stuck with Wednesdays and Sundays. Which was fine with me because I was a night owl and Wednesdays were are slowest days and I often wouldn't even see a customer until noon. only down side was we rarely made our quotas on this day and would get ""talked to"" by our district manager frequently.

Well one morning an older man came in about an hour after we opened (maybe 50-60s, I was 19 at the time). He was a small guy but in good shape. He was quiet but seemed like a sweet older guy. He walked around the store for a while. Bought a top he said was for his wife and left. I didn't think much of it.

 He then started coming in every Wednesday morning and would buy an item or two. Over time he became more talkative. We would talk about things off topic a few times. it was a welcome reprieve since the mall was dead most Wednesdays and I worked alone on these days. After a month or so he started asking me for advice on clothes. Asking if his wife would like certain items. He asked if they would fit her claiming she was his exact height and about his body frame etc. Didn't think anything of it. Helped him pick out stuff for her aiming at clothes an older woman would wear (not our clothes aimed at teenage hookers lol)

I guess he became comfortable with me over time. One day while helping him try and pick out clothes he finally says ""Ok i have a confession. As much as sometimes these clothes are in fact for my wife. Most of it is for me"" I could see he was nervous about telling me and he waited for my reaction. So I go ""Oh ok...well, then this is not a good shirt"" and continue to help him find clothes better suited to him. I could literally see the relief in him. He goes on to tell me that on the weekends him and his wife go out to the drag clubs and he dressed up. They had a ton of fun doing it and how it had breathed life back into their failing marriage and brought them back together. He told me how they went from being on the edge of divorce during his mid life crisis into a couple that couldn't take their hands off each other. it was such a sweet story. He thanked me profusely for being ok with what and who he was. I told him I was proud of him for being himself and I was glad it was something him and his wife could enjoy together. He was so happy because a few other stores shamed him and told him he could not go to their stores. I told him he was always welcome at my store and He bought a few things and left.

The next week he comes in and asks if he could try on stuff. I told him as long as there were no female customers who needed the fitting room it was ok but that if a female did come in he would need to come out and let her use it (I had asked my manager who asked the district ahead of time in case the question had popped up). He said he was perfectly ok with this as it was a female clothing store and we only had one fitting room area. Plus we were so dead this day of the week it was never a problem anyways. 

So the next week I get there to open my store and he is waiting outside with a platic bag. He had brought in his wig, his high heels, his spanx and his bra that had fake boobies in it. he wanted to see how things would look in his full get up. He wanted to get there early so there was no chance of someone else coming in to use the fitting room. I loved it. It was so much fun. I actually told him I was jealous because he looked better in the mini skirts than I did lol That day he ended up buying $600 worth of stuff which was our quota and I sold it in one transaction. On top of that we got gift cards if we did transactions over $500 so I ended up making $25 that day :D

He ended up being my best customer that year. He came in almost every Wednesday. The days he brought his whole get up, he would be waiting outside my store at opening with his lil plastic bag. About every other week he would drop sever hundred dollars. Since Tuesday was our main shipment day there was always new stuff for him. I will never forget him. 

When it came time for me to leave he was devastated. i was joining the military and he panicked because he didn't know if he would be able to buy his clothes. Luckily the girl I was training to take my place was as open minded as I was. I told him she would be more than ok with his shopping and he would love her. So the next week I scheduled her to train during my Wednesday shift. I told her about him and she was so excited to be able to help him (she was a very excitable and energetic girl in the adorable way). When he came in that day he was very timid and nervous when he saw her. I told him to come in and meet her. He reluctantly came in. When I went to introduce her to him she cuts me off and goes ""OMG is this him?! Hi I am A***** I am so excited to meet you!"" he kinda looks at me but responds to her. She immediately took him away and began asking him questions and helping him pick out stuff. As I was watching I could see him relaxing as she went along. I knew he would be in good hands.

He asked me for my email when I left and for quite some time I received email correspondence from him. he would tell me how nice she was and how he still went in each week and bought stuff. The normal life stories and such. He was such a nice older man and I was so happy I could help him feel comfortable in his own skin. We've lost touch over the years and I still sometimes wonder how he is. I wish everyone could be so welcoming and understanding so people like him won't have to be ashamed of themselves. So glad my momma raised me so well and open minded &lt;3

After a few years I decided to move on to better opportunities (more money) and put in my two week notice. This occurred about one week into my two week notice. 

It's fifteen minutes after closing and I'm inside the counter area cleaning up and putting away merchandise, general ""I want to go the fuck home"" type activities when this large woman walks up and plops two prepaid phones on the counter without saying a word. I notice her after a few seconds and ask ""would you like to purchase those?"" She sarcastically replies with ""no, I just put them up here to look at."" Fine, I can see how this is gonna go so I just decide to zip my lip and complete the transaction. I get to the total and tell her what she owes and she tosses her credit card on the counter. Now I'm annoyed because she's just being disrespectful. But I again bite my tongue and don't say a word. I finish up the transaction, put her phones and receipt in the bag and hand it to her without saying a word. She snatches the bag out of my hand and says ""you ain't even gonna tell me to have a nice day?! You're rude!"" 
At this point, I lost it. I tried to stay professional throughout and she just went one step too far so I left her have it. I figured I've only got a few days left, what are they gonna do, fire me?
I look at her and let it fly. ""No, I'm not going to tell you to have a nice day. You walk up here fifteen minutes after we close, drop your shit on the counter and give me a smart ass remark when I ask a simple question. Then you have the audacity to toss your credit card at me like I'm your bitch. After all the your expect me to tell you to have a nice day? Nope! I won't. In fact, I hope your day sucks. In fact, I hope you have a crappy weekend. Bye.""

I'll never forget the look of shame/anger on her face. She couldn't even muster up a response, she just huffed away and I went back to work. Apparently she went and found a manager to complain about me because I saw her leave 5 minutes later and the manager on duty came over to ""reprimand me"" for my behavior but as soon as she cleared the exit door he bust out laughing. He told me he saw the while thing and just let it go because she had it coming. She probably thinks she won because I was gone after that week, but at least she'll think twice next time.

I hope you are all having a wonderful day. I certainly am, seeing as my Redskins won the big game last night (HTTR!).  So, being in a chipper mood, I figure I can share some laughs with everyone here.  Fair warning, if you are sensitive about religious topics, specifically Atheism, this story might not be for you.  So today I bring you:

**Religious Hypocrisy Abound!**

So it's another fine day, working for *Doodoocrombie &amp; Mitch*.  I'm floating between stores, coaching associates, doing my LP thing.  Eventually, I end up at the *Follistar* brand store, and am in the back going over paperwork, investigating money shortages we've been having.  I have the stores camera's up in front of me, and from time to time I am taking sharp, eagle eyed glances at them, to make sure one of the mannequins didn't fall over.  It was dead. It was beyond dead. It was deader than Bambi's mom after hunting season.

Too soon?

Anyways, in walks this family.  A mother pushing a baby stroller, and three sons, ages roughly around 11,14, and 20+.  Nothing really drew my attention to them, but being the only people in the store, I figure I should watch them. The older guy and the 11 year old sit in the chairs in the front of the store, just chilling, while the mom and 14 year old go into the store.  The 14 year old pics out a nice pink and white checkered button up shirt, and a few other flannels.  His mom has him try them on, and after seeing they fit, she points to another room, and he goes walking  off. That's when I see the mother take the 3 shirts, bundle them up, and stuff them under the baby stroller.

Fantastic.

Now the normal downside to this, would be that since I'm watching her on camera, I can't go from the camera room in the back, to the sales floor, without losing sight of the shoplifter.  If that happened, then I technically wouldn't be able to make a stop, as I couldn't 100% testify that they definitely did not ditch the stolen merchandise.  Luckily for me, she happened to be in the room right next to the door that leads to the back room. So I called a manager, and was able to get onto the floor quickly enough to ensure that she didn't ditch the stolen items.  My cover was obviously blown, so I just played the part of a manager, and me and the other manager just walked around, talking about this and that in the store. Meanwhile we discreetly followed to the woman.  Sure enough she leaves the store, and I make my stop.  I identify myself, and ask her to come with me.  Im blocking the exit for strollers, so this woman just says ""No"" and starts trying to push her stroller, with a baby, up the stairs to exit. I'm trying to block her progress, but also don't want to risk injury to the baby.  The older male starts asking me what is going on, and not wanting to embarrass the woman, I just say ""She has some of my merchandise and I need her to pay for it.""  Something about the look in his face told me he was semi aware of what was going on, but not a part of it.  The 14 year old started yelling at me to stop trying to ""hurt his mom"".  I told my manager to call the cops. The woman kept shouting ""I didn't do anything I'm a good christian!"" and pushing the baby stroller, WITH THE BABY IN IT, into my shins and thighs, trying to get past me.

Now, I loved my LP jobs, and I took them seriously, but I would never do anything to risk a child's health. Fuck that, it's not worth it. 

So I calmly said, while walking next to her into the mall, ""Ma'm I'm not gonna stand in your way, because if you're willing to risk your child's health to get away, I'm not going to be a part of that risk. But I don't care if I have to follow you to your car, get your plates, and have the police follow up. I'm getting my merchandise back, and you will have to deal with all that follows.""

She just kept dipping and dodging, trying to walk away and shouting ""GET AWAY I'M A GOOD CHRISTIAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.""  The older male just kind of follow shaking his head. He was a lot bigger than I was. I'm big, but he was close to 7' tall and had at least 100 lbs on me.  But so far he wasn't threatening. The 14 year old on the other hand, kept trying to run interference.  I would just walk around him, and keep pace with the mom.  

At this point the mother is shouting ""IF YOU DON'T STOP FOLLOWING ME I'M CALLING THE COPS!"" to which I replied ""I'm already on the phone with the cops.""  I dialed them up and they had my managers call before, and I was detailing to the dispatcher where we were in the mall at that time. Every time I gave a location and direction, the woman would turn and go another way.  It was a game of cat and mouse, wherein the cat couldn't run and the mouse had down syndrome.

Who will win, you ask? Well naturally it was me.  Eventually the 14 year old decided ""Well, I can take him.""  and decided to step in front of me, push me, then take a swing.  NOPE.  So we are on the ground, the woman is screaming, and the older guy is standing over me as I'm holding his brother on the ground.  I tell them to get back.  Luckily the older guy had a cool head on his shoulders, and decided to step between the woman and I and keep her from jumping on me.  Just then the cops arrived, a whole 10 minutes after all of this nonsense began.  The cops cuffed the young boy and led the mother and him back to the store.  

Once inside, we got everyone separated, and began to talk.  The woman is in tears, just saying ""I'm a good person, I'm a good Christian.""  The young kid is staring daggers at me.  The cops ask me if I want to press assault charges.  I look at him, and at the mother. 

I can't tell you why I did what I did. I can only tell you that I am an amazing, kind, (and obviously humble) person. Maybe even the greatest person who ever lived.  I told the cops not to press charges.  That he thought I was harassing his mom, and when he stepped in front of me, we ran into each other, and I took it as a hands on thing when he pushed. I didn't tell them about the punch.  I think the cops knew, but realized I didn't want to put this poor kid through a trial when he was defending his mom.  Yes I am an amazing person with a trivial act of kindness. That means more Karma, right Reddit?  Upvote me damnit!

Ok enough sarcasm.  We recover the shirts from the baby stroller, and have the older male take the baby and the 14 year old outside to wait.    The mother has calmed down enough, and keeps saying thank you. Thank you.  We start to question her, and she explains that tomorrow is picture day at school, and her older son is the only one who works in the family. So they are struggling. She wanted her boy to have nice clothes, and this is the only way to get them right now.  She looks at me and says

""Good"" Christian Woman:  Thank you for not pressing charges on my son. He was just protecting me. They don't know I do this. Im ashamed.  But thank you for understanding and not making problems for him.  Please tell me what Church you go to, and I'll gladly make a donation as a thank you.

Me:  I understand. He just thought I was harassing you for no reason. Any good son would have done the same. But save your money Ma'm.  You obviously need it, and besides, I'm an Atheist, so there's no church to donate too.  But it's a sweet sentiment.

Now I don't think that I have the words to properly convey the look that came across this woman's face. It was some sort of mixture between confusion, disgust, revulsion, and incomprehension.  It honestly looked like I had just told her that if you kick a puppy through a field goal post, you'll find a pot of gold where it lands.  

Yes that is an awful image, and I love dogs, but imagine the look on your face if someone told you that in all seriousness, and that's how this woman looked. 

GCW: An....Atheist?  But you're obviously a good person. You were kind to my son.  How are you not Christian?

M: Well, that's a whole debate about whether you need religion to be moral, but...

GCW: You do. You can't be moral without God.  

M: Ma'm I'm not going to get into a philosophical debate here.  

GCW: But your godless.  You're false.  

M: False?  Like I don't exist? I'm afraid I don't follow.

GCW: That's why I came in here.  Satan was working through you and I fell for his tricks and stole.

M:.....

GCW: How can you trust Satan?

M: Ma'm I don't believe in Satan.  It kinda goes with the whole Atheist thing.

Now this was even more shocking to hear for her.  I guess she assumed that all atheist were devil worshipers, because logic?  Meanwhile the cop is sitting there just kinda of watching this.  I keep trying to get out of the situation, but she keeps wanting to refocus on ""saving"" me.

GCW:  I can help you.  If you let me just help you. Read the bible. I have so many I can give you one! Just open up to it.

M: Ma'm for the last time, I don't want to discuss this.  I have read the Bible, I have read several books of the Apocrypha, I've read the Quran, Book of Mormon, Dhammapadda, and parts of several other religious texts from various religions and belief systems.  It's not an issue of ignorance.  But that is not why we are here. We are almost done if you just let us finish our paperwork, the officer here is going to release you on a PTA and you'll be free to go.

GCW: YOU NEED JESUS

And that's when I snapped.  I can tolerate religious talk, and honestly, even enjoy open discussions about various faiths and beliefs.  But a man, can only take so much.

M: Well, if I WAS going to take religious guidance, I probably wouldn't take it from someone who can't even follow one of the top 10 rules of their religion. 

I decided to accent this point by holding up the shirts she had just stolen.  Hypocrite.

GWC decided this was a good point to shut up and start scowling at me.  The officer shot me a look and we continued our paperwork, before walking her out.  The officer was gonna walk with them and escort them off the property.  The GWC, and her two younger sons were glaring at me the whole time, like I had just literally punt kicked a puppy over a field goal post.  The older son looked upset, but was still very quiet, other than saying ""Sorry about this"".  GCW packed up the carriage and said ""Come on boys. Before this false man perverts us even more.""

Naturally I just said ""Have a good day!""

**TL;DR- Matthew 7:1-5 *Judge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when there is the log in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.*  Guess she didn't read that part**

1375037044.0,652,self.TalesFromRetail,1j87fz,and he never offered to pimp my ride :( (long),ectopia,824,172,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1j87fz/and_he_never_offered_to_pimp_my_ride_long/,"I originally posted this in /r/letsnotmeet and someone suggested I should post it here. 

First off, I work at an independent video store in a highly residential, nuclear-family infested neighbourhood. We don't have any porn, but we do have a lot of fancy shmancy Criterion movies and other critically acclaimed international titles that are hard to come by. Most of our customers are regulars, and a lot of them have been coming to our store for 15+ years. I am a petite, girly blonde in my mid-twenties. I love movies, and I love my job - but it doesn't pay extremely well.

This particular encounter happened roughly two years ago. It was during the summer, so a few of my co-workers were on vacation and I had taken as many extra shifts as I possibly could (working somewhere between 30-40 hours a week). My mother lived within short walking distance from the store, so I didn't have a problem taking a few closing shifts at the time. The store is pretty small, so I always ended up closing alone.

This all happened at about 9:30pm, half an hour before closing time. This guy stomps into the store, dressed in baggy black clothing. I remember noticing him because he legit looked like Xzibit. Anyways, he comes in, and immediately goes to the very back of the store where we kept all our blu-rays. Our shelves aren't very tall, so I can see his head poking through. I go back to work, and fifteen minutes later I realize that we're the only two people left in the store, and that he's still in the exact same spot in the blu-ray section, staring at me. I'm a little startled, but I stare back until he looks away. Closing time is fast approaching so I decide to go talk to him, see if maybe he needs help choosing a film or whatever.

When I finally approach him, I immediately notice that he looks like he's about to piss his pants. He looks crazy anxious. His eyes are darting all over the room. I give him my usual speech, tell him I have to lock the door in less than five minutes and offer to help him choose something quickly. He stammers something along the lines of ""oh... i uh.. she's the one who sent me here... she wanted something funny... i never... she's... it won't take me long..."" I notice that he keeps playing with what I assume to be his belt. I can't see what he's doing because of his long baggy t-shirt, but I know he's playing with something at the back of his pants, at waist level. I start to suspect he might be concealing a weapon, and that he's planning a hold-up.

I do my best to hide how scared I am and head back to the counter. I have the strength of a wet noodle, so I had no intention of trying to be a hero. I was going to give him everything in the register, but I knew he'd probably be disappointed by how little was in there (no more than 400$). Unfortunately, my boss hadn't deposited the money in the safe under the counter in over two weeks so I began to pray that this guy wouldn't ask me to open it. Because it isn't actually visible, I figured there was a chance he didn't know it was there so I did my best to conceal it entirely.
Finally, he starts walking towards the counter and says he's not going to rent anything. I was doing my best to look busy, all while keeping him in my peripheral. He stopped about a foot in front of the counter, directly in front of me, I could tell he was holding something in his left hand and my heart sank. I looked at it, expecting to see a gun or a knife. Thankfully, it was just his penis. Just an average, semi-hard penis. I heaved a sigh of relief and began my closing routine.
The flasher seemed confused by my reaction, and I guess he thought I didn't look at it because he began contorting his body so his dick was in better view, trying to get my attention by saying random shit like ""uh so uhhh I'm leaving? uh, goodnight then?"". So I looked up at him, looked back down at his dick and said ""Yeah, whatever."" He seemed even more confused at this point and left quietly.

I called the cops, but nothing much happened. They had me look at some mugshots, but none of them looked anything like Xzibit. I figured I'd probably never see this guy again, because I assumed my reaction disappointed him since I knew for a fact that it didn't get him fully hard. Wrong.
Two months later I am working a day shift by myself on a Wednesday. The flasher staggers in, still wearing baggy clothes but this time everything is bright yellow. He comes up to the counter and starts awkwardly trying to chat me up, he points to the red writing on his blindingly yellow baseball cap and says ""Hey Mama, see this? What's it say?"" I totally can't help side-eyeing him as I answer ""Draid?"" he ignores my obvious lack of interest and chuckles ""Yeah girl, that's my name! What's yours?"" I lie and say my name is Deborah ""Do you work here a lot, Deb?""

At this point, I don't feel like playing along anymore so I do my best to sound as tough as I possibly can. ""Why the FUCK do you want to know?"" his smile instantly fades and he begins to stammer, and he proceeds to give me possibly the most absurd explanation I have ever heard ""Oh uh... well uh... y'see... I um I have this TWIN brother and like, he's kind of shady and like, he said he comes here a lot... so uh... if he ever did anything shady in your store um... like, I wouldn't want you to think it was me... cuz I'm not shady... but my TWIN is..."" I think I actually snorted. ""Alright Draid, whatever. I do work here a fair amount and it's possible your twin came in while I was here but he clearly didn't make much of an impression."" He seemed disappointed by this, shrugged and said ""Oh... Ok... Well uh that's good..."" and pretended to look at movies for about five minutes before bolting out of the store.

Once more, I stupidly assumed that would be my last encounter with him. I wanted him to think that he hadn't left an impression on me, since he clearly gets off on shocking people. I thought that by telling him that I didn't remember him, he'd be discouraged. Sadly, he had more of a ""Challenge: Accepted!"" attitude.

I didn't work night shifts for a good six months after this, but when I finally took one as a favour to a co-worker... yeah. Flasher shows up. I was already having a pretty shitty night, so by the time he entered the store I was already in a sour mood.

He walks in wearing his all-black outfit, has a big grin on his face and turns to me and says ""Hey, girl. Remember me?"" I was pissed. I could barely conceal my anger when I answered. ""Why would I?"" he seemed to lose some of his initial confidence and blurted ""oh... guess I got the wrong girl...""

He goes back to the same corner as he did the first time, peeking at me over the shelves from the back of the store. My cheeks were burning with rage. It really pissed me off that this guy kept coming back, that the cops would do pretty much nothing about it since he'd totally have time to run away before they got here, and that my fucking boss STILL hadn't installed security cameras. All he did was give me a ""beatdown stick"" (it's a heavy, wooden table leg with sharp corners and a duct tape handle.)

I knew from experience that he'd still be staring at me so I looked up and made eye-contact. I glared at him. Since acting indifferent didn't work, I took a different approach. I wanted to scare the fuck out of him. I yelled at him from across the store ""WHAT DO YOU WANT? YOU'RE STARING AT ME. DO YOU NEED HELP? YOU KEEP STARING AT ME LIKE YOU NEED SOMETHING"" he began to shake his head. ""NO? YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING? YOU SURE? YOU'RE STILL STARING AT ME LIKE YOU NEED SOMETHING"" he shook his head some more. ""ALRIGHT WELL IF YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING STOP STARING AT ME."" his head shot down.
I pulled out the beatdown stick and rested it over my shoulder like a baseball bat. I still wanted to scare him, but I was aware that being a petite little blond girl in a pink sequin dress didn't make me look like much of a threat. So I decided to make myself look like a crazy maniac. Before he came in the store, I was watching It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia so I figured I would just pretend to keep my attention on the show, all while exaggerating all of my reactions to it. I started yelling at the screen, like ""HAHAHAHA WHAT CRAZY MOTHERFUCKERS HAHAHA SO FUCKING HILARIOUS"" I made sure my laughter sounded fake and angry, and waved the beatdown stick a few times. It took about ten minutes but yeah, he ran out of the store FAST.

So yeah, I haven't seen him since and I really hope I don't either 'cause fuck I am out of ideas now.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1j87fz,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1j87fz/and_he_never_offered_to_pimp_my_ride_long/,

And, this one made me giggle. So  it's late on Monday and we are always dead on Mondays.  I'm working on floor moves when a wild customer appears.  

Lady- ""Hi.  ummm I need to do make an adjustment.""
Me-  ""Sure.  What did you need to adjust?""
Now this is the part where I usually get a receipt, and a customer complains about our price changes/sales.  However, this lady blindsided me.
Lady- ""I was at your A store the other day and bought two pairs of capris.  I returned them both for a different size, but A store didn't have another pair of navy ones, so I got black ones.""
Me- ""Oh? Did they charge you more for the black ones?""

Now, somehow half our capris by one brand went on sale, the rest stayed at full price.  Usually when they do this it's to get rid of the colorful ones and keep the solid colors.  However, not such the case. I assumed the other associate just didn't give her the even exchange.

  Now I look at the receipt and both are already discounted to the sale price.  I stare at the receipts to double check.  I figured maybe they forgot to add the coupon. 

Me- ""Ma'am, these are the right price. They did an even exchange.""
Lady-""No they aren't.  The black pair were 31.98, she only charged me 12.85.""
Blink.  blink
Me- ""Well.  That's okay.  You don't have to worry about it.""
Lady-  ""No.  The girl she was really nice and she didn't have to do it.  I knew they were $31.98.  If I didn't know or I didn't see the receipt, I wouldn't care.  I need to pay the difference.""

Blink Blink.

Several years back I worked at a grocery store, which now has been forced to close many of its stores.  At the time, I worked at the customer service counter where we cashed checks, did money orders, sold cigarettes, videos, and other goods, etc.  I'd dealt with my fair share of fake bills, scam artists, etc., but the worst experience I had came from a co-worker.

The store had recently hired on a loss-prevention lady since our theft was a bit out of control due to the neighborhood where the store was situated.  Well, after a couple months, speaking to her in passing, etc., she came in on her day off to collect her paycheck.  She patiently waited in line so she could cash it, and I commented that she looked very incognito that day, due to her coming to work in street clothes on her day off.  I cash her check, and away she goes.

Probably 20 minutes later, I'm called by the store director to come to his office.  I have someone cover for me, and away I go, having no clue why I'm being summoned.  I walk in, and there's my store director at his desk, with the loss-prevention girl sitting across from him, along with another empty chair next to her.  ""Have a seat,"" he says.

I sit down thinking, oh crap, they think I stole something.  The store director opens with the usual political crap about something we need to discuss.  He turns it over to her so she can make her statement.  She says that while I was cashing her check, I said something about ""incog-negro"", or something of the sort.  I was FURIOUS!  I quickly stood up and started toward the door, completely disgusted with, not only the situation, but that I would be accused of something like that.

How can you not know what that means??  Get a dictionary or something!!""  I then looked at the store director and told him that I couldn't believe what was happening, and that I had ALWAYS treated him with respect and that we had a great working relationship.

After that, he asked her to leave the room and told me that she had already made several other accusations against people in the store.  She was let go a couple months later for failing to produce any sort of change as it related to theft.

I have a ton of stories to share. I thought I'd also share this little tidbit. I posted on College Humor last year about my encounter with the law, it's now in their hall of fame! Here's a link: http://www.collegehumor.com/upick/6699627/pizza-fought-the-law

Edit 2: Front Page! Thanks everyone!

I used to work for a food company that would go to special events and cater. We are very popular in our province, so we get booked to a lot of shows. 

It was last summer and my pizza company was hired to serve free pizza for a huge union party that had over 10k people. Now I was a manager and I had 20 staff, spent at least 3 hours prepping ahead of time because we knew we would get rocked.

Gates open, and we already have a lineup. Let me also add there was also a burger place, hotdogs, chinese food, bakery stuff and all this other delicious food. We were the only ones who had a lineup for free pizza for the entire day.

So, it's hot. We are tired because you know some people take forever to choose between the only two options of cheese or pepperoni. We start to notice that we are actually going to run out of food within opening the first 5 hours. We were supposed to be open for at least 9 hours. We also had enough food for the expected 10k guests, but turns out the people that hired us had lied and there was more than that. This was also supposed to be a 2 day event by the way, so big hiccup.

We were given the OK to close the tent early, but there was still a huge line of 100 people and once we start telling them we're almost out of food they all rush in front of the counters just to grab a slice. It was complete madness. 

So we are finally out of pizza, but still had a lineup despite telling these people an hour before that we would be closing once it's out. Then the rage begins. An annoying customer starts shouting at us to give her pizza. She begins swearing to one of my servers, and then I confront her.

Me: ""Ma'am you need to calm down. You have no right to talk to my server like that.""

Rude Woman: ""I want my pizza, you can't do this! I waited in line for an hour, my children are starving! What the fuck are you guys doing?! Blah blah rude rude"" 

Me: ""We said we were almost out of pizza an hour ago, and besides the pizza is FREE. You aren't paying for it. There are 5 other food places right beside us with NO LINE. Pizza is not the only food here.""

Rude Woman: *Starts swearing at us*

Customer beside the rude woman: ""Hey bitch shut the fuck up! Go to fucking hell! You can't talk to them like that what's wrong with you, you rude fat bitch!""

The two then almost get into a damn brawl, but I was so glad this customer stood up for us. I was about to lose my shit as well, but it was such a sigh of relief. Some customers are just awesome. I gave her some pop for her and her kids since we had no more pizza. While the two fought we just closed our tent up and had to disperse the horrid crowd.

Our policy at the time was exchange or gift card only on PC titles but we'd refund or exchange unopened console games for cash. We also had a points scheme that would mail out vouchers to our loyalty card holders (this is important).

So, it transpired that our store and several other of our stores in the area were getting hit by a group of scammers who'd buy a console game, remove the shrinkwrapping, steal the game out of the box and then re-wrap the game with a shrinkwrapper using padding of some sort to make the game feel like the correct weight.

They always used to hit stores at the busiest times and always had a receipt so management used to authorise these without any further thought to actually checking if the game was actually in the case (Stupid I know).

So after losing several games in our store to this scam, we were being a bit more wary of returns, especially shrinkwrapped games coming in at busy times, so we had a customer come in with a copy of GTA IV which had only been released a few days earlier wanting a refund, it was insanely busy so the manager took it in without checking on behalf of one of our new staff, refunds the customer and thinks nothing of it.

Well, it turned out that we'd been caught out again with the scam. The  case had no game in it, but the thief being a total genius had stuffed it with one of our loyalty card letters we send out, probably trying to be clever.

He wasn't that clever though, the big problem with using our literature for this is that not only did it have his loyalty card number at the top of the letter, IT ALSO HAD HIS FULL NAME AND ADDRESS written on the top.

This includes kicking people out, doing exchanges and refunds, and dealing with irate customers. I'm alright with this, though, because I just need to tell kids to stop screwing around in the store. 

Anyways. I was at work earlier this evening when 3 young boys came in - I’d say 9 - 11 years old. My coworker and I were keeping an eye on them because it’s retail and the little brats like to steal things. 

The store I work at isn’t exactly kid-friendly. There are a lot of risque items as well as items with vulgar language on them. Our card rack capitalizes on both these aspects quite well. One of the cards we sell is a birthday card with a woman holding a chalkboard so as to cover her insinuated nude breasts and genitalia; the chalkboard reads: 
&gt;Menu:

&gt;*  Large, juicy melons 

&gt;* Smokin’ hot buns 

&gt;* Whipped cream for dessert.

The boys glanced over the card to pick up a mug covered in various curse words, with one laughing and pointing at the smallest of the three as he proclaimed, “These all describe you! You’re a fuckin’ faggot bitch! Ahahahahahahaha!”

At this point, my coworker looks at me with this look of “Are you kidding me?”

They returned to the aforementioned card, picked it up, and the same boy who spoke said (quite loudly), “This bitch deserves what’s coming to her. Slut.”

They then wandered around the womens’ clothing section for a bit, picking up the less modest clothing and making remarks such as, “Yeah, she’s begging for the D if she wears this.” “God, anyone who wore this would open their legs for anything!” etc.

They soon left, only to return an hour later, running through the store. Apparently, they were playing keep-away with the smallest boy’s Hulk hat. After being told twice to not run, I  crouched to their level and told them, “Listen. One, we said to not run. Two, this isn’t a playground. Three, you were in here earlier making absolutely inappropriate remarks about girls. Would your mother or aunt or grandmother be okay hearing you say the thing you said around my coworker and me? Four, you don't treat your friends like they're friends, and I wouldn't want to be friends with someone like you. Now, get out and do not return unless you have your parents with you, or else I'm calling security.”

The boy who did the most talking looked at me and said, ""I can talk about girls any way I want. They're just girls and it's adult to let them know who's boss.""

At this point, I physically removed them from the store. Apparently, they’ve gone to tell their fathers about the mean lady at the store.

My manager on duty overheard this and told me that, while what they did was atrocious, I was acting completely out of bounds and could be suspended for what I did, but he'll just write me up. However, he congratulated me on scaring them.

**TL;DR:** Little kids come in and make a disturbing amount of rape jokes, so I kick them out and get in trouble.

I worked in a chain restaurant in the UK while I was at uni. One evening, a family are seated in my section - mother, father, and their two adult daughters. I know them: they live a few houses up the road from me, and I used to go on these Christian youth-group excursions with the mum (a family friend's son had invited me onto them and my parents forced me to go). She had always been a very pleasant person, and the husband and kids always seemed friendly enough.

Anyway, I go over to them and say ""Hi [her name]. How are you?"" She just barks their drink orders at me, no ""can I have..."", no ""please"", no ""thank you"". Weird. 

I take them their drinks, take their order, and am putting in through when she appears next to me at the till. ""Can you take the foil off the wine bottle?"" She asks me. Yeah, apparently she wanted me to pick the foil off the neck of the wine bottle. That bit of foil that nobody takes off because it doesn't obstruct your wine-drinking in any way. I obediently go back to their table and perform this pointless task - they don't even bother to thank me.

Their food comes out and I take it to them. Again, no thanks, just a couple more drinks orders growled at me. Ten minutes later she wanders up to me again: apparently she doesn't like her food. She freely admits that there's nothing wrong with it, she ordered a calzone without ever having had one before and apparently just didn't like the concept of it. She wants to exchange it for a pepperoni pizza. Fine. I go back to the table to take the calzone away... she'd eaten two-thirds of it! Right, can't have hated it that much, anyways I took it off the bill.

Well, her replacement pizza comes out. The kitchen have kind of fucked up and done a large instead of a medium. So, I take it to her and say they've accidentally done a bigger one - but don't worry, we'll only put a regular one on the bill, and we can box-up any that's left over. Again, no thanks, but the husband wants yet another beer.

They finish and ask for the bill. Just after handing it to them, I see her talking to my manager. She had asked for her replacement pizza to be taken off the bill because she hadn't been happy with her first order - and, for some reason, he complied. They paid - without leaving a single penny as a tip - and left. She had eaten every single morsel of that pizza.

Well, next time I saw her in the street she actually had the audacity to say ""Hello j_guazu, how are you?"". I blanked that bitch, and me and my family have done ever since. And I've made it my business to make sure that as many people as possible from her church know what a scamming, disrespectful cunt she is. I can't get over how friendly she would be when I was her neighbour, but could then treat me like shit when I'm waiting on her.

I had tried everything, I have talked to corporate, I had proof and nothing was done. 

I got the job when I was 16, the manager who hired me was my mentor, he served as a father figure in my life. I worked hard for years, getting promotions and pleasing the customers. Our store was run well, the store manager was a reasonable man and was best friends with the mens department manager (my manager), the employees here were intelligent and fun to be around. We were the highest selling store in our state. It was a magical place to work, I loved every minute of it.

A year ago I was offered a promotion to manager. Housewares needed a new manager, and I was the one they wanted to run the Department. For the longest time I was a Supervisor I was the young, reasonable guy everyone loved. Being offered the promotion was the happiest day of my life, no joke. I was overwhelmed and had a lot of anxiety over this, but, everything worked out.

As manager I began noticing how different management was to being a lowly worker. Lot of drama, and the worst corruption. I noticed one day as I was talking to the textiles manager as he was ringing someone out, he was giving that person a massive discount. What? That can't be right. 70% off? The item was 30% off. I confront him, and he plays dumb saying it was a mistake. I believe him, I do, because I trust the people working here. But, I'm still suspicious. The next day I'm returning something to textiles when i see him again with the same customer giving him a massive discount.

I confront him again. He just shrugs, and tells me ""Does it really matter? Just another perk of being manager"". I go up to Rick our Store manager, and tell him what I saw, I show him proof, and he just sighs and leans forward and tells me ""A manager is allowed to give out discounts. You didn't know? That's fine, but, if you wanna hand out discounts don't make it so obvious"". I sit there my mouth agape, looking at him like he lost his mind. ""sir"" I say ""Sir, that's against corporate policy isn't it?"", he looks at me and his eyes narrow ""If you want to keep your job here, don't think so hard about this"".

I storm out and go to find Alan. Alan was the one who hired me, he is my mentor and like a father to me, he was the smartest man i knew, the hardest working a real stand up guy, he would know what to do. I go to his office. He looks up from his computer, ""hey Dean, what's going on? Need something?"", so i calmly explain what i saw and heard. Alan sighs, and motions for me to sit. ""It's best if you ignore this. I don't much agree with this, but, the right thing to do is to mind your own business. If Rick says it's okay, then it's okay. Now you've done a darn fine job here. Don't ruin your career here"". I'm stunned, the Alan i knew would never say this to me, the Alan I knew would never turn a blind eye to these shady dealings. There's no feeling quite like knowing the guy you idolized turns out to be just as bad as the rest. I went home early that day, I needed to decide what to do.

I decided to not do anything, yet. Days went by and I got the distinct feeling I was not very wanted here.The aura in that store had changed. Managers would glare at me, and I just felt unwanted. But I trucked on, there was nothing to do. About a couple weeks ago, I was returning a shirt to womens when i caught a new hire, Tamara removing the tags from a blouse and placing the item into a bag without paying. I confronted her, and she denied everything, but, I saw and dragged her to my office. 

I was giving her a lecture preparing to fire her, when the door opened and the womens dresses manager, Amy barged in and claimed she would handle this. I think ok, it's her employee and a a close friend of hers, she'll handle this. I go back to my department. I then see Tamara coming out of the office's and heading back to her department. She wasn't fired. I go to Ricks office, and ask him whats going on, Rick ""She had a minor lapse in judgement. Everything has been fixed, no harm done. It's over and done with"" he harshly explained. Again, I was wrong about this store, i was wrong about everything.

That night at closing I was taking the trash out when I was closing, mostly everyone had gone home, and I had just finished my cash drops, I was walking out when I saw Alan in the womens department taking the sec-tags off the items and putting them in a bag. He must have a dozen shirts in there, he hadn't paid. I followed him out the store, and there was a car waiting.

Alans wife was in said car. She spotted me and waved, Alan, turned around and came up to me. I was the first to speak ""You didn't pay for those clothes, did you?"", and so Alan looks at me,looks me dead in the eye and says ""No. But, I can and will pay at later date. There was no harm done"" I grow red ""No harm done? This is against the policy, this is theft pure and simple. I have to report this"", he puts hs hand on my shoulder ""Son, I got you this job, and with 1 word I can get you fired. We going to have a problem?"", and then he walked off and got into her car and left. 

That was the final straw. I felt so betrayed by Alan, and this store. How could they be this blatant about their stealing? I had proof they were, so the next day i went to LP. The LP manager, Arnold was not the most pleasant of people to be around, he was egoistical and not very good at his job, his LP agents weren't much better. I tell him what I saw, and ask if he can replay the videos. Gotcha!Arnold looks over to me, and tells me ""So ole'Alan is stealing, eh? Who cares, you aren't going to use me as a witness because I trust ole'Alan, he's a good man. Corporate will not care, and your job is on the line. Just sayin"", I ignore him and walk out. 

During break I contact corporate, I contact the Regional Manager, and to my surprise he is willing to do an investigation. The next day I'm called into Ricks office, sitting in Ricks chair is a man in a suit I had never seen before, RM, had to be and in front of him Alan. The man introduces himself as Todd and says he was contacted here by a concerned manager that we had a theft problem. I explained to him what I saw, and what had been going on. Todd, asked Alan, and Alan defends himself and then finally deflects this onto me, and attacks my character.

Todd smiles and says he think he sees the issue here, he says he's looked around and thinks the issue is I'm not able to do my job. he recommends that I not be placed in any leadership position. He gets up and shakes our hands. Rick is furious, and Alan is smiling. Rick looks down at me, ""Should have minded your business. I should fire you, but, I won't because truth be told you're a valuable employee, but, your time as a manager is over"" he boasted. I get up and walk out, Rick yells at me, I tell him all that needs to be said ""I'm done. I quit"". As I'm walking out Alan grabs my shoulder, ""Son, rethink what you just said. You spent 11 years here,you aren't going to be able to use us as a reference. Think about what you're doing"", nope, I don't care. I throw my badge on the ground and walk out the front door.

A man and a woman about my age (mid-twenties) came in and ordered a coffee and a soda to go (and paid for them) while browsing the menu. They decided the menu didn't have what they were looking for (its ok, it happens) and begin to inquire about the ""grab and go"" type snacks and desserts up front in the case.

There were a lot of incidents involving nasty customers but I wanted to share with you all my final breaking point. 

I was working the drive through window during the dinner rush, not taking orders but handing them out the window. I was wearing a headset so I could hear the orders as they were being taken. It was ridiculously busy and I had been running around for over an hour with no stop in orders, pretty stressed but thriving because I get off on being busy like that. 

I heard one customer insisting (over the deafening roar of their diesel truck) that they didn't want special sauce on our ""flagship"" sandwich. They were being a dick about it, but whatever, some people really don't like thousand island dressing. 

Eventually I get to this order, and put it all together, making sure the burger has a grill slip for ""no sauce"". I hand the gentleman his food and turn to get his large Coke. 

When I turn around to hand him his drink, I hear, ""YOU LITTLE CUNT I SAID NO SAUCE!"" the burger comes flying through the window and hits me in the face. It's hot, there is cheese and grease and (GOD FORBID, the sauce) all over my face, hair, glasses, and shirt. This was especially disgusting to me because I was vegan at the time. Obviously the grill crew had screwed up, and now I was paying the price, as usual when the grill screwed up. 

(Vegan fast food worker? Being 16 leaves few options for employment in my area)

After a second of just staring at the guy, shocked, covered in burger jizz, I said, ""If you think you're getting another one of these you're fucking crazy.""

I took the lid off his soda and threw it on him, slammed the window shut, took off my headset, and walked out the door. I never went back.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_182dbo,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/182dbo/and_a_burger_in_the_face/,

I was working my second open to close shift in two days. In the evening, a family of at least 5 walked into the shop. As one of the young children in the group came up to the counter, another young man off to my right stood near the other counter where we keep our trading card game cards, dices, and other gaming accessories.

He asked, ""Why are there so many different kinds of dice?""

The woman standing behind him responded, ""That's none of your fucking business.""

I explained to the young man that the different dice could be used in role playing games such as DnD, MTG, etc. He asked what those were, and the woman told him, ""You don't need to be asking question. Mind your own fucking business before I slap you head into this counter to get the point into your head.""

I don't tolerate certain things in life, and threatening a child, especially a child just asking innocent questions, is one of the things I will not tolerate.

I turned to her and said, smiling as I always do, ""Ma'am, I will not allow that in this store."" The comic store I work in is a private business, so I am fully able to do this.

She replied, ""I'll do whatever I fucking want in any fucking store I damn well please!""

I told her, ""Ma'am, you will not do that in THIS store, please. It will not happen in THIS store.""

First off moms are the work customers ever I despise when they come in my store. Especially around back to school time, when they come in ""packs."" You know the type. Gabbing extremely loud as they rush through the store picking up anything and everything they see, unfolding, looking at them for a second, and despite not taking one step after picking up an item they manage to place it 3 feet from it's original spot. Their time is the most precious commodity in the world, and we are lucky they grace us with their presence. /s They are all bad in their own way but this one woman put me over the top. 

So this and her friend came in and were your typical stay at home mom shoppers. It was only me and them in the store. (Sidenote. We are the home store for our company and just had a store visit from the head of the outlet division so our store was immaculate so they could take pictures to send to the other stores.) Despite me offering to grab any sizes they might need and constantly hovering around them, to avoid having them destroy the place. They still managed to make a mess of everything. One of them asked for a tank top down that was out of reach I said no problem and grabbed a hook to grab it down. What happened next made this woman my most hated customer of all time.

While I'm grabbing the tank down. She's looking at the shirts folded below on the shelves. She pushed me to the side grabbed a stack of tshirts I had folded the night before so each shirt showed a different part of the graphic, so that when they were stacked up the pile showed the full graphic. It took me a long time to fold them like that. So she takes the stack and flips them onto the ground and proceeds to grab the one on the very bottom. She then looks at me and says ""Sorry, but then again I guess I am you're job security."" With a voice and look that just screamed I'm better than you, as she stepped over the pile of tshirts on the floor and pushed me out of the way to go to the register.

I don't know what it was about the situation that made me so furious, but I was literally shaking with anger. I walked over to her, took the items from her hands and told her to get the fuck out of my store. Obviously she threw a fit. Asked for my manager. I just replied I am the manager, and you will leave my store before I call security. She left, but an hour later i got a call from my district manager. I told him to watch the tapes.

About 10 minutes later my section phone starts ringing, Its the customer service counter, there's a couple at the counter having issues with EFTPOS and can't pay for their goods and because of this they want to talk to someone **because we are wasting their time**.

This is a touchy subject that people don't usually like being told about.  This is the conversation that we had;

Couple (C): Your stupid EFTPOS machine isn't working and has wasted our time, this is ridiculous, me and my husband are in a rush and this needs to be done.

Me: Sorry Sir/Madam, unfortunately the error code we are receiving from our merchant is saying that there isn't enough funds on your EFTPOS card....

C: (interrupts me) There is enough money on the card! Fix your stupid machine!
Me: OK Madam, I'll process it on another machine to make sure its not our end stuffing up.

I put the transaction through and am greeted with the same error once again.

Me:  I'm getting the same error again sorry Madam, do you have an alternate method of payment? Or we can hold your items for you until you can get in contact with your bank?

C: (pulls out another card like I was the most unreasonable person ever) I'l just pay with this card, I want a discount though, you've wasted my time!

Me:  Unfortunately madam, even though this issue has taken up some of your time, we cannot offer you a discount, there is no fault on our end of things.

C: But there is money on that account, its your fault!

Me:  No it's not madam, I believe you when you say that there is money on that account, but that is an issue you will have to chase up with your bank, there is nothing I can do.

They pay for their goods and leave, and say that they will be complaining to management about their experience.  

I don't understand people like that, they legitimately asked for a discount because they didn't have enough money to pay.  How do those people remember to breathe when they go to sleep at night? How did they learn to tie their own shoelaces?

Like any proper store, we had a slushie machine that was the bain of our collective existence.  It was a constant source of sticky annoyance.  I once got yelled at by a customer for telling her child not to lick the dispensing nozzle.  But I digress.  The point is, we had a slushie machine.

One night, just as I was clocking out, a group of about four teenagers came in.  They wandered around the store as I took my till to the office to count out.  When I came back, I saw that the slushie machine had been left running and there was now a waterfall of glacier blue rasperry cascading from the drip tray into a vast pool of blue on the floor I had just finished mopping.  

So I turned it off, told my boss' idiot brother, who they wisely kept on the midnight shift lest he scare off the customers, to to mop it up, and went back into the office to wile away my precious off-time watching the closed circuit security camera.  As I suspected, one of the teenagers proceeded to place something from our shelves into his coat pocket and leave the store.  I stopped him as he left, asked him to come back in and hand me the stolen merchandise - a bottle of No-Doz.  

I brought him to the back room, where he swore all the way to Jesus and half way back that this was the first time he's ever done such a thing and this, if I would just let it go, just this once, he would never ever ever do it again.  I knew he was full of shit, but I guess I felt kind of sorry for him, so I decided to cut him a break and call his parents instead of the police.  Whay can I say?  I'm a push over.

His mom, however, was not.  When I told her what had happened, her exact words were ""Then I suggest you call the police.""  As I hung up the phone, I felt even sorrier for the kid, but I knew that letting it slide would do him no favors.  ""Sorry,"" I said.  ""Your mom said to call the police.""  And I did.

When the cop showed up, he cuffed the kid and took him away so I could go home.  On the way out of the office, he stopped, picked up the No-Doz and held it inches from the kid's face.

Now, I pride myself on my customer service. I am honest, if a person wants my opinion on an item or I see them picking a low quality cut I will tell them it's crap and give them a better option. Management does not really like this, but I remind them that our job is to provide exceptional customer service and I am not going to lie to a customer just so their profits go up a by a few bucks. Regardless, I have a lot of customers who love me and I have gotten a large number of positive reviews from customers who phone in to the corporate office to tell them about the good job I've done. Basically, I don't put up with crap. If it is within my power I will help someone the way I would want to be helped. And if they are asshats I don't put up with it. So here is where the story gets fun.
About two years ago I was doing my cleanup, this involves foaming the whole department, walls, tables, floor, saw, with a very powerful and toxic if ingested soap. A customer came up to the counter and asked my to cut up the whole fryer chicken she had into parts. Normally, I would have been happy to oblige, but since the tables were covered in this foam I told her that I was unable to. She then proceeded to tell me that it was my job to do this, to which I told her that it was my job to also not poison her. She did not find that funny. She demanded that I cut the chicken for her. I pointed to the foam covering the department and repeated that I could not without getting her and anyone who eats the chicken very sick. Well that was just not good enough. She lost it. ""It's your job!"" ""You have to do this!"" all the typical bullshit that over privileged customers scream at us lowly customer service folks. So what do I do, I laugh at her tell her I'm not going to help her and that she can go talk to a manager. I turn my back to her as she storms off to complain.
Of course the manager comes flying up to me and asks what happened. I pointed out the toxic chemicals and said that I was unable to cut the bird for her and I was not going to put up with being screamed at by a customer for not making her sick. So he goes gives her a heaping amount of gift cards and sends her on her way. And from there I thought it was over, but not by a long shot. Apparently she called the regional corporate office the next day to complain about me. The complaint made its way up the chain to the district manager. Now this guy is a complete asshole, but we have always been cordial towards one another and he appreciated the outstanding customer service I have regularly provide. I show up for my next shift the following weekend and the district manager and the rest of the store managers are waiting for me. I get called into the office and asked what the hell happened. I tell them about the customer and then proceed to get chewed out by all the managers ""you have to do what she asks"" ""customer service blah blah blah"". During this I am just sitting in the chair smiling and listening. Once they are done I look at them and said something to the effect of, ""okay sure I'll cut the chicken next time, but I have a question for you. Would you guys like a multi-million dollar lawsuit on your hands, because I'm fairly sure poisoning a customer is a good way to go about getting one. I understand where you are coming from, but I have never provided poor customer service and as far as I am concerned I saved this company millions of dollars and a heck of a lot of embarrassment. So next time, if I am getting you guys, I'll go ahead and poison her. Who's contact info should I give out to her when she wants to sue?"" Everyone went silent. A lot of mumbling and repeating stuff about customer service ensued until they were done at which point I thanked all the managers by name for their time and went to go do my job. I never heard a word about it again, and thanked my lucky stars that I was a union member so I could not get fired for insubordination.

I'll set the scene first:
I worked in a high end UK supermarket chain on the Deli Counter (cooked meats, cheeses and hot roast chickens).
I was one of 3 guys who worked all day on the counter on Sundays, we had a morning and afternoon guy too.
All the counters (Deli, Meat, Fish and Patisserie) are run by one manager, and one assistant manager. But they only work one Sunday a month each.
So every other weekend we run it ourselves, after a few months i took over the paperwork for all counters and put myself in charge.

This system worked, my Manager approved me running it on Sundays (paperwork always done correct), my colleagues were grateful that id get the blame if shit went wrong, and i was happy as i doubled my wages through my own hard work. I got the role ""3rd Hand"". a Regular employee with manager roles to do when they weren't in.(after Deparment managers and Assistant Managers).

Now, all managers had the 1 Sunday a month deal, so often there was only one section manager a Sunday and they took on the role of ""Daily Store Manager"" (in charge for the day).

I got on with all managers except one, we'll call him McTache (only guy in the branch allowed a mustache because he has ""fuck off"" tattooed on his top lip, former bike gang memeber gone good).
He's a pain in the ass and hates young clever kids because he fucked his own youth up.

Now, one Sunday in south east london the whole Borough (county area?) had a power cut due to a fire at a electricity substation.

Our Store is the only one in 5 miles with a back-up generator (dont want to lose stock). 

And we sell hot chickens. The only hot food available that day. For 5 Miles.

I got to work EARLY (5AM) to take a van to 2 other stores too small to have generators, and take thier raw chickens.
I get back to my store and ""spike"" them all ready for rotisserie roasting and crank up the ovens to full.
We get to opening time (10 am) and ive got 10 ovens ready to go, coming out at 30 minute intervals in the day. Last oven out an hour before closing. Sensible right?
Its now McTache comes in, grumble powercut grumble (everyone else got in fine), and hes the Daily Manager.

This will be fun.

I got the paperwork for the stock transfers done and gave it to him.

McT: ""What the hell is this?!""

Me:  ""we'll i took thier stock because today were the only way people can get a hot dinner""

McT: ""oh. yes. good work""


Geez, thanks. I bite my lip, its a miracle this guy hasn't chewed me off about not asking first.


Now we proceeded to do immense business for the day, chickens selling out quickly, and we had our second highest sales day of the year (beaten only by the saturday before christmas).


I work my arse off until 3pm, chickens in, chickens out, serve chickens. Then the last oven come out.
We close at 4, so we cant cook any more in time to sell. Breath a sigh of relief and start cleaning the chicken zone.


McTache approaches.
McT: ""what are you doing?""

Me:  ""erm, cleaning the chicken area, we're sold out.""

McT: ""put more in the oven"" (80 minute cook time, 60 minutes of store time. anyone else see the problem?).

Me:  ""no, they wont be cooked in time, thats a stupid idea"".


ok, i wasn't the most diplomatic there, but i was sick of chickens.

McT: ""did you call me stupid?!"" McTache is getting his angry on.

I took my hat off, ""yes, i am, you wont sell them, thats *epic mental maths* a loss of £60 of stock and £120 profit.""

McT: ""I AM THE DSM. MY WORD IS LAW. PUT THE CHICKENS ON NOW"". fuck hes mad.

Me:  ""no chance, get someone else to do it, im off to the office to finish the paperwork"".

I walked off, leaving him bellowing at my colleagues to put on chickens.
I got my paperwork done, and went back down just after close at 4, just as the chickens came out.
He comes over and starts screaming at me:
""If you'd put them on when i said we'd have sold them. This is all your fault, im reporting you to the Store Manager""

Awww hell. The chickens get sold to staff for 50p at a loss. Worst, it took an extra half hour to clean up, something we weren't paid extra for, and i'd already put in 3 more hours that morning.

The next day at my monday evening shift i get called into the Store Managers office.
The Store Manager was a very reasonable lady, and a good friend of mine, particularly after i pioneered the ""3rd hands"" System. 

SM: ""I hear you had an argument with McT yesterday over the chickens.""

Me: ""yeah . . .""

SM: ""That you called him stupid infront of other staff and customers""

Me: ""Yeah . . .""

SM: ""That you disobeyedd the Daily Store Manager and ignored him""

At this point i am thinking i am in it now. I can't deny any of it, chicken cooking is recorded, with times and who put them in.

SM: ""Did you know we made record money yesterday because we had hot food from you on offer?""

Me: ""i thought we would, thats why i got the stock transferred early""

SM: ""a stock transfer you weren't authorised to make""

Me: ""yeah"" - the dead feeling creeps in now.

SM: ""well, you were right, you made us alot of money yesterday. And McT made the wrong call, and abused the oher staff by shouting at them. We want to thank you for your actions and reward you.""

Me: ""wait, what?!""

SM: ""The store is a partnership, we all work for each other, yesterday you made the right call for the company, were giving you a case of Jack Daniels as a thankyou for yesterday and the unpaid time you put in.""

I am happy now, my shit day is compensated for.

SM continues: ""and we're sending McT on an anger management course and he's on Disciplinary.""

Justice is served.

Next sunday McT is forced to come over and apologise to me, and acknowledge that as 3rd hand i run it, not him.
Felt good to stick to my guns and win.

**Introduction:**  I work for a security company whose uniform is a blue polo shirt with a brightly stitched yellow badge on it and black dress slacks. After my shift, I wandered into Best Buy where they wear a similar blue polo but with tan khakis. I was looking at some tablets when this commotion arises from the front of the store; people are walking toward the front, then running up to the windows. I was about to go look anyway when a customer runs back to me and says, ""Hey! You work here, right? You need to come see this!"" He sounded genuinely concerned so I didn't bother correcting him and instead followed him out of the store. There, right on front of a gathering group of people, was car that had just caught on fire.

**Act I:**  I only wanted to look at tablets but suddenly there's this whole situation unfolding and walking away just isn't an option, especially since the actual Best Buy employees were just sorta wandering out and taking pictures of the fire on their smartphones. First thing's first: I grabbed one of the yellow-shirted Best Buy Loss Prevention employees (who was also busy snapping pictures away on her phone) and told her to call 911. [Note: in any emergency, don't assume anyone is going to call 911. If you can't do it yourself, pick one person and tell them to do it *even if* someone else *may* have already done it. 911 doesn't care how many people call in to report one emergency.]

While she starts to use her phone for something productive, I start waving people away from the area and telling people to back up. I'm tapping on car windows to get people to either get out or pick a different parking space further away, but gawkers keep coming. People tend to crowd around disasters instead of running away from them -- I have no idea why -- so establishing a perimeter is important and about 300 ft is all I can reasonably protect with the sheer amount of people trying to come see what's happening. So now I'm yelling at every moron walking up to get back to take a video (seriously, why the hell are so many people walking *toward* this thing?) and finally the Loss Prevention lady gets back to me to report that the local Fire Dept is on their way. I'm about to ask her to help me keep people from getting close but she immediately disappeared. I spend the next five minutes trying to keep moronic motorists from driving literally *right by* the blaze that has now engulfed the front third of this sedan before the FD shows up and immediately gets to work.

**Act II:**  Thinking I was essentially done, the Fire Dept then assumes that I'm a Best Buy employee and asks me to see if I can go find the owner of the van that was parked closest to the fire because even though they're fighting the fire, they need this van moved. Okay, well, I can do that. When you're a first-responder, you inherit all the responsibilities of overseeing the situation until appropriate people show up, and so far, no Best Buy manager has come outside to help.

So I go into Best Buy and try to use their PA system to call out the license plate of the van in an attempt to find the owner, but I have no clue how to work their phone system. I ask one of the employees at customer service (who probably had no idea what was happening outside) to dial me into the PA and then hand it over to me but he gives me this look of *Seriously? You don't know how to do this yourself?* He does it for me, then hands me the phone and tells me to start talking when I hear the beep. Well, there's no beep. So I tell him and he gets even more of an attitude with me, giving me a look that said *How stupid are you?* He turns the phone around to me and tells me what numbers to press and I do it myself. Luckily it worked, even though there never was a beep, and I moved on to making the same announcement in every store up and down that strip mall, just in case the owner of the van had gone into a different store. I never did find the owner.

**Epilogue:**  Finally I reported back to the Fire Chief and the police officer who showed up. Everything was long under control so they didn't need me any more and I went back inside the Best Buy to resume my shopping. After a couple minutes, the same jackass employee passes me in an aisle, does a double-take and says ""Oh shit, you don't work for us do you?"" The look on his face was priceless and he felt so bad that he offered to buy me a Dasani. Hey, it wasn't much but I took it and left without buying anything because really, at that point, I wasn't interested in being there anymore.

TL;DR: Repeatedly mistaken for a Best Buy employee, I help out in a minor emergency, receive very little help from *actual* employees, and then get an attitude from an employee for not knowing how to work their intercom.

My coworker approached the man and asked if he could help him find anything. The man looked up from the wall of tapes and simply said,   
*""Damn, I wish I was your lover.""*  
  
This was the title of a song very popular at that time, a fact known full well by my coworker, as we had been selling tons of it. Instead of pointing out the song to the man, my coworker jumped back in mock-indignation and said in a loud voice, *""Sir, I don't even KNOW you.""*

So I work in a petrol station. I'm unaware of the rules regarding mobile phone usage in other countries or in other petrol stations but at my one in particular the use of mobile phones is prohibited. I don't know why; all I know is I can't authorise a pump if someone is using a mobile phone (same goes for smoking a cigarette, a kid under 16 years old or someone who blatantly doesn't know what they're doing). The company I work for routinely does checks on this to make sure the staff are authorising pumps correctly. If you fail to authorise a pump without doing the checks the first time you get a verbal warning. Second is a written warning. Third is a second written warning and retraining. Fourth is dismissal.

So I'm working one day with an older co-worker (hereby referred to as 'D') of mine. She gets flustered easily and can't handle prickish customer very well. This guy rolls up in a BMW (hereby referred to as 'BMW'), lifts the pump and proceeds to start talking on his phone while trying to dispense fuel. D turns the pump off. BMW storms in to the shop as thus ensues:

* BMW: ""Phones don't even affect pumps.""
* D: ""You cannot use your phone while dispensing fuel.""
* BMW: ""Show me where in this place it says that.""
* D: ""It says it on all the pumps and it says it in here also. I cannot authorise a pump if you're using your mobile phone.""
* BMW: ""Listen to me, I don't have to take lectures from the likes of you people. Don't you dare chastise me.""
* D: ""I am not chastising you all I'm saying is...""
* BMW: ""Yes you are. I pay your fucking wages, people like me keep these sorts of places in business.""

He then proceeded to write D's name on a piece of paper. At this point I felt the need to chime in.

* Me: ""You wanna calm down there?""
* BMW: (He points) ""Mind your own business.""
* Me: ""You can't use your phone while using a pump, that's all she's saying.""
* BMW: ""And how am I meant to know that?""
* Me: ""There are signs at every pump, a sign in here, plus D just told you.""
* BMW: ""I don't have to take lectures from the likes of you, I'm not stuck in here like you are. I pay your wages.""
* Me: ""Away you go then.""
* BMW: ""What did you just say to me?""
* Me: ""You don't want to take lectures from the 'likes of me'? Away you go then.""
* BMW: ""And what's your name?"" (He starts squinting at my nametag)
* Me: (I hold up my nametag) ""My name is [full name] and you're not getting served today. Away you go.""

He leaves and drives off. What appeared to be his wife was sitting in the passenger seat and she looked like she was a little embarrassed. A customer who was waiting to be served laughed at him on his way out.

By taking our names he seemed to be threatening to lodge a complaint or something. It's been a few days since this happened and no complaint has been lodged.

Usually they're subtle or at least halfway-reasonable about the ""misunderstandings,"" like exploiting coupons, so it surprises me when I get someone this inane and nonsensical about it. 

I was working on a drive-thru shift today, and we get this older lady (not quite ""elderly"" but certainly in her early fifties or so) who orders about $12 worth of food. She gets to the window and she's like ""Oh dear, I forgot my purse,"" and then she looks at me expectantly like she wants me to give her something. I respond, ""I'm sorry about that, ma'am! Would you like us to hold your food for you? Just let us know that you're back and we'll have it ready for you. We'll make sure it's hot!""

She looks at me for a moment and then says ""Oh, yeah, thanks. That's very thoughtful of you,"" in a way that sounded quite sarcastic, making me very confused. She then drove away. I shrugged and told them to cancel the order so we could wait until she came back to make it fresh.

Fast forward about twenty-five minutes, and she returns. She pulls up to the speaker box and says ""Yeah, I came through here earlier and I didn't have my purse, now I'm back,"" and I reply ""Alright ma'am, please pull around to the window!""

When I take her money, I can tell she's really pissed, and I don't understand why. I figured it was frustration and embarrassment at having not brought her money. Turns out I was kinda right.

When she gets all of her food, hot and fresh like we promised, she proceeds to unload on me.

She says, ""Do I get anything for the trouble?""

I say, ""I'm sorry, ma'am? What was that?""

She says very forcibly, ""I'm an old lady and you made me drive all the way back home for my money! The least you could do is give me a free drink or a discount or something. But it looks like you don't even care.""

I wear a baffled look on my face for a moment as I try to imagine what she's getting at, and finally I say ""I'm sorry, I can't give you anything for free.""

She frowns and says ""Do you have any idea how much of an inconvenience that was to me? Terrible customer service, just terrible. Terrible."" She says this as she looks away from me and shakes her head disapprovingly.

I try to apologize again, but she cuts me off and says ""You know what? Forget it, just..."" and drives away.

With these kinds of people, I almost wish I could ask them what planet they're from. NASA needs to know about it.

It seems a bit odd, trying to post a story as the horrific events in Boston unfold.  So I'd like to take a moment and say thank you to the police, firefighters, EMTs, ER nurses and doctors, race volunteers, and military personnel who all immediately responded to this horrible attack.  No panic, no hesitation, just an immediate reaction to the call for aid.  You guys and gals are the best.  To the victims and people of Boston, my thoughts are with you.  I wish you all a speedy recovery and my deepest condolences for your losses.

The store attached to our station was a fairly large one.  Several aisles of snack food and basic consumables (TP, paper plates, canned food, etc) along with your standard issue roller grill, microwave, half-a-dozen coffee pots, and a huge cooler full of soda, milk, and beer.  Lots of beer.  This IS Oregon, after all.

That beer was a thorn in my side as a cashier.  Bored rich kids thought it would be fun to try and grab-n-go with it, or use fake IDs, or get someone else to buy it for them, and it was a constant battle against them in order to keep from getting fired or possibly arrested.  Everyone in town knew I was a stickler for the rules.  This guy, however, tried anyway.

A car drives in and parks right in front of the store.  I can see out our full glass door into the car, it has two guys in front and two girls in back.  The passenger gets out, walks in, and heads straight for the beer cooler.  Great, I'm going to have to deal with this.  He gets his cell phone out, and makes a call.  I can see the driver answer HIS phone, and it's pretty obvious that they are conversing back and forth.  So the guy in the store, let's call him Sergei, comes up to the register with a half-rack of Coors Light, a six-pack of Bridgeport, and two six-packs of Mikes Hard Lemonade.  Oh, boy.

""Sir, I'm going to need to see your ID...""

He begins reaching for his wallet.

""...and the IDs for everyone in the car.""

Oregon has a shoulder-tapping law.  This means that, if you park in front of my store with multiple people in the car, and come in to get beer, I have to see EVERYONE'S ID or else I could get fined about $5,000 and potentially charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor.  This, of course, does not sit well with Sergei.  He first insists that they are all 21.  Doesn't matter, still have to see ID.  He then insists that all the beer is for him.  Doesn't matter, still have to see ID.  Then he complains that other cashiers have done it for him (yeah, right).  Doesn't matter, still need to see ID.

Now Sergei's gone from begging/joking to angry.  He starts rambling on about how he knows the owner and the owner would do it for him.  Dude, did you not hear me the last four times?  It doesn't matter, I still need to see ID.  Plus, since the owner was the one who gave the cashiers their OLCC training *because he's certified to do so,* I highly doubt it.  Finally, Sergei DEMANDS that I call the owner at home, and get him down to the station to clear this up.

No.  Just, no.  I'm not calling the owner, a very nice man who respected his employees and treated them well, at 9pm, just to interrupt his family time, have him drive 20 minutes down to the station, just so he call tell you you're an idiot and kick you out.  I like the owner.  And before you ask, no, I'm not calling the general manager or any of the assistant managers.  I'm in charge right now, and before I sell you this I. Need. To. See. ID.

But Sergei's heels are firmly dug into the ground like a cartoon donkey.  He's gone into the ""repeat the same thing over and over again"" bit, telling me to call the owner.  Alright, I've had enough of this.  I intercomm one of the other employees to come in and cover the register, and tell Sergei I'm going to make a call.  ""FINALLY, JUST DO WHAT I ASK!"" he bellows.  Oh, my friend, that's not quite the case.

Yes, there was a phone next to the register.  But to be honest, I wanted this to be a surprise, so I went into the back room.  Instead of calling the owner, I called, you guessed it, the local constabulary.  Would you be so kind as to send over one of your fine officers to deal with a young rapscallion who's attempting to purchase intoxicating beverages with the intent to distribute them to potential minors?  You would?  Oh, marvelous, see you soon!

I come back out of the stock room and tell Sergei that someone will be here soon, just wait around for a few minutes.  He throws his hands in the air in disgust, walks outside, and lights up a cigarette.  Sadly, he was facing away from me when the police car rolled up and parked behind his car, so I couldn't see his facial expression.  More's the pity, I'm sure it was priceless.

The officer steps out, greets, Sergei, and asks the driver and two girls to step out.  He then ushers all four of them inside.  The girls look nervous, the driver looks pissed, and Sergei looks in shock.  I manage to keep a victory grin from spreading across my face.  An effort of will that was, let me tell you.

The officer then asks why he got called down here on a complaint that someone was trying to buy beer without showing ID.  Sergei counters saying he DID show me ID.  The officer then looks at me.  ""No, he never actually did.  And he never got ID for the people in the car.""  Sergei denies being in the car.  ""I saw your car park, you get out of the passenger's seat, come inside, and call the driver, sir.  You definitely came in the car.""  Sergei then gets angry, calls me a liar, and was probably thinking of trying to come over the counter at me when the officer calls it all to a halt.  ""How about this, ladies and gentlemen.  Let me see everyone's ID.""

They all very reluctantly pull out IDs.  Sergei is 24.  The driver is 23.  Girl #1 is 17.  Girl #2 is 16.  Uh-oh.

So the entire troupe is herded back outside, and another couple of units arrive.  The first officer asks if I can call the assistant manager that only lives a few blocks away, so that they can look at surveillance footage.  No problem, that AM is the one I'm in classes with, he'd love to help out an investigation.  I give him a quick call, and he's at the station within 2 minutes.  He and the officer go into the back room and watch the tape.  The beer is slowly getting warm on the counter.  I'm getting bored.

The officer comes back out, shakes my hand, and thanks me for calling this in.  He then goes outside, and promptly arrests both Sergei and the driver.  Neither are very happy about it, but don't put up any sort of fight, just shouting and vague threats towards me and the station.

The girls were the icing on the justice cake.  The officer made them call their parents so they could be picked up, and then made them explain exactly WHY they had been called late at night to a gas station with police officers there.  Nothing deters future criminal activity like the ""I'm very disappointed in you"" speech.  That victory grin was now next to impossible to suppress.

Finally, it's all over.  My AM wrote out a note for the GM to review the tapes in the morning, thanked me for giving him something to do that evening, and left.  The next day, I had a $100 gas card and a nice little note in my employee file.  Never heard from Sergei or his friend again.

Hopefully this one is up to standard.

I was working the closing shift at my local grocery store. It was the first night that I would be doing this without somebody training me. So far, so good. The phones had been silent for about 15 minutes and there weren't many customers coming up to the counter which made the night go slowly.

It's about 8pm and the phone rings. I answer with the typical ""how can I help you"" intro expecting a wide variety of things. Except for this. The caller responds to me, ""Hi, I'm in your store right now and need some assistance.""

""Oh, you're actually here?""

""Yes, I'm by the meat counter and I'm having a hard time finding the 12 packs of Diet Rite. Can you help me?""

""Yessir. Those will be in aisle 7 with all the other sodas. It should be located toward the middle of the aisle.""

""And what was your name again?""

""It's kudrew12.""

""Alright, kudrew12, I want you to come find me and show me exactly where they are because I can't find the fucking things.""

""Oh, okay... I'll send someone over.""

""No! I want you, kudrew12. You seem to know where they are and nobody else can find them. I've got a big beard and a hunting vest on. I should be easy to find.""

*CLICK*

I called my manager over and told them what was up. They told me to stay behind the counter because I was the only person working Customer Service that night and that they would go find the customer instead. My manager told me beforehand that we might be out of Diet Rite and they would be able to check the inventory easier than I would.

A few minutes later, the customer comes up to the customer service counter with my manager following behind. The customer starts with, ""I want to file a complaint.""

""Okay. What is it about?"" I'm beginning to reach for the complaint forms when he responds.

""Nobody in this store listens to directions. I specifically asked for you because I thought you were smart enough to know where a 12 pack of Diet Rite would be and could help me find it. I guess I was wrong. I didn't want this other guy cause he's telling me you're out! I bought some here yesterday! There's no way those are out of stock!""

""Well, sir, it is on sale and I can write a rain check for you. Those won't expire and we should have some Diet Rite in stock again tomorrow morning when the vendors come in."" My manager nods and confirms that we can do this for the customer.

""I don't have time for a fucking rain check. I came in here for Diet Rite and I'm not happy with the way you all run your store. Are you (pointing at me) so privileged that you can't come out from behind the fucking counter?""

My manager replies, ""At the moment, yes. He's the only one here tonight and I needed him to stay and answer the phone for crazy people like you. He's not here to cater to your command over a phone call, *within the store*. Just come back tomorrow for your Diet Rite or take your commands to (*insert competitor here*).""

The customer tried to say something in return, but decided to stop and walk out. On the way out, he shouted at some other customer while pointing in our direction, ""THESE PEOPLE DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT WHAT I WANT!""

This actually happened last night. As you can tell by my title, I'm not in America. I work at a Canadian Hardware Store. We do accept Amex though, as many people out here have it. Here in Canada - we use Chip/Pin for most cards now.

These two customers come to my till with a flatbed cart that has patio sets and accessories on it. I scan through their items and I give then their total. 

The man tells me Amex so I tell him to insert the chip or swipe. 

Man: ""Oh sweetie (I hate being called sweetie, it's patronizing and stupid), we're from the USA. We don't use chip cards there.

I'm thinking: Oh well that's great, you can just swipe your card and go on your way.

Me: ""Alright then swipe your card, stripe towards the inside.""

So he swipes his card and it's declined. I notify him and he loses his shit. 

Man: ""TRY IT AGAIN. I HAVE MONEY ON THE CARD.""

Okay, if you say so. We try again and it's declined. His wife then decides that her card should work. So we try that too. Nope. Declined.

Man: ""CAN'T YOU KEY IN MY CARD?! WHY WON'T YOU ACCEPT MY AMEX?""

Me: ""Unfortunately I cannot key cards, only customer service can.""

Man: ""I'M NOT WAITING IN THAT LINE UP THERE.""

Me: ""Ookay.. Do you have another card to try?""

Man: ""NO. I HAVE THIS ONE. YOU BETTER CALL SOMEONE TO FIX IT.""

So I call my manager, tell him the customers are upset because their US cards aren't working. As I'm explaining this to my manager, the man gets a call from Amex. We all hang up and my manager comes up. 

Man: *to manager* ""Your cashier is declining my card, but I just got a call from Amex because I'm travelling. It better work now."" *to me* ""What are you waiting for?! Set up the machine!""

Wife: ""I told you we should have called!""

A side note is that 90% of all my coworkers at the time were female.

One night during the summer about 15 minutes before we locked up we had 3 men come in (they were probably in their mid to late 30’s) and ordered ice cream. By the time we had finish serving them it was time for me to lock the door so I was surprised when they noticed that and decided to take their dessert outside to our patio (at this time I was thinking we had some great guys on our hands).

I asked one of my employees to go outside and wipe the windows down, clean the tables and chairs that weren’t in use, and take care of the outdoor garbage can. Now this was a downtown area strip mall that had regular police patrols and plenty of foot traffic from the movie theatre, restaurants, and coffee houses so we didn’t ever really have issues with people doing weird shit. Today was not one of those days.

I was counting my drawers and safe when two of my coworkers come into the back and one appears to be comforting the other one who once I noticed was clearly upset. I asked what was wrong and I was informed that the clients who had so kindly gone outside to eat decided the best thing to do in a situation where a 16 year old girl was cleaning around them was talk to her about how pretty she was, and how much they would enjoy doing various sexual acts with her. The amount of detail they used was nauseating. 

Let me pause right here and say that I was raised in a household where I was the youngest of 3. My two older siblings are both female and as such I have been raised to expect certain things from myself as well as my male counterparts when interacting with women. Like how women are actually people.

Anyways… I was pretty pissed so I told her I would handle it. She asked me not to, that it was all just fun and games, that they the men had just been joking around. I told her that they needed to at least be informed that they shouldn’t joke around like that with someone who obviously is uncomfortable with it.

So I give a phone to one of the other people on shift and tell them that if anything happens to call 911. I go outside and turn to these guys and tried my best to tear them a new one.

Me: So I hear you like sexually harassing 16 year old girls.
Guy 1: What are you talking about?
Guy 2: Dude chill out we were just joking around with her.
Me: Are you fucking kidding me? You were just telling her how much you would enjoy gang banging her.
Guy 2: It was a fucking joke you fucking pussy.
Me: It wasn’t a joke to her obviously. If anything you guys are kind of the joke in this situation. How old are you 35? You enjoy trolling around downtown inviting underage girls to have sex with you?
Guy 3: We aren’t fucking pedophiles you ass hole.
Me: Well technically no, you would be ephebophiles.
Guy 1: What the fuck did you just call me.
Me: Glad to see your education paid off. You need to leave.
Guy 2: We aren’t leaving we paid for this ice cream and you can’t police the sidewalk in front of your store.
Me: I can and I will. If you aren’t gone in the next 5 minutes the police will be here. If you come back and I or anyone here sees you we will call the police. Now leave.

I walked back inside. Locked the door. They proceeded to wait till pretty much 4 minutes and 45 seconds (when I went and grabbed the phone) to leave.

When this story took place, I had worked there for five years and was a supervisor, and was the female member of management. Our office is directly behind the sales counter.


It was the hottest part of the summer, and we were in full swing. During my shift we were having a management meeting with all 5 supervisors, senior supervisor, assistant manager, regional director, and the district manager. Since it was my shift, I had been keeping a partial ear open in case there were any emergencies. 

There is a tone, that when you've worked sales for a while, will recognize immediately, it signals warning. It is before the yelling starts, but has the same terseness that a girl will use when their guy is in hot water. I heard this tone coming through the wall, but since a lead (lowest management level) was there I didn't go rushing out. Almost immediately an employee pops their head in the door and says, ""fireball03, we need you out here, NOW"" 

It was the look on their face that made me race to the counter. When I got there I saw her. She was obese, wearing a minuscule bikini top and cut off jean shorts with the top button undone. She had spent most of the day in the sun and her body was so sunburned that there were spots that were turning purple. With her were 3 young girls between 5-9 equally as large all holding their own funnel cake and souvenir cups. They were doing what all kids do when they are hot and tired, whining. The lady, you could tell, had an awful day.

I went up with my friendliest smile to try and figure out the situation. Whenever I have an angry guest I introduce myself and inform them of my position so that they know I am in a position to help. Having seen her situation I was ready to fix anything I could to hopefully make her day a little better. Instead AG (angry guest) said this.

Me: Hi, im firball03, im a supervisor here, let's figure out what's going on ( i hadn't been told the issue at this point)

AG: You work here?

Me: Yes I do

AG: You can't help me, I want a man to help me. What about him? ( pointing to the lead)

Me: Well I am his boss, so I would be able to better fix the issue (at this point the leads face was one of terror, he had only been promoted the week before and hadn't had to deal with an angry guest)

AG: No, he will help me!

I turned to the lead and gave him an encouraging nod and took a step back. After a little back and forth it turns out that she didn't like the product. She had already seen the product before she bought it. Since these are personalized we can't do returns without supervisor authorization.

Lead: (to me) am I allowed to do that?

AG: Why are you asking her, you're a man

Lead: She's my boss and I can't do returns

At this time the management meeting was over and they were all coming out. The walls are paper thin so they heard everything.

AG:(to the group) Can one of you help me?

DM: Sorry fireball03 is in charge you'll have to ask her

Me: I'm sorry, unfortunately we cannot return these products and all sales are final, I am so sorry I wasn't able to help you, have a wonderful day! (Still with my super friendly smile and a slightly apologetic look on my face)

Had she not decided that a man would be able to help her better, she would have walked away with at least a partial refund and a fixed product. My bosses were cracking up. And the great thing was that there was nothing I did that I could have gotten in trouble for.

I used to work a tech support desk at a big electronics retailer. Part of our job there was to handle service plan claims, which involved testing the item, and then shipping it to the service center. We would always warn people that if the item came back with a no fault found diagnosis, the customer then had to pay $25 to get the item back. We even had said customers sign a disclaimer to this effect. Still, every time an item came back NFF, we would get a large argument. This is why we insisted on testing EVERY SINGLE ITEM thoroughly before sending it out, that way we could verify that yes, indeed there was a problem. Most of the time, however, when we couldn't verify the problem, the customer would still insist that we send it out.

On top of the normal daily arguments we would get, this one particular instance sticks out in my mind, mainly because i walked away with a injury and ended up sending a guy to prison for it. This particular customer, i will call him Bob from here on out, had dropped off his DVD/VCR combo about a week before, claiming that it did not work. At the counter it was tested, but the Bob wouldn't even describe a problem, just saying that it didn't work over and over. We plugged it in, played both disks and VHS tapes, and even recorded to VHS for him, just to prove that it did, in fact, work. With no additional details given, though, he still insisted that it didn't work and that we needed to send it out. So we did, in fact, send it out for him, sighting the issue as ""client states unit does not function. Could not verify issue at store."" and we made him sign a disclaimer saying exactly that, and spent the better part of 20 minutes explaining to him that if/when the item comes back NFF, he would have to pay the fee to pick it up. Of course, Bob agreed verbally and in writing, so i though that we were at least relatively safe.

Fast forward one week. The DVD/VCR had been received that morning, and Bob had been called to come pick it up and reminded that he would, in fact, need to pay the $25 to pick the item up, as they could not find a single problem with the device in question. This night it was myself and one other associate (we shall call him Dave), who happened to be working the counter when Bob walked in. Dave greeted Bob fairly nicely and took his receipt and went and found the device. He then informed Bob, yet again, that the item came back with NFF and is, in fact, working exactly as it is supposed to. He even offered to test it again for Bob to show him. He then reminded Bob about the $25 NFF fee that had to be paid for us to release the item. Of course, Bob was appalled. ""What $25???? I'm not paying that shit! You fixed it, and now you want to claim that it was never broke just to get my money!"" Dave went back and forth with him for a few minutes, and then walked away from the counter to call a manager. Unfortunately, he left the DVD/VCR sitting on the counter, well with in the customers reach.

I spotted this, and i also spotted Bob reach out, put his hands on the unit, and peer in to see if we were watching. I quickly reacted, walked over and put my hands on the item, hoping i had caught it before Bob had fully formed the idea to run. I greeted Bob nicely, and then tried to diffuse the situation, explaining the $25 again, and also reminding him that i was the one that tested the item for him originally, and it clearly worked here at the counter. Unfortunately, he was not going to back down on this issue. Bob starts to yell that he wants his unit, and that i cant keep it from him. He yells that i cant keep his product from him. He also yells lots of obscenities at me. While this was going on, i move to pick up the unit and move it off the front counter, out of Bob's reach. Unfortunately for me, i was a little too slow. Bob's ninja like hands dart out and grab hold of the other end of the device, attempting to pull it from my grip. I refuse to let go, telling him that as of this moment, that device is the property of The store, and that i cant release it to him. He yells to give it to him, and i tell him again that i would be happy to if he would simply pay the $25 fee. Bob did not like this, and decided that i was serious about not letting go, so his hands quickly let go of the unit.

Unfortunately, after letting go, Bob was left with a boiling anger, and a lack of something to do with his hands. So of course he did the only logical thing with them that he could think of and reached out for my neck. Here i am, being strangled over a counter by a 6 foot tall 50 something man, and all i could do was yell out. Luckily the guy working at the LP desk was close enough to run over and tackle old Bob to the ground.

You can guess the next few bits, what with the management, the cops, the reports, court, etc. The best part was before the police would take him out of the store, they dragged him over to the counter and made him pay the $25! Turns out that Bob was out on parole for assault, and obviously had just violated. Just another fun time at the service desk!

TL;DR: Don't leave things alone on a counter where a customer can grab it if there is a dispute!

I was wearing tan cargo pants and a red England futbol jersey. Someone asked me were something was, I just answer ""idk maybe over there?"". They got pissy and went were I pointed, came back angry because it took them 5-10 minutes to find it, let alone to find out their out of stock on shelf.

 She came up to me telling me they're out. I'm just said alright and your telling me why? She gets pissed saying ""I'm telling the manager"" and left as I responded ""that's nice?"".

She ended up dragging a manager over (I really do mean almost dragging, she was pulling on his sleeve) and pointed at me saying i was a rude, belligerent and useless employee. I just responded ""wtf are you talking about? I don't even work here"". 

She gets angrier claiming I'm lying. Cue me going off, while the manager takes a step back and cracking up where the hatchet faced hag couldn't see him as she had anger induced tunnel vision centered on me. 

I figured the Jersey saying England on it, having the coat of arms, the gold star, and umbro markings would have given that away. Things ended with her being escorted out, the manager calming me down and giving me a $10 gift card while laughing incessantly. Overall it ended being an alright day.

We get lots of tourist traffic in addition to our regulars. Today a woman comes up to my register who is clearly from out of town - very white, very Southern, looks kind of like Honey Boo Boo's mom. She hands me a shoebox and says ""These are scuffed, so I talked to the manager and they said y'all could take 25% off."" 

I'm immediately suspicious, because 10% is the most we'll ever give for a damage discount (if it's worth taking any more off, we'll just write it off as a damage and won't sell it). I look at the shoes and there's a tiny bit of wear on the bottom. Otherwise the ""scuffs"" are nonexistent. I say, ""Well, let me just call my manager over so that he can double-check it, okay? It'll just take a second.""

She starts to get huffy and goes, ""I already talked to your manager! They said it was *fine*! Y'all are trying to cheat me out of my money!"" I make up some BS about how I can't authorize the discount myself, the manager has to do it, and she seems to calm down for a second, until the MOD arrives. Now, the MOD today happened to be a guy we'll call Carlos, who could best be described as Stefon from SNL with a thick Queens accent. He's one of my favorite managers and everyone loves him, myself included, but he's the type of gay man I think half the country believes only exists in chick flicks and Ryan Murphy shows. Anyway, he shows up and asks what's going on, and I ask if he authorized a discount for the shoes. He says no, and looks at the nonexistent scuff marks before diplomatically asking the woman what the manager she supposedly talked to looks like. ""A white lady, brown hair,"" says the customer, and Carlos and I exchange a look. That describes exactly *one* of our managers, who has been out for the past week with the superflu. Finally, Carlos says that he can't give a discount for merchandise that isn't visibly damaged, and the lady loses her shit, yelling ""I DON'T CARE! Y'ALL ARE TRYING TO CHEAT ME! I WANT TO SEE THE MANAGER I TALKED TO, NOT THIS FAGGOT!""

And the chill that swept the cash wrap could have frozen the entire northeast.

Carlos, very quietly, told her to leave the store, and she threw the box on the floor and went on her way, ranting under her breath about how we need Jesus. And it was fucking glorious.

I’ve watched this woman shove a duvet into her baby’s backpack, she has no shame. Because everyone working was involved, we’ll say Larry and Moe were the cashiers, Curly was the manager, Abbott (who is that cliché effeminate gay guy) and I were working on displays, and Costello was stock. On to the story!

The second Sticky Hands walked into the store, she shouted at Abbott and I, “Ay! One uh you gonna help me or what!?” I recognized her immediately. I walked over to her as she destroyed a bed display. She asked how much a duvet was, then the quilt, then the sheets, every sham, and threw each item into a pile in the middle of the bed as she “inquired” about it. After the bed was completely stripped, she asked where the sale bedding was, and I told her the back of the store. I was waiting until she was out of ear shot to warn the guys in the back, but Larry recognized her also, and was quicker on the walkie talkie.

Larry: Hey Moe and Curly, there’s a woman in a blue jumpsuit with a hat on and her belly hanging all out (yes, really) walking back toward you guys. She has her husband and kid with her, but you watch her like a hawk. She’s a thief.

Larry was actually supposed to be off the clock at that time, so she clocked out, then went to the back of the store to watch Sticky Hands. At first Moe and Curly just did the normal overly-helpful thing one does with shoplifters, but after about thirty minutes, Curly was getting annoyed. Moe had been doing a good job of not getting distracted. She was using the walkie to call for everything from stock to price checks, and never took her eyes off the woman. Curly came over the walkies and said, “This is ridiculous! She obviously isn’t buying anything, and she’s wasting all of our time!”

Oh Curly, you just don’t understand yet.

Me: Curly, it’s not what she’s going to buy, it’s what she’s not going to pay for, then return. She’s done at least $1300 worth of fraudulent returns that I know of. Do not leave that section. In fact, if everyone can be in that section, all the better.

Apparently Larry told him the same thing.

Abbott and Curly then decided the only displays that needed to be worked on were those in bedding, and Costello went over to “help Moe more quickly.” Basically (if anyone has seen a shoplifter, you will know exactly what I’m talking about), Sticky was asking bullshit questions about the bedding, and saying things like, “Go check in the back for this. Go in the back and check the price.” etc etc. Once all four were in the back, anything she asked, they all answered with different answers.

Sticky: Does this come in a queen?

Moe: Full/Queen.

Costello: No.

Abbott: I’m a queen! (Also, yes, really.)

Curly: They’re right behind you.

Every now and then Moe would call over the headset, “Hey, JacOfAllTrades, can you price check [item].” I told her $500 no matter what she asked. She made up random numbers.

This went on for about thirty minutes before Sticky finally admitted defeat and bought a sale duvet. This should be the end of the story, but it’s not.

Sticky and the rest of the Hands family went out the “back” door, and as they were walking back toward the front door in the mall hallway, I could hear her telling him off for not distracting us enough. He was useless, and they couldn’t get anything because he was so worthless. She then walked in the front door and directly up to my counter. She wanted to do a return. -.- Fine.

As I’m returning her item, I took the bag and threw it in the trash, and she immediately yells at me, “No! I want to keep the bag!”

Me: Sorry, ma’am, I can’t allow you to have a bag if you don’t have paid merchandise.

Sticky: That’s racist!

Me: No, ma’am, it would be racist for me to let you do it and nobody else.

Sticky: That’s bullshit! What if I need that bag!?

Me: For what?

Sticky: Other stores!

Me: I’m pretty sure other stores also have bags.

Sticky: This is the dumbest bullshit I’ve ever heard! Give me that bag back now! You're telling me the most bullshit!

Me: More bullshit than returning something less than five minutes after buying it?

Sticky: What the hell are you trying to say!?

Me: You know exactly what I’m saying.

Sticky: This is bullshit! You racist! I’m never coming back!

I finished processing her return as she thought of a hundred and one ways to tell me she was never coming back, because clearly a lack of retort meant I couldn’t hear her. By the time I handed her the return receipt, everyone but Moe had migrated to the front of the store and was watching this. Curly whispered over the walkie, “Say anything you want to her, we’ll all back you up.” Oh god. Don’t give me that kind of permission!

Sticky put the receipt in her pocket, and once again yelled at me, “I’m never coming back!”

Me: Okay, well then I have to ask, what do you do with the merch cards?

Sticky: What?

Me: I would think there would be an end point unless you could get cash for them. But if you get cash for them, I would think you could buy clothes that fit.

Sticky: What’s that supposed to mean!?

Abbott: *singing* You need to cover your belly! It’s disgusting!

Sticky: I want a manager!

Curly: I’m right here. *big smile*

Jess didn't want any of the servers to have to put up with this guy and went to cash him out herself. He pulled a 100 dollar bill from his wallet, despite having lower denominations in which to pay for his meal. Jess, per policy, held the bill up to the light.

I work at this fairly well known amusement park a couple miles from my hometown. I'm a ride operator so part of my job is to put the wristbands on the kids after we've checked their height. This normally takes the hassle out of getting your child's height checked at every ride that they go to. It's a great idea for those who don't want to wait in line for two hours and find out their kid is too short to ride. One of the rides I work at requires you to be 54 inches to ride - no less. 

So this white woman and her two small girls come walking up to my stand to get wristbands. The two girls both have HIGH HEELS on because they know that they are not going to be tall enough for the rides they want to get on so they're trying to cheat the system. I measure one of the girls with her heels on because she fell into the 48 inch range with or without the heels on. The other girl was about 50 inches without her heels on but was 54 with them on. So I tell her to take her shoes off so that I can't measure her without them. 

Me: ""Alright, darling, do you mind taking your shoes off so that I can measure you?""

The mother looks at her daughter and then looks at me. The daughter looks like she's about to cry because she knows that she's not going to be tall enough without them. 

Mother: ""Yeah, I think you're being really racist right now.""

I am shocked because I have never been called racist before and I'm thinking what kind of sheltered life do you live that anything a black person does to you that doesn't seem fair is racist. She says she wants to speak to my manager and I say I can call him for you and she just storms off to talk to the manager from the places that takes photos of people in the park. He literally has nothing to do with this situation but tells me to give her the 54 inch wrist band anyway. He kept looking at me the entire time like I was the one in the wrong and agreeing with all her BS about how I was being racist. I think he may have been trying to get her to leave but even so - I still don't see how I did anything wrong. 

These wristbands are for your kids safety. Not because we want to be mean. My ride has a strict 54 inch requirement because the harness around you has to be able to lock around your body. It does not have a floor to it so it makes the requirement necessary. I just can't believe the people that get upset over this kind of thing.

People in my area are just plain moody and nasty. You get your usual happy go lucky type, but they are rare. It's gotten to the point where I didn't even try to make small talk anymore.

Okay, most people handed their items to another cashier to hold them for an extra day. A few decided to look around, but bitchy bride to be and her posse of bridesmaids looked at us like "" are you fucking kidding me?""  I tell her the two options and she responds with "" Its always something with this store"" and I just tell her that I was sorry for the inconvience, but its a fucking storm. 

She then procides to tell me I better fix this and ring her up because she needs the makeup for the next day.  Um wtf am I supposed to do?  I just glare at her for a bit and tell her she's welcome to stand and wait.

Here's the great part, the storm wasn't letting up and I had 10 mins left. My mom decided to pick me up and came in the store to let me know she was there. I walked in the back to punch out and get my coat and when I walked back out my mom was talking to bitchy bride and bitchy bride saw me and started saying stuff she really shouldn't have.

I work in the auto parts portion of a large Canadian department store, which also has a auto service department. We will often get people who will buy a headlight or a replacement belt, then ask me to install it for me. I am an 18 year old guy, so I am used to older people disregarding what I say and trying to gently bully me into doing things for them with the thret that they will call my boss. My boss is a cool guy and doesn't put up with their bullshit.

Anyways, I always politely tell them that I am not a mechanic, and that if they want something installed, they should shuffle a few feet around the corner and talk to the service desk who will be more than happy to schedule them in. Most people understand that I can't go work on their car on their due to liability issues, but some people just don't get it and will storm off in a huff complaining about poor customer service.

Sometimes they go to install it themselves, and we do have a few screwdrivers that we will lend for this exact thing. Unfortunately for customers, some cars now use Torx screws instead of Philips or Robertson heads. 

**EVENT**

The other day we had an older lady (probably around 63-70) who, after trying to get me to install it for her, borrow a screwdriver and went at it herself. She comes storming back in saying that I need to get her the screwdriver ""with the funny star point.""

*Me:* I'm sorry ma'am, we don't have any Torx screwdrivers to lend. We have them for sale is Aisle 39 for $1.99 a piece.

*Her:* Well what the hell do you people do when someone come into the shop to get a bulb changed?!

*Me:* The mechanics use their own tools

*Her:* Well go get me one of them to install it!

*Me:* I cannot do that ma'am. Those are their own tools which they have purchased with their own money and with which they make their livelyhood. All of our mechanics have a strict no-lending policy. Also, they are not independant mechanics. If they are working for us, they cannot do work for free.

*Her:* You don't know that! Go ask them! I'm sure they would all love to help a lovely little old lady like me!

Up until that point, she was just an annoying customer like hundreds before her. Now she was an entitled bitch who though she could make people do things for her. I politely tell her I will go ask one of the mechanics. I quickly run through the situation, and one of the mechanics gleefully volunteers to ""help"" this lady. He comes up to desk and says:

*Mechanic*: You were looking to get a bulb installed ma'am? If you make an appointment with service I can get right on your work order?

*Her:* Well I was hoping a kind young man (the mechanic is 50+ and looks it) would love to help a little old lady in a bind.

How about I get you fired instead?,DeathByCarousel,705,110,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1k085j/you_want_to_get_me_fired_how_about_i_get_you/,"I did three years of retail. I am glad I am out of it. This is a little long and I am a little drunk, so sorry about this.

My story begins when I started working for that telecomm company. 

I was hired as an operations specialist, pretty much meaning that I handled the back office paperwork from the sales team, was in charge of the sales quota, among other things. Besides me, there were about 6-8 sales people and a manager, all hired under a contractor, meaning we were not directly hired by Big Telecomm. 

The story deals with the manager, who I will address to as Bill. Bill was a man that was full of tall tales, had a real bad temper and had horrible work ethics. The only part of his job that I remember was setting the schedule, arriving late and leaving early on most of his shifts, taking conference calls in which he'd be so angry about ""our numbers"" that he'd slam his fist on the desk or throw his pens around, and announcing that there were customers in the store. I'm serious, he went from ""Customer, customer"", to ""Consumer, consumer"", to ""Guest, guest"", whenever someone was in the store.

Fucking sad, really.

One of the things about my job that I hated was dealing with money. We never dealt with money, unless a client wanted to buy a modem or router from us, and usually that would be on card, not cash. In the extremely rare event that we took cash, I'd just fill out a form, put the cash in an envelope and hand it to the armored truck guy.

Here's where things went downhill. Bill got hired as an employee of Big Telecomm, meaning that he was a manager of the store but not in charge of us. This is good and bad. 

At one point, the powers that be decided that they will be running a promotion in which they'll be handing out free remotes for any customers that received an invitation. This could be a very simple transaction: Customer has a free remote voucher, they get a free remote and go home.

Bill somehow made a rule that every remote that was sent out should cost a penny because ""by law we shouldn't be giving stuff out for free"". So the sales people were literally charging a penny for a free remote, and if the customer didn't have it? No problem! We could throw in our own.

This became a problem because we started to pile up on pennies, and giving the armored guy that took the deposits a shitload of pennies in an envelope just didn't cut it. So Bill decided that we should just leave the pennies in the deposit box that was sitting next to our desks, no big deal, just a bunch of pennies in a box and no one would notice.

After a year and a half and a bunch of accumulated PTO, I was told that I need to take time off or I would lose all the PTO, so I took a week off. I was enjoying my time off at home, when one of my coworkers who was also one of my best friends called me and told me, ""Bill is trying to get you fired"".

I asked her why, and she told me that the district manager of our store stopped by to do a random inspection, and saw that there were a shitload of pennies on the safe that were not deposited. Even though I handled the deposits to the armored man, Bill's responsibility was to make sure that all deposits were sent in, and he was the one that told me that the pennies should not be deposited and just left in the safe considering how many there were.

I was not there to defend myself, so Bill threw the whole ""pennies"" idea on me along with the fact that they were not deposited. Along with that, I had been given the task of handling set top box returns, and our closet was full to the brim because we were not getting enough boxes in to send them out, and Bill's job was to order those boxes, which he virtually never did.

When I return back to work, everything was going fine. I was setting up the quota for the month, checking for work order errors, just doing my thing. The managers for the contractors, Mike, comes in and makes small talk with me and out of nowhere, he throws ""So DeathByCarousel, I really need another rep at our kiosk in this location, I really think you should take the position...""

Now mind you, I'm the ops guy. I do sales every now and then but only when it's so busy that the sales people need help. So I tell Mike to go out and have a smoke with me and talk about this.

We go out, light up, and he tells me that Bill is trying to get me fired, that he spoke to his bosses about getting me fired, but since I was a contractor, he couldn't fire me directly. Technically, Mike was there to fire me, but he told me that Bill was using me as a scapegoat for his incompetence and he was giving me the only two choices I had, which was to transfer to another place and work as a salesman. Or be fired.

Again, I had no choice. I thanked Mike for his kindness and told him I'd rather keep a job than not have a job at all so I'd transfer within a couple days. Mind you, I didn't tell anyone that I was transferring except for that coworker that I considered one of my best friends.

Bill comes up right next to me and asks ""Are the rumors true? That you're transferring?"". I was so pissed off, because I didn't say anything to anyone and apparently ""rumors"" were flying out already. I confirmed his ""rumors"" and he said he would miss me along with everyone else, that they would all miss me.

So I leave.

Now for the good part.

____________________________________________________

Not two weeks after I am doing my thing at the new place, selling like a madman and killing my quota, Mike stops by and asks me to come out for a smoke.

He tells me that there are four or five employees, along with himself that are trying to get Bill out of the other store. He asks me if I would be willing to have an interview with the Big Red higher ups about Bill's incompetence.

Of course I agree.

The day comes and I'm sitting in front of Bill's bosses. I tell them about Bill's anger issues when it comes to conference calls or when the numbers are just a little too low. I tell them about how Bill made a comment about how he got a gun and he could easily kill everyone in our team without emptying the chamber. I tell them about how when one of the sales reps fell asleep on the back after closing time, Bill was proud enough to bring said gun into the store because ""he was concerned to what he would do"". I told them about Bill's early leave, and late arrival, use of profanity with all the reps, inappropriate comments, and how I was used as the scapegoat for the clusterfuck with the safe and the returns. So many things that I don't even remember it all.

They thanked me for my time, apologized for the inconvenience and sent me my way.

Two days later, I heard that Bill came walking into the store, late as usual, yelling on his phone, and as soon as he walked in, he was pulled into the office to resign his badge and that he was done, and not to come back since he was banned from the store.

Serves you right, Bill.

Thanks for reading.

**Edit: Edited some typos.**

**Little epilogue:**

I had quit working at the new store about a year and a half after joining in due to lack of foot traffic, which meant decreased sales to the point in which we were on the red. Instead of getting reprimanded, I gave my two weeks and went to work at a call center for a competitor.

I get hired, go through orientation, and they introduce us to the team.

""Hello team, this is DeathByCarousel, who's joining us from Big Telecomm ""

""Hey DeathByCarousel, you're the second person that we have from Big Telecomm! Do you happen to know a man named Bill?""

My heart froze.

Bill worked there now. I don't know if he was aware that I was a big part of the reason why he got let go. Thankfully, Bill was on vacation when I arrived, and thankfully, he never came back. I did check the employee directory just to check that it was that Bill, and there he was.

I worked at a very popular plus sized women's clothing store for a few years as a supervisor.  It was a great job, I had great co-workers and usually great customers, but as the territory comes with specialty retail, you definitely rack up on stories.
I was opening one morning with an associate, it was a quiet day early in the week, so foot traffic was fairly slow.  I got a phone call a few minutes after we opened, and it was a man on the other line.

Me: ""STORENAME, this is Cassiethesassy, how can I help you?""

Man on Phone: ""Oh, hi, yes, um, I have a question...""

Me:  ""Sure, what can I do for you?""

MOP: ""Um, well, I was wondering if I could come in and purchase a, um, dress... for... myself.  I was wondering if, um, I could try them on.""
*Our store had no set policy on letting men shop in the store for themselves, but we always welcomed any customer, because hey, their money is just as green as anyone elses!*
Me: ""Of course, my best advice is to come by this morning or tomorrow morning while we don't have many customers in the store.  If there IS another woman using the fitting rooms we will have to ask you to wait until she's finished, but otherwise it's not a problem.""
*We had a back room where our fitting rooms were, with 5 smaller ones and a larger handicapped room towards the end of the hall*

I told him my name, and that to ask for me if he'd like to come into the store and shop.  He thanked me and our conversation was over.
I didn't think anything of it, as we get phone calls from men who cross dress, but very few acutally come IN to the store to try things on.  They usually ordered online, or bought some items and returned the ones that didn't work.  Because we were a plus sized store, our clothes were obviously bigger and longer which would fit more men, than having them shop in a clothing store that had smaller sizes.  I continued to organize various things as we were very slow in the mornings.
About 30 minutes later an older gentleman with bright white hair, in a large windbreaker and khakis comes strolling in.  I greet him as I usually would any customer, and he quietly aproached me.

MOP: ""Are you... Cassiethesassy?""

Me: ""Yes, I am!  Did you call earlier?""

MOP:  ""Yes, I did... I was hoping you'd help me pick out a dress.  I like to wear them around the house.""

Me:  ""Not a problem, was there something certain you had in mind?""

We continued to talk about what he was looking for.  He was on a budget, and our full priced merchandise was a bit more pricey than a discount retailer, averaging about $70-100 for a new dress.  So, I escorted him to our clearance section and decided he would fit best in a 1X size.  He picked out a few that he liked and asked if he could try them on.  I obliged as we had no other customers in the store.  I unlocked the farthest fitting room (just in case we did get another customer), and as I let him in with the items he said: ""Will you stick around and give me your opinion?""

Me: ""Sure, just let me know when you're ready.""

I let him get settled and when I heard my name I knew he had the first dress on.  
He had picked some rather, LOUD patterns (as many plus sized clothing makers insist on making), but as he tried them on I gave him my honest opinion.  Between dresses he would drop down to his undergarments in front of me.  When I say *undergarments* I mean he had a red, stuffed bra on and matching red panties.  Everything was covered, but needless to say, I learned a pretty good poker face that day!
He tried on about 4 different dresses and decided on a green, satiny number with a black swirly pattern across it.  As he was changing back into his clothes, he looks at me, hands me a $10 bill and says: **""Wow, I wish I had a girlfriend as nice as you.""**

Needless to say, it was a very sweet compliment, but a bit out of the usual for myself.
He paid for the dress, thanked me again and went about his way.  Amazing what a little understanding and kindness can do for someone's day, plus, hey!  $10!!

**TL;DR: Cross dressing man tipped me $10 for helping him try on dresses during my shift at a woman's plus sized clothing store.**

I used to work graveyard at a convenience store. In Portland, Oregon where beer hour was 2:30 am. This incident happened around 3:15 am. I was 24 when the incident occurred.

At that time of the night I would empty and clean the coffee pots in back because the service industry workers would have come and gone, the workout warriors wouldn't start trickling in for another half hour and the cabbies wouldn't start filtering in until four. Few people came around then so I left the door open, the back was next to the front door I could easily pop out when I heard the bell. 

On this particular night I was engaged in some heavy scrubbing of one pot in particular which had a great deal of grim in it's nether regions. The bell rings and I yell 'Just a sec!' set the brush down and take a moment to dry off and such. I figured it was just someone looking to buy smokes or a street walker looking for condoms or ho-hos (yeah, they do actually buy those).

Directly across from the door to the back, all the way on the far wall, is the wine rack. I exit the back and see some kid, no more than 16, shoving bottles of wine down his pants whose cuffs are tucked into his socks. Just shoving them down there one after another. Outside his two friends are in what I assume is a parent's car laughing their asses off. None of them has seen me. I just stand and watch this kid fill his pants up.

The kid gets all he can carry, turns to the window that looks into the parking lot and he raises his hands in triumph. I see his two buddies in the car do the same. Smiles all around. Good teenage tomfoolery accomplished.

As he turns to go he sees me. He smiles some and calmly asks “Oh, hey. Can I get a pack of Camel Lights?” Shit eating grin and all. 

Then he starts walking to the counter. 

&lt;Clank&gt; &lt;Clink&gt; &lt;Clank&gt; &lt;Clink&gt; &lt;Clank&gt; &lt;Clink&gt; &lt;Clank&gt; &lt;Clink&gt; &lt;Clank&gt; &lt;Clink&gt;

“Put the wine on the counter.” I say.

“I don't have any wine.” his confidence is starting to erode. 

I walk to the front door and lock it. Reach around the lipstick display and lottery machine and grab the phone.

Kid starts to freak out. “Ohm mmgawd nuw! Here!” He starts fishing out all of the wine from his pants. I look out the window and see his friends freaking out in the car.

All the wine is on the counter. Kid shakes his pants to show me he's clean.

“You got anything else of ours in your pants?” I ask.

“No sir.” he looks down sheepishly.

His friends outside are talking amongst themselves hurriedly. I assume they are debating whether or not to abandon their friend. I should have called the cops- we had a number of patrol officers personal numbers for these sorts of situations, no need to bug 911 and better response time- but for some reason I was feeling lenient.

“Get out of here and don't come back.” I unlocked the door.

Kid took two steps and stopped. “Uh, well...could I still get those Camel Lights?”

I didn't sell him the smokes and I did report the license plate number as being driven by a possible underage intoxicant. ",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1i9rzm,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1i9rzm/definitely_wasnt_legal_for_the_wine_probably_not/,

Although I wasn’t a cashier, often times I would fill in when the cashier would go on lunch or for smoke breaks. The part of Brooklyn I worked in was colorful to say the least and I had to deal with my fair share of crazies, but one man in particular stands out to me.  I shall refer to him as “CD”, short for crazy dude.

So CD comes up to the register and asks for a pack of cigarettes, which I get out and then proceed to ask him if he will be paying with cash or credit. “Credit”, CD says. Ok cool, easy enough, right? Oh no! CD hands me one of those plastic credit cards you get in the mail with promotions from the bank that say “Your name here” and have a numbers like “1234567890” and are just obviously not really a credit card.  I look down at the card and know this is going to be a rough time. 

“Sir” I said, I cant accept this as payment.
“Why”? CD asked defensively
“Because this is not a real credit, it’s a card you get in a mailing asking you to sign up for a credit card, it doesn’t even have a magnetic strip for the machine to read”
“No, it’s real” CD says in an annoyed tone. “Just swipe it”

So I swipe this damn card, obviously to no avail. CD is getting increasingly agitated that the machine is not taking his “credit card”. 

“I’m sorry sir, this card doesn’t work, it’s not a real card” I say again. I even try to reason with him and explain why his card cannot be used for payment and that  maybe he got confused and took the wrong on out of his wallet. I ask if he has cash or a different card on him, he doesn’t.

“Run the numbers” he demands. I oblige, obviously this is never going to work. I call over my manager who sees the absolute stupidity of the situation and also tries to explain to him why we can’t take his “card”, this insanity continues for about fifteen minutes.

Finally, the cashier comes in and sees what is going on, and in a streak of genius he offers to the guy that our competitor down the block has better prices on cigarettes and they for sure will be able to take his credit card as payment because obviously our machine must be broken. CD was satisfied with this answer and left the store to torture another cashier.

My story today comes from my first year working in a ""Big Box Retail"" store that carries all sorts of electronics.  I no longer work there, but in the five years combined that I worked in this store, I have amassed many stories involving employee hilarity after hours, manager douchebaggery, but the best of all:  Stupid customers.

This story is easily my favorite.

**Black Friday, 2005
Location:  Car Audio Department**

I've been employed part time for roughly six months.  I knew absolutely nothing about Car Audio other than the major brands were Pioneer and Alpine for head units.  Over that time, I became more familiar with amplifiers, 1/2 or 1 farad capacitors, installation of subwoofers, speakers, and many other things.  However, our department was still mainly for the basics:  Head units that could handle the ridiculous boom of iPod users wanting to listen to their playlists in their car.

Black Friday in retail....I wasn't prepared for it.  Even in the afternoon, people were nothing short of insane.  After dealing with six of them, I will never go back.  On this day, though, a little blonde female college student gave me all the reason to stay in retail with her sheer stupidity.  The conversation went like this:

**Me**:  How can I help you today, Miss?

*Her*:  I need a new car radio for my 2002 Honda Civic!

(Sidenote, the area I live in is near one of the largest Honda plants in the country, so Honda pretty much dominates the demographc)

**Me**:  Alright, well you can pretty much pick whatever you want, but what do you need it for specifically?

*Her*:  Well, I have an iPod, and I want to be able to play it through my radio.

**Me**:  No problem.  Most of the decks in the mid to high price range have two options for iPods.  You can either buy an Apple Interface Cable (They went for about 100 bucks at the time....ridiculous, when you think about it) and it will power and charge the iPod.  The second option is to get one that uses the AUX slot in the front.  It doesn't charge it, but it's quick access and cheaper so you just plug it in the front.

*Her*:  Oh okay!  Like this?


Now...I'd like to think that most people have good common sense.  However, there is an occasional person out there that I run into which makes me lose faith in humanity.

This girl takes her iPod out of her purse and, as I point at one of the radios that has the AUX port, completely ignores that and attempts to put the iPod into the CD slot sideways.  After a couple of failed attempts, I blankly stare at her and finally respond.

**Me**:  Miss...you don't put it in like that...""

*Her*: Oh!  Like this?

She then turns it length-wise....and tries to do it again.

At this point, I have to laugh, but I stifle it and tell her I will be right back, going to the front of the department and grabbing one of the other guys, who watches her CONTINUE TO TRY AND PUT IT IN THE CD SLOT.  He takes over and I go to the warehouse....and proceed to lose it.  The Inventory Manager, who never smiled unless he had a beer in his hand, hears the story, and responds with the simplest, yet funniest thing I've heard him say.

I came to the US when I was 9 years old with my parents from the former USSR, and hence speak fluent Russian, however you would never know from speaking to me since my accent is practically nonexistent thanks in part to my being so young when we moved. 

When I was 17 I got my first (official) job as a cashier at ShopRite. For those not on the east coast of the US, ShopRite is a supermarket chain here. 

So, it's a particularly non eventful day of normal cashier work. People get on my line, I scan their shit, I bag their shit, I tell them how much money they spent, and they give me money to stuff the register. 

At some point this Russian woman and her 20ish year old son get in my lane. I finish ringing up the customer before them and the following conversation ensues.

&gt; *Me: (To previous customer) Have a nice day.*

&gt; *Me: (To Russian woman) Do you have a ShopRite card?*

&gt; *Woman: No.*

&gt; *Me: Do you have any coupons or rain checks?*

&gt; *Woman: No.*

I then begin scanning her groceries. Note that as far as she's concerned, it has been established that I speak flawless English.

&gt; *Woman: (to her son) Посмотри что этот идиот делает. (Translation: Look at what this idiot is doing)*

I glance up trying to find the idiot she is talking about. Perhaps something funny is going on?

&gt; *Woman: Почему он здесь работать? Бог Я ненавижу идиотов. (Translation: Why is he even working here? God I hate idiots.)*

At this point I realize she is talking about me. Mind you, all I am doing at this point is taking her groceries, waving them over the scanner, and putting them aside to bag later. I'm not banging them or taking a long time or anything. I was doing a pretty decent job of it actually. 

I begin to run the situation in my head and decide that it's best to just continue working and ignore the woman... for now. So I put on my best smile and keep scanning her shit.

&gt; *Woman: Сколько это еше займет? (Translation: How long is this going to take?)*

I finish ringing up all her stuff, punch up her total and begin bagging. Normally I would have asked how she would like to pay at this point, but I decided I would let her throw in a few more insults first.

&gt; *Woman: Он даже не знает как правильно упаковать. Ой, какой идиот. (Translation: He doesnt even know how to pack correctly. Oh, what an idiot.)*

She managed to throw in a few more insults my way, calling me some very colorful things in Russian. I made sure to pack all of her things away with a smile, and then replied:

&gt; *Me: Как вы будете за это платить? (Translation: How will you be paying for this?)*

The woman stops dead in her tracks, her eyes open wide in a moment of horror and for a brief moment our eyes lock. I smile an even bigger smile, as gentle as I can possibly muster, under the circumstances. Her son even took a step back. After what must have felt like an eternity for her, she hung her head in shame and handed me her credit card. I rang her up, handed her the credit card back, and handed her son the remaining groceries. Both of them are completely red in the face at this point and both refuse to say anything. Their eyes are firmly locked on to the floor. As they leave, I smile at them again and say:

&gt; *Me: Большое спасибо. Пожалуйста, приходите еще. (Translation: Thank you very much. Please come again.)*

Now the cherry on the icing happened almost 6 months after the incident. The son happened to get on my line with whom I assume was his father. They were speaking Russian to each other and didn't pay much attention to me. But I recognized the son. After I was done scanning their things, I pause, put on my smile again and say to the son:

&gt; *Me: Я вас помню. Как вы поживаете? (Translation: I remember you. How are you doing?)*

The best part wasn't the son's look of terror when he realized I was the same cashier that caught his mother being a cunt. It was the same look on the FATHER'S face, and the subsequent look of shame and insistence on looking at his shoes and not speaking. Obviously the story of his wife's antics reached his ears at some point, and they all remembered even 6 months after the fact.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_wj7sp,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/wj7sp/being_bilingual_sometimes_has_unexpected_benefits/,

This story comes from that time as it is one that stuck with me. Note: This story doesnt take place in the USA. 

I sit at my register and wait for customers. As it is quite bad weather, snowfall &amp; wind, there arent many. The wind picks up and early afternoon we have to close the gondola lift. About 30minutes later a family of 4 approach my register. The parents in their forties and two daughters around 17-19. 

Conversation goes as followed, A=Me, S=Supervisor, C=Customer. 

**A**: Hi how may I help you?

**C**: I would like 4 one way tickets to the middle station, we want to go sledding.

**A**: I am sorry the gondola lift is currently not running due to the weather!

**C**: but we want to go sledding! So sell us the tickets! How long do you think it will be closed?

**A**: Uhmm well I cant say as it depends on the weather and I dont know how it will change during the upcoming hour. 

**C**: You are doing this on purpose, you are just a lazy person and dont want to run the lift!

**A**: Doing what on purpose?

**C**: Not running the lift because of the weather!

**A**: Uhmm No. These are restrictions from the manufacturer. We dont make them, we cant change them for security reasons. It would be quite stupid from us to close the lift even though we could still run it, dont you think? I mean we make money from people using the lifts! 


*He had to think about this one for a bit as he probably noticed a flaw in his logic*


**C**: I dont believe these restrictions exist! You are just a bunch of lazy assholes that dont want to run the lift!

**A**: Well first off, I dont even run the lift from down here. I sell tickets. I will talk to my supervisor, just a second please!


*I walk back to my supervisors office and tell her that he wants tickets for the gondola, she of course tells me that it doesnt run due to wind and I tell her the guy doesnt believe me. She looks at me quite baffled and comes to the register with me*


**C**: Finally someone that can sell us the tickets. Your cashier is rude and lieing to me!

**S**: I dont want to sell you tickets as the lift isnt running due to the weather conditions and no CocaisBauer isnt lieing to you. 

**C**: You are just lazy assholes that dont want to run the lift. I want to go sledding with my family so sell us the tickets!

**S**: CocaisBauer sell him the tickets!


*I print out the 4 tickets for him and his family*


**A**: That would be 65 USD, please.

**C**: Here you go and next time dont try to fool me just because you are lazy!

**A**: Here is your change and have a nice vacation! Bye!


He leaves with his family towards the base station of the gondola lift around 200m away from the cashier office. 


I walk back to my supervisor and ask her why we sold him tickets. She tells me he wanted the tickets so we sold them. I could keep the money from the sale and if he comes back I should direct him to her. Around 30minutes later I sit back at my register and can already see the guy stomping down from the base station of the gondola towards my register. I wait patiently and smile at him while I look at him coming towards me. 

**C**: You are all lazy assholes that dont want to run the lift! I want my money back for the tickets! 

**A**: One minute please, I ll get my supervisor!

**C**: You better do so, I am angry and you are a useless lazy asshole! 


*I get my supervisor and I am eager to know what will happen now* 


**S**: You wanted the tickets even after we told you that the lift isnt running. You insulted CocaisBauer and no you wont get your money back!

**C**: This is outrageous! I demand to get my money back or else I will never come back to this region again!

**S**: You wont get your money back!

**C**: You are a stupid bitch and your cashier is a lazy asshole that wont achieve anything! I come here for my vacation and I should be treated better!

**S**: You should maybe try to treat other people with respect if you want to be treated so aswell and not insult them! We are closing now, if you have any more problems come back tomorrow!


I closed the office as the lift was staying closed for the remaining 40 minutes of its regular opening times due to weather and left so did my Supervisor. The guy was still screaming in front of the closed register for a few minutes until he noticed that we didnt care at all. I went for a drink with my supervisor afterwards with his ticket money and met his daughters later that night in a local bar where they apologised numerous times for their fathers behaviour.

After a long string of horrible customers, I began working with an elderly customer.  She told me that it was her granddaughter's birthday and that she wanted to send her a card.  The granddaughter did *alot* of texting and she wanted the card to be special.  She showed me the message she wanted for the card but wanted it to be in texting lingo and she didn't know any. 

I worked with the woman for about 15 minutes crafting the letter and explaining where things like, ""Let's replace this 'Lots of Laughter' with LOL and change the 'you are special'  'URSpshl'.  It was the most relaxed, care free, and creative, I had been in a long time.

She was *so* appreciative.  And like the great person she was,  she asked what she owed me.  I said ""nothing"" with the biggest smile I had.  ""Are you sure? I took you away from helping all these other people who are buying things?""  ""I'm sure"" was my response.  ""Can I give you a hug? You've been great"" she asked shyly.  ""I'm fine with that"" I responded.

One time on my lunch break I went over to this place because I was looking for a new kitchen stove, and the store manager approached me and asked if I worked at the store across the street. I thought we were about to have a moment of retail management camaraderie and so said yes, I was the manager over there. He then accused me of ""sneaking"" into his store and writing down their prices so we could undercut them. I tried to explain I had nothing to write anything down on or with, and was looking at kitchen appliances not software, but he was adamant and told me if I returned to his store I'd be trespassing.

Well unfortunately for them, they had a price matching policy of not just matching, but beating other prices by 10%. So from that day on, any time they called for a price check (that was their way to verify prices at the time), I'd tell them our price was like half of what it really was. The guys who worked at my store would buy everything from them because they'd get a better deal even than their employee discount.

One time they called to ask about a US Robotics modem and I gave some ridiculously low price and the guy was like ""OH COME ON!"" knowing he was being scammed, but also having a customer standing in front of him smiling smugly. Seconds later I see a guy dashing across 4 lanes of traffic from there, dodging cars with horns blaring, coming to check the price. It was the same dude who had threatened to have me arrested. I met him at the door and told him that per our previous conversation, I had not returned to his store and he was not welcome in mine. 

He had to dodge cars back across the street and I concentrated and focused my will, attempting to telekenetically trip him under a bus, but it didn't work. I don't know if he sold the modem at 60% off or not.

The car immediately behind him apologizes for what I have to put up with and tips me $10. How do people get to the point where they think that behavior is okay? The killer part is once it goes out the window, I am not allowed to take it back so if he would have just said, I only ordered one sandwich, he would have received two sandwiches for the price of one.

Know its been a while. Some shake ups at work have prevented me from accessing the internet, but fuck it, I have stories to share.  So today's is one of my favorite tales of catching a liar in an act.  This is the tale of **Dig Dug**. Throughout the story, please insert your own shoveling noises with each lie, to accompany the image of this girl digging herself deeper.  Or if you are a RvB fan, just pretend she made shoveling noises with her mouth. Anyways....



So it's another day at GDNickels.  My partner Stacy is on the cameras, when she alerts me to a case.  On her screen is a young latina woman, pushing a baby stroller, and accompanied by a younger girl who looks maybe 10 or so.  Stacy had already seen then place some fashion jewelry on top of the hood of the baby basket, and then cover them with some shirts they selected. So while its concealment, its one of those situations where it doesn't mean they are going to steal the items.  We see people place items there all the time. Sometimes as convenience and sometimes as a way to steal.  Either way it warrants watching. We knew we had a real case on our hands when they folded the hood up, pretending to coo at the baby inside.  Now all the items were concealed inside the stroller.  The two girls walked around, before finding a corner of the store where they quickly reach into the folded hood of the stroller, and shoved the clothes into a baby bag. They then proceeded to head to the exit of the store.  

Stacy and I met them at the exit, did the regular LP steps, and led them to the LP office to process them. Now the older girl was already in trouble.  But, like most shoplifters, she tried to lie her way out of it.  What makes this story different is the amount of lies fed to us, and the sheer stupidity of them.  So we will call this girl Dig Dug, or DD for short.

So we are in the office, and I'm searching the baby bag and stroller while DD and the younger girl are sitting on the bench.  Stacy is questioning them. DD says she has no ID but that her name is yolanda and she is 16 years old.  The younger girl says she is 12.  Inside the baby bag I find baby items, our merchandise, and several pairs or shirts and jeans from other stores, all without a receipt.  Now in the bag is one of those plastic containers containing baby wipes.  I open it up and taped to the inside is DD's license.  And sure enough, her name is not ""Yolanda"".  So I turn to the younger girl and ask how she knows ""Miranda"".  The little girl replies that she is her aunt.  

Me: Ok. And what was her name again?

LG: Miranda

Me: But she said it was Yolanda

DD: Miranda's a nickname.

M: I see. Then who is [Insert Real Name from license here]?

DD: Never heard of her.

M: Well thats funny cuz there is a drivers license hidden in the baby wipes with your picture and that name.

DD:  I've never seen that in my life. You planted it there.

Me and Stacy shared a glance and started to laugh

M: So I planted a fully ready license with your picture and false info, never having met, or even seen you before 5 minutes ago when you were stealing our stuff?  I also supposed you are really 16 and not 19 like this license says?  ::Shoveling Noises::

DD: I bought those clothes.

M: I'm sure you bought all these other clothes in this bag from the other stores too?

DD: Yea we were returning them.   ::Shoveling Noises::


M: Listen, you're already in a lot of trouble for stealing with two children in your presence.  Lying isn't gonna help.  Is this your real name?

DD:  Yes. 

M: That wasn't so hard.  Now is this girl really your niece?

DD: Yes.

M: Well we don't have any way of verifying that until the cops show up.

DD, panicked, yells ""WHY ARE THE COPS COMING?"" while standing up. quickly. Stacy forces her to sit back down, and tells her to stay seated unless she wants to get cuffed. Stacy then explained that the cops are coming because she stole clothes.

DD: But they just fell in there!   ::Shoveling Noises::


M: We have you on camera.

DD: So then you can see they just fell in there.   ::Shoveling Noises::


M: So you want us to believe, despite what our eyes, camera footage, and common sense tells us, that the clothes and jewelry somehow fell into your baby bag. Despite the fact that they are in different parts of the store. Despite the fact that the bag was closed, and despite the fact that the bag was underneath your stroller?

DD:.....

M: Listen, we aren't idiots.  And even if we were, those lies just are so bad that you aren't doing anything but making an ass of yourself.

DD: DON'T SWEAR IN FRONT OF MY BABY AND NIECE!

M: DON'T STEAL IN FRONT OF YOUR BABY AND NIECE!

At this point the baby started crying, so we allowed DD to take care of him, and feed him while we waited and did our processing.

While we were waiting, I decided to continue to ask her about the other clothes.

M: These other clothes from these other stores, did they fall in the bag too?

DD: No we bought them early.   ::Shoveling Noises::


M: Well why are they in your baby bag and not in a store bag? And wheres the receipt?

DD: We spilt soda.  [OK FUCK THE SHOVELS. WE ARE GONNA NEED A BACK HOE UP IN HERE. Catepillar bitches!]

M: Umm.....oooook.  Spilt soda. And....?

DD: Yea so we had to throw the bag and receipt out.

M: Because the soda ruined them?

DD: Yes.  I promise

M:  Then why are the shirts neither wet nor stained?

DD:  We got them out in time.

M:  Why are you lying?

DD: I swear. If I stole them I'd have removed the store tags off of them.

M: You didn't remove the tags off of our shirts...

DD: Well I didn't steal them.

M: Listen, here's the deal.  When the cops come they are gonna ask you the same thing. If you can't prove you bought these, they are going to bring you, in handcuffs to the stores, and ask if they saw your purchase these. If they didn't, you'll be charged there as well. But if you tell me now, we will just return them to the store and save you the extra charges.

DD: I stole them.

Now in truth most stores have a policy that once its out the door, they can't do anything. And smaller stores can't accuse you of stealing it if they cant remember you buying them. The sheer amount of customers they get plus different cashiers makes it impossible.  I just wanted to put her down a few pegs.

M: Ok do you have anyone who can come get your niece and son?

DD:Why it's only like $100 worth of stuff, they'll just release me.  I've been through this before.

M: I'm sure you have, and yes it's only $100. But you're also look at two felony counts.

DD: FOR WHAT?

M: Child Endangerment.

DD: Bullshit.

M: STOP SWEARING IN FRONT OF YOUR NIECE AND SON!

DD: [Glares at me]

M: Listen I'm not trying be an ass here. You're not just gonna walk away.  You used two children to steal.  That's Child Endangerment.  That's a felony.  Someone is gonna have to come get these kids.  

DD: Nah you're lying. I'll be fine

M: I'm not lying. Listen I know you've been a pain in the ass and we've been harsh back but we are tryna help you here.  Would you rather someone grab them here or at the police station while you're locked up?

DD: Stop playing.  I'll be fine.

Eventually me and Stacy gave up tryna convince her and we sat in silence until the cops arrived. They did what they needed to do, laughed at the tales of stupidity we had to share, and asked DD if there was anyone she could call. 

DD: Why?

Cop: To come get the kids?

DD: What? Why?

M: I already tried to explain.

DD: Explain what?

Cop: Well someone needs to come get the kids.

DD: WHY?

Cop: Because you're going to jail for the weekend?

DD: WHAT? WHY?

Cop: Seriously?

The cop explained the child endangerment charges and how it was Saturday so she'd have to wait till Monday to be arraigned. DD was not happy about it. She was also shocked that I, upstanding young man that I am, wasn't lying.

DD: They don't have anyone else. I'm the only one.

Cop: Well then how come the Little Girl has a different address then you.

DD:  Tax Reasons.  [WELP NOW FUCK THE BACK HOE! CAN WE GET THAT GIANT DRILL MACHINE THEY HAD IN ARMAGEDDON?  MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE]

Cop: Tax Reasons?

DD: Yea it helps with Taxes. But she doesn't live there.

Cop: So you're telling me you're also committing tax fraud?


DD: Ummm.....No.  She lives with her mom.

Eventually the Little Girl told us her moms name and number, and she was going to meet them at the station to pick her up and DD's son.  From what I heard after, DD was bought dinner while at the station from MCdonalds. She made her meal choice, then promptly had an ""allergic reaction"" the second she bit into her meal. You know, the one she chose. The officer on duty decided an ambulance wouldn't get there in time so took out an epipen and told her to hold still so he could stab it into her heart to save her.  She promptly announced that she was fine, and it was ""just gas"".

I work as a kitchen grunt at a fast food place. My favorite station is drive-thru because we are a bit of an upper-class place and our menu items border on ridiculously complicated, so I enjoy just sitting back to take orders and letting everyone else do the work of making the stuff. Still, there is the occasional customer who makes me want to tear my hair out.

Late one night, I get a guy who talks on the speaker in a low, passive-aggressive tone, as though he's being forced to order food against his will. He orders about seventy dollars worth of food, and says that he wants his food in ""separate bags,"" which is fine. We get that a lot. So I listen as he lists what goes in the first bag, then the second bag. Then he makes some modifications to the first bag. Then he asks to change something in the second bag. Then he asks to remove some items from the first bag and put them in the second bag. This starts to get on my nerves, but I seem to be following along just fine, and I go with it. Finally, when he's all done, he says ""So what's the total on the first order?""

Oh *snap*. It dawns on me that he wanted separate *orders*, not just bags. And I learn he didn't just want two, but three separate checks. And that's a bit terrifying, because our point-of-sale software is very badly designed and it's a nightmare to split arbitrary items onto a separate check. So I tell him to pull around to the window (there were no other cars in the lane at the time) and I'd tell him his total there. 

When he gets to the window, he looks seriously pissed, but I try to ignore it and I calmly tell him, ""I'm sorry, sir, but I didn't quite catch that you wanted your check split into different orders, I thought you just wanted separate bags. So I'm going to go through everything one more time just to make sure I have them on the correct checks.""

And I do. I meticulously list every single item he ordered, one at a time, and wait until he gives a ""mm-hmm"" or a ""yes"" or some sort of confirmation before continuing. It takes about fifteen minutes, no joke. But I walk him through each check, and I give him his total for a check and swipe his card before moving onto the next. This is my typical problem resolution strategy when I'm not entirely sure what the customer ordered.

But to my horror, as soon as I give him his third and final credit card receipt, he stares at it for a moment, and he gives me an odd look. I ask, ""Is something the matter?"" and he says ""Wait, this is all wrong. These are all on the wrong checks.""

It's at this point that I nearly explode, thinking, *I just spent fifteen freaking minutes double-checking every single item him... and he waits until AFTER I run all three of his cards through to realize everything's wrong?!! DID HE THINK I WAS TALKING TO MYSELF?!!*

When I went to get the manager to conduct the post-adjust, I explained (more like ranted about) the situation, and I asked her to finish the transaction for me because I couldn't hold my composure in front of the guy anymore.

Whenever I train someone on drive-thru, I warn them that the hardest part isn't learning our menu, or learning our glitchy and aptly-named POS software interface. That's only the beginning. The real challenge is dealing with customers who have communication issues.

His group used to come in for bi-weekly trips to the bookstore. He was mentally challenged, but super nice. This group lived in a home for the mentally disabled. I don't know if they are cast aways or what, but I always felt bad when I saw them just beause they were dealt a shit hand in life that was totally outside their control.

What made it so memorable is he had a certain taste in magazines, namely the ones all wrapped in black plastic. He would come in when the new issues hit the stands and buy every.freaking.one. I'm talking Playboy, Hustler, Perfect 10, every special issue of Playboy (College Girls, Lingerie, Wet &amp; Wild, etc). Now, if you know these mags, they aren't cheap, they will run you between $5-$10 a piece. It wasn't unusual for him to drop $60+ on these mags a month. 

He would then pay for them all in exact change. The problem with this is he had a very hard time counting due to his disability. Eventually, we got to the point where he would come up, hand me his wallet and the mags and I would ring him up, take the cash, and return his wallet to him short the correct amount. Yes, I'm honest, I'm not going to steal from a disabled person. Karma is a bitch and I would deserve a special circle of Hell for that. 

One day, I decided to tell him it was a lot cheaper to just get the subscriptions. He said he couldn't because they weren't allowed that kind of mail at the home and he didn't know how to use a computer to surf for the free stuff. But it honestly made his day to buy those nudie mags. And seeing him leave so happy would always brighten my mood.

Some background.  I worked at a local convenience store for the better part of 6 years.  My store in particular, being a small neighborhood store, closed at 1:00 AM.

The below customer, which I will refer to as AC, came in at 12:45.


AC  :  Yea, can I get a meatball sandwich?

Me  :  I am sorry miss but we have already cleaned up the hot foods for the night.  Can I get you a cold sandwich or something? (As an aside, this already annoyed me because we had cleaned up everything and put it away)

Me  :  As I said, no hot foods.  Sorry about that.

At our store we make drinks in addition to selling tea. My co-worker (let's call her Tiffany) was the only one on the floor and was trying to help two people at once. She was making a latte for one woman and then a second customer comes up and asks for a $25 giftcard. So, Tiffany tells the giftcard woman to just wait by the register and she'll help her as soon as she's done making the other customer's drink. 

Giftcard lady starts to walk away and Tiffany tells the woman ordering the drink her total. ""That will be $5.25"". All while making eye contact with this drink order customer. Tiffany walks over to the register and the giftcard woman looks at her and hands her $5.25. At this point Tiffany is puzzled and says to the woman, ""Oh you want a $5.25 gift card now?"" And this woman loses her shit. ""YOU SAID IT WAS $5.25!"" Obviously Tiffany is laughing inside at the stupidity of this lady and she goes, ""Ma'am, I'd be happy to sell you a $25 gift card like you originally asked, but that will cost you the whole $25."" This woman wasn't having it. She started yelling some more, ""YOU TOLD ME OVER THERE IT WAS $5.25! THAT'S WHAT I'M PAYING!"" ""I'd be happy to give you a giftcard, but the amount you're giving me is only for the total of $5.25. When I said that I was speaking to the other woman who ordered the drink."" ""NO YOU WEREN'T!""

I work at a local hibachi restaurant as a serve since January. Now, one of the chefs and the management are completely inexperienced in the food service industry, so it gets ridiculous. 

For example, last night: 

I have two tables of my own to take care of, and another one (Table A) is set shortly after my larger one. The larger of my tables wants to wait a few minutes for one of the guy's wife to show up. After 20 minutes, they order and I put their ticket in the back for the next chef. The timing of it all led to where Table A, which came in after my table, was ahead of mine in waiting for a chef. No big deal, right? It wasn't my fault. The people at my table were genuinely sad because they thought they dropped the ball. Nope. After I go back to enter in some drinks in the POS, my manager comes in and starts chewing me out for purposefully holding the order so I could score the better chef. This goes on for awhile, but I'm speechless and just leave my station flabbergasted. 

During the rush, the other waiter and I couldn't find time to bus the tables which have already left. The manager comes in, fed up with the mess, and busses it. After I finally get a break to rest, she chews me and the other waiter out for being so slow and irresponsible. ""I like the other waiter better! He actually cleans his tables! Now, you guys owe me money. Pay me for cleaning your tables, because it's not my job to do it!""  

Fast forward to 9PM, I'm waiting for any late tables, which does happen from time to time. In walks one lady, sad that she wasn't going to be sat with anyone else. I tell her that I and another waiter will gladly sit with her if it helps her feel comfortable. She agrees, and sits down. In run the manager, the boss' wife and the dining room server. The boss' wife guides who through the menu, while, at the same time, the server shows her all the drinks in drink menu, and while the manager is asking her for her beverage order. Hectic and unnecessary. 

I walk over, apologize for the chaos and, since I'm up on rotation, I take her order as she's ready to eat. My manager yells from the station that it's (The boss' wife) Ashley's table. I shrug it off and continue. I run into the back to give the chef the ticket. As soon as I do that, out comes my manager. ""Amildpikachu! That's not your table! It's Ashley's! You, go clock out!"" I walk out with the manager following me, she's still telling me it's not mine to have. I finally snap and go off. ""Listen, I'm up. It's my rotation, it's my table. Not her's. She doesn't get to fucking pick and choose which tables she gets! It's bullshit! She's fucked me over on one table today, and it isn't happening again! Got it?! Good!"" She finally walked off, waving her hands, her mouth agape at what I had just said. 

To shorten up the next hour, I scored free food thanks to that last customer, got to sit down and rest, and got a $50 tip from her on a $42 bill. When my manager and Ashley saw, they weren't too pleased that I ""robbed Ashley of her tip"". 

Fuck them. Fuck this place.

""No, it's all over her body and the doctors say she only has a few days left to live.""

""The nurse comes by once a day. So, you'll definitely be losing a customer! Haha!""

And then he kicked up a fuss because she didn't give him enough money for the food because there was a coupon I was honouring past its expiration date (I knew she had been in the hospital and it was a store coupon so it wasn't a problem, plus she had always been nice to me), but he didn't bring it with him. So he goes on and on about how she's on pain medication and keeps forgetting things. So he drives back to get the coupon. And he's STILL missing 4.30$ because she didn't add it up right. He insists I add everything up on the calculator first, and is like...""Ok, and now you take off the 7$..."" like I don't know how to add and subtract. He keeps muttering about the coupon and her forgetfulness and finally I said ""What's your point?"" 

And it comes up to 4.30$ more than what she gave him. So he asks me to do it again. My employee goes 

""There aren't 25 000 ways of adding it up. You're still short 4.30$. Do you have the money yourself? She'll pay you back, I'm sure. You can call her from here if you want."" 

And he flips his shit and says how he's only doing this to help out an old neighbour, how he was being so nice by running some errands for her, how her pain medication makes her forget things all the time, and how he doesn't lend money to anybody. He then storms out. Honestly, if I hadn't been in shock I would have gotten out my wallet and paid the difference myself to make him feel like an asshole for stressing out a woman who is dying over FOUR FUCKING DOLLARS.

So, given how the tale of the Shitscalator utterly disgusted people, I felt that I should share one my stories on the other side of the spectrum. 

Two Seasons ago, I had traded out my coupon-shilling masters to work at a dreaded company involving a giraffe, toys, and toy's occasional quantum status as people. You might say that we were them, even. However, despite the fearsome reputation the company has as a place to work for, I was quite enjoying it.

Any job where I get paid to play with remote controlled helicopters for four hours is a fantastic job in my book.

Also I was back-of-house now and didn't have to come within a mile of customer service, which really did wonders for my disposition. 

On this particular December morn, however, we had more back-of-house guys than we needed and, as the least experienced member of our illustrious minimum-wage association, I was booted out to suffer on the sales floor. Given that Yule loomed over the end of the week like Santa over a plate of confectioneries, we were packed. 

A fair matron rushed up to me, reeking of cigarettes and bad life decisions. ""Sir,"" spake she, ""I absolutely need a Crayola Crayon Maker or my daughter's Christmas will be ruined.""

Now as an aside, I absolutely hate being guilted about this shit. My family is not exactly descended from Croesus, understand, and whenever people make me out to be their kid's last hope to receive the  one gift that would make-up for being mentally traumatized by their parents I remember my mother taking out two jobs when I was a brat so my sister and I could have half the stuff we wanted. I don't want to feel responsible for people's holiday not playing out like a Disney movie. God dammit, don't put that on me. I think I'll give Mom a hug when I get home tonight.

So, she wanted a Crayola Crayon Maker. Needed one. The world would end without one. And so, by my obligations as a knight, and the fact that I was getting paid to do this sort of thing, I told her that I would quest into the fabled ""Back"" for her. 

I immediately rushed to the greatest of Sages, the store inventory count, to acquire the knowledge I needed to reach my prize. It bent down under the weight of its knowledge, and I was bathed in the illuminating electric glow. We had exactly two in the store, and both were on the sales floor. Flying fucking shit dammit. 

But how could I call myself a knight if I surrendered at the first sign of resistance? My noble ancestors would be ashamed of me! After freaking out about how they were alive in a world that they didn't understand, sure, but ashamed nonetheless!

(Though worst come to worst I could probably distract them with indoor plumbing for a good month.)

I asked the font of knowledge where my prizes were last stored. I received a few bays, where they had been scanned out weeks ago. Damn. I ran and did a cursory check nonetheless, but both the standard bays and the TZ single item bays were bereft of crayons, and the makes thereof. 

I returned to the matron with a heavy heart, and informed her of the trials that loomed before me. If she was willing to wait, I told her, I would search until I found them. If they were still in the store, they would be mine. This I swore on my honor. Then I remembered how I stole my sister's dessert the night before and swore on the holiday season itself. Mentally of course, since I don't actually talk like that out loud.

Surprise of all surprises, she said that she would wait. Usually when I say that I have no idea how long it would take me to find an item, if it even remains in the store, the customer departs in a huff. But she remained, determined to wait out my efforts, and my previous coldness regarding her cause melted away. I resolved to do my absolute best to find a Crayola Crayon Maker for her.

I journeyed to the faraway hills of the re-shop carts. My prize dwelt not among the people there. I climbed the fabled cliffs of overstock bays, but my quarry remained elusive. 

It was then that I knew where I must go. The mountains of shit that got unloaded from the truck last night. While technically in the back, they weren't scanned into any bays. My heart sank and for a moment I despaired. 

But no! I did not come this far to be defeated by a tower of cardboard boxes! (Seriously, it probably broke a few safety regulations.) I would climb to its peaks or perish in the attempt!

Reaching the loading dock, I beheld my enemy. Somewhere, deep within the heart of the mountain, lay a box of Crayola Crayon Makers, sweeter than any gem ever unearthed by mortal men. It had to be. It *had* to be!

I spent twenty minutes crawling around and on top of the pile. It was nowhere in sight. I excavated several tunnels into the depths, but I found it not. My heart began to wrestle with the possibility of failure. 

Suddenly, something caught my eye! In the very back of the pile, just barely visible thanks to my digging efforts, a box with the ""Crayola"" brand emblazoned upon it peeked out of the gloom. I strained to see if it was followed the the word ""crayon"", which would hopefully bring the word ""maker"" along with it, but I could not make anything else out.

Hope was kindled. 

I carefully crafted a tunnel through the heart of the mountain, probably breaking even more safety regulations. I gingerly crawled through an opening supported by some hot wheels and a box of Iron Man masks. On my hands and knees, I inched towards the box. My fingertip could just barely brush it. Then I managed to get an index finger around the corner. I strained, and strained, and managed to get half of my palm on the box. This gave me enough leverage to pull it towards me.

I felt like the event should have been accompanied by sunbursts and the choir invisible. As it was I read the words ""Crayola Crayon Maker"" celebrated only by a cloud of dust and spider poop. Still, though, never did I know a sweeter triumph. I hollered, a tribute to my conquest, and raised my fist in victory.

As I did so I accidentally punched the roof of my tunnel and collapsed it onto myself. I was trapped. Entombed, before my time.

Fortunately my compatriots had heard my yodel of triumph and came to investigate. A few minutes later I was free of my premature grave, though not without more than a bit of teasing, and striding towards the matron with my head held high.

She received her crayon maker, I received a commendation, and Christmas was saved for everyone forever.

Someone buys more than they can carry and I have to help them lug it to their car.  Sometimes it was great, I get to chat to a friendly customer as we walk in the nice weather to her car, and often I got tips.  Sometimes it was horrible, and the actual worst was a woman I have named ""Gertie Goodlife"".  

This woman has real entitlement issues.  The last time she was in the store three months ago, she had six huge bags of stuff, and was offended that she had to carry one of them, I took five.  We walk in the pissing down rain, her under her umbrella, me getting soaked.  When I need to put down her bags on a bench for a moment to regrip because of wet hands, she bitches at me.  When we finally reach her SUV, she drops her bag at the back, pushes a button on her fob to open the hatch, and demands that I quickly put the bags in because she's in a hurry.  She climbs into the drivers seat, beside her 20 yr old son who's playing with his phone. In the 45 seconds it took me to settle the six bags in the back I heard ""Come on!"" three times.  No tip, no thank you. Fuck her.

Jump to liquidation.  The Chief Liquidator tells me I'm not to do carry outs any more, but allows, when I ask, that I can use my break time to accommodate some of our favourite customers (really, I like most of our customers).  And you know what? The bugger does time me when I do carry outs.

Now this morning.  First I see one of my most favourite customers, a little old lady, maybe 189 years old (I swear to god, she looks ancient) but who is spry, with it, pleasant and a joy to serve. Let's call her Nanny Nice.  She practically has tears in her eyes looking at the bankruptcy signs.  I go over and say hello, she actually gives me a hug (never happened before) and tells me how sorry she is and asks if I have a new job yet, actually concerned for me as a person.  We chat for a minute, then I tell her I have to do other things, but I'm sure our regular sales folks will be more than happy to help her find what she needs (Everybody loves Nanny Nice, and I knew she'd be taken care of).  Then I go back to disassembling empty fixtures.  That's when I see Gerty Goodlife is in the store, full cart and all.  Don't care.

After half an hour, a coworker asks if I'll do a carry out for Nanny Nice.  I go to the chief liquidator, tell him I'm taking a five minute break to do a carry out, and grab Nanny's bags.  I put them in her car and she hands me a fifty!  I tell her it's too much (usually it's two or five).  She laughs at me and tells me ""I just bought two thousand dollars worth of crap I don't really need so I can certainly give a nice boy like you $50"" (Nice boy, btw, I'm mid-late 40's) I smile, hug her again and go back to the store.

There's Gerty at the door with six bags looking pissy and tells me ""You need to carry these to my car.""  The biggest shit eating grin spreads across my face:

""I'm sorry, we aren't doing carry outs anymore under the liquidation.  I need to get back to work.""

""I just saw you do a carry out!"" she screeches.

""Actually, I just took some of my break time to do a favour for a nice lady I consider to be a friend.  You aren't nice, you aren't my friend.  If you have a problem, go talk to the Chief Liquidator, he's right there."" I say pointing.  Then I go back to work disassembling fixtures, listening to the screeching coming from the front of the store for the next half hour as the chief liquidator tells her to drive her car close to the front doors and load her own damn car.

TL;DR: I bought coffee for my coworkers today, but kept the change.

""Where at?""

""You go down this street ...""

""Okay but WHERE""

... ""You see this building outside?  On the other side of that.  Right hand side of the street""

Thanks, just I what I needed.",MajikToastsLady,701,144,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1j92st/i_might_get_fat_like_that_girl_over_there_says/,"Recently, I have moved an hour away from home for uni. I don't really know anybody here besides my boyfriend and our roommates. I've gotten to know a couple coworkers, and I'm still familiarizing myself with a the new store. I work for a fast food chain, and I transferred stores, so things are a little different. 


Today we had some very rude people come in to my store. I guess they do this a lot, however. Anyways, while sweeping up our lobby these two boys and a girl came in. They ordered food from me, no big deal. I got their food quickly, and there were no issues. They walk away with their food all was well.


A little back story: My coworker tells me how the girl and her sister had tried to get her fired once for something completely unrelated to work. Other than somebody brought up where my coworker works in a Facebook argument, and we have a social media policy stating we can't post anything about our company. (Reason why I am not naming where I work.) And so this girl and her sister tried to use this against my coworker and it obviously didn't work.


So, a little time passes and my manager asks me to go check our lobby, and clean up whatever needs done since we're slow.... No problem. Until, I am wiping down a table that is one table away from theirs. They proceed to have a conversation rather loudly that goes a little something like this...

Boy one: *Man I'm glad I don't have to work here.*

Boy two: *Me too, then I might get fat like that girl over there.*

Boy one:  * *looks over* * *Oh my God you're right.*

Girl: * *laughs* * *Guys that's not nice.* [sarcastically, of course.]


Are you fucking kidding me? Why on earth would you say that to somebody? They weren't prizes either... For clarification, I am a size 8. Not small, but not big. Just average. Everything about me is average. Except I'm a little short.


So I walk away to go get a broom to just sweep, hoping that they either leave or something changes. Well, no, when I had to sweep the area where they are sitting, they make sure to have another loud conversation about me.


Boy one: *Oh, and she's back again.*

Boy two: *Just watch her bend over, her rolls get twice as bad.*

Girl: *I'm glad I don't have that muffin top. That's just ridiculous. Obviously she needs clothes that fit.*

Boy two: *I'm glad you're not fat.* **[This is to his ridiculously thin girlfriend.]**


So I promptly left to just clean the other side of the lobby, and had told my coworker who had expressed her issues with them being there in the first place what just happened. She told her manager, and in doing so the front line team heard. While I was getting a mop to finish the other side of our lobby, my boyfriend (we work together) asks me what's wrong. I shrugged it off, told him it was nothing and finished that part of the lobby as soon as possible. 


I empty the mop bucket and come back to the front line to take my position back over, I see my manager throw this group out. This is the first time I have ever worked with this manager. But he gave me a thumbs up from across the lobby as they left. About ten minutes later he fields a call from two different angry moms on why their children, who were threatened first, were thrown out of our establishment. He proceeded to tell them that when they (the group of teenagers) initially ordered their food nobody said anything to them besides the obvious questions for their order. And that when his employee (me) went to clean the lobby, she didn't say a word to them. He had been in the office at that time counting the safe down, and could see me on the camera system. One mom left it at that, however the other mother didn't. She tried to question his authority, and he eventually just told her that it wasn't his job to parent her children. That they should have more respect for his employees, because every time they come into our establishment, something happens, and he always gets a call from her. He said he would be glad to sit down with the owner, the group of kids, and parents and explain why he is requesting that they be banned from the property.


Now mind you, I have just started working here. I just moved, and this is my third week. I know nothing about the group that came in. And this is the very first time I have ever worked with the awesome manager who threw them out.

I'm alone in the store beyond a customer coming in every so often.

This was not something I requested or agreed to when I came into my initial shift. I expected to be relieved after my eighth hour at work. Nobody came. Calls went out, and no response.

I work in a large store that sells groceries and accepts EBT (food stamps). On weekday nights it is usually fairly busy, but I am a fast checker, so it's usually not a problem. Last night I was working an express lane (20 or less), and a woman comes up with about 40 items. I'm not too picky, so I let her come up. 

Immediately, I knew that was a mistake. The first words out of her mouth were ""this is EBT, and I only have a hundred dollars. I know this is probably over, but you can take things off, right?""

Me: Of course, or I can keep a running total for you and you can say when to stop.

Customer: Let's just ring it all up and see how much it is first...

Me: Okayyyy..... (Insert beeps) your total is about $115.00.

Customer: I knew I couldn't get it all...

Me: What do you want me to take off?

Customer: All of it. I still have to go to Aldi and get stuff.

So I called a manager, and they abort the transaction.
Just as I'm asking her if she would like us to take care of her cart, she puts about half the items back up.

Me: Do you want to go ahead and get these?

Customer: I don't know... Lets see how much it is.

This time it was about $30.00.

Once again she says its too much and asks to cancel it. Different manager aborts.

We repeat this process about five times. When we finally get back to the original manager, she tells the customer she has to decide or leave the store. This encounter has lasted about an hour as she tries to decide what to get each time, and its killing my productivity report. 

Customer: But I'm poor! Can't we just do this one more time? I need this stuff!

Manager: Yes, we can cancel it one more time. And then you can leave. I can't have you wasting my cashier's time and the time of the people in line behind you.

So on this particular Sunday the phone goes in the pharmacy five minutes after we've opened. The Pharmacist answers and its a customer asking where her medication is. For older customers we offer a delivery service whereby their medication is delivered to their house each month so they don't have to come into town to pick it up. This particular customer had not received her medication and we were scouring the pharmacy and the computer system to find out why.

Yes, that's right, she threatened to call the police because she hadn't received her medication yet.

The driver was not comfortable carrying a prescription without a member of staff so we ended up sending one of the pharmacy team in the taxi with him and we delivered it to her door. Of course, the store had to shell out for the cost of the taxi, and from what I heard, she wasn't even appreciative when we finally got the medicine to her.

The first thing the store manager told me when he promoted me to full time, and overnights, was that the night crew was filled with mutants perverts and mental defectives. I soon found out that he was right, but he neglected to tell me how entertaining the could be. 

We used to start work at 11 P.M. the first thing we would do was break down all of the pallets and 'spot' the load in the correct aisles. We did this by making stacks of cases and then wheeling them to the correct spot, in the correct aisle, with two wheeled dollies. 

We had two guys, one named Booger and the other Snapper. Booger was named that because he looked like a gross little troll, and Snapper was a pervert that was rumored to 'snap' his carrot in the men's room if he ever saw a hot looking customer. They spent a lot of time busting on each other and playing practical jokes on each other. 

While spotting the load one day, Snapper noticed that Booger was only twenty feet or so behind him and heading in the same direction. Snapper lifted weights and was on some high protein diet that gave him farts that smelled like something had died in his colon a few years ago and was trying to escape. So Snapper lets one fly and Booger walks right through it. He gets pissed and yells a bit. About a half hour later, Booger feels a good air biscuit building so he goes and finds Snapper. He sees him go into an aisle 5 or 6 down from where he was. He jogged up and caught sight of Snapper out of the corner of his eye. He spotted Snapper at the close end of the aisle almost hidden by the large end cap display that was overflowing into the aisle. Booger moved sideways and threw a hip into Snapper to hold him there while he rips out a fart that sounded like he needed to wipe afterwards. Booger laughed and ran away before Snapper could beat the crap out of him. The only problem was that when he made it to the end of the aisle he almost ran head on into Snapper coming the other way. He took a quick look back down the aisle and spotted the shocked middle-aged lady, with the same color shirt on as Snapper, standing at the end of the aisle wondering what the hell had just happened. 

Booger went and hid, and Snapper and I had to apologize to her for what had happened as the rest of the crew searched for the 'random drunk customer' that had farted on her. We had to spend about a half hour calming her down while Booger hid in the back of the deli department. It was disgusting, but hilarious, and thankfully never got back to the store manager.

first post, so please let me live...

This story takes place roughly 10 years ago when I was in university and worked part-time for a fast food chain. While it wasn't uncommoon for customers to be rude, insulting behaviour towards and name calling of employees wasn't tolerated. Legislation in that European country regarding so called ""offences against personal honor"" like libel and slander is strict, and calling someone an asshole might result in prosection and having to pay the person you have insulted damages. Also, this whole ""get me you manager"" attitude isn't really common there either. You deal with me and me alone, and I'll throw you out if you don't behave. Managers have better things to do with their time.

It was a Friday evening shift in town, around 9pm. Work was slow as partygoers weren't expected until 10 or later. I was the only one at the till, my manager was standing behind me, handing me whatever our customers ordered. In came those two Turkish guys, talking in Turkish about what they'd done this evening. I greeted them politely and took their orders, they wanted to eat in store. That's when one of them started telling the other one in Turkish how that blonde girl behind the till would certainly be a good f*ck, how he knew for sure I would be easy to pick up since slutty till girls like me should be grateful for his attention etc. etc. Little did Mr. Dumbass know that the one they were mocking could understand every single word they said. I turned around, looked at my manager - who was aware I knew Turkish - grinned, and whispered ""Watch this"". I put their order on a tray, let them pay, looked at the one who'd unsulted me, and with the biggest smile on my face I told him in Turkish: ""You know, I'm not so sure if my (non-existent) Turkish husband, or his family for that matter, will be happy about the way you just insulted his wife."" 

Mr. Douche got white as a sheet and started stammering. It was awesome. He and his friend basically grabbed their food and ran out of the store, never to be seen again. My manager couldn't stop laughing that evening, I got an extra break and ice cream on top.

Thankfully, this happens a lot where I work. Normally it's something along the lines of this:

'I want a cheeseburger, but with no cheese.'

'Sir/Ma'am, I can do that as a hamburger if you'd-'

'Did I say hamburger? Would you listen to a customer for once? I pay your wages' (etc, making the biggest deal of this possible. )

'Sir/Ma'am, the cheeseburger costs 10p extra for the cheese, and is otherwise identical to the hamburger. To make sure you get your order exactly they way you'd like it, can I just check: are you asking me to charge you 10p extra for something that you would like specifically removed from your food?'

The hidden sniggers from the other customers normally make this worth it, especially if the customer gets embarrassed enough to stick to their guns and pay that extra 10p, but yesterday we had someone embarrass themselves just that little bit more.

So there's a lot of people who like their fries really hot. Not a problem. What can become a problem, is when we're selling fries so fast that the only ones ready have literally JUST come out of the fryer, and the customer wants us to put down a basket just for them. If they were polite and willing to wait it wouldn't be so bad, but this guy yesterday just lost it, and made himself look really stupid. 

(Customer is to be read in a nice, south london accent, with just a hint of fake *thug lyfe*. Also, he looks about 12.)

The guy next to me who was serving this customer was french, and I was eavesdropping (not native but I speak it too). This customer (we'll call him RudeBoi) starts laying into him about how he 'NEEDS hot fries', and the ones he was given 'JUST WEREN'T GOOD ENOUGH', and 'WHY does he have to wait? *Because everyone else was getting THEIR fries, why are HIS taking so long?*' My co-worker gets irritated and starts grumbling away to himself in french; stuff like 'Ahh this is so stupid, why doesn't he just take the fries'. RudeBoi hears him talking in french but completely mishears it / makes it all up, and starts shouting.

'Oi! I heard what you just said! You said Pu-tan!' (really shoddy attempt at putain - french expletive similar to fuck - but with a really strong english accent.) 'I know what that means, *YEAH I speak French* and I won't be talked to like that!' 

It should be noted, the co-worker didn't even use the word, or swear at all. But seeing as RudeBoi said he spoke the language, he just started explaining the situation in french for him, even prefacing it with 'well seeing as you speak it, maybe I can help and explain it better for you in french.' 

The blank look on his face when he didn't understand a thing was brilliant, and as if getting caught in the middle of a massive lie wasn't good enough, he burnt himself on his fries afterwards. The customers in the line he was holding up were laughing at him, and sweet victory was had. 

**TL;DR: customers act all self-important, we politely make them look like idiots by 'trying to help', the world is a better place.**

We sell lots of iPads and a fair amount of laptops.  So, when a woman calls us with questions about getting an iPad, I'm happy to help her out so she can get the best fit for her needs.

However, she asks every question that could ever be asked about an iPad, as well as every question ever considered in regards to Wifi and 3G.  45 minutes later, I hang up, thinking I have helped her make a final decision.  She calls back 4 more times, each time with ""another quick question.""  In total, I spend 2 hours on the phone with her.

The next day, someone walks into the store.  I can tell she'll be a problem customer, so I go into the back to get some water (I've gained the ability to recognize terrible people from at least 50 feet away.)  When I come back out, she's nowhere to be seen, so I go on helping other people.  About an hour later, my coworker comes off the floor to get a manager.  As he passes me, he says ""This lady's killing me!""  She's been talking to him for an hour about iPads.  It turns out he basically had to repeat everything I had told her on the phone.  She also talks to our manager for another hour, again being told the exact same information.

At this point, she decides she wants to get a MacBook Air, because she didn't realize the iPad didn't have a physical keyboard (?!).  We get the inventory sheets and warranty stuff all set up, and are about to swipe her card when she decides that she doesn't want it because it doesn't have 3G on it.  Someone tells her she could get a mobile hotspot from her cellular carrier if that was important for her.  So she stands at the desk for an hour as she calls verizon to ask them every question ever conceived in relation to 3G mobile hotspot.  

Eventually she decides to go through with the order.  We all think she's left.  However, 20 minutes later, she storms up to the desk, as I'm in the middle of processing a huge iPad mini order, and demands to know why anyone would make a laptop with one USB port.  After lots of ridiculousness with this, she buys a USB hub, and leaves.  About 45 minutes later, we get a phone call from her.

She had read all of the fine print on the back of her receipt after she got home, and saw that we don't accept computer returns after 5 days in cases where people just decide they don't like the computer.  She says, ""Only 5 days?!  But what if there is a manufacturing defect?  What if I need it repaired a month from now?  5 days?!!!""  So I calmly explain to her what a warranty is (at the store, she had purchased applecare coverage after getting a lengthy explanation of what that entailed).  She seems satisfied and hangs up.  At the end of my shift, I bet my coworker that she'll either show up in the store first thing the next morning, or call us as soon as we open.  He laughs and says no way.

We opened at 8 this morning.  At 8:01, the phone starts ringing.  The shrill sound reverberates through the chilled emptiness that is the sales floor on a Saturday morning in December, like a Banshee's screech echoing across the moors.  Behold, it is her.  She has called to complain about the fact that Windows 7 is not the operating system on AN APPLE COMPUTER.  We tell her about parallels (Windows for Mac) and hang up.  She shall surely return.  And we will be ready.

UPDATE (5:31):  SHE JUST SHOWED UP!!!  I'm about to go 'help' her.  I'll update when she leaves.

UPDATE (5:53): So, she came back in saying that she was concerned about the processing power of the 11inch air she bought (because word processing takes up so much power).  She also wanted to know if she could put the different models in her purse to see how they were in terms of size (despite playing on a display model for an hour before she bought it yesterday).  I couldn't handle it, so I said she would have to go talk to someone at the desk across the room, as ""I can't leave my desk right now.""  

She shuffles across the room, and I can see the terror in my colleague's eyes as he realizes the horror which is about to befall him.  He talks with her for a bit, explaining how she is worried about the processor speed and she doesn't think the 11inch screen will be big enough for her eyes, because ""people's eyes get tired.""  My coworker listens to her explain her every thought in deciding how to consider her purchase, and then says she can do whatever she wants with the demo models, but he's going back to the sales desk.  

He then CLOCKS OUT AND LEAVES (so he won't have to deal with her anymore!)  Later, she left, but then walked back in to ask me what the exact dimensions of an iPad retina's screen are.  I said about 10inches, but she had to know EXACTLY how tall it was, so I went and looked it up (the device is 9.5inches tall).  Apparently that wasn't acceptable, so she left without saying anything further.  Oh how I hope this is the end.  I'm sure she'll come on Monday though.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,1355007867.0,,,True,t3_14hxr1,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/14hxr1/apple_nightmare/,
1359344641.0,551,self.TalesFromRetail,17ephp,"""I can't feed forty kids with these two crappy pizzas!""",WinnifredBurkle,677,126,105,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/17ephp/i_cant_feed_forty_kids_with_these_two_crappy/,"So I spent some time working for a children's play place and pizza restaurant chain when I was in high school and college. I dealt with lots of crazy stuff (see previous post and comments), but some of the craziest customers were birthday party moms. 

I live in a moderately sized southern town with some overly entitled southern housewives. They were the worst. Not like Pinterest moms now, who go overboard doing everything homemade, oh no. These ladies wanted the best for their kids but they absolutely did not want to pay for it and would throw the biggest fit in the history of fits when given their final bill. 

One particular mom stands out more than others, but some backstory first. We offered different party packages, some with more emphasis on the games and winning tickets and some focusing more on the maze. Two of the packages we offered had pizzas at a discounted price along with maze admission for a set number of kids, and some tokens. The main difference between the two was how many kids were included, how many tokens you got, and wether or not a party hostess helped with your party. 

Before I became shift manager (and sometimes after) I was a party hostess. For the most part I loved it. It was fun to do my little skit with the mascot and cut the cake and I got sweet tips for it, too. Most parents were thankful for the help and the chance to enjoy their child's party. Others were not so nice. 

This mom had purchased the most expensive package. It came with admission for 8 kids with admission discounted for any extras, two discounted pizzas, some
free tokens, the party hostess (me) and interaction with the mascot. Great. I check her in, go over token prices and additional food prices, give her her 8 wristbands for the guests (she assures me that no more than that will be coming) and start to get things together in the party area. 

I find out from my coworker up front that more and more kids come in for this party. At first she tries to sneak them in, but we had the wristbands for a reason (easy identification for who didn't pay) and made her add additional ones to her party ticket. She ended up having FORTY kids total come on her ticket. 

It takes a while, but I get everything set up for forty kids. I check and double check with the kitchen-did this woman order any extra pizza for her gigantic party? They assure me that no, she did not. I ask again twice before I call them back, and the kitchen finally assures me that the two discounted pizzas we talked about at check in were all she ordered. I assume that the other parents were going to order food for themselves and their children, as unfair as that would be, and call them back. 

So the forty kids come back, all flushed and excited from doing the kid thing, and immediately see that there's a problem. None of the other parents had ordered food, and these kids are *starving*. The fatass birthday kid grabs three pieces for himself, because its his birthday and he can do that, which leaves 11 pieces of pizza for 38 kids and all their parents. 

The party mom storms over and asks where her other pizzas are. I tell her that we made all the pizzas she'd ordered. No, she'd ordered more, she insists. 

""Do you think I'm *stupid?* Why would I have forty kids and only two pizzas? You should have know and made them anyway, even if I didn't order them!""

""Ma'am, I'm sorry, but we can't just make pizzas without a ticket. I'd be happy to place an order for you, but it'll be a while before they're ready and your allotted time in the party area will be over. I'm terribly sorry, what would you like me to do?""

She blows up. ""Well I would have really liked it to not have an idiot take care f my son's party! I can't feed forty kids with these two crappy pizzas!"" 

It was a ridiculously busy day and I had at least two more parties to do after hers, so I decided if she was going to act that way, she wasn't going to have a party hostess. I got my boss, who explained he was sorry about the pizzas but we had no way of knowing that she wanted more. (I guess now we could have asked her, but how is that our responsibility? And what if a kid had had an allergy or something and that's why she didn't order more? I mean, who knows.) He offered her hot dogs as an easy way of feeding every guest quickly, but she got even more pissed when she found out she'd have to pay for them, even at a discount. 

I didn't go back to that party until they had all left, but I did over hear her bitching about the fact that they didn't get enough free tokens with their party package. She bought some more, eventually, and flipped her shit when she got the final bill. 

I don't think she realized that my boss included a tip for me (for having to put up with her and her forty guests) in the bill. She probably would have come back and burned the place down.

1369260941.0,552,self.TalesFromRetail,1ev41y,Someone's trying to get me fired. (x-post from r/talesfromcoffeeshops),SpoonPoetic,647,95,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1ev41y/someones_trying_to_get_me_fired_xpost_from/,"This woman is literally calling my store several times a day asking to speak with the owner (who's never around, thankfully) to try and get me fired.

The story:

She drives directly up to the drive thru window, skipping the speaker, so we don't even know she's there for a minute. When my barista notices her there, she apologizes for not seeing her, and without even acknowledging her, this woman jumps right into talking down to her: ""Does a mint mocha have mint in it? Yeah? How about mocha, maybe?"" Like she's 5 and stupid. My barista says ""oh that was supposed to be a mint mocha? I'm so sorry, hold on one second.""

We whip one up for her and I head to the window with it. ""I'm really sorry for the mix up! Here's a brand new mint--"" She interrupts, absolutely screaming. ""I DON'T WANT THAT, I WANT A REFUND!""

She keeps screaming at me for several minutes, basically repeating herself (""this isn't a mint mocha, it's supposed to be a mint mocha, I want a refund, this isn't a mint mocha..."") as I'm trying to gather the pertinent information to get her refund for her. If she had listened to me for one second, she would have also received the mint mocha, for free. I can't get her to slow down or listen to me for one second so I can't even find her order to give her the refund (I kind of need more information than ""I wanted a mint mocha but didn't get it"" - what did she pay with? what time of day did she come?). Plus there's a line of customers building up behind her.

So I asked her, ""I'm really sorry about this mix up, I am doing my best to fix it for you - would you please refrain from yelling at me and I can get this sorted as soon as I have all the information I need to void the order?"" She screams even more loudly, ""I'M NOT YELLING!"" before yelling at me that she paid with a Discover card an hour ago.

(Bonus: This information lets me know that this woman in fact ordered a plain latte, I even double checked to make sure she didn't want any flavor in it - she was the first Discover card I'd seen in weeks so I happened to remember that transaction clearly. But for the sake of customer service I keep pretending it was our mistake instead of escalating it by telling her she ordered wrong.)

I thank her for the information, assure her I'd get that voided out as soon as possible, but would she please pull around to a parking space so I can get the drinks out to the customers behind her? I'd be bringing her void receipt out in just one minute. She responds to that by scoffing, and yelling to see the manager. ""Oh, I'm the manager. Don't worry, it will just be a minute, I'm really sorry about all this.""

""YOU?? YOU'RE the manager?"" ... She pauses. ""We'll see about that.""

Literally just a few seconds later I get the order voided and run the receipt out to her while my baristas take care of the line behind her. She is on the phone. She sees me there but pointedly turns to face the other direction. I'm left standing there for almost 5 minutes before she rolls down her window and looks at me. ""Here's your void receipt, again I'm really sorry for the miscommunication. If there's anything else I can do to help you please let me know! Have a great day!"" ...She doesn't even respond.

I get back into the shop only to be informed that while I was outside waiting for her to roll her window down, this woman had called the store twice, asking for the owner to complain about the manager. I later found out from the manager at our neighbor store that she had called there, too.

And now she's called several times a day for over a week, trying to reach the owner. Really?? Who has time for all that? Especially considering I was sweet, smiley, and apologetic the whole time; gave her exactly what she wanted; and was well within my rights to refuse her service because of her disrespect. Maybe that was my mistake, actually - being too nice when I should have been all, ""LISTEN HERE - show me some R-E-S-P-E-C-T, lady!!""

Also because I'm not some big burly man that people are afraid of pissing off. -sigh-

TL;DR - Lady orders wrong, wants refund, yells and screams, I ask her to stop and give me the info needed to complete the refund, she subtly threatens my job and calls several times a day since to try to get me fired, people suck.

A normal Saturday consists of about 8 hours of this.
Anyway, a few hours into my shift and with the madness showing no sign of ending, a customer that I had just finished helping was stepping away from the desk. Out of nowhere, this woman rushed up (cutting in line, I might add - a huge pet peeve of mine on nonstop days) and IMMEDIATELY copped an attitude: pointing a finger in my face, she said, ""I had security call me an ambulance, but I don't WANT this ambulance, I want you to call me a NEW ambulance, because the driver of this one is giving me ATTITUDE."" For a second, I was stunned into silence. I mean, I have heard some ridiculous complaints at my job, but this was by far the most ludicrous. My immediate thought was that if this lady was well enough to demand multiple ambulances, she wasn't sick enough to need one in the first place. So I responded ""ma'am, if this is an emergency, you need to take the ambulance that is waiting for you, or call 911 yourself and see if they will send a different one, which I doubt they will do. If its not an emergency, I can't let you cut in front of all these people who have been waiting."" Her eyes bulged madly for a second before she demanded that I find the security guard who had called the first ambulance and ask that security guard to call a second one. I told her that I could not do that either, that security would not call a second ambulance for the same guest. At that point she SLAMMED her hand down on the counter and screamed ""Well if YOU can't do that for me I want you to find someone who CAN!"" I glanced at my coworker sitting at the computer next to me, rolled my eyes, and look back at Belligerent Lady. Before I could even open my mouth she shrieked ""Are you ROLLING YOUR EYES???? DID YOU JUST ROLL YOUR EYES AT ME?????"" To which I calmly replied ""yes I am rolling my eyes at you,"" stood up, and called to my manager to call security. I guess Belligerent Lady didn't think she could get away with bullying the security guards either, because she yelled a little bit more about how she was ""just trying to have a conversation"" with me and this was my (over?)reaction, then she scuttled off.

Epilogue: The same lady came back later that day demanding to see my name tag so that she could ""report"" me. I held it up to her face and said, ""Sure, it's sex_camel, make sure you don't forget the underscore."" (I have an unusual name, so this was particularly satisfying.)

It was a Cadillac convertible from the 70's. It was the slickest and cleanest looking car I've ever seen. Some customers had commented it was worth about $40,000 - $50,000. Either way, it's expensive (sorry I didn't get a pic of it). Being a gas station, it's not unusual for people to leave their broken down cars with us for a day until they get it towed or fixed. Usually people leave their name and phone number with us, but the owner of this car never came in. We had no idea who it belonged to. 

After 4 days, a local cop stopped in and we asked if he could run the plate number to find us a name or number so we could try to contact the owner. The next day he came in with a phone number, but of course, no one answered when we called. We tried all day and eventually just left a voicemail. A couple days later we considered having it towed, but we didn't want to do that to this car. Clearly, someone takes really good care of it. You would think he would check up at some point to make sure it's OK. It was odd that someone just left a car that nice at a gas station for a week without checking on it. The cop said it wasn't stolen or anything like that. 

Finally, after 8 days someone called. He claimed to be the father of the owner of the car. We told him he had until the next morning to pick it up or we're having it towed. He came in and explained that it belonged to his son, the CEO of a local hospital. The car started making weird noises, so his son parked it since he didn't want to do further damage if there was a major malfunction. His would have come back for it the next day, but he had to catch a flight to Hawaii for a 2 week vacation. 

Guy: ""Why can't my son just leave his car here? It's not doing any harm. He'll be back in a few days and he can get it then.""

Me: ""My manager wants it gone. This isn't a public parking lot or a storage lot. You can't leave a car here for that long.""

Guy: ""Why not? No one else was using this parking spot when my son parked it. It's our spot until we move it.""

Me: ""No, this is private property owned by Company Co. and you don't own any part of it.""

Guy: ""But the car isn't causing trouble.""

Me: ""Sir, it is a huge liability. If something happens to it then we have to deal with cops and your insurance company.""

Guy: ""Fine. How much to let us keep it here for a few more days."" *He pulls out a wad of $100 bills* ""One, two, three hundred?""

Me: ""This isn't up for negotiation. Corporate doesn't allow us to rent or sell property.""

Guy: ""You mean I have to waste my time and move this car because you won't let me keep it here? Fine. Where does your property end and I'll park it someone else.""

*I point out where our property ends* ""I'll warn you... those businesses will tow any cars left on their lots at the end of the night.""

Guy: ""You can't tell me what to do. You're lucky I don't pay your company to fire you.""

He moved his car about one foot off our property. Not surprisingly, the businesses next to us closes and has it towed. The guy called back 15 minutes after that and said, ""I'm coming back there. If you don't let me park my car there I'm prepared to sue. Is that really worth it to you?!""

Me: ""To late, the other business had it towed."" *click* I hang up. Never heard from him after that.

(Long post),dignam4live,632,86,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1a8zfz/horrible_exmanager_finally_gets_what_she_deserves/,"Hey guys, I currently work at a petrol station that is part of a large chain, I have worked for the company for almost two years. I started at a store close to where I live, but while working at this store my manager was just horrible. I'll call her Sue. Sue would constantly berate me while working, for the smallest mistakes. Mostly for no reason though. Nothing I did was good enough for her, and she was a complete control freak. She would put me down as well, she always asked if I did well in school, and if I had trouble concentrating. When I told her I did well, she said ""I don't believe you, you cannot even understand simple directions, you must have learning issues."" I was actually a decent worker, but for some reason, she hated me.

 If I was at the console keeping an eye on the forecourt, she would yell at me to stock. If it wasn't busy and I was stocking, she would yell at me for not paying attention to the forecourt. It was miserable working for her, not to mention she only gave me 3 hour shifts. The one good thing about working at the store was one of my co-workers, lets call him Steve. Steve was awesome. He was a middle-aged man who was just the nicest guy ever. Really funny and awesome to work with. Anyway, Sue just plain hated me, and was trying her best to get me fired. Eventually I fucked up and made a mistake, so she managed to get me to do a 'Performance Review"" with the Area Manager present. During this meeting, she had listed all the mistakes I made, (the majority of them were during my first week or two, learning the ropes.) She was also claimed I was lazy, never did my duties etc, which was all bullshit. I didn't really contest any of this, I knew I would get a strike on my record anyway. I did. Strike One, three strikes and you get fired. 

They have to give you three written warnings until they can fire you, thats company policy. Unless of course you do something really bad, like steal something from the store. So the next day after the meeting, Sue comes up to me and says ""If I could have fired you now, I would have. Since I can't, I'm going to cut your hours to zero."" So she cuts my hours, but this ends up being a blessing. I have a friend who works for the company at another store, and he gives my number to his manager so he can use me to cover shifts at his store. I cover some shifts for him, and he loves me. He loves that I am flexible and willing to work, and says I am a good worker. He gives my number to other stores, because I have zero hours at my home site, so I'm almost guaranteed to cover a shift. 

After a few weeks, I am working the maximum amount of hours I can work, I have to turn down at least 3-4 shifts a week because it will put me into overtime. I start covering a lot of shifts at the store I currently work at, and the manager loves me, so requests for me to be transfered. Sue, of course approves it, as she is no doubt glad to get rid of me. My manager has no problem with me, and thinks I'm a great worker. Go figure. I am finally free from her grasp, and I now work at a great store, with an awesome manager and co-workers. 

A few nights ago, I start talking to my old co-worker, Steve on Facebook. I haven't heard from him in months. He tells me Sue has been fired. She was fired for abusing customers, workplace bullying and sending abusive text messages to co-workers. Sweet, sweet justice has been served, even if it took almost a year.

I work a Front End Supervision position at a Big Box Discount Retailer (think TJMaxx, Ross, Marshalls, Home Goods) meaning I'm on register all day long and have to moderate breaks and lunches according to staffing and the line.

So its nearly Christmas and we've got a line weaved and wrapped around the store. We have eight registers with all eight people working them (and one register that is completely broken and cannot function). 

I'm running around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to find the schedule to do a break/lunch check so we don't fall behind on breaks. I figure at this point of everything being completely fucked anyway I may as well get people on their lunches and breaks regardless of the line because I can call any Non-Active Managers (meaning they aren't the lead manager at the time) to run empty registers. 

""Hey get on a goddamn register and help!!!""

I ignore the cries of the waiting customers as I have loads to do other than help impatient assholes.Like schedule checks, hanger runs, and return processing before our returns bins overflow and become safety hazards.

I tell T to go on break as she's over due.Same customer loses her shit.

""What now two of you are off... this is bullshit!!! where is your supervisor""

""Ma'am I am the supervisor. We are all trying hard to make sure this line moves quickly, but understand by law my employees need a break every two hours...""

""Its almost Christmas you should have scheduled more people!!!""

""Ma'am this is the maximum amount of people we can have on. I don't make the schedule or do payroll. Regardless we have only eight functioning registers and right now six are being run, My register and the girl who went on break aren't being run right now because I have other things to do to keep the store safe for everyone.""

""I don't care about safety, I have places to be! Also register nine isn't being run!!!""

""Register nine has to be replaced entirely before we can have anyone run it. The replacement won't come until January or February"" 

""WELL WHY WASN'T IT REPLACED SOONER!!!""

and then a customer who has finally had it with this ratty ass woman peeps up.

""Hey give her a break!!! This woman is running this entire Front End of the store, Three days before Christmas! You should expect long lines and longer waits.... its insane you'd think the lines wouldn't be hell, imagine being stuck up there all day dealing with people like you. In fact if you'd kindly shut the fuck up and let her do her job then the line would move faster...instead you are berating her and keeping her from doing her job so she can get back on register.""

THe woman went silent and I gave the guy a percent discount on one of his more expensive items under a customer service discount.

and two days ago under a similar stress level we had added to it all one register that couldn't do returns because the cashier had fucked up so many of them she had her power to do so revoked. So when the woman in line goes to the cashier who clearly called out ""Register Five is Open, not Returns"" she throws a hissy fit.

""The security guard said wait in line and any register can help me and you are now saying you CAN'T""

""Ma'am I can help you over here on my register for a return.""

Oh lord walk two whole inches to the next register.

""You are all goddamn hoodrats...this is why I don't come to the ghetto to shop.. you are all ignorant (in Utah this means rude) ghetto ass bitches who can't do their goddamn jobs right.""

I process the return with a smile apologising for being a hoodrat ghetto ass bitch. Give her her money and tell her to have a great day, all the while she mumbles about how fucking stupid I am. Then the next person some up, well within sight and earshot of the last customer.

""DAMN THAT WOMAN WAS A TOTAL CUNT!""

**WALL OF TEXT WARNING**

This is more of a rant than an actual story but I just had the absolute worst  night of work I've ever had. I work for [redacted.] I can have upwards of 10 duties in one shift. I've gotten used to it, but it can be overwhelming when there's a big rush and I've got 3 calls coming in. I'm very polite to my customers. I'm good at biting my tongue. This being said though, if you really piss me off, you can see it in my face. Once you go too far, I can't help it. However, this is extreme. Not regular bitchy customers, you really have to try to make me this mad. Tonight, I had one of these customers. We'll call her Jill. I have a line of about 6 people, Jill being the last customer in line. Here is how my night quickly went to shit.

I'm checking out the first person in line when I hear some grumbling and moaning. I look up to see Jill sighing and visibly upset. At this point, I'm not thinking she's angry, she seems genuinely troubled by something.

Me: Ma'am, are you okay?

Jill: I'm so SICK of being ignored.

Me: I'm sorry, I don't understand.

Jill: YOU. You're just up there ignoring me. Like I'm not even here.

Me: I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm not trying to ignore you. I'm trying to get this line down so I can get everyone through as quickly as possible. Is there something you needed help with?..

Jill: Yes.

Me: Not a problem, what can I do for you?

Jill: Well you can check me out. 

Me: I will be with you as soon as it is your turn. Register 1 and 2 are also open right now, so if they finish before I do, you'll be asked to go over there. 

Jill: but I only have ONE ITEM.

Me: I'm sorry, but the line is first come first serve, not how many items you have.

Jill: and how is that system working out for you?
(Right now I'm wondering what other system she's ever seen used)

Me: we'll be with you as soon as possible, ma'am.

Jill: I ONLY HAVE ONE THING!
(I smile at her and nod and I'm now checking out the person in front of her, meaning she's next)

Me: Alright, ma'am, sorry about the wait. 

Jill: whatever. I need ""fifteeh"" on this gift card.

Me: was that fifteen or fifty, ma'am? (I always ask to confirm, but this time I really couldn't tell what she had said)

Jill: fifTEEN, obviously! Do I LOOK like I could afford fifty?

Me: Sorry, ma'am, just confirming.
(what I'm really thinking is, HOW THE FUCK SHOULD I KNOW?! and had i assumed you couldn't afford it, you would have flipped your shit on me)

Jill: are we done here yet? 

Me: Not yet ma'am, that'll be fifteen dollars.

Jill: I already paid.

Me: I'm sorry, but the screen still says to swipe your card. It must have not gone through. 

Jill: What card? I'm getting a gift card!

Me: Yes, you said 15 dollars right?

Jill: OH MY GOD YES. 

Me: Alright, then that brings your total to 15 dollars.

Jill: I ALREADY PAID!

Me: Again, it says the swipe didn't go through. Could you swipe again please? You'll only be charged once, don't worry.

(She reaches for the gift card and slides it through the credit card machine)

Me: sorry ma'am, I meant you need to swipe your debit or credit card again, or you can pay cash.

Jill: why can't I use the gift card?

Me: You're purchasing the gift card. You need to pay cash or debit/credit for it. 

Jill: UGH. that is so DUMB.

(I apologize, even though I'm not sure how paying for a gift card with the gift card accomplishes anything.)

Me: Okay, ma'am. Here's your receipt with the activation record for your gift card. Bye now! 

Jill: Aren't you going to offer me a bag?

Me: I'm sorry. I don't usually get bag requests for gift cards, but no problem! This is the smallest size we have, will this do?

Jill: You want me to waste THAT much plastic for THIS?
(waves gift card in my face.)

(keep in mind, the smallest bag we have is the size of a regular grocery bag size. and i have no fucking clue why she needs a bag for a gift card. It's already in the little envelope)

Me: Sorry, but that's the smallest size we carry.

Jill: You need smaller bags.

Me: sorry about that, is there anything else I can do for you?

Jill: No. Bye.

Me: Bye! (with a smile).

my manager had been behind me for about 30 seconds to put some more cash in my drawer and heard all the trouble so he smiled at the lady and said ""have a good night""

Jill: Thank you for saying that because I clearly wasn't going to get that from this bitch (points at me)

I freeze. I don't think I even said anything. I was so shocked at what she said. I had been as nice as I could be given the circumstances. This lasted at least 8 minutes or so. I was just so appalled that she could say that. I had tried everything I could to make her experience a positive one. I've been told by many customers that I am excellent at customer service. People remember me, and thank me all the time. I've stayed after hours to help people to their cars and help them find things and I'm happier than any other coworker I have. Jill turned and left. 

I think this is over as she leaves and try to recuperate to help the next customer. After that everything is fine and everyone that was behind her tries to comfort me but I'm really close to tears. I tell everyone to have a good night and then I get ready to take my break because I really need to calm down and get over what just happened.
I take five minutes, have some water and just breathe. I splash my face with cold water to start fresh again. I walk back out with confidence determined to be happy with the rest of the customers.

Lo and behold, I get to my register and Jill walks in.

Jill: I just wanted to let you know that you're horrible at what you do. You need to quit your job because customer service is NOT for you.

Me: I'm sorry but I don't know what more I can do for you.
(I'm really considering calling for back up because I'm not sure I can be near this woman much longer without breaking down)

Jill: It's not about me, I'm trying to help you. You should find another job. You're shitty at this one.
(Normally I can ignore stupid comments, but I felt so harassed and it came out of nowhere.)

Me: Ma'am, I'm sorry for anything I did to you but you're really hurting my feelings right now. If there's nothing else you need from me, I'd appreciate it if you left the store for tonight.

Jill: You shouldn't say things like that. You don't know what I'm going through that is making me act this way!

(wtf? nothing is making you act this way.)

(I'm not crying, but I'm sure my eyes are red and my nose is a bit tingly.)

Jill: Oh man up! Jesus, you really aren't built for this job. 

I'm a woman, young, and no. If that's what my job requires, I'm not even close to being suited for it. 

I told her to have a nice night and that I hoped whatever was going wrong in her life worked out for the best. Then I clocked out and got in trouble by my manager for ""telling a customer how you feel"".

My boyfriend picked me up. I got home, got in the shower and cried my eyes out. I'm good now but goddamn people can be evil. Btw, Jill was about 45.

1374443455.0,541,self.TalesFromRetail,1irt5f,It was either laugh or cry.,I_try_hardish,639,98,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1irt5f/it_was_either_laugh_or_cry/,"I told this story to my buddy yesterday and he said it belonged here...

So I'm a 24 year old white female working at a gas station which is pretty rare around here so I pretty much hear lewd and suggestive comments every day, but this was a first for me.

I work morning shifts alone on the weekends. I'm the assistant manager so during the week I either have one or two people with me so it would figure that this would happen on a Saturday. It was sometime in the afternoon between 12 and 3 when a male and a female walk into my store. It's in the middle of Satan's butthole hot July right now so the first thing I notice when the guy walks in is his long coat. Not a trench coat, just long. I didn't really pay them any mind since I was in the middle of helping a couple of other customers at the moment. I did happen to glance at the car they had just come from and noticed three other guys in the car, all white and around mid to late 20's. They were simply pumping gas so I ignore them too.

So this guy is shuffling around picking up random shit to look at while his counter-part walks to the bathroom in the back. A woman and her son walk in to pay for some gas really quickly so I handle that while still pretty much not paying attention to the guy even though something looked kind of off about him. I check out the mother and she and her kid exits the store, leaving the place empty except for me, coat man, and the girl who must obviously be having some issues because she still hasn't come back out of the bathroom.

I finally shift my attention to coat man and ask him if he needs help or is looking for something specific. He mumbles something I can't hear so I lean forward and ask him to kindly speak up. He says ""yeah...I need some fresh air."" Then he kind of awkward jump/hops to directly in front of me and flings his jacket wide open. This is when I realize what looked so weird about him. He was wearing a long coat but I could still see his bare legs. It just looked awkward.

So there he stands in front of me in his birthday suit with his little noodle still flopping around in a semi circle from his little hop. So I stand there and stare in shock for a solid three seconds and take in this dudes small frame with tiny little milk dud looking nipples and teeny little tootsie roll tinkie-winkie. Then with a force that was physically painful, I burst out laughing.

Now when I say burst, I don't mean I brayed loudly. No. I'm talking about pure, raw, laugh diarrhea that was so forceful that spittle flew out of my mouth. To make it worse for him, I covered my mouth and pointed at him. It was laughter so hard that noise stopped coming out of me and Niagara Falls started streaming from my eyeballs. A look of hurt-shock flashes across his face and a dark crimson color starts setting in. By this time it was too late for me, I couldn't stop myself. Finally the noise caught up with my laughter and I just threw my head back and hee-hawed until I was pretty sure I was going to be sick. 

Hearing all of the commotion, the girl busts out of the bathroom, takes in the situation, and then takes up my laughter with me. By this time the guy is clutching his coat around his body like a nervous first time lover. Through a wave of tears, I see the other passengers outside laughing and bouncing around so much while pointing at us that the whole car is rocking back and forth.

The dude spins around to make a quick get-away and runs face first into the glass door. The girl comes to his rescue and helps his out of the store in a half jog to their car. On the way there he stumbles over the curb. He catches his balance but the back of his jacket flew up exposing his bare white ass. I lost it.

At this point I'm pretty sure my laugh sounds diseased because my vocals were so scratchy and I couldn't catch my breath. I'm pretty sure the guy was crying as I caught one last glimpse of his face during their hurried retreat. It took me a long time to regain my composure. It didn't help that everyone that came in for the next hour asked me if I was ok since my face was all puffed up and my eyes were completely bloodshot. I would tell them what happened and we would have a good laugh together. In pretty sure I lost 5 pounds by the end of the day.

On this particular night, I was the only one working the front register, for the first time. I wasn't at the pharmacy, just the cash register, for people who only needed milk or chips orwhatever. We only had two registers anyway, but there was no one else helping me out today and my manager was in the back working on something. It was a slow night, so I didn't mind, until in walked the largest man I've ever seen in my life.

He was probably five hundred pounds, in a tight white t-shirt that had numerous sweat-stains and what looked like barbeque sauce smeared across his expansive belly. Also, he had on extremely short denim cutoff shorts. Yuck.

He came through the doors, saw me standing alone at the register, grinned, and walked right over to me. 

""Hi, is this a pharmacy?"" he asked.

I pointed to the sign over my head, which read, 'PHARMACY IN BACK,' and said, ""Yes, we have a pharmacy; it's in the back."" Our store wasn't very big; I could see the pharmacy from the front counter, about a hundred feet away, tops. If he had just turned around, he would have seen it. He didn't even look up at the sign, let alone turn around to see the pharmacy.

He said, ""That's great thank you, so do you guys like, do tests on pills or something? To see what kind of pill it is?""

That's a question I hadn't yet come across. It was my first night alone, and my impulse was to pick up the phone to ask the pharmacy, but I decided, I could *do* this. I am a *retail employee.*

I said: ""I don't believe that's something we do here. We do have a pharmacist in the back who can definitely talk to you about that, but I imagine you'd have to send it to a lab or something to get tested?""

He said: ""OK because, you know the Internet? Well, I bought ten dozen packs of cheap Viagra, but I'm afraid to take one because what if it's not Viagra, you know? So what do you think I should do?""

I stammered something like: ""Well, you could just take one, and, um, see if things... well...""

He didn't even seem to be listening to my response, just grinned and thanked me for my answer, and then said, without breathing, ""OK I have another question my friend told me about I read online I heard something about... Vibrating condoms. Do those exist? Where can I get one?""

Trying to keep a neutral face, I said, ""We actually sell them here. Not quite vibrating condoms, but condoms that come with a vibrating ring. They're on the condom rack, back by the pharmacy."" Again, I pointed to the sign above my head.

""So how are those?"" he asked.

""Sorry?""

""How are those? Do the ladies like them? You seem like quite the stud, have you tried them out?""

Now, not only was I a painfully virginal 15 year old, I'm also gay, so asking me about ""the ladies"" would not really get you a good answer even now.

I said something like, ""I haven't gotten the chance to try them out yet,"" and reminded him that they were on the rack in the back.

He waddled down the center of the store toward the pharmacy, looking back at me as he walked. When he reached the condom rack, he stopped and looked back. I nodded. He looked at the rack for half a second, looked back at me, and shrugged comically. I tried to motion that they were on the bottom of the rack, but he just shrugged again, and then waved me to come back.

Like I said, the store was very small, and there was no one else there. I figured, what the hell, locked my register, and walked back to him.

I bent down and picked up the two boxed varieties we had and handed him one of each. 

He asked: ""What's the difference?""

I said: ""One is Durex, one is Trojan.""

He said: ""OK, what's the difference? Describe them to me?""

Painfully virginal, gay, and also, naive. But at this point, I realized that he wasn't actually just shopping for vibrating condoms, he was ""enjoying"" having me help him pick them out.

I read off the basic description on the front of the box, which was identical across both brands -- ""Three lubricated condoms  plus one vibrating ring.""

""Which one should I get?"" he asked. ""I'll trust you.""

I handed him the more expensive box.

""Excellent,"" he said, and followed me back up to the register.

I quickly rang the box up and told him his total, but he made no move to pay me.

""So, how do these work?"" he asked.

""Um, it's a condom, plus a vibrating ring,"" I answered.

""OK, but like, how do I use it?""

I picked up the box to read the instructions on the back, to see if there was anything there that I could use so this didn't need to get any more awkward, but the directions were full of phrases like ""base of the penis,"" which I definintely was not interested in saying.

So that's when I said, ""Sir, I'm not going to demonstrate the use of a condom for you."" I reiterated his total, and, slightly chagrined, he paid me.

As he was leaving, he said, ""Maybe these will finally get her off that goddamned pill! How long will you be here? Are you still going to be here in twenty minutes or so? I'll come back and let you know how it went!""

I told him I was actually leaving for the day immediately (even though I still had hours upon hours left), and to have a nice day. I never saw him again.

The second the door whooshed shut behind him, my phone rang. It was the pharmacist. "" *Did that man just have you pick out condoms for him?!* ""

""Oh girl,"" I said, ""You have no idea...""

I've been lurking here for a while and thought it was time to share some of my stories too.
I recently worked as a sales floor associate in a department store, and although we were responsible for multiple departments, I was often in the toy section. Back around Christmas time, we were swamped with calls from parents asking if we still had certain toys in stock, etc. Most were pretty ordinary, but this one conversation still stands out in my mind. 
I picked up an external call with an older lady on the other end.
""Hi, this is ""Department Store"", how may I help you?""

""Hello, I was hoping you could help me with a present for my granddaughter. Her mother told me she's been wanting a dollhouse, could you tell me what kinds of dollhouses you have available, and what the prices are?""

""Sure, just let me take a look...Well, we have a Loving Family dollhouse, which is about $70, Barbie dollhouse for $100..."" She wants to know what they look like and what they all include, and I describe them to her. 

""Yes, they sound like what she would like...So there's lots of space for her to get in and move around and everything?""

For a moment I'm confused. ""I'm sorry Ma'am... do you mean space for your...granddaughter to get inside the dollhouse?""

""Well, yes, I just want to make sure it'll be big enough for a girl her age, that there's enough room.""

I pause for a moment. ""Ma'am, are you maybe looking for some kind of playhouse for your granddaughter? We have some larger houses for children to play inside, but these are just dollhouses I've been describing..."".

""No, a dollhouse, that's what she wants."" She sounds impatient by now. ""Are these ones not big enough for a 4 year old?""

I realize this woman really doesn't understand the concept of what a dollhouse is. ""Well, this is designed for ages 3+, but Ma'am, dollhouses aren't made for children to play inside. The house is just proportionate to the size of the dolls, the little rooms and furniture and everything are just doll-sized...""

""Well, that's awful expensive if she can't even get in!"" She says angrily.

""Again, we do have playhouses that would be big enough for her to play inside...""

""No, no, her mother said she wants a dollhouse. I don't know. I never had one...Did you?""

""Um...yeah...""

""And you couldn't play in it?""

""Well, no, but I had lots of fun just playing with my dolls in it...""

She grunts. ""Well, maybe they'll have what I'm looking for at Toys R Us...""  *Hangs up*

TL:DR: Lady calls store looking for dollhouse for granddaughter. Gets mad because they aren't big enough for her granddaughter to fit inside.

I work for a small convenience/drug store. Our store is located near the local school for the blind so we regularly have visually impaired customers in our store that we assist.

It was the middle of allergy season and I was working the front register. I have terrible allergies and I get unreasonably sick at least twice a year from them. My throat was sore and my voice raspy at the beginning of my shift, but as the day wore on it worsened. After 5 hours into my shift my voice had gone from raspy, to squeaky, to non-existent. It was extremely difficult for me to even make the most basic of sounds. Not wanting to lose any of my hours for the week, I pushed through and made a sign that I taped to the counter saying something along the lines of, ""I have lost my voice, I will communicate as best I can. Sorry for the inconvenience."" This was working pretty well for most of the customers, most apologizing and telling me they hoped that I get better soon. Everything was running smoothly with no real problems until one of our blind customers comes in.

He was a semi-regular customer who also has Aspergers. It was getting late in the evening and business had died down, I was completely alone at the front of the store. He comes up to my counter and starts screaming ""HELLO!"" as loudly as he possibly can. I try to speak but nothing comes out. He keeps screaming ""HELLO! IS ANYONE THERE?!"" I wind up banging my hands on the counter to let him know I'm there but my ability to communicate stops after that. I push one of our alert buttons at the front register to try and signal my coworkers but no one responds. I'm at a loss for what to do until another customer gets in line behind the blind the customer.

He notices something is off about our interaction seeing as the blind the customer is still standing there screaming ""HELLO! I NEED SOMEONE TO HELP ME!"". So I motion to the customer behind him in line to read the sign taped to my counter. He reads the sign, stops himself from giggling, and tells the blind customer that I am there but that I have lost my voice. The blind customer then starts to apologize profusely and then starts listing off a couple of items he wanted. I run to grab them then come back to ring him up. This was also an ordeal because this customer always wants to run the card himself but since it is a touch screen, he can't read the responses or feel the buttons. The customer behind him (who was very patient) had to help me guide him through the payment options. He left shortly after still apologizing profusely. My manager came to the front at the tail end of this transaction. He sent me home shortly after.

Definitely my most sitcom worthy story.

TL;DR: Blind customer comes into my store while I have lost my voice. Hilarity ensues.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1fo28a,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1fo28a/the_mute_leading_the_blind/,

They are both in a mall (a toy store and a candy store cause I love children and not in a creepy way) I feel like working in this line of business makes you bitter towards people in general. However  makes you cherish the truly humble and amazing people that exist in this rotten society. 

I had a guy roll up to my register in a wheel chair at the candy store. We have higher shelves for more expensive candy so kids can't stick their hands in it. He tells me he is making little gift jars for some of his coworkers. He bought a few jars from a dollar store and wanted to fill one with gummy pigs and jelly beans to call it ""pork and beans"" which I found this to be hilarious. He shamefully said he might need help as he had a recent stroke and sometimes his hands don't function and he didn't want to spill anything.  I instantly told him anything he needed help with I would be more than glad to. As I was filling his jars he started talking about anything and everything. He told me of bars I should visit, told me of his past jobs, surgeries, then he went into a bit of detail on why he was missing a leg.  He said he stepped on a nail while helpping someone carry something in his store but was not on the clock. He then contracted a flesh eating bacteria that would eventually take his left leg,  right foot,  and his right eye.  (he said the doctor did a great job with his eye and that's no lie.  I couldn't tell the difference) he said he hated life at that point and had attempted suicide a few times but one day he decided ""why the fuck am I so angry about?  I'm still alive so who cares about that other stuff""  I thought wow this guy has absolutely nothing going for him yet he is still such a positive person.  I finally finished filling his jars and when I rang it up I knocked off like $5 cause I enjoyed his company. It cost him a little over $20 and he paid with $25 and told me to keep the change. I humbly declined and he said it's not up to you.  Cause if you try to hand me that money it's gonna look like you are taking money from a handicapped dude. ""it will barely get you a gallon of gas,  heck if i was you I'd check the ground for some change and go get that $5 deal for Arby's,  damn roast beef is so good"",  I laughed for like 5 min on that comment.  We then talked about the new dead island and bioshock (side note he is around 60 years old).  It really makes these jobs worth working when someone comes along and shakes up your life with such a positive impact.  I didn't even get his name.

One day the drain of the grocery cooler got clogged (one of those open coolers without any doors that hold 12 packs and 6 packs).  My GM sent one of the stock guys to the hardware store to get 2 huge jugs of industrial strength drain cleaner containing HCl.  

After pouring both jugs into the drain to no avail, the GM then decided to try another cleaning product.  I'm sure most of you are already thinking to yourselves ""there's no way he could be so stupid as to mix bleach with one of the strongest acids available for public sale.  It's common sense to not mix random cleaning products together.  And it even says right on the bottle in very large letters DO NOT MIX THIS PRODUCT WITH ANY OTHER CHEMICAL, ESPECIALLY BLEACH, this is literally the first line of the warning label.""

So, I walk into the store at the beginning of my shift and the entire store is filled with a noxious chemical gas.  My eyes immediately start to water and I can feel it burning in my lungs.  I ask my boss what the hell happened, the GM points to the handy man and says it was his fault, the handy man points back at GM and says it was all his idea. 

Not only did the GM mix HCl and bleach together (line 1 of the warning label).  He then poured hot water into the drain as well (line 2 of the warning label), which created steam and enabled the Chlorine gas to spread throughout the store faster.

In way of apology, he ended up giving everyone who worked that day a $50 bottle of Scotch and some other random bottles of beer and liquor.  

edit: bluerose2 pointed out that it's redundant to say HCl and I exaggerated by saying the cleaner was straight HCl

We had been robbed for a lot of cash that morning (about 60-70k dollars). The people working at the time of the robbery were pretty much in shock, the execs came there and we all talked about it.

My job is sort of an operations supervisor.  I supervise the booth attendants who are on the front line selling the parking tickets to customers as they enter the ramps, I dispense and track all of the money coming in and out, I coordinate with security and dispatchers to ensure things are running smoothly, and I fix any and all machinery that breaks down.

Tonight there was an event that brought in 15,000+ people.  In addition there were several smaller events, plus your typical Saturday night bar crowd types.  Nearly every ramp we have was completely full.  Tonight was probably in the top five busiest nights in all of my time working there.  Despite that, the night went relatively smoothly until the end.  Most people were orderly and not causing massive traffic backups, there were only minor issues with the machinery, and even the least competent of my employees were keeping their heads together and doing their jobs well.

Then the big event let out.  15,000 people were trying to leave the parking ramps all at the same time.  Inevitably, there are backups in the ramps, and it can take a long time for people to get out.  In this case it was about an hour, which is actually pretty extraordinary for an event of this type.  To put that in perspective, there was an event about half the size last night and it took over two hours for everyone to get out of the ramps.

Security and booth attendants are stationed at all of the ramps to help customers exit.  It may seem like exiting a parking ramp should not be a complicated thing, but thousands of drunken people who are all pumped up from the event that they just left make it very complicated.  

Most people are very excited about the event they just attended and they are happy and joyful and funny (and quite drunk).  Some people are very, very pissed off about how long they had to wait in the ramp to exit.  Most of the pissed off people just make some snide comments about how poorly we are running things, and I just smile at them and tell them to drive safely.  A few people take things to the extreme.

The ramp I was in has two exits on opposite sides.  I had a security officer at the top end directing traffic to each exit.  I was assisting at one exit, and a booth attendant was assisting at the other.  There was one gentleman in particular who drove me to post this tonight.  I have dealt with all sorts of unreasonably angry people during my time at this job, but never have I experienced anyone like this before.

Near the end of the line is this person who is reaching the security officer who is directing traffic.  He is so drunk and angry about waiting that he is visibly shaking.  Even from my spot 20 yards away I can see how worked up he is.  He stops his car, gets out (he is now blocking everyone behind him from exiting), walks up to my security officer, and begins screaming in his face.  He is losing his mind so thoroughly that spit is flying from his mouth as he yells.  I see my security officer about to lose his patience with the guy, so I rushed up to try and diffuse the situation.

When I get to them I ask what the problem is.  The guy yells, ""I'll tell you what the fucking problem is you fucking bitch!"" and cold cocks me right in the face.  He seriously just punches me across the mouth.  Before today I'd never been punched in the face, and I have to tell you that it really, really hurts.

I fell to the ground, dazed, and the security officer jumps on the guy's back to keep him from further attacking me, all while calling for other security to back us up and for a dispatcher to call the police.  The rest of it is rather fuzzy for me as I'm sort of small, and not exactly used to being punched in the face, but the two of them scuffle for a while until the cops show up.  They arrested the guy, and I went off to the hospital.  Nothing in my face is broken, just good and bruised up.  I am also on some pretty fun painkillers.  I told the police that I would in fact like to press charges, and the man is sitting in a jail cell right now as I type this.

I have won customer service awards in multiple retail companies. I have been working retail for 4 years, in both sales and management. 

I have worked at 3 different retail companies, but for privacy sakes I won't say their names. Suffice it to say, one was a convenience store, one was a popular electronic retail chain, and the other (where I currently work) is a cell phone store. This event happened a few months ago.

So I'm working in the cell phone store one day (let's call it a Saturday) and it's just me and the new guy. The New Guy knows what he has to do, but doesn't have much experience, so I'm there until 1 hour before we close so the new guy can have closing experience, but with me there in case it gets busy before closing, or the new guy needs help with something. So I bought my ticket for The Evil Dead for an hour after I got off (time to get to the theater, concessions, etc).

Mid-day, 4 hours before I'm supposed to leave, an old woman walks in with a stack of papers. And when I say old, I mean she has a driver/nurse/care giver walking with her (this woman was in her 80s, the nurse looked to be 40s-50s). She has a flip phone, and tells me she wants a smart phone in case she ever gets lost for GPS reasons. The nurse/caregiver/whatever only spoke...well I'm not sure what it was but neither me nor the new guy spoke it. The old woman was Asian, so perhaps it was an Asian language, all I know is that it wasn't English or Spanish.

Anyways, before I can get a word in on usual pitches, she lists a bunch of phones she wants to try. This is where happy normal ends. At each cell phone she asks to try out, she asks to hold it, then asks me to do something on the phone (whether it's to check email, GPS, weather, etc). It would go something like this:

Old Crabby: Can you show me how to launch the weather?

Me: Ok (pushes the weather app icon for her)

Old Crabby smacks my hand

Old Crabby: Let me do it!!!

Yes. She told me to do it for her, then slapped and yelled at me for me doing it. But hey, we make commission in my store, so whatever as long as I get a sale. This went on for about an hour, trying out every single phone in the store. Eventually, she settled on the Galaxy Note because of it's big screen and her vision issues. Then I see her go through her paperwork, and bring out dozens of flyers. As I look, I see that even though there are dozens of flyers, there are multiples. There were only two kinds of flyers in there:

1. The flyer for the competitor, placing the phone at half price than normal
2. A flyer for out store, again showing the Note, for a sale price that's $50 higher than the 1st flyer showed.

She then demands that I give her the sale price of the other store. Now I notice this flyer is for the company I worked for before where I work now (I really don't want to say names, but like I said, this company is a very popular nation wide electronics store). I also realize what kind of sale this is. They'll advertise a great price for the week, and only have 4 units or so per store. So I mention this to her, she accuses me of being a liar, then demands I call their stores and ask for their inventory information. I'm a little ticked off at this point, mostly as she wasted my hour (she knew what phone she wanted) and I just wanted to say ""Well go to their store and leave me alone"". However, I'm management, so I decided to be polite, diplomatic, and take it like a weak new guy in a prison shower. 

I call up every store they have in a 50 mile radius of our store AND this woman's apartment, and everyone is sold out. So she decides to buy it from me (finally, something good out of this).

It takes half an hour to run her credit as she didn't trust me with her social security number, mailing address (although she wanted me to setup her billing too), and...the phone number she wants on her phone. So whatever, I had her call customer service to setup her account over the store phone (because apparently saying it all out loud with me next to her was safer). She gets approved, I go to setup her phone, and at this point she's been in the store a good two hours. 

Old Crabby: You should give me the competitor sale price, that's what you're supposed to do!

Me: I'm sorry miss, but our sale is the only price I can give you.

Old Crabby: But you've kept me here for two hours already! What about customer satisfaction (yes, this is what she said).

Me: I'm sorry miss. But if you want this phone today, the price will be (and I told her the exact price with sales tax).

Old Crabby: Oh fine.

So I setup her phone, get her number sent over, and transfer the pictures and contacts from her old flip phone to her new one. 

Old Crabby: I need you to show me how to use this phone!

So remember earlier she would hold up the display and make me explain every feature while hitting me? Yeah, there was another hour of that.

By the time I was done explaining the phone, she yelled at me for keeping here there 5 hours (yes, she blamed me for everything, and no it hadn't even been 5 hours) and demanded to file a complaint with my manager. That's when I pulled off my name badge, and handed it to her so she could look closely and see the ""Manager"" title.

She said she had to use the bathroom, and walked away, leaving her new phone on the counter. The new guy, who watched the whole thing in stunned silence, looked at me and said ""You know we closed thirty minutes ago, right?""

Yup. Not only was I stuck at work a good 90 minutes past when I should've, but my movie started thirty minutes ago. She comes out of the bathroom, makes me reexplain a few basics, then leads while cursing me. We closed as quickly as we could, and I ended up locking up the store right around the time the movie ended. Luckily AMC agreed to exchange my ticket for a later showing so I could still see my movie.

A few days later, it turned out she was the 1 out of every 100 customers who gets a survey call. She gave me the lowest possible rating because ""he didn't give me the price OTHER STORE NAME was selling the phone for"", as well as other things about how I kept her there, didn't setup her phone, etc. The new employee backed up my store exactly, and my boss, (yes, I am a store manager, this guy runs all the stores in the area), looked at me. Now, this is a nice guy. He doesn't curse, he doesn't say derogatory names, and he's very peaceful, and respectful. He looked at me and said ""Damn, how did you resist hitting this bitch?""

The holiday season in particular seems to bring out all kids of trolls, goblins and miscreants. 

It's relatively early in the morning midweek, and at this point it's uncommon to have any customers, let alone ones causing a fuss. So, my manager and I are sitting around the cash register area making minor chit-chat. He's talking about his day off, I'm leaning up against the counter texting and scanning for customers. 

A rather portly man (Who shall be named Mr. Dursley for the purpose of this story, and for the uncanny resemblance and remarkably similar speech pattern.) suddenly charges into the store, bumping into tables and displays the whole way. 

**Me:** Hello sir, is there anything I can he-

**Mr. Dursley:** WHERE IS YOUR MANAGER?!

**Me:** Evan, this gentleman needs your help.

Evan, who is by far the most beta person I've ever met in my life, hops out from behind a table and makes his way to the register. I stand behind him pretending to fill out some of his paperwork because lord knows he's going to need my help. (And I also wanted to watch the shit inevitably hit the fan.)

**Evan:** ..How may I help you?

**Mr. Dursley:** I NEED TO RETURN MY WIFE'S SHIRT.

*He proceeds to pull out a shirt from a store bag that's many seasons old, the shirt has clearly been worn, has no tags, faded fabric and has a near perfectly circular hole in it.*

**Evan:** Okay, sure, do you have a recei-

**Mr. Dursley:** WHY IN THE BLOODY BLAZES WOULD I HAVE A RECEIPT?  

**Evan:** Well, it's just that, the shirt has no tags, a receipt would make it easier to return...but that's okay, we can always-

**Mr. Dursley:** I SAID I WANTED TO MAKE A GOD DAMN RETURN!

**Evan:** Yes, okay, I'll just need to see your driver's lice-

**Mr. Dursley:** WHY DO YOU NEED THAT?! YOUR PEOPLE DAMAGED MY SHIRT, YOU SHOULD TAKE IT BACK BUT INSTEAD YOU'RE HASSLING ME OVER THIS AND THAT!!! HARRRRIBLE SERVICE YOU KIDS HAVE HERE, HARRIBLE!!!

**Me:** Sir, may I take the shirt to the back to check our inventory? We might be able to switch it out for you.

Mr. Dursley finally shuts the hell up long enough to contemplatively hand me the shirt. I grab Evan and pull him and the shirt into the stockroom with me.

**Me:** Evan, I have this shirt. It's from like two holiday seasons ago. It's obviously not going to be back here. You need to tell him you can't accept the shirt. It's damaged, has no tags, smells like garbage and I'm pretty sure this hole is a cigarette burn. He has no receipt, there's no tag, we don't even know how much this thing cost him. How pissed is Jason (District Manager) going to be when they realized you were on the register when this got returned?

**Evan:** Oh...okay. I guess you're right.

We head back to the register where Mr. Dursley is forcing his 300+ pounds onto the counter and sneering. Evan and I exchange looks, he's clearly expecting me to handle it. 

**Me:** We didn't find your shirt anywhere in the back, but I was't really surprised. I don't recognize it from this season.

**Mr. Dursley:** (*Who is turning bright red in the face*) THEN JUST GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!!!! I WASN'T SPEAKING TO YOU ANYWAY. 

**Me:** Evan will tell you the same thing. We can't return this, it's company policy. The item is damaged, we don't know how. If you at least had the tag or perhaps a receipt, we might have been able to process the return and damage it out. At this point, we don't know how much you paid for the item. If we just took money out of the register and gave it to you, we'd both be fired for embezzling money. 

**Mr. Dursley:** YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT BEFORE YOUR INCOMPETENT FOOL WORKERS DAMAGED MY SHIRT.

**Me:** We can't determine that's what happened sir, sorry, there's nothing we can do. 

**Mr. Dursley:** ARE YOU IMPLYING THAT I OR MY WIFE DAMAGED THE SHIRT?! YOU HAD BETTER NOT BE, I'LL CALL YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE HOTLINE. 

**Me:** Sir, I'm not implying anything. I'm just saying as the situation stands, we don't know what happened. There's nothing we can do. I don't make the rules, corporate does. We have to protect our assets. 

*I pull out a card and write down the hotline number.*

**Me:** You're certainly welcome to give them a call.

*Mr. Dursley snatches his shirt off the table.*

**Mr. Dursley:** THAT'S GOING TO BE THE LAST TIME I EVER SHOP HERE. BUNCH OF FUCKING MORONIC KIDS RUNNING THE PLACES. SO MUCH FOR A LITTLE GOD DAMN CUSTOMER SERVICE.

Not all reps service that chain so not all reps need to be drug tested.

There was an opening for a service rep in one of his stores, so he called one of his other reps and asked if she would be interested in taking on assignments for the drug test store. She said. ""Oh, I can't do that, I smoke pot."" His jaw hit the floor and he laughingly said, ""I'm sorry, I'm going to say I didn't hear that. "" She replies, ""I SAID I CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE I SMOKE POT!""

This guy had 3 big bins of cds to sell me. I told him it would be a while and he could look around the store as I checked in his items for the condition, how much we're paying, and how many we have in stock.  One thing we hate the most, which he did, is when people lurk right at the register and pester us with every item, ""How much is this? How much is that?""  To make matters worse was that he was on his phone talking loud enough for the whole store to hear him cursing and carrying on.

After half an hour or so I finally got done with everything and could only buy about 15 cds out of 200 and offer him 9 dollars or so. Almost everything he had to sell us looked like he ate his dinner off of.  Scratches, soda spills, hair, and what looked like an actual bite into a disc.  I tell him the breakdown of what I can take and what I can't along with the money he would be receiving.  Of course he was upset and put up a fight over what albums I passed on and what I was paying for the ones I was taking.
""Why aren't you taking this? This is a great album"" (then why are YOU selling it if it's so great?)
""I'm only getting a dollar for this? Can't you make it three dollars instead?"" (I can't go any higher, I can totally go lower if you'd like)

He settles down and I ask him for an Driver's license or state ID as is required to sell at our store in case anything comes up stolen.  We go through the transaction as he signs his paper he is muttering all these offensive things to himself about myself and the store.  I tell him to have a nice day as he snatches his money and bins and hurries down the stairs and out the door.

A customer comes up a while later saying there are a bunch of cds outside in the parking lot.  I knew it had to be that same customer from earlier.  Yep, all his cds were scattered in our lot in the rain.  He's pulled this exact same stunt 5 other times he has come in throughout the year and we were getting tired of picking up and throwing out his garbage.  So I collected all his cds and bring them inside before I pull up his ID on the computer and take down his address.  After work, I loaded his bins in my car and picked up my friend, then drove to his house.  I had my buddy check to see if he was home since he knew my face and got no answer when he rang the bell a couple of times.  We threw his cds all over his lawn and left the bins on his front step. He hadn't come back to your store since then.

This was by far the worst customer I'd ever had in my 7yrs of retail.
An older gentleman came in and wanted to return a tablet he bought for his 18yr old son. I checked it out to make sure it was in working order. It was. (RQ. This particular chain was unable to put your money back onto your debit card if that's how you paid. It would ALWAYS come back as cash, don't know why the system wasn't setup to put the money back onto your card, it just wasn't).
So I grab his $219.99 out of the till and reach out to hand it to him.

Him- No I want it back on my card.

Me- I'm sorry sir our system isn't setup to put it back onto your debit. It has to be in cash, or a gift card if you'd like to purchase something else.

Him- No. I want it back on my card (he reaches out,grabs my hand and puts his card in it)

Me ....Sir. I can NOT put it back on your card. It was to be cash.

By this point we're both starting to get irate and my co workers and other customers are starting to take notice, including my 8.5mo pregnant supervisor who is 2hours away from going on maternity leave.

Him- This is ridiculous! I shop here all the fucking time! The money IS GOING back on my card!&lt;br&gt;

Me- No it's not! It's coming back in cash!

Him - I'm going to call the police and report you!

Me - Sir just take the cash. You have a branch for ""bankname"" across the street. You can deposit it there.

Him - No! I'm calling the police on you and you'll be arrested!

Me - Fine! My name is ""myname"" and please feel free to call them down here
*At that time I had returned his money to the till and slammed it shut. That's also the time my supervisor came over*

Her - Sir please put away your phone. Lets work this out. Now my associate told you it has to come back to you in cash. If you like we can give you a gift card for the amount.

Him - No! It's going back on my card like I told that bitch over there! *pointing at me*

Her - Alright. We've tried to be reasonable. We've tried to give you the money, now that you've threaten to call the police, you've officially turned this into a legal issue and I no longer have to deal with your shit. Here is the number for our legal dept, go ahead and give them a call. I'm about to pop a baby out, and I'm not putting up with you anymore. Here's your tablet back! We formatted it for you. Have a great day! *we both walk away*

Greatest manager I've ever had hands down. She also scares the crap outta me

The aircon above the registers was broken, and the entire store was hell to work in. I'm talking, sweat in places you didn't know you could have sweat.

It on this mind boggling hot day that was I, being young and cheap to employ, was working the registers. These have the long conveyor belt to pull things toward you, and only stop when an object is placed in the way of this laser at the front. Cleared up? On with the tale.

A woman in her middle fifties walks up, we exchange the usual small talk and hello's, she starts unloading her trolley. I scan and bag, and her objects quickly pile up - that's okay, that's why the conveyor belt is so long. I've done all the cold food, now it's onto the cans and boxes. She's put everything on haphazardly, and me being a good little retail slave is properly sorting out groceries as I go. 

Suddenly, I smell the sickly sweet scent of sugar. Unsure of where's it's coming from. Maybe someone dropped a softdrink? I look around, see nothing, continue to scan.

I attempt to pick up a box of cereal... and suddenly realise that something is very, very wrong. The cereal pulls away, strands of brown goop trailing from the box to the belt.

I think it was at this point ~~I swore~~ I cursed the makers of syrup. It was *everywhere* - trailed along the entire belt, with every item from potatoes to toilet rolls stuck. And the smell - because it was so hot, the sweetness was just overpowering. It'd had melted to near liquid and just pooled everywhere.

The lady just looks at me. 

I look at her.

&gt;Me: How did the maple syrup manage to leak everywhere?

&gt;Her: Well... I might have opened it... earlier... to see if it was the right one... maybe the lid... wasn't on... properly.

It was at this point I did the retailer's biggest no-no. 

&gt;Me: You think?

In my defense, I was hot, the syrup was now *on me* and I was mad that due to it being my register, I would be the one cleaning this. Who even opens goddamn maple syrup? To smell it? It's pure sugar, there's not going to be much wrong with it.

Customer lady gets huffy and tells me I should have been more careful with her groceries and then it wouldn't have fallen over. I point out that a) I am yet to even find the maple syrup amongst her ~~shit stacking~~ unique way of item placing and the b) It wouldn't have spilt if she hadn't opened it.

She asks me what she's suppose to do with the groceries '**you have ruined**!!'. I have no idea. I call the supervisor. She calls the manager.

He explains to her that while technically, she damaged store property as she was yet to buy said ruined items, she may do another shop and get the exact same things. And she must pay for those, but [store] would not make her pay for the items already damaged.

She hit the roof.

As the incompetent cashier had ruined her groceries, she must be given a refund, have someone else do the shopping for her because she's already been on her feet for one round, alert the media about [store]'s scandalous policies, have store credit, get all her non-damaged items for free.

She is politely but firmly asked to leave. 

She refuses to, as she has not yet done her shopping. It is re-explained that she must do it herself. She refuses that, too. Manager asks her if she wants to pay for stock she has damaged. Innocent cashier is blamed. Manager becomes mad. He tells her to leave, or he will be forced to post a banning notice. She storms out, having not paid for anything, screaming that she will contact *everyone* she knows to boycott [store]. Manager smiles.  

Meanwhile the culprit of this debacles, the knocked over and leaking maple syrup, has been found and bagged. By me. Who is now sweaty, sticky, and sweet smelling. The rest of the stock had to be thrown out, as literally *everything* had been covered in maple syrup. Worst ever. 

**TL;DR Customer opens maple syrup for unknown and frankly mysterious reasons, proceeds to not properly secure lid, everything is sticky in Australian summer heat**

For three years I effectively ran an adult video store from the time I was 19 until I was 22 (1999-2002). I hired, I fired, I ordered, I made collection calls, I threatened to tell wives, I did inventory. It was pretty much a one man show other than Friday morning when the owner would come in for 10 minutes to pick up the deposits and receipts. 

It was a great job. Didn't pay much, but I was single and had access to all the porn I could eat at a time when tubesites were non-existent and was single enough to appreciate it. It also came with an assorted cast of characters: the meekly looking old guy who rented the same gay porno every week; the plumber who lived with his mother and would ditch work Monday afternoons to check out the new Tuesday stock; the Russian guy who worked for a room he could put his air mattress in; the guy who lived to dress like a pirate; it goes on and on.

I hope to make this a semi-regular feature around here. Stories? I got em, some of them too fucking stupid to believe actually happened. This is more of an introduction that anything, just putting the feelers out there to see if this would be a popular thing, though I'm pretty sure it would be.

I'm somewhat notorious in the store for not tolerating boorish behavior (any more than one MUST), and when these kids came in, I was called over the headset to keep an eye on them.

At first, they poked around like most do, but within a few minutes they were hiding in the hanging rugs and drapes on flappers. Due to the fact that the flappers have large metal handles that protrude out of the cove, this is actually somewhat dangerous, and, frankly, if you are older than 3, don't expect to get away with that. I walked over, gave them my very best put-upon look, and said, ""You are in a place of business, either respect that, or leave."" They seemed incredulous, so I followed that up with, ""Now."" They all came out from between the flappers with the classic 'Mom's Nagging' looks on their faces, but they went back to poking around... for a couple of minutes.

I suppose they thought I had stopped watching after scolding them, but once they disappeared around the corner toward our display beds, I waited about 30 seconds before following. 30 seconds. When I came around the corner, all of them were IN (as in under the covers and all) a display bed: more specifically, in the ALL WHITE bed. Oh, temper temper.

At this point, I was done amusing them, and I walked over, threw back the duvet, coverlet, and sheets, and went full mom on them, pointing to the far corner of the space and ordering, ""Out! Right this second!"" They laughed, so I smirked right back, then called over my headset, ""Call the police, we have destruction of property."" Oh, their faces went pale.

This is where the explanations began. 

1: ""We didn't hurt anything!""

""This is $700 of white bedding you just stuck your nasty, dirty bodies in, shoes, greasy hair and all. You get to explain to your parents why you owe this store money.""

2: ""Come on, we're sorry! Let us go!""

""Too little, too late. I told you once, respect my business. You can't respect that, you pay the consequences.""

3: ""You're bluffing, security will just kick us out.""

""I didn't tell them to call security, I told them to call the cops. I'm friends with the cops here, and the damage is over $500, you wanna bet all you're getting is kicked out?""

The fourth one had enough fear or sense to keep his mouth shut. By chance, the main mall officer (who is an actual cop for the city, there are generally 2 in the mall at all times, if not more) happened to be outside in his car, and I spotted him through the window as he was coming in to respond. Fortunately, he also spotted me and the four trapped children, and I saw the smirk that said fun was about to happen.

He made them all sit on the floor while he wrote up a report on the damages, and when one teen spouted off, ""I'm outta here!"", the officer put his hand on his cuffs and said, ""You wanna rethink that!?"" All in all, these kids had to sit on the floor for the better part of an hour, then the officer said they were all going to jail. At this point, both girls started bawling, and one of the guys looked like he might.

It was really really hard not to laugh.

The officer told them he was going to run a background check on all of them, and if it was a first offense, he *might* not take them to jail (all fictitious, of course). He escorted all of them to the holding facility in the mall, spent about 45 minutes shopping in my store, then eventually called their parents. 3/4 kids were made to apologize to me and the officer by their parents, and each parent chipped in money to pay for the damages.

Now before anyone tells me what a crotchety old woman I am, I'm 22 years old, and these ""kids"" were 16 and 17. If I had ever even thought about acting like that I would have got my butt busted, and the fact that these kids collectively decided it was fine is just sad. But, for whatever else I can say, I can honestly say I am remorseless on this one.

Anyway, this older woman and her friend drive up at around 9:50 at night (we close at 10 so I'm pissed off already) and orders a footlong sub, she orders the right way because there is a certain way to order your sandwich at this place, and I'm like okay, this is going to be a breeze, she knows how to order. 

Then she says, ""Oh and I have a separate order.""

Me: ""Okay what would you like for the second order?""

Insane Bitch (IB): ""I'd like two 'regular' tunas on 'regular' bread with EVERYTHING on it...""

Keep in mind that we have like 6 types of bread so I just assume that she wants white bread...

Me: ""Alright ma'am so you want two footlong tunas on white bread?""

IB: ""NO.... I  *said* I want *WHEAT*...""

I'm just like... -_- seriously... here we go...

Me: ""Okay... Sorry about that, and do you want to include the jalapenos on your sandwich as well?"" (We have to ask this, because some people don't realize that everything includes the jalapenos...)

IB: ""ALRIGHT, WHY ALL THE QUESTIONS... I SAID EVERYTHING, I MEAN EVERYTHING..."" 

Now I'm beyond flabbergasted that she's acting this way over two sandwiches... so I just say,

""Okay ma'am sorry to bother you with my questions, but I am required to ask them so we make your sandwich to your specifications.""

IB: ""Okay, well, just tell me the total...""

I tell her the total and tell her to pull up to the first window. Her friend in the side seat gives her her money and she pays for her sandwich, then I tell her the total again, and two footlongs at this particular store costs like 15.67 or something, so I tell her and she gives only 15.

Me: ""Um ma'am I need .67 cents or a dollar...""

IB: ""Why the hell does it cost so fucking much?! I just order two REGULAR TUNAS.""

Me: ""Well, two regular footlongs cost 7.31 plus tax...""

IB: ""Are you fucking kidding me?! I ORDERED TWO SIX INCHES............ You know what, just give me the fucking money back!""

Me: ""I'm sorry ma'am, do you still want us to make the first sandwich?""

IB: ""Well, she fucking paid for it didn't she?"" 

*You bitch....*

Me: ""Okay, it will be out soon please pull up to the 2nd window.""

So, we make the first sandwich for IB's friend and I tell my coworker that I want her to come with me and hand out the sandwich to her because I'll get bitched out more and I need some support.

My coworker and I go to the window, which by the way the lady is fucking pounding her fist on the glass for some reason because she's mad I guess and clearly insane, and me and my coworker are both standing there when she starts ranting.

IB: ""Is there a manager on this premises? I want to talk to a fucking manager! This is the WORST service I HAVE EVER HAD. That INCOMPETENT *FUCK* IN THERE SHOULDN'T BE DOING ANYTHING IN SERVICE BLAH BLAH BLAH.....""

This bitch was literally saying all this shit like I wasn't STANDING right there. Ugh man. And her little friend in the side seat was nodding her head in agreement the whole time like [this](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m37l2kbHzI1qihztbo1_400.gif). 

Coworker: ""No there isn't a manager here right now, but I could give you the office number and you can call them between 9-5 on any week day....."" 

Then she cuts my coworker off and yells, 

IB: ""YOU PEOPLE COULDN'T GIVE TWO FUCKS COULD YOU.""

She then proceeded to snatch the sandwich out my coworkers hands and literally SKID out of the parking lot. And this was an old fucking lady. I swear if I am that angry when I get older I'd just commit myself to an institution, because that shit is just unacceptable. Damn.

It was a great story to tell though and now we just laugh about it, but damn. People and their food are not to be messed with. 

ALSO: SORRY IT'S SO LONG

EDIT: To all the people saying that I shouldn't be mad that they came at 9:50 because it's fast food and they should be gone by 10. Do you understand what it takes to close this store? Also, we have to be out in 30 to 45 minutes or WE get in trouble, no matter what the circumstance. It's bullshit. Also, at this particular drive-thru when people order, it TAKES FOREVER.

Like I said, I was waitressing last night and I got my butt kicked. I was the only waitress and in walks the entire girls softball team and their parents, on top of my 6 other tables. It's tradition that the high school teams get their food free so they always come in. We're happy to serve them and they're great, except for the softball girls. They NEVER tip. I even heard one say last year that they don't need to tip because they get their food free. Well this won't fly with us (the owner said we do it for the community so we shouldn't worry about tips....) so the owner's son last year finally said something to them because when you don't get tipped on helping 15-20 high school girls you get mighty surly. Anywho, they actually tipped me $12 last night and their tab was $85 so I was content with it (there was 15 of them and someone left a $5 so that's not even all of them tipping $1. Sweet girls huh?). 

15 minutes after the girls leave the boys baseball team walks in.  I want to cry until I realize their parents aren't coming. I love the baseball team. I love them because they're nice, funny and they tip phenomenally. Last night was a perfect example. They tipped me $55. Yep, 55 freaking dollars. Why? Because they're nice boys and realize that they're getting a free meal so they over compensate.  They made my crazy busy night oh so worth it.

Now she could not bend down to use the air pump to fill her tires so for the past few years when i've not been too busy with anything else i would go out and do this for her. While filling her tires we got to chat and became quite friendly. (Note: I'm a six foot heavy set guy with a shaved head) When she came in i would call her my purple granny. As she like other pensioners died her hair that shade of purple that they seem to like and she would reply with at least she had hair. She would even come into the shop and bring in treats for the staff but gave me extra like a granny would to her grandchildren. All in all she was one of those rare customers that would brighten up even the most dull days. 

A few months ago she told me she was moving down south to England to live with her son and this would be the last time we would see her but she promised to write to us to keep in touch. Well true to her word she did write to use once a week sending up pictures of her with her son and grandchildren. Then today a package came addressed to me personally and i did not recognize the handwriting but by the post code i knew where it came from. My heart sank as i feared the worst, It was from her son informing me that his mother passed on in her sleep last week. He went on to thank me and the other staff for helping out his mother and more importantly being her friend. He went on to tell me that she knew she was dying for the past year and talking to me in that time plus our weekly letters gave her something to take her mind off the situation. 

Inside the package was a framed picture of her holding a air pump in a garage down there and written on it was the words ""it's not the same without you baldie"" Well i burst out crying as i am just now typing this. At the end of her sons letter was an open invitation to come down and visit with his family. All i need to do is let him know and he will send me the train tickets. I wrote to him as soon as i got home today so with luck in a few weeks i can go and pay my final respects to my purple haired granny.

I worked third shift at a gas station while trying to finish my stint at a community college. As a lot of the folks here at TFR may know, third shift at a gas station isn't the most glamorous of jobs. Had my fair share of shop lifters, beer runs and the occasional gas drive-off, sometimes with the nozzle still in the car's tank. 

One particular evening, around the beginning of the summer, we had a group of teenagers come in, all looked to be around 16-18. After ringing some of them up, I get interrupted by one of them who had just come in. 

Teen: Hey, I don't have my ID with me but I'm 18. I promise. Can you sell me a pack of  Marlboro Blend 27's?

Me: Nope.

(For clarification, in the US, you have to be 18 to purchase tobacco products. Also at this gas station chain, the rule of thumb is, we need to ask for ID if they look younger then 30, or best judgment. Also other gas station/retail employees reading will probably be familiar with the constant scare of secret shoppers.)

Back to the tale...

He argued about it with me for a few minutes and after realizing that I was without any reason of a doubt, going to refuse him service, He said in a very snotty way “Well fine then. I'll just have my girlfriend buy them for me when she gets out of the restroom. He then storms out and stands very visibly in front of the store.

His girlfriend comes out and heads outside where they talk briefly. She goes to the car they were driving, grabs her purse and comes back in.

Teen's GF: Can I get a pack of...

Me: Marlboro Blend 27's?

Teen's GF: Yeah.

I explain to her that neither my co-worker, nor I can sell her the cigarettes since we know she is buying them for her boyfriend that cannot prove his age.

She, understanding says: It's ok then, and very politely starts to head out.

The boyfriend was watching the whole time and jerks open the door and yells: Oh you're not going to sell her cigarettes now? She has an ID!

Me: Since I know, as you previously mentioned, that she was buying them for you, it is my job to refuse the sale. I can refuse any and all sales I deem necessary.

I work for a membership based retail chain that has gas stations at some of our locations ( any guesses yet?) The Gas stations are all pay at the pump, no cash at all and there must always be an attendant at the station whenever it is open. The main job of the attendant is to sit there and push a button that approves the pump for the member to fill up their vehicle.

Ok now that we got that out of the way..

A little while ago, I was doing my shift at the gas station. Normal day people coming and going no problem. Then this guy calls me over because the card he was using was not working in the pump. 

NO biggie, this happens all the time, sometimes they just need to flip the card around. I go over to help and sure enough he is putting the card in wrong. I explain as nicely as I can how to do it properly but while doing so I notice that its one of our Membership/Credit cards and the picture of the person on the card was of a women. I looked into the car and saw no women. 

I asked the man if he had another form of payment since I could not let him pay with another persons credit card because it is against the law. 

He smiles and explains he has ""authorization to use it"" whatever that means. I explain to him that our laws dictate that the person must be present to use the card and that I could not accept him paying with that card .

He gets a little angry and insists I just turn my back on him and let him fill up since he does not actually have to hand me the card, he can just swipe it at the pump. 

I explain that even if I did that for anyone and the card just so happened to be stolen, the police would trace the card back to the last purchase, find out it was here and use the security cameras to see who used it and see that I looked right at the card and continued to allow the purchase to go through. Which would lead to my termination. Something which I am not willing to risk for anyone. 

He then blows his top and screams at me to go ""back to you little fuckin hut and shut up, I am going to swipe this card and pay for this purchase and there is nothing you can do about it shit head"".

I put on my calm smile and remind him that I have to click a button tha t approves his pump and no matter what, I will not be pushing that button while he is using that card. 

thats when it happened. He turned to me came storming up to me and screamed in my face "" you sir, are the biggest ASSHOLE on the entire fucking planet! Fuck you and your little fucking button"" 

I couldn't help myself at this point. I just chuckled and said "" seriously?  on the entire planet? that is quite the accomplishment! Have a great day sir"" 

He got back in his car and peeled out of there. A few other people who were filling up just looked at me and laughed. 

So there you go folks. I am the Biggest Asshole on the entire planet. 

Do I get some kind of trophy now?

I had been looking for a better paying gig, but I was enjoying my current one, so the search wasn't urgent. 

We got into all manner of hijinks in the back: One of the cooks changed most of the dish names on the computer. If you ordered meatloaf, the ticket read ""Robert Paulson"". A fettucine alfredo rang up as ""Boba Fett"". After a server learned she had an allergic reaction to a dish, it became ""kill amy"". After one very notable evening, a new notice was put on the board. ""Anyone caught making a penis out of pizza dough will be fired"". This led one of my coworkers to spend several hours carving a very *threatening* looking phallus out of a five pound salami. He was a very artistic man, and his medium was food. He made some spectacularly vulgar stuff out of produce. He also almost lost his job after being discovered in the back room, in only his boxers, pretending to hump a dog. But that's neither here nor there.

We had lots of ways to kill time. One night, a server had a fantastic meltdown. We had front row seats as she peeled off her uniform, screaming and throwing things.

One of the cooks asked how we would do it if we were to be fired or quit. At first, it was just all about the show. Yell and scream, talk about bugs in the food, find a person enjoying a meal and ask them if they found any of the pubic hair, etc.
Then they got to me. The gods of mischief came down and laid their terrible bounty upon my head. I had a terrible idea.

""If I knew I'd never be back, I would shit in the pickles.""

Pickles come in a big green five gallon bucket. The slices of pickle are packed tight enough that you never see the bottom until you take a lot of product out. Remove a large pan full, take a dump, and cover it back up. No one's going to see it until they hit the bottom. And the size and positioning of the bucket are so that you could easily, comforatably take a poop in it and not be spotted. And you would be long gone. 

Everyone was silent for a moment. Then I heard, ""you won"". 

From then on, it became my go to phrase. Have to work over? ""That's it, I'm shitting in the pickles!""  Need something more from the walk in? ""I'm gonna go look at the pickles for a minute."" Pretty soon, ""pickle"" became code word for anything extra frustrating. 

I finally found a better paying job. During my exit interview, the chef and I were joking around, when he suddenly turned serious. ""Toxlab, tell me. Did you really shit in the pickles?""

As explained in my first post, I work in a produce department for a rather large supermarket chain in New Zealand and have for about 6 years. I have many stories :)
This little incident happened a few months ago...

So I was filling the shop (what we call it when we walk into the department in the shop, find things that need filling eg bananas, lettuce etc, write it down on a list, go out the back of the department, put the items on a flat deck, wheel it into the department and start filling the gaps). As I was doing so, I noticed a woman ""trying"" the grapes. Now, this isn't *usually* a problem but I sorta frown upon it. I mean, I don't mind if you try the grapes (or any loose stock as long as it's not an apple or watermelon or something. Small loose stuff like grapes, cherries, [lychees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychee) etc) but it would be polite if people would ask us first.

So this particular woman was trying the grapes... but she wasn't just trying one. She had a whole handful. An entire stem, in fact. About [this](http://us.123rf.com/400wm/400/400/natika/natika1106/natika110600341/9647817-perfect-bunch-of-red-grapes-isolated-on-white-background.jpg) many. As she was doing her shopping in the department, she had them in her hand by her side and would raise her hand to take one. Basically, she was trying to conceal the fact she had a handful. She happened to walk passed me as I was filling the tomatoes. We shall call her ""Grape Lady"".

**Me:** How do they taste?

*Stunned look from Grape Lady*

*Realizes I have seen her trying a handful of grapes*

**GL:** Oh... they are ok.

**Me:** Cool. In future, would it be ok if you want to try something to please ask and we are more than happy to let you sample the product.

**GL:** I'm just trying them!!!!

**Me:** I understand. Normally we wouldn't say anything if you were just trying one, but, you have a whole handful ...

**GL:** Oh well fine then!!

*drops the remaining grapes into my tomato crate on my flat deck*

*walks off*

I think she was a little embarrassed she was 'caught' and didn't like the idea I challenged her. Like I said, I'm happy for people to try ONE grape, but not a handful.

So I continue with my flat deck and finish up with it. I wheel it back into the back of the department and inform the others I'm going to take my break. It was lunch time so I went to the front of the store (checkouts) to grab a sandwich and a drink. It was rather busy so there were a lot of people around. As I was walking to the sandwich stand who should I see standing in line but Grape Lady. I didn't notice her at first as I was walking passed the que she was standing in heading for the sandwiches when she piped up and said to me;

**GL:** So what did you do to those grapes then?

*I stopped and turned around, saw it was Grape Lady and answered her question*

**Me:** Oh. Well, I had to dispose of them. I can't sell them unfortunately.

**GL:** Pfft. So what was the point of that then. You could have just let me have them and they wouldn't be wasted!

**Me:** Well like I said ma'am, You are welcome to try one but we can't let you have a whole handful!

**GL:** Why not?! If you're just going to waste them what's even the point?

**Me:** Because it's theft! That's why! One grape is theft but it's just one grape so we let it slide. A handful of grapes is a different matter. Please, ask us if you want to sample something and I'm happy to let you try one (or two). Not a handful.

*Grape Lady proceeds to place her basket of items on the ground and walk out of the store in utter disgust*

I watch as she walks away and heads for the exit. I then start to find myself a checkout so I can purchase my lunch. As I spot a small line in front of the VERY busy express lanes, Grape Lady turns around, and yells;

**GL:** I'M GOING TO LAY AN OFFICIAL COMPLAINT ABOUT YOU!!! YOU DO **NOT** TALK TO CUSTOMERS LIKE THAT!!! HOW DARE YOU!!!

Right then, EVERYONE stops and stares at me. Customers in line, checkout staff, the MANAGER (who was at checkouts helping with the rush at the time)... everyone! I knew if I walked away from this, every single person that heard her say that to me would instantly assume I was the rudest jerk in the store (good ol' public opinion, aye?). I don't know what came over me but I spoke up and came out with this;

**Me:** Really... and what are you gonna say? ""Oh, the man that caught me shop lifting was rude to me"". Yeah, that's gonna look really good, isn't it. In fact, the manager is standing RIGHT THERE (pointing to him). Why don't you tell him?!

You could hear a pin drop. Everyone then looked at her. Her jaw dropped, her face went red, I then saw what looked like tears (probably out of pure frustration). She then left the store.

I heard one lady in line say to me ""Good on you."" and a group of students in the express lanes went ""awwwwkward...."" in her direction. It was awesome!

Once I purchased my lunch, the managed asked if he could see me. Went to his office, told him exactly what I just wrote on here and he said ""ahh, ok... well, I can't really say anything other than don't talk to customers in front of everyone like that but I know how it would have looked on you if you didn't. So, well done.""

My heart was racing for a good 10min after that. I never saw her again.

*hmm, I wonder if she browses Reddit*

**tl;dr** Caught someone eating a large quantity of grapes. She didn't like me informing her that it's ok to try one but not a handful. She threatened to lay a complaint and I told her she was shoplifting. So go ahead!

A couple months ago, I was working a closing shift when a couple of college-aged guys came in asked me several questions about the king crab legs. I was low on stock and told them that what I had out in my case was currently all I had left, and that we should be getting another delivery in the next day. They talked for a while and then asked me for five pounds. I filled the order, wished them a nice evening, and sent them on their way. The whole interaction took probably about 15 minutes.

Ten minutes later, my night supervisor stormed back with the bag of crab in hand, and proceeded to slam it down on my counter (in front of a few customers) and tell me, ""Next time you do something like this,"" (pointing at the crab legs) ""you need to tell me first.""

I was actually speechless for a minute before I asked him, ""Do what? Sell crab legs?""

He tells me that the two guys had tried to walk out the door without paying for the crab legs (about $80) and when he confronted them they actually tried to fight him over it. 

At this point my face is bright red and I am being forced to ignore my customers to listen to this lecture. I apologize to my manager and tell him that I didn't realize they would try to walk out with it. Realize that the seafood counter is in the very back of the store, and I can't even see the checkstands from it, much less the doors. 

He tells me that next time, ""if you sell a lot of stuff like this to someone who looks like they can't afford it, you need to tell a manager"". And then he walks away.

I was almost in tears at this point, and my customers that had been waiting just shook their heads and told me that they didn't know how I was supposed to know if someone could afford crab legs or not.

There hasn't been an incident since, although I do normally call ahead to the checkstands now if I sell lobsters, so the checkers know they're coming, but I am still kind of in shock that I'm supposed to be profiling customers and informing a manager if someone that's ""too poor"" to buy seafood is trying to do so.

I accidentally deleted my somewhat popular complainer mom and crazy yelling husband story. Thanks, though, to all who read/upvoted/commented. I enjoyed it!

So to make it up to you for deleting that post, here is a new crazy person story. Again, this took place at the pizza place/arcade/maze area chain that I worked at through high school and college. 

Anybody who is familiar with the place knows about exchanging tickets for prizes. You may also be aware of how most places have what's called a ticket bank, where kids can save up their winnings towards the giant stuffed toys or the cheapy skateboards or whatever. We just kept a piece of card stock with the kids name, birthday, and ticket total in this filing cabinet. Nothing super fancy. 

So one day this mom comes in with a pretty small kid. He was about two or so and was mostly interested in playing in the kiddie area, but she was adamant that he come play games with her. She spent *hours* playing this game called ""Wheel 'Em In"" where you try to get your token to land squarely on a number of lanes worth different amounts of tickets. (I don't know how to embed links, but if you google it you'll see what I mean.)

Anyway, she comes up to the counter close to closing. We're helping a few straggling customers so she has to wait, and I suggest she use the self ticket counter to get her ticket total. She says no, she doesn't trust that we didn't fix the machine to only count every second or third ticket. She wants me to count this huge pile of tickets by hand. I explain that that would probably result in more error as its really easy to lose your place, but she insists. I end up ripping all the tickets apart, so that its a huge pile of unattached tickets, and she has a total of around 500. 

Now, 500 tickets can buy you a lot. What it *cannot* buy, however, is a moderately sized stuffed version of our mascot. Those were around 1000, and this lady simply did not have enough. That didn't stop her from pointing at it and telling me that it was what she wanted. 

""I'm sorry ma'am, you don't have enough for that. Down in this case over here are the 500 ticket and under items.""

""No, I want that stuffed animal. I have enough.""

""No ma'am, I'm sorry. Those are 1000 tickets. You have 500.""

So we argue for a little while, then finally she seems to understand. She looks at the 500 and under sections, her little boy points at a few things he really seems to want, but she doesn't decide on anything. At this point we're past our closing time, everyone else is doing what closing duties they can, and I'm stuck with this lady. 

Finally I say that I can put her tickets in a bank if she can't decide on a prize. She looks at me like I told her to shove her tickets up my ass for safekeeping. 

""Absolutely not! I don't trust you guys and those ticket banks! You probably steal from them!"" I give her a look, like 'what the hell do you think I'm going to use your tickets to steal from this place?' But instead I just smile and offer her a bag so she can take her tickets home. 

""NO. I want that stuffed animal. I'll just pay you the left over with cash.""

Now, I don't know if y'all are aware, but we can't do that. There's no ticket-to-dollar ratio, and we didn't have a code or anything to put into the register to show that we sold a ticket item for cash. And besides, if that was allowed, we would run out of our bigger prizes really quickly, and have to spend more money to get more.  

""I'm sorry ma'am, but I'm not allowed to take cash for prize items. I'd be happy to set you up a bank and you're more than welcome to take a picture so you know the total stays the same.""

Logic does not work on her. She goes on a tirade about how ""fucking stupid"" it is that she can't purchase an item with cash, especially when it was ""fucking obvious"" that her son wanted the stuffed animal ""way bad.""  Her son had been slumped against a wall, exhausted, with a finger up his nose for about twenty minutes. He didn't give a damn about the toy. 

Mom continued to argue, I continued to tell her I just couldn't do it (it would have cost me my job, which I tried to explain) and we went on and on. 

Finally, in a complete rage, she just screamed a nonsense scream at me and pushed *five hundred individual tickets* off the counter. Those bitches went *everywhere*. She lets me know that she is never EVER coming back, and I say ""Have a nice night!""

We split the tickets and ate a shit ton of candy. It was awesome. 

And there you go! Hope this makes up for deleting my other post-I'm sorry!! I'll keep posting about crazy ticket people and psycho party moms and crazy poop stories if you guys like. Just let me know!

Today I was the sandwich maker and although it's not my job, when I saw a man walk to the end of the counter with his chili cup, I stopped what I was doing to help him. In broken English he say ""More beans"". Ummm... what? ""I want more beans!"" 

So I figure out he wants another chili and for some reason has brought me back the cup. So I tell the cashier to ring him up for another one. He proceeds to start waving his arms and saying NO NO NO NO NO!!! MORE BEANS!!! I calmly explain that we do not do refills on chili and that if he would like another one it will be more money. He simply refuses to accept this. I then go get the manager who speaks the most Spanish to explain it to the man. 

After about 3 sentences of Spanish the customer looks up and says ""SPEAK FUCKING ENGLISH ASSHOLE!!!"" Oh my bad guy with a thick accent. I just assumed you didn't know how to speak English because you pretended not to understand the entire fucking conversation we JUST had. 

He then tells me and the manager in English that he just wants a refill on his chili because it was not enough. We again explain that he has to purchase another one. He slams his fist on the counter and proclaims to the entire restaurant that we are terrible, unhealthy, unsanitary, assholes who don't take care of customers and that he will never be returning. 

And that's alright with me.

I was at the local small grocery store for one item. I bought said item and got back in the car. As I was preparing to leave, I see a woman push her empty cart near the sidewalk. The cart corrale was just as far away as the sidewalk, but for some reason this lady thought the sidewalk was the proper place for the cart. Since it was on a slight hill, and a mighty winter wind was blowing, the cart began to roll into the street. The lady watched it roll a few feet and then turned and walked back to her car.

I'm pretty interested at this point. Will the cart roll into the street? Will a car hit it? Will it hit a car? Will the lady chase after it?

Yes.

No.

No.

No.

So I watch two cars narrowly miss the rolling cart as it rolls across the entrence to the parking lot, across the street, and up on to the opposite curb half a block away. All the while the lady sits in her car.

Since she was just sitting there, and I wasn't in a hurry, I jogged up the street, and pushed the cart back into the lot.  I parked the cart (sideways so it wouldn't roll) about 2 inches from the lady's back bumper just as her reverse lights came on.

She rolled down her window to bitch but before she could open her stupid mouth I said, ""That was yours. It seems like it got away from you. I brought it back. You're welcome."" And a trotted off to my car.

I figure I'd share a story before heading away for a week or two.  I've told it on here before, but in comments, so I'll tell it here.

**Mighty Mouse Saves the Day: Or Why I Quit Dudercrombie &amp; Bitch**

So obviously this was during my time with *Dudercrombie &amp; Bitch*.  I was already growing sick and tired with the company, their policies, and the employees.  

Anyways, as I'm sure most of you are aware, D&amp;B hires based off looks.  They get around HR issues by saying that they want to hire people who ""represent their brands"" and are ""outgoing, fun, and enjoyable to be around"".  But basically what they mean is young and extremely attractive.  And if you're a minority to boot? Fucking racial lottery jackpot as far as the company is concerned.  Here is a typical managers meeting summed up for any of their stores:

Manager 1: Guys we had to fire [insert names here] this week.  So this means we are low on African Americans.  

Manager 2: Me and Manager 3 went recruiting to [local event or popular hang out] and found X amount of candidates. 3 of them were African American and I got one Indian girl.

Manager 1: Great. Make sure you follow up with them so we can get them hired it'll look good with our numbers.

Now this may seem like an exaggeration but believe me its not.  It's bad enough to see people hired based off looks, but given jobs, especially managerial jobs just because of race is another issue. More often than not, the less attractive people were put into the back as ""Impact Team"". Basically stock.  Not that these people were usually ugly by any means. Just not ""Front Room Model material"".

Now I know some of you may be saying ""What does it matter? As long as they are hard workers?""  And you're right.  But a lot of times, the models in the front room knew why they were hired, and wouldn't care. They were there to get paid and hang out.  Some shined and really cared about their job, and were great with customers. Others just wanted to get paid and do as little work as possible. You'll find that in any job, but its exacerbated when the little shits know they were hired because they are attractive. 

To make things worse, it often left the Impact Team feeling like second class citizens.  And a lot of times they were.  They were usually left alone till something was needed or went wrong, and thats when they had attention paid on them.  This lead to a lot of issues with LP.  I can't tell you how many interviews I had with someone I caught stealing where they basically said they only did it because the company doesn't care about them.  It wasn't a good business model as far as I'm concerned. Then again what does that say about my looks if I was hired because I'm supposed to NOT look like I work there? =/

Anyways, I only added in that bit of background because it pertains to today's tale.  I had been having issues with this company, my managers, and how they handled their shrink, but this is why I ended up leaving the company.

It was Saturday. Saturdays at this mall, were busy.  And I don't mean typical mall busy. I mean busier than a all you can eat buffet with only one cook after Honey Boo Boo's family walks in.  I was bouncing around between stores, typical observation spots, and talking with other LP agents at other stores. It had been slow on the LP end. A sensor from a shirt found in the fitting room. A bracelet tag found stuffed into the pants of some jeans. Nothing huge. Nothing worth worrying about missing.  That's why I got the call from my *Follistar* store.  A manager there called and told me three hispanic guys had walked in, opened a bag, and swiped an entire table of colognes and bolted out. I told her to call the police and get the tape pulled, and to call two of the other stores. I was going to go to the *Dudercrombie and Bitch* main store and wait.  

 Luck was on my side when I walked in and saw the display in the front room was still up.  Directly to the right of the door was a table full of polos, and about 10 ft behind that were 3 tables, one of which had some shirts and a cologne display.  As I walked in, two hispanic guys, matching the description my manager had given me, brushed passed me and walked over to the colognes.  So I stay at the table with the polos, and waved over the girl greeting in the front room. She was new, I hadn't met her before, but I figured she could follow simple instructions.  I made to act like I was asking her a question about the polo shirt I was holding, but whispered to her to ""Run, and go get the manager. Tell her to call the cops here now!""

The girl just stared at me like I had told her I do the Macarena with no pants on as a tribute to my fallen gang members.  I was trying to discreetly instruct her while watching these two asshats.  I told her again to go grab [Manager's name] and call the cops now. As I was talked to her, I saw one of the guys pull out a booster bag from underneath his coat. A booster bag is basically a bag that is designed to defeat store alarms. I see Guy 1 open up the bag, and Guy 2 just swipes all the colognes inside.  Then for good measure he takes every shirt on the table, and swipes them in too.  Guy 1 then proceeds to walk toward the exit.

I hissed that the girl, who was still standing next to me ""Go get her NOW!""  and moved in the way of Guy 1.  Guy 2 sees me go to block his buddies path, and books it.  Fuck it, I want the guy with the merchandise.  Guy 1 stops for a second, looks at me, then the bag in his hand.

Now when you make a LP stop, you're supposed to identify yourself as working for the company, and ask them to come along with you. You're often encouraged to refrain from discussing the theft in public. Telling them you'll talk about it back in your office.  What I tried to say in this case was:

Me: Hi. My name is Drunken_Black_Belt.  I work for *B&amp;D* Loss Prevention and I'm going to need you to come with me.

What happened in this case was this:

Me: Hi, my name is Drunke

and then Guy 1 swung the entire bag at my face.

Nope. NOPE! FUCK THAT.  In the words of Ghandi "" IT'S GO TIME BITCH! DIPLOMACY OVER!""  

So guy swing bag at head and tries to run past me. I grab bag, grab guy with other hand.  Now I'm 6'4 and at the time 220.  This guy turned out to be 5'5 and 260.  So he's trying to kick me in the shins with his short stubby legs. I'm trying to stand back from being kicked with each hand of mine grabbing one of his wrist.  I'm sure it looked like a really awkward middle school slow dance, just angrier. The girl in the front room sees all this, and FINALLY runs off.  Good, she finally understands who I am.  Or so I thought.  I throw Guy to the ground.  I'm attempting to put him on his back, when some ass hat come running up and leading with his shoulder, drives right into me.  As he did so, he yells ""GET OFF HIM HE'S DOING HIS JOB"".  Thank god that Guy 1 is a fat out of shape fucker, cuz he's on the ground winded from our 20 second episode.  I throw the guy who just tackled me, off of me, and yell ""I'm the LP asshole.  I'm on my back at this point, and Guy 1 start to get up and try to run. Before he can eve take his second step I just kick out with my leg and catch his knee, and Guy 1 goes down like a lesbian at a sleep over after a pillow fight.  The guy who tackled me is trying to apologize while I'm trying to get on top of Guy 1 again.  Guy 1 is on his back kicking at me, and I have his ankles trying to just wait to move them aside and get an arm secured.  Meanwhile, Douchbag McShoulders over here is waving in my face to get my attention because he wants me to know that he's REALLY sorry and feels bad he didn't know I wasn't the thief.  Theres a huge crowd around us, as this store was right by an entrance. Suddenly the crowds part, and I just hear "" OUT OF MY WAY! IM A MARRRIIIIIIINNNNEEEE!!!!!!!"" as some guy comes outta knowhere, jumps on top of Guy 1, and grabs his arms. I tell Shoulders to get the fuck away from me, (in the nicest way possible of course) and he melts into the crowd.  Mighty Mouse, the guy who jumped in, says he's a Marine MP, and helps me secure Guy 1.  Eventually Mall security meanders over, and I ask for their cuffs. But they can't give them too me. So I ask them to cuff him. Nope. They can't touch him unless he touches them first.  I glare at him and debate letting Guy 1 up just so he can give this asshole a hard time, but decided against it. At this point Guy 1's shirt is gone, he's sweating profusely and I am covered in it. Gross.

Anyways, we sit there for 5 minutes.  Eventually I ask the mall security if he can call the cops.  They show up 2 minutes later, cuff Guy 1, and we go back to the office.  They never got a call before. I walk in the back, and the girl I had been instructing is sitting with my manager. I ask what the hell they are doing. Manager says this girls trying to tell me something but that the girl doesn't speak english so manager doesn't know what.

Yup. Girl was hired, her first week in America, because she's cute and black.  Didn't speak any English. Not that that should exclude her from working, but maybe not in a job where you talk with customers, and stop shoplifters all day.   Processed Guy 1. Had just over $5500 worth of shit in the bag.  Got him for Assault, and Possession of a Shoplifting tool too. Had a talk with Manager and she  decided maybe this girl wasn't ready for the front room (good fucking call).  And the best part?  Mighty Mouse had been at the jewlery store next to B&amp;D buying an engagement ring. I went over to thank him, and the workers who knew me there (they allowed me watch my store from their store) gave him a 30% discount for helping out.

Once again small jewellery store in Canada

We sold a line of sterling silver jewellery and synthetic gems that was very popular mostly char bracelets. People would go insane over them, even if they hated them. A lot of people (mostly eastern Europeans and Asians) would not buy sterling silver, white gold or anything less that 18k gold and would get really mad if you showed it to them. Now this line was only sterling silver and nothing else.

I'm showing a lady a bracelet and after a little bit hilarity ensues. (C for customer zz pour moi)

C: does this line come in gold

ZZ: No sorry this line is exclusively in silver

C: well why the hell do you even offer it then anyone who can't afford gold is not good enough to wear jewellery 

Now a lot of people do not know lots about gems or metals and that okay and everything but the following stupefied me.

She proceeded to tell me that every thing she's wearing is 24k white gold (this is not possible gold has to be alloyed to turn white).

C: anyways make me this bracelet in 24k white gold

ZZ: Umm I'm sorry miss but I can not 24k white gold does not exist it has to be alloyed and usually it's coated in rhodium.

C: what are you retarded? gold can be any color even green and black (this is true but once again it is alloyed and cannot be pure). Your obviously not good enough to know this. I want to speak to your manager your HEAD manager no middle managers.

Now here I'm kinda trying to not laugh

M: How can I help you miss?

C: he does not know what he is talking about I want this bracelet in 24k white gold.

M: Ummm miss i'm sorry but that does not exist it has to be alloyed to be white.

C: No stupid it does not anyways show me this ring here.

This ring was beautiful and had Dematiod garnet (green garnets). I'm not our gemologist but the next best thing here I face palmed hard

C: These emeralds look weird

ZZ: those are actually Demantoid garnets these specifically are from russia.

C: UGHH you are so stupid garnets are red

ZZ: actually they can come in a few colors

C: that's not true what are you going to tell me sapphires can be orange next?

ZZ: Sapphires come in every color except red orange ones are called parapadash 

C: F*** your stupid i'm obviously to smart for this store i'm never coming here again.

sorry there was a little bit of tech talk there but this one had to be told

More to come if you want!

After lurking for a while I decided to share one of my stories as a delivery driver. One of the stories posted recently reminded me of this, so I thought I'd share.

As I said before, I used to be a delivery driver for a deli in my town. When I wasn't driving, I would occasionally work cashier, answer phones, etc. I was working the night shift as a cashier on this particular day, and everything was going pretty normally so far.

The phone rings, I answer it, and a woman greets me on the other line.


Her: ""Hi, I was in earlier, and I think I lost my purse there by accident.""  
Me: ""Not a problem, ma'am. Let me check to see if anything got turned in.""


I put her on hold and ran to the back where our office was. I asked my manager on duty if a purse had been turned in, but he said nothing has turned up. I go around and ask my coworkers if they've seen it, and they tell me the same thing.

I pick up the phone again to speak with the lady.


Me: ""Sorry ma'am, but it looks like nothing's turned up. Where were you guys sitting at?""  
Her: ""Well, we were sitting at a booth, kind of on the end...""


I tell her that I'll take a look around and get her phone number in case someone finds it.

And so the hunt began! I start looking around where she was talking about and, oh? What's this? a purse! I rush back and gave her a call and told her I found it right where she said it was. She was ecstatic, and that she'd be there shortly. 

A short time later, I was helping other people when I noticed my coworker talking to a lady and hand her the purse. I walked up to let her know where I found it and to confirm that it was her's.

Her: ""Oh, you're the one who I spoke to on the phone? And you found my purse?""  
Me: ""Yes ma'am, that was me!""

She starts to dig in her purse while saying, ""You know, it would have been such a hassle to get everything back that I could have lost..."" She proceeds to pull out two bills. ""...so here, take this.""

I politely decline but she insists. I take the money and she thanks me profusely as she walks out. I noticed fives on the bills so I'm like, hey, ten bucks? Not too shabby. I take a closer look at the bills while I pull out my wallet and...

Those weren't two fives. Those were two FIFTIES. 

This lady gave me a hundred dollars just for finding her purse. It must have meant nothing to her compared to what she would have gone through if she had lost her purse, but to a broke kid in his early 20's? I was pretty stoked.

So I left my shift that night $100 richer and with a few jealous remarks from my coworkers. I really wish I could have thanked that lady more had I known. She seriously made my night, and I keep that memory as a reminder that not all customers are bad.

At the time, this totally blew my mind and it still does to this day. As of Veteran's Day 2011, our company started offering military discounts (I should say that we officially started offering them, for if someone asked for one, we'd just give them a 10% discount using a different code), and as such, we started getting a lot more military in the store. Well, that means we get disabled vets who get military discount and tax exempt, so they save 10% and no tax. 

I had an older couple do this, and the woman behind them lost her fucking mind. She just started screaming, ""So they get 20% off because why? For nothing! What'd you do that was so special!? Not a damn thing! I'm a teacher and I don't get shit! Fuck you!""

Here's some things to note before I say the response: 1) this guy clearly had a prosthetic leg (the metal pole kind), massive facial scars, and three missing fingers; 2) to do a tax exempt sale we have to enter information into the computer then make a physical copy of the document, which takes time and is obvious; 3) to get a military discount, I take the ID and hold it up to match the picture, so again, obvious; 4) I will try to give you a discount if you're polite regardless; and finally, 5) no way in hell a teacher can afford to ~~shop at~~ buy what she was buying at my store unless there is some other source of income, so she's clearly either full of shit or reliant on someone else.

The response: ""Ma'am, without this man's service, you wouldn't be able to say things like that without being shot where you stand."" The vet just shook his head, but his wife laughed. 

The lovely and eloquent teacher put her stuff on the counter and demanded a discount, and when I told her no she demanded a manager... Who also refused the discount, and once she was told the whole story, told the woman not to come back until she learns some respect.

My co-workers were awesome but the management, not so much. I gave my 3 weeks notice and they told me: ""We will say our goodbye's on your last day!""

At the place I worked we always had a weekly flyer with stuff going on and changes in rules. Normally it contained all the people who had their birthday that week and the people that were leaving. Strange, it doesn't say I'm leaving. Guess they forget.

My last day came around and I closed my till and walked to 
the back where I expected to see my supervisor to say thanks for the fun years and stuff like that. Nobody. Not even the main boss was there. I was disappointed and left my name tag and locker key at his desk with a note that thanked them for the fun years and signed it with my name.

So a few days back I went back to get some groceries and told a friend of mine (also a co-worker) what happened. She looked at me in disbelief and told me that I was supposed to get a going-away present and money for my locker key. Oh, okay. Maybe they forgot.. She tells me she is going to talk to my boss about it and they will call me.

My boss had told her she was going to talk to my supervisor about it and they will give me a call. Three days have passed and I still didn't hear anything. I'm just angry and sad they forgot about me and now I have to go back to get my money. And they tell you you're not just a number...

However, at the store I work at*, I am also employed in the babysitting-type area we have at the front end. I love working there, as it is easily a thousand times better to color, watch TV, and read with young kids than it is to check-out customers for eight hours or work at self checkout for five.

At the children's area, we have a security procedure that allows us to make absolute sure that the child (or children) are in the right adult's hands, and that all children are signed out properly. This takes a few minutes, and afterwards there's enough time for me to wave goodbye to the kid(s). 

One little girl in particular, who had been the absolute sweetest throughout the hour she was there, stopped suddenly as she was leaving with her mom. She looks at me, then her mom and asks, ""Is that a boy or girl?"" 

I'm pretty used to people wondering my gender, as I have fairly shorter hair than the average girl, and am not exactly what you'd call ""pretty"". Most people my age ask me this out of sheer horribleness, but with my experience with kids, I knew that she was only curious, and meant absolutely no harm. 

As with any younger kid who asks me this, I smile politely and reply that I am, in fact, a girl. She looks at her mom again, then  back at me, then her mom. She takes a second before responding, ""I want to look just like her."" My heart absolutely melted. No one has said anything so kind about my appearance ever, and it put me in an incredibly good mood. I'm actually getting somewhat teary eyed thinking about this.

I've been cursed out, called an idiot, and someone went so far as to tell me I'll ""Never set foot in a classroom here again."" I decided against telling them I don't even go here. 

I'm working the register mid-morning when a young man finally gets called up. His arms are full of art supplies and textbooks, and I start ringing him up. He engages me in pleasant conversation and actually helps out by bagging his own books. After the transaction is complete, he tells me that there are some supplies he's in need of that aren't in stock. When this happens, we have to get a pre-order slip, go find the ISBN numbers of the required supplies, and fill out the pre-order form. 

As a cashier, I'm not required to do this; usually I just send the customer to one of my coworkers who manages the floor. However, I can see that all the floor workers are busy with customers, and the line for the cash registers has died down a slight bit, so I agree to help him out. He has a long list of things he needs, so I spend the next twenty minutes running down paint samples and canvas and filling out pre-order forms. By the time I'm done, the line has stretched out again. He thanks me politely and says that he's going to get back in line, making a lighthearted comment about hoping the professor for his next class won't be angry with him for being late on the first day. Instead of making him wait another half hour in line, I take him back to my register and get his supplies pre-ordered. He thanks me again and leaves. 

Three hours later, I clock out for lunch and head for the door. As I'm about to walk out, the guy comes back in. He tells me that he's got yet another bunch of supplies to preorder and asks if I wouldn't mind helping him. I'm taking off my apron as he's talking, and he realizes I'm off the clock. He apologizes and says he'll find someone else to help. I have to admit, when you come across a customer as nice as this one was, you tend to want to help them out. So, off the clock, I head back into the bookstore with him and help him gather the rest of his supplies. I tell him that since I'm clocked out, I won't be able to ring him up and that he'll have to wait in line. He understands, and thanks me again. 

I walk with him to the end of the line on my way out the door. Before I can leave, however, a lady approaches me with a basketful of textbooks and asks me to check her out. I apologize to her, telling her that I'm off the clock and unable to work a register. Her response? ""Then clock back in and check me out. It will only take a few minutes."" I explain to her that I won't be able to clock back in until one p.m., an hour after I clocked out. She immediately blows up on me, telling me that she watched me help the other customer find his things, and that I'm sexist. (I'm a girl.) I try to explain to her that I only helped the man find his supplies, and that I can't check out either of them. She retorts with, ""I'm not standing in this line. You're going to check me out or I'm going to talk to your manager."" Before I can tell her to be my guest, the young man I've been helping all day suddenly says, in a very hateful tone, ""Actually, I think I'm going to talk to the manager."" Without another word, he leaves the line and heads for the back office. The woman gives me a smug look. 

My feelings were hurt, but I know an escape when I see one. I left the store to go on lunch, but I felt awful, firmly believing that no good deed goes unpunished. I return to work at the end of the hour, clock in, and I'm immediately approached by the manager. He asks for my side of the story, and I tell him. He nods, satisfied, and then informs me that a gentleman had come back to the office to tell him that ""one of your best employees is being harassed, and damned if I'm going to watch it."" My manager went with him to see the disgruntled lady, listened to her rant, and told her that he was not going to reprimand me for doing my job.

I'm also a USAC Level 3 coach, and a part-time lifeguard with general first aid skills (remember this for later!)
Anyway, here's my story.  A very nice woman came in with her 15-16 year old son, and they were looking for a $600-1000 bike so the kid can race mountain bikes.  Not a big deal.  Anyway, I pull out a mid-range $700 bike that has notoriously touchy Shimano hydraulic disc brakes.  Remember this too.
So anyway, we get a helmet, and go out to the parking lot for a test ride.
That's when she drops the bomb on me.
""He's never ridden a bike with gears and brakes before!""
Great.  Not a huge deal, so I calmly explain how the gears work, how to pedal when shifting, and (since he's never used hand brakes before) a warning NEVER to touch the front brake.  ""It will send you right over the handlebars!""
So, off he rides.  He goes for about five minutes, all is well.  He's gone for another five minutes.  No big deal.
Then he came back.
Road rash everywhere, bleeding nose, all the symptoms of going over the handlebars.
""You hit the front brake, didn't you?""
A sheepish yes.
""Okay.  Let's get you patched up.""
Like I said before, I'm a coach, so I've seen my fair share of bike wrecks, including my own.  So I clean him up, get the gravel out, stop the nosebleed, the usual.  Told the mom what to buy for the road rash (i.e. the best bandages, antibiotics, etc.), the best painkillers, and some other stuff.
They end up buying the bike, and some accessories.
As she goes to pay, I tell her the total.  It was around $900 with tax.  I notice her writing $1100 on the check.  Strange.
""You guys do tips?""
""Yes, we do!""
$200 tip.  Made my week.  
So thank you, random lady.  That money means a lot to me, and I really appreciate it.

It was a slow night around 7pm, I didn't feel like doing much so I was screwing around making flowers and dragonflies out of the ribbon we had behind the counter to rap gifts with. Mainly cause I didn't feel like doing what my boss had told me to do (sizing all clearance lingerie) because everybody knows that the clearance part of ANY store is a shit storm so fuck that noise I'm going to make cool shit out of company shit.

Doing nothing when the phone rings. WOOO!!! Something to do that I can stand around doing nothing while actually!!!

""Hello this is HowlingBukowski in Lingerie Dept, How may I help you?"" In the most sickly sweet voice I can muster.

""Hey...uhhh I'm looking for uhhh...present for my girlfriends birthday.""

 Now to set the stage. The voice on the other end was male, anywhere from 20s-40s, low and soft spoken, shallow breathing (as noted by the *breath* in the sentences)

""Sure, I can absolutely help you with that!! What kind of thing were you looking for?""

""Ummm...I don't *breath* know really maybe uhhh *breath* some kind of panty?""

""Ok, what kind of style? Material? Bikini? Tanga? Thong? Lace? Cotton? Microfibre?"" I get me pen and paper out cause you gotta get what the customer wants.

""Umm well I'd like something kind of *breath* see though so you can see her *breath* bush. It's kinda uhhhh shaved...into a heart. So what would *breath* uhhh you suggest so I *breath* could see it?""

O.o WAAAAAT????


""Well sir,"" I say trying to keep my cool, ""I'd go with a lace number. Any ideas what colour?""

He starts breathing a little heavier, ""Um well her bush *breath* is blonde so *breath* what would *breath* make that uhhhhh look good?""

O.O NO WAY...IS THIS GUY SERIOUS???

""Well Sir I think a nice fuschia colour would go well. Any particular style?""

""*breath* UHhh She doesn't like *breath* thongs so maybe a cheeky kind? Do you *breath* have that?""

""Of course sir, we have that.""

This is where shit gets weird and I realize what the fuck is going on....His breathing is super audible, very low somewhat gruff voice and I'm a moron.

""How late are you open *breath* tonight?""

""9 o'clock Sir.""

""Will you be there *breath* if I come in *breath* tonight?""

""Yes sir, I am the closing associate tonight, I'll be here til 9.""

""So if I *breath* come you'll be there?""

""Yes""OHMYGODHE'SJACKINGOFFF

Another day, another 20,000 gallons of fuel to sell.  Let it be known to all and sundry that, despite the events that I have told here, most of my days at the station were, in fact, rather dull.  Car comes in, say hi, take money, pump gas, hand back receipt, say bye.  Over and over and over again, ad infinitum.  It was a job that allowed one to either A) turn your brain off and not think, or B) let your mind wander and think about awesome creative stuff like unicorn hair care products or specialty underwear for overweight leprechauns.  Or maybe the gas fumes were getting to me.

It was also in a rather rich neighborhood.  Rare, exotic, or otherwise extremely expensive cars were a common occurrence.  Lamborghinis, Ferraris, Maseratis, Bentleys, Rolls Royces, Aston Martins, etc.  So when a very nice Porsche Carrera GT3 rolled into the station, I was not overly amazed.  I walked over and greeted the driver, as I always do, with a cheery smile.  He stepped out of the vehicle, handed me a card, and asked me to fill up with supreme.  No problem.  He then stepped over into the parking lot, and lit up a cigarette (far enough away that I didn't have to yell at him).

It wasn't busy at that moment, so I stuck by the car as it slowly filled, and my eyes wandered over to the driver.  He was dressed nicely, a suit that I could tell was probably worth more than all my guitars put together.  Hair slicked back.  Shoes probably worth more than my shitty car.  And a crack pipe in his hand.

Double take.

Was I seeing that right?  I looked closer, and yeah, there in his off hand, a small glass pipe, with charring on one end and what looked like cotton in the other.  Huhn, never seen one of those outside of class.  I walked over to my assistant manager (who was part of the same criminal justice college classes I was) and surreptitiously told him about it.  He walked over, doing his best to look inconspicuous, and had a gander himself.  Yup, sure looks like a crack pipe.  Weird.

We had a quick debate as to whether we should call the police, but were leaning towards not.  We weren't 100% certain, though it really looked like one.  And it's JUST the pipe, he's not smoking it nor does he have any baggies of something yellowish and clumpy.  Probably should just let this one go.

But our minds got made up for us when a State Trooper pulls in.  Complete coincidence, the trooper needs gas.  Okay, since he's already here...I go over, do the greeting again.  ""By the way, sir, I'm not 100% certain of this, but it really looks like the guy over on pump 12 has a crack pipe in his hand.  Could you go take a look?""

It's a young cop.  Maybe 25.  And he gets that ""Oh ho, I have just stumbled upon criminal activity, I shall investigate forthwith!"" look on his face that gung-ho new cops can get, and steps out of his vehicle.  The driver of the Porsche has now walked back over to his car, as the pump has clicked off, and he's waiting to be disconnected so he can leave.  I don't know if he even saw the cop.

What I do know is that, when the cop walked around the pillar that holds up our awning, he didn't even get a single word out of his mouth.  Because the Porsche driver immediately swung on him.  BAD IDEA.  The cop was freshly off FTEP, all that hand-to-hand training he got in academy fresh in his mind.  That one swing was all the suspect got, because he was immediately dumped on the ground and pinned down, while the cop yelled into his radio for back up.  My manager and I stood in shock, jaws somewhere down around our kneecaps.

What had been just one State Trooper getting gas was now one State Trooper conducting an arrest, with two local cops, a county sheriff, and a State Trooper supervisor observing and acting as backup.  My manager, another attendant who hadn't been involved at all up to this point, and myself figured it would be a good idea to back off and let the cops do their thing.  Customers weren't going to be pulling up anyway, not with a bunch of red and blue lights flashing everywhere.  I also suggested making popcorn, but got vetoed.  Always gotta ruin the fun.

So the suspect is now being interviewed, and a search of his car is being conducted.  Suddenly, everything just seems to stop, and the cop who was hip-deep in the car slowly backs out with a very large bag.  Think a quart freezer bag that's been filled with air so it's the shape of a pillow.  And inside is a black, semi-liquid substance.  Ya know, kinda looks like heroin.  Someone grab a test kit.

Yup.  Heroin.  Two and a half pounds of it.

Now several more units show up, all of them saying ""supervisor"" or ""lieutenant"" on the doors.  The suspect is no longer being an idiot and trying to swing at anyone, but he is VERY vocal about how he needs to be released.  He has a job interview to get to, and he REALLY needs to go.  Over and over and over again, like a broken record of the album *Interview Nervousness* by the band Career Hunter.  Sorry bro, that's really not going to get you out of this one.  He was arrested, the car was towed away, and we basically didn't do any business for about 30 minutes.  And I never got any popcorn.

When I first started, I had no idea who he was. Just another face amongst the many faceless people I meet everyday. Until he kept coming back, all the time. After a while, we started smalltalk, and eventually became pretty good friends. How can I be friends with someone when I don't know their name? I have no idea, but he's the best person I've met in this line of work. Today he came through and changed it up. He ordered a yogurt parfait and then his usual Diet Coke. I said ""changing it up today, eh?"" and he just laughed and said ""I like to keep you on your toes."" He pulls up and asks me how I'm doing. My girlfriend has dumped me and my life is kind of a clusterfuck, so hearing him ask that just made me want to cry alittle. He was interested in how I was, because he knew something was wrong. He asked me how school was going and said ""Have a good night, bud!"" as he drove away.

I work for one of the major pizza delivery chains in a very small town (less than 7K people). The one with the dots. Anyways, we had a big bunch of thunderstorms about a year or so ago. Tornadoes, heavy rain, it was kinda cold so the roads were slick, all that fun stuff. I wasn't actually worried because i was driving a 4x4 pickup. I was usually the guy they sent out when no one else would go because of conditions or due to that delivery being way out of the way or something.

Continuing on, we had those thunderstorms. My experience with any kind of rain having worked in both a grocery store and a pizza delivery place is such. When it rains, most people do one of the following. they will either freak out and go grocery shopping like its the end of the world, or they will freak out and stay home and order delivery pizza. I usually don't mind though. Hell it's good money! But this lady.....oh she takes the cake. 

We get an order on the screen, it gets made, and we go to put the delivery stickers and whatnot on the boxes. the delivery area is WAY out of the way. Doesn't bother me too much so i load everything up and throw my truck into 4 wheel drive and go on down the road. Still raining like a bitch, threat of tornadoes, threat of places flooding. my pickup could handle it though. so i trudge on up this lady's driveway. steep as fuck, wet, muddy, all the fun stuff. (another side story, my pickup had a flowmaster exhaust so when i started up this lady's driveway i saw her coming out of her house cause she heard it coming). finally get up to her house and start to get everything together and all that. still raining like crazy. run up to her house and get to where she was standing and we do the normal monetary exchange. then this happens....

Lady: i can't believe you have to work while all this weather is happening! don't you know there might be tornadoes in the area!?

Me: -_-.....well ma'am you ordered a pizza and asked for it to be delivered so we delivered it. 

Lady: well i didn't think you guys would actually come out in this!

.....how the hell else do you think we get the pizzas to you? magic? needless to say i tipped my hat and went on my way.

I was working at a hotel that was rather close to the airport. We had the contract to keep all pilots and flight attendants from a fairly well known airline every night. They came in at all times throughout the day and left at all times due to their scheduling. Overall, these were the rudest, pickiest, meanest people I had to deal with while at this five star hotel.

One night I received a call from a lady saying she was a pilot with that airline and she would be staying at my hotel next week. She said that she is allergic to the wifi signal and cannot stay on a floor with a wireless router. 

uhm...okay, I'll be sure to do that. 

**now it's time to check in**

All floors have wireless routers, because this is 2011? So I tell her I can't do that but I find out where the router is and put her in the room furthest from the router. She LOSES HER SHIT. ""This is so unsensitive! ""Would you cook my food in the fish pan if I were allergic to fish as well?"" ""Can't, you just disconnect the router for one night? What's the big deal?""

THEN!!!!! Her phone rings and she answers it, says ""I can't talk right now"" hangs up and turns back to me with the ""what are you going to do for me"" face. I clearly can't say anything about the WIRELESS PHONE CALL she just held up to her head because I'm in retail and therefore everyone's bitch.

A few weeks after I was training with other cashiers my manager trusted that I knew my stuff and allowed me to start being alone for shifts. I still had some slip-ups, but nothing major or harmful to the company. My coworkers and managers are usually great when I ask for help.

Anyways, one of the first few shifts that I was working by myself, it was late afternoon and pretty slow. A tall, unshaven man about 30-40 years old walks up to me with a bag with a pair of dress pants. We'll refer to him as TUM (tall unshaven man, for lack of a better term).

**TUM:** I wanna return these pants.

**ME:** Alright. Was there anything wrong with them? Wrong size... changed your mind..?

**TUM**: ..yeah.

**ME**: Okay. Did you bring your receipt?

He didn't have his receipt, so I did the return using his telephone number (my company allows non-receipt returns). When I scanned the pants, the register that showed that he paid 49.99 and with tax about $53. I went all the way through the return and told him that his refund would be $53. He looks at me with the stare I think only Satan would be capable of.

**TUM:** I paid $100 for these pants. They are worth $100. Look, they're right over there. See? $100. Give me my full refund.

**ME** (after scanning the pants on a different register): Huh. They are $100. Let me try that again.

Now, at this point, I was completely unaware that this customer was trying to rob me. I thought that somehow the refund was wrong because the pants were a different price. I went through the transaction again and unsurprisingly still came up with a $53 refund. 

**ME:** Sorry, the register is telling me you paid $53 and that you will get that credited back to your card.

**TUM:** Look, I'm in a hurry. Just give me the $100 you owe me and there won't be a problem.

At this point, my heart is beating really fast. This guy is pretty intimidating and I, being a 16 year old girl, looked like a pretty easy target to him. I paged for my manager because I thought she would be able to diffuse the situation. 

My manager, we'll call her BAM (Badass Manager because, well, you'll see), comes in a few minutes and talks to the TUM. Keep in mind, my manager is a petite woman and about a foot shorter than the man. However, this customer is about to find out that she doesn't take shit from anyone.

**BAM:** Is there a problem, sir?

**TUM**: Your employee isn't giving me my refund. The pants are $100 she's only giving me half. I'm in a hurry. Are all your employees completely incompetent? 

**BAM: (a little shocked at this point)** Let me see your receipt... 

**BAM:** How could we give you a refund of $100 if this receipt says you only paid $50? It is irrelevant what the price is now. We do not honor current prices for returned items. What you paid is what you'll be getting back. 


**TUM**: What are you trying to say? 

**BAM:** There's nothing we can do.

They go back and forth like this for a while. Afterwords, the guy finally leaves with his $53 refund. 

**BAM**: You know that guy was trying to scam you, right?

**ME**: No.. I wasn't thinking straight. (dumb thing to say, I know)

**BAM**: Well, I'm proud of you dichill. You called me because you knew something was up. Whenever something like that happens, don't hesitate to call me or another manager.

Another coworker comes over and we tell her the story. She says that she saw the customer walk around to every department and stopped at mine. He is apparently notorious for finding the youngest/most naive looking employee and tries to get extra discounts/money off of them. I was in shock the rest of the night but everyone was really proud of me.

Hope your New Years Eve was plentiful, and your hangover didn't last two long.  I have a short one today. Short especially by my standards of writing.  So today's story, we harken back to the days of old, December 2008, for today's adventure...

**A Tale of Two Idiots**

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.  Bush's time in office was numbered.  America was hopeful that some black dude from Chicago could be black, and therefore, cooler than our white, semi retarded president from Texas.  The Olympics that year were already a faded memory, except for that one guy who won like 40 medals for swimming and smoked pot. USA USA USA!  A man was impregnated.  Beyonce was advising men across the nation that if you like it, then you should indeed, put a ring on it.  The terrible scourge that we now know as ""Beiber Fever"" was in the future, and we were all blissfully unaware of how it would come and sweep the nation.

Oh and there was this financial crisis thing you may have heard about. Probably not. It was WOEFULLY under reported in the media.  It's only our stock market collapsing after all.  Stories about a guy who used to be a woman getting pregnant are much more interesting and important, because, America.

Anyways, I was working LP at a Blue and Yellow shirted electronic retailer.  The month before, our red shirted enemies at Circuit City had declared bankruptcy and closed down. Huzzah. Just proving once again in the long standing battle of Red Vs Blue, that Red sucks, and Blue will always triumph. Even if we have a teamkiller named Caboose on our side.  

Anyways, it's holiday season, busy time for all. Especially busy as our main rival in retail was no longer here. So we were seeing a lot of new customers. Management was happy, the company was ecstatic because apparently they had never heard of this little site Amazon.com. If you haven't either I suggest checking them out. It's a gamble, being as they are so small, but its definitely worth it.

Anyways, I'm working at my podium, searching cameras, looking like Big Bird in my Khaki pants and Bright Yellow polo.  Like a sexy, sexy Big Bird of Justice!  When off at customer service, I hear a commotion.  What is this?  Danger afoot! DRUNKEN_BLACK_BELT AWAY!

I had my co worker watch the cameras and doors while I walked over to see who was yelling and cursing up in my store, and why.  I see a middle aged man, red faced, yelling at an associate, who was as equally red faced out of frustration.  Now this co worker was a nice enough guy. Showed up for each shift on time, did his work, was pleasant to talk to. He just wasn't smart.  I mean this kid was so dumb, he was about as sharp as a marble.  Believe me when I tell you this kid was so dumb that he thought that OJ really was innocent.  If you showed him how to do something, gave him a little hands on experience, he got it, and was fine. But if anything deviated from that training, he was about as useful as a poopy flavored lollipop.

So I naturally assumed he was trying to do something he wasn't sure about and too shy to ask for help.  Getting berated by this poor customer wasn't helping, and I could see this co worker, ""TJ"" looking like he just wanted to curl up in a ball and disappear. 

As I walked over, the man stopped yelling, mid rant and stared at me. 

Angry Man: Are you a manager?  Can you help me with this idiot?

Now he still had anger spittle dangling from his lips as he said this.  Meanwhile, TJ was staring at me, pleading with his eyes for me to save him.  Well, I may not have been the LP that store deserved, but I was the LP that store needed....

Me: Sir, I work LP, but I'll try to assist the best I can.

AM: Well I want to return this item, it's defective. But your employee here can't seem to find it in the system.  I understand you are all kids and older fuck ups who can't get a real job here, but how hard can it be?

Me:  Sir, I'll do what I can to assist.  However I'm gonna need you to stop yelling and not talk to us like that if you want help.  OK?  

AM: Whatever, long as you can actually do something, or find me someone who can.

AM: Ok, whats going on TJ?

TJ: I scan it, and its not showing up. Neither the receipt or the product itself.  I can't figure it out.

Now, I want to be a cop.  I eventually would like to work as a detective. I've always enjoyed a good mystery, and like to think I have an eye for detail.  So any sort of mystery to be solved is right up my alley.  But looking at the situation in front of me, all I wanted to do was punch TJ in the face, and then follow it up with a swift kick to the balls of the customer, to make sure he can never reproduce idiot spawn.  For you see, the packaging for the item in question was a brand that was owned, and sold, exclusively at Circuit City. And next to the product itself, was a receipt, with the words CIRCUIT CITY clearly printed on the top of it.

A long moment passed.  Maybe this was a prank?  Am I being Punk'd, as it were?  Asthon Kutcher, you son of a bitch. You've made a fool of me for the last time.  

Alas, it wasn't a prank, just two brain dead human beings. One with his head in the clouds, another with his head so far up his ass that he'd have to cut his own nipples off just to see.

Me: Well, it seems the issue is that this product wasn't purchased at *Rest Ruy*.  

AM: What? 

Me: Well, Sir, and TJ, you can both clearly this receipt says ""Circuit City"" at the top.  Also this item was made for, and sold exclusively at Circuit City.  So that's probably the issue.

TJ at this point looked like he was going to die of embarrassment.  I felt bad, he was a loveable goof.  

Angry Man looks at TJ and with a voice of superiority says ""And you couldn't figure that out? You had to have someone help you?""

I honestly felt like my brain was going to pop.  I thought after hearing something so stupid, I'd just go insane, be relegated to a hospital for the rest of life to chase butterflies and drool into my supper every night. Luckily, my mind is strong, and my mental fortitude allowed me go on.

Me: Sir, might I point out that you were the one who brought this here ?  

AM: Well yea!

Me:........

AM: YOUR POINT?

Me: My point is that you're calling him an idiot, for not recognizing that it's a competitor's item, yet you didn't realize the same thing?

AM: I KNEW! But I brought it here to return it!

Me: Yea. But it's a competitor's item.

AM: Yea a competitor who is closed now!

Me: Yes.

AM: Good so you see my point!

At this point,  I felt certain my children would be born with the intelligence of a snail with down syndrome, just from conversing with this man.  I had no idea what he was getting at.

Me: I'm sorry, but it seems like you are saying the same things I am, but you're arriving at a different conclusion. So could you explain to me what exactly you think was going to happen when you returned this, and why?

AM:  Jesus christ.  Circuit City is closed.  I can't return my items there anymore.  You guys are still open. So you can do their returns.

Me: No, No we can't.  They are a competitor.  Even when they were open we couldn't return items from them. I don't know why them closing would change anything.

AM: Well why wouldn't you? You'll get the money they lost.

Me:.... No. You spent money there and got a product.  Then if you returned it here, we'd have no way to process the return. Even if we could, we would be giving you a product from our stock. So we'd lose money on that product.

AM: Listen just because you work retail doesn't mean you know how business works.

Me: Oooooook.  Yea listen, this is getting nowhere.  You can't return it here.  Simple as that. We don't want to do it, and even if we did, there is no way to do it, as we can't accept this item into our stock, or give you the same exact item.  Follow?

AM: Get your manager. 

I sent TJ to find a manager.  If this guy was left alone with TJ I'm sure he'd continue to berate him.  I just sat and stared while the guy mumbled under his breath and glared at me.  Luckily, it was Manny, our cool manager on at the time. Manny was my direct manager, and a great guy. Old school Italian guy who was easy to get along with, took care of his employees, and knew the business.

Manny walks over, and I explain the situation.  Manny looked at me and asked AM if this was some sort of prank. AM scoffed and got angry, saying how no one here knew what the fuck they were doing, and this is why he never shopped here. He just didn't have a choice now because Circuit City was closed. Manny just laughed, and said that if he was indicative of the customers that Circuit City catered too, no wonder they went out of business.  AM got angry, and said ""You just lost a big customer!""  

Naturally Manny just laughed and said ""You never shopped here. How did we lose you if you weren't a customer?""

AM stomped out, hooting and hollering the whole time about what a bunch of idiots we were. I walked him out letting him rant, and laughing and smiling the whole time.  TJ thanked me, and apologized.  We had a laugh, and he bought me a Red Robin burger and fries for lunch to thank me.

This isn't because of how monotonous the job was. It was mostly because of the ludicrous behavior of our affluent guests. The area I worked in was right on the border of two towns, one being very wealthy and the other being very poor. This meant that we had a mix of income levels in our store, but the worst were the ones from the rich town.

So this night had been a pretty good one up until this point. Most of my guests had small purchases and it wasn't too busy, so I engaged in some small talk with many of them, talking about how I was leaving for university soon and them wishing me good luck. Everything was going smoothly. 

Right then, Charmander (I'll call her this due to her ""fiery"" personality) walked up to my register with an obscene amount of clothing, which is strange because usually pokemon don't wear clothes, but I ring up her up.. I look at the clothes, give an internal sigh, and go to work taking the clothing off the hangers, folding them up, and bagging them nicely for her. Also, I should mention that she is staring down my computer the whole time like a falcon about to go in for the kill, making sure that every single item is priced correctly.

Apparently, one of the items had rung up incorrectly and she told me that it was supposed to be $35. I looked at the price, which happened to be around $80 (this was a very nice dress), and thought there was no way it was $35. I politely told her I would call someone in softlines and they could check for us. This set off Charmander, and she evolved straight into a Charmeleon right in front of my eyes.

Charmeleon claimed that she also worked retail and she knew that I could manually change the price. This was true, but I could only do it in situations where the price was under $20 and the price quoted to me looked to be about right. She also claimed that the customer is always right, so I shouldn't be wasting her time checking the price. 

I got a call back from the department the dress was from and they told me that it was in fact $80. I thanked them and repeated this to Charmeleon hoping that this would end the argument. Not even close. Now she is a full-fledged Charizard, breathing flames into my face. She yells at me with, ""I work in retail and I KNOW that you can changed the price!!! I told you that the price was $35 so you so change it for me!!! You are so imcompetent!

All of a sudden, a Blastoise and her trainer appeared to put out the flames! This Blastoise attacks Charizard with a Hydro Cannon by saying, ""If you actually worked retail, you wouldn't be yelling at this cashier right now! He's just doing his job, so when he tells you he can't change the price, that means he can't! So either you can pay for your stuff and fuck off, or we can meet outside and I can fuck you up! Your choice.""

At this, our Charizard has quieted down, and has decided to pay for her items and leave the store without another word. As she leaves, the trainer yells out at the top of her lungs, ""Have a good day motherfucker!"", which causes Charizard to fly out of the store as fast as possible. All I could do after this exchange was laugh and thank her over and over again. I also gave them some discounts on a few of her items because they were so awesome. They told me that they both work retail to and hated seeing ""bitchy customers"" in other stores, so they always told them off. I couldn't stop smiling the rest of the night.

Not exactly retail, so forgive me, but I can definitely relate to a lot of things I read here.

I work at a zoo food stand. Other than our special plastic cups with their fancy, sturdy straws, there are no straws anywhere in the zoo. I've heard this is normal at many zoos in the country. We've personally been told this is for animal safety. (I'm not entirely sure this is the truth but considering the number of ducks and other birds flittering around picking at people's litter on the concrete, or with litter stuck to their feet, it's a perfectly plausible excuse.)

A lot of people ask us where we keep the straws, and when we tell them there are no disposable straws or lids for certain cups, for animal safety, they usually get it and walk away. We can't give them what we don't have, of course.

But some people just gotta have straws, apparently.

Had a customer order a beverage—in a cup that has no lid or straw—and was otherwise polite, but she came back after a few minutes.

**Customer:** Can I have a straw?

**Me:** Sorry, but we don't carry disposable straws for the safety of our animals.

**Customer:** The *animals?!* What about *my* safety?!

Co-worker on the next register just looked at me and I looked at her. Both of us entirely bewildered. I wasn't really sure how drinking without a straw was unsafe. Was she gonna drown or something?

**Me:** Uh, in the past, people have thrown the straws into the animal enclosures, so—

**Customer:** How does a place not have straws? How am I even supposed to drink this?!

At this point my co-worker and I performed a beautiful piece of synchronized psychic ballet. We curled our hands like we were holding cups, put our invisible cups to our mouths, and tilted our heads back slightly. The woman walked away in a huff, complaining to her husband.

I mean, seriously. You likely drink without a straw at home.

Here's a personal favorite:


So it was probably around noon on drive-thru. I was always the coffee guy, so I stood right around the corner from the cash window. My managers office door (always open when she was there) faced into the drive-thru area of our store, so she could always see/talk to us. She could also see the cameras at all times on her computer. I was in the middle of a conversation with her when she suddenly became visibly distracted by whatever was on her computer screen, leaning in and squinting. At this point I had more seniority than everybody (managers included) at this particular store, so I was like everybody's right-hand-man. She calls me over and points to the small window on the upper-left of the screen, where I see the drive-thru camera, and what appears to be a shirtless Asian dude doing a Sam-Fisher style wall slink up to the window. She promptly stood up, walked over to the window, gently moved the cash guy to the side and leaned out, looking directly to the right.   



""Excuse me, sir, what are you doing?""


No response from secret-agent-drive-thru, but we did notice that he had a makeshift cape tied on his back, probably a shirt or sweater. He gets all skittish and runs around the side of the building in the direction of the halfway home. Fair enough, we've seen weirder. 


Ten minutes later, a customer pulls up to the speaker box and we all hear through our headsets: 


""What's up with Jackie Chan in the parking lot?""


So the drive-thru team collectively turns to look through the front windows of the store, to see our caped friend (still shirtless) standing in the middle of the parking lot doing kung fu or something for no reason. Naturally, the weekend crew of teenagers thought it was hilarious, but my manager decided it was time to call the police (note: we got some REAL characters, it was usually a safe assumption that anybody who didn't get the message the first time was not going to listen a second time).


What followed was the most entertaining thing I have ever seen through a drive-thru window. Apparently the local police had previously encountered this man, so they showed up with *three* squad cars and cornered him at an intersection, where he continued to jump around and do kung fu before squirreling his way out of the street and into some bushes. The police just sort of looked at each other for a minute and drove off, although one of them walked back to the store and told our manager to let them know if he came back. He didn't.

 Well, i work at one of those mart stores, and i just walk in for my shift, clock in and get to work, the usual leveling and just maintenance, but within 10 minutes, all of that changed. About 2 aisles down, i hear a loud smash. As i'm walking over to investigate the loud noise, i see one kid, around 17 years old on the ground, and milk, milk EVERYWHERE. I also see another kid down the aisle with his phone out, so right away i assume that they are making one of these stupid videos, but i'm not aloud to do anything about it, so i ask if he's alright and get to cleaning. As I start cleaning though, i see the security camera person running to the front of the store, then she comes walking back with the 2 kids, and they go into the back office. After i'm all done cleaning up the mess, which took like an hour to do, I walk into the back to put away the cleaning supplies, and see the cops there yelling at the kid! :D The look on the kids face was priceless, he looked so scared!
  
  Later in the day, i see the kid walking out of the store with his mom, and she is ripping him a new one, bad. It was so awesome though! She was so mad telling him hes grounded forever and that hes never going anywhere alone again, i was cracking up in my aisle.
 
 Thought i'd just let you guys know about my first annoying retail experience / the justice that happened! 

*Edit* I also forgot to mention the other little piece of justice that occurred, the cops made him delete the video off of his phone, roflol!

We had a customer I will call Eleanor, due to her resemblance to Eleanor Roosevelt.  She had a constant look on her face of vague confusion, as though she was just planted on this Earth and hadn't figured out the customs.  Eleanor was considered one of our top customers--in our store, it meant she spent over $3000 on average a month.

Eleanor's preferred method of shopping was to come in, walk to the back of the store, plant herself on one of the couches, and demand employees bring her certain clothes.  She'd literally wave down the closest employee and demand ""Bring me a skirt.  Something colorful.""  or ""Bring me a jacket.""

Normally, this wasn't too much of an issue, but she refused to schedule secret shop times, so having one employee dedicated to just her was occasionally difficult.  On one particularly busy day when I had a few call offs, I knelt down beside her and quietly said ""I'm really sorry Eleanor, but I don't have the staff to bring you clothes today.""

She stared at me, bewildered.  ""Then how do I shop?""  She literally couldn't consider that she could walk around the store and select her own clothing.

We also had issues with her mistaking other customers for employees, and suddenly some woman shopping would feel someone grab their skirt and demand that they bring Eleanor pants.

Eleanor was constantly planning trips.  We kept dossiers on our best customers, and hers read like an adventure novel.  Cruises through the Keys.  Trips to the Caribbean.  Italy for the fall.  A time share in Cape Cod.  Each with a new set of mix and match clothes for her to wear. She'd brag that her husband was an executive in a locally based large business. She'd name drop the local elite.  I had plenty of customers who did that, it wasn't a big thing.  We'd all just nod and take her money.

Eleanor would veto clothes for ridiculous reasons.  ""Those flowers are too flowery."" she'd say to a skirt.  But we quickly found that if you took something away, then brought it back a moment later, she'd love it the second time.

One day Eleanor asked for a skirt.  She had me hold it in front of her, staring at it intensely, then suddenly shut her eyes and looked away for a moment.  Then she stared at it intensely, then closed her eyes.  Then told me to take it away and bring another. 

We went through this look then look away routine with a few different garments before I finally just asked what she was doing.

Her sister in law, it seems just redecorated her living room.  She was going there for dinner and planned to sit on the sofa.  For this, she wanted to make sure she coordinated with the new interior decorating.

That little episode started a new stage in Eleanor's shopping.  She would still demand clothes, but when she tried them on, she'd prance through the fitting suite, alternating between looking at her own reflection and closing her eyes in let's pretend.  ""Can you picture me wearing this on the sands of Aruba?"" she'd ask.  We'd all agree it was Aruba sands appropriate.

One day she was looking for something that was good for Italy.  We had some marketing from the previous fall laying around that was Tuscany themed, and I held it up behind her as backdrop.  She loved it.

Then came the day that we got a new employee in.  She went to Eleanor's church.  I'm sure everyone in retail has had a moment where someone hasn't recognized you out of context.  This was one of those moments.  

Eleanor is sitting there, letting this woman bring her things, running her mouth about the fabulous places she's going and who she knows.  Finally my employee just goes ""Now, Eleanor.  You know none of that is true.""

There's a stunned silence.  Eleanor's eyes go wide.  She tries on her things, quietly, then leaves, quietly.

We find out from my employee Eleanor was the much younger wife of a man she had known for years.  Yes, he used to work for the company she mentioned, but not nearly as high ranking as she claimed.  Plus, he'd been retired for years.  The vacations?  Pretty much all not true.

Eleanor though, wasn't the smartest of women, and she came back in.  If the employee who knew her wasn't there, she'd spin her stories.  If she was, she'd buy one or two things quietly.

Then one day, Eleanor's husband came in.  He was elderly and pissed.  Turns out that Eleanor had been maxing out credit cards she was taking out without his knowledge.  He had two huge bags of clothes to return, things from months ago, tags still in place.  All bought to support her personal fantasy world.  

Her husband wanted us to deny her service from that day on.  We couldn't do that, so he just started going with her when she shopped.  He'd demand she get up to do her own shopping, and she would get one, maybe two items per visit.

But when you were alone with her back in the fitting suite, she'd still whisper that her husband doesn't want us to know she's wearing this or that to the governor's mansion this weekend.  We'd nod and act amazed.  It was just sad.

Eleanor quietly dropped off of our best customers list.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1h7q7e,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1h7q7e/eleanor_none_of_that_is_true/,

No, these live in jello...

*""Do you buy fish? I have 2 crawdads and a frog I need to get rid of.""*

Yeah, how about that

*""Look at the hummingbirds!""*
Yeah, except those are Zebra Finches

*""I had a panda in my backyard last night! I even took a picture of it.""*
I didn't realize that pandas had brown fur, ringed tails and a black mask.

*""Look, a rattlesnake! I want it to bite me!""*
First, you're an idiot. Second, that's a RATsnake.

*""How can a bird flap it's wings if they don't have arms?""*
...what?

*""Can I keep my fish in anything other than water? I think that's why they keep dying.""*
You didn't know? Fish can also live in vodka

*""I didn't know you were allowed to sell pet raccoons.""*
We're not. Those are ferrets.

*(a mother to her 2 young kids) ""A snake doesn't have a head like you and me, it's actually a part of its body.""*
Actually, coming from you, that makes sense.

*(old lady looking at the finches) ""Aren't they the most beautiful of God's creatures? All it would take is one little squeeze to the chest and they'd die.""*

&gt; ""Do you guys have any Christian video games for the Wii?""

Woo... I was pretty sure I knew where this was going, But I was at work, so I had to be nice, so I politely told her that we don't have any christian games. 

&gt; ""Oh, well how about some Christian **karaoke** games for the Wii?""

What? I just told you we don't have any Christian video games. Specifying isn't going to magically make some appear. Again, I told her we didn't have any.

&gt; ""Well that's too bad. I played that Glee karaoke game, and it was really fun, but I just hate how they force their anti-christian values on people. You know... like with that one boy.""

So, at this point, she hadn't said it outright, but it was pretty obvious she was homophobic, and being a gay man myself, I tend to be unwilling to deal with those customers. Right about now is when I tell customers I can't help them anymore, but I'll happily get another associate to help them, but before I could, this lady spoke again.

&gt; ""Have you heard about Jesus?""

Whelp, my day just got more fun. I look at her and reply

&gt; ""Yeah, of course I have, he cleans the floors in the morning. Nice guy."" (Just a note, one of our cleaning guys IS named Jesús, and a few of my coworkers have mistakenly read his name as Jesus.)


&gt; ""NO NO NO!"" the woman exclaimed ""I'm not talking about 'hey-zoos', I'm talking about JEEEEEZ-US! Our Lord and Savior!""

&gt; ""Oh... well I'm not sure who you're talking about then..."" I replied with a completely straight face. ""I don't know any Lords or any other kind of royalty.""

&gt; ""Well I kind of have work to do... but I'll... uh... Google the guy... was that J-E-E-Z-U-S?""

Apparently it ""wont turn on"". fair enough-I go in and the house is a horde, animal feces everywhere, rotting food bugs, and her PC is nasty dirty. So, I dig in and find the PC won't work because it's not plugged in. 

The lady comes up to me ""Is it fixed yet?"" she says while smoking her cig. ""Yes Ma'am, i believe the reason why your PC won't turn on is because it's-"", she abruptly interrupts me ""I dont fucking care for your explanations. I want mah PC workin"" while still smoking that cig. God the house stinks, like rotting animals and feces and old smoke, I'm in a rush to get this done. I turn the PC on and viola it's fixed! I can get out of here!

I turn on the PC, and get in her chair. I should tell you her PC was a mess, smoke stains everywhere what I thought were rat droppings by the monitor, dead roaches and cat piss underneath. Shockingly her PC turns on. I login to her account, (no password) and my heart sinks, her PC is ruined by malware. 4 different nasty malware programs slogging her PC to a crawl, pop ups everywhere (I hadn't even gotten online). God, this is going to take forever.

Lady comes in, ""Is mah PC workin?"", and again i tell her it turns on, but, her PC is a mess so it will take some time. She grumbles to herself and goes back to watching TV. Every few minutes she comes back ""Is mah PC fixed"", and I calmly tell her no. About an hour passes and some progress is made, but, holy crap it's a dull slog. Suddenly she comes over to me and starts complaining again about her PC. I tell her no, and let me do my job. She grumbles and goes back to her TV.

I'm making some progress when the PC just up and shuts down. I check the side, and its burning hot and I swear I smelt a burning smoke from it. I unplug everything, ground myself as to not ruin her PC. I open up the case, and smoke comes out of it. Right away I know her PC is fried. I look inside and the inside was covered in dust and roaches. Roaches started pouring out once I opened the casing. 

Not much i can do, PC is fried, and I'm not paid to kill roaches. I put the casing back on, get up and explain to her why her PC isn't working. Her reaction was to fly into a rage, screaming it's my fault, and she's going to slit my throat and feed me to her cats. Finally, finally she calms down and writes me a check.

It took place years ago when I was in high school and working as a cashier/cart jockey in a supermarket.

One day I come in and our assistant manager is really pissed.  Earlier in the day, this one cashier, Dave, let a guy leave with $80 ish in groceries without paying.  Dave was also in high school like me, but was a really naive guy.  I think he'd been home-schooled until high school and was incredibly trusting.  Some guy came in, went grocery shopping, and didn't have his wallet.  Dave let him leave with the groceries because the guy left his shoes there and said he'd be back with money in two hours.  Dave, being super trusting, thought this was fair and let the guy leave.

Understandably, the assistant manager was mad at Dave and sent him home.  She told him that he was fired unless this guy showed up for his shoes with money.  The shoes in question were pretty well-worn sneakers, they weren't worth anything.  

About an hour into my shift, this guy shows up asking about his shoes and waving his wallet around.  He actually came back, paid for the groceries, thanked the store profusely, and left with his shoes.  Dave got to keep his job because the assistant manager kept her word.

Dave comes in the next day and everyone is teasing him for being stupid.  He goes ""I'm not stupid, like I said, that guy came back and paid"".

I",legomaniac89,595,105,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1hafen/coworkers_from_hell_pt_i/,"So in my 7 years at the same pet supply/garden center store, I've seen a lot of employees come and go. My bosses are notorious for being horrible judges of character when hiring, and are known for hiring people that turn into veritable nightmares. So I thought I'd share a few of the more memorable ones over the past few years.

Before I continue, it should be noted that my store is a small family owned business. My managers are the co-owners of the store and they make all of the hiring decisions and whatnot. They are notably lenient when it comes to enforcing store policy, and honestly, you've gotta try pretty hard to get fired from this place. We have a lot more freedom than what you would have in a typical retail chain. Right, enough of the boring stuff. Onward!

* The first notably bad employee they hired was a kid of about 16 years old, we'll call him Creeper Kid. CK had a very thin peach fuzz pre-pubescent mustache that made him look like a young porno film director, and had a creepy smile that made him look like he was visualizing you without clothes. He also didn't have a single shred of common sense. Bad enough as it is, but it gets worse.

   CK was incredibly lazy. He was hired primarily to work with me in stocking shelves and carrying heavy things out to customers' cars. Normally, he'd clock in, put two bags of dog food on the shelves, and plop down in the back and play on his phone. Now occasionally the stock boys would play the ""not it!"" or the ""nose goes"" game when it came to carryouts, and every once in a while it was fine. But CK took advantage of this, and every time he heard the intercom beep, before the page even started, he'd yell out ""not it!"" and refused to do anything that involved him moving.

   The last straw was when he came into work all excited that he had just bought a new blade for his box cutter. He decided to demonstrate for me just how sharp this blade was by slicing off the top of what else, but an empty 20oz soda bottle. He was right, the blade was quite sharp, and it did a great job slashing a 3"" gash in the side of his hand. He was rushed to the hospital for stitches, came back the next day and tried to claim worker's compensation for an injury while on the job, lying about how he had cut himself. I had already told my managers what had actually happened, and his claim was denied. He was fired shortly after. Total time of employment: 2 months.

* The next gem of an employee comes from the pet department. After CK got fired, I had migrated from stocking shelves to working in the pet dpt.  This is where Big Fat Fuck comes in. He was about 6' tall and almost as wide, and *always* had a Mountain Dew in his hand. BFF was hired for one thing and one thing only: to clean animal cages. The one thing he never did was clean animal cages. He would waddle up to the display cages in the middle of the animal room, flop his Pillsbury Doughboy belly up on the cages, and start bitching about how hard he worked and how he deserved a raise and how he just wanted to go home and play GTA.

   BFF's downfall came on a Saturday morning. He had been told by my boss to get the mouse cages cleaned Thusday, and again on Friday when he didn't get them done the day before. BFF was already on thin ice with my managers, and I had been explicitly told to NOT clean any cages, as BFF was supposed to get them done. Saturday rolls around and these cages still hadn't been cleaned. BFF dicked around all morning until lunch time, he clocks out, and as he lumbers by the animal room, he lets loose the single sentence that to this day still makes my blood boil.

   ""Hey legomaniac89, &lt;manager&gt; told me to tell you that you need to clean those mouse cages before I get back from lunch""

   I stood there in absolute shock for a moment as the rage built up inside of me. I was more pissed than I think I have ever been, and I am not an angry person. I am very easy going and you'd have to try really hard to get me pissed off enough where I just rage uncontrollably. But BFF did it. I stormed up to my manager on duty, explained (e.g. shouted) to him what happened and that either BFF goes or I do. He was fired that evening. Total time of employment: 1 month.

* Next in the lineup is Desperate Creeper Chick. DCC was in her mid-20s, bisexual, and about a 3/10 in the looks department. Thinking back on it, she could have been a real-life version of Lumpy Space Princess. She would repeatedly ask every employee moderately close to her age range (myself included) if they wanted to come over to her house for a ""sleepover"". After being shut down over and over by everyone in the store, she started asking any customers that she found remotely attractive the same thing. Needless to say, this didn't go over so well with people, and when the awkward ""I think your employee is hitting on me"" complaints began to roll in, DCC was canned. Total time of employment: 3 weeks.

Well, that got a lot longer than I had thought. FFS OP, STFU already! Ok ok, fine. I have several more stories about failed coworkers I'll share in a Part II.

Because we're often busy ringing people up, the phone calls can be a little tricky. Here was an interesting experience I went through...

I was stocking products by the front of the store while a co-worker of mine was working the register on a very busy day, with the phones constantly ringing. I tried to help her out whenever I could, but the products needed to get out on the floor ASAP. At one point she gets a call from a woman asking her to check to see if a product is in stock. My co-worker tells her she needs to put her on hold for one minute to connect her to stock so they can check on the product. The woman gets angry (loudly enough that I can hear it on a busy day while stocking the shelves), telling my co-worker she should go check the product herself. My co-worker tries to explain that she is both answering phones and ringing up customers on register, and she cannot leave the register. 

I can hear that it is a stock call, so I come up to answer the call about thirty seconds after the woman has been put on hold. I answer the call and ask how I can help her. She then tells me she has a question for the fish department. This is not at all what she told my co-worker, and I can do stock but know nothing about fish, fish questions need to be directed to our fish specialist. I tell the woman I need to put her on hold again to connect her to the fish department.

At this point, she gets ANGRY. She starts yelling at me, telling me that she CANNOT be put on hold again, as she has been on hold for the last TWENTY MINUTES and reconnected SIX TIMES. I absolutely MUST answer her question now because it is my job.

I wait for her to finish, and calmly tell her I am not a fish specialist and cannot help her. Furthermore, I've been standing by the register since she first called the store a full minute and a half ago. Therefore, she should probably stop wasting our time by saying things that aren't true, and I'd be happy to connect  her to fish.

About 10 years ago, I was in college and working at a bookstore.  My favorite job ever, maybe sometime I'll write out how I lost it.  I used to joke that, in contrast to the grocery store job I'd had before it, ""at least all my customers here can read!""  But you still sometimes still got the stupids...

One day, a lady approached the front and asked for help locating the atlas and map section.  I escorted her there and asked if she was looking for anything in particular.  

Lady:  ""No.  Well... Do your atlases come in audio?""

I was flabbergasted.  Atlases are just big books of maps.  I managed to reply, ""No ma'am, they don't."" without sounding too unprofessional, and escaped ASAP.

As soon as I saw her leave the store I told my co-workers and we all had a good laugh.  For weeks afterwards we entertained each other by imagining ""Audio Atlases"".

Me:  ""And Japan is here.  And Greenland is here.  And North Dakota is here.  And Russia is over there.""

Co-worker:  Canada is a large yellow country directly above The United States of America, which is pink.

We had three varieties of beer on tap.  15 minutes before the show ended we kicked a keg, and made the call not to tap a new one since it would be a waste to give out just a few more samples, then be stuck with a not quite full keg we couldn't sell.  We took the tap handle off and removed the sign for that beer (a porter)  Two beer were still available.

A guy came up and asked about the porter, and I told him it was kicked:

Guy: I heard you have a good porter.

Me: Yup, but we just kicked the keg, sorry.  Want to try one of these others?

Guy: No, I want the porter.

Me: Sorry, it's kicked.

Guy: Tap another one.

Me: I can't do that.

Guy (pointing behind me): I see a keg right there, put it on.

At this point I'm not going to judge.  Everyone has been drinking for hours and you have to expect some lapses in judgement.  No problem.  Another guy in my booth restates what I said, the guy tries the other beers and goes on his way.

The next day I'm checking our Facebook page, and see that that morning the guy posted on our wall, ""Should have tapped the porter"".  Today, two days later, I find that he has now posted a comment on our website feedback page again decrying our decision not to tap the porter.

I can understand being a little disappointed not to be able to try everything he wanted, but really, it is a 2oz pour of beer after a day of sampling from a few dozen breweries... at some point you just have to let it go!",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_17v8ld,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/17v8ld/its_2oz_of_beer_let_it_go/,

but today, i've got more of an annoying one than mean.

So I was working my normal box shift, doing my normal box duties. helping customers, manning customer service, the phones, and selling tickets. it was slow for a friday because pacific rim and grown ups 2 were our only new releases, and were rather small. So i'm doing my normal sales when a lady comes up and asks for 2 tickets to pacific rim. No problem, I put it into my till and ask her for the 20.00.

then the first annoyance happens. she hands me a card that's demagnatized, which happens pretty often,I figure i'll just manually punch it in.

something that should be known by the public about punching in credit/debit cards is that you need the info on the card. AND a zip code. a lot of people look at me like I have two heads when I ask for their zipcode, but usually it's not a big deal.

well today it was. I told the lady ""i'm going to have to manually punch in your card because the magnetic strip is worn down"" she agrees and I spend the next minute and a half trying to punch in the numbers on our finnicky touch screened tills. I finally get all the card info in and ask the woman for her zip code. 

She replies with ""I don't give out my zip code""

What. okay, whatever I need it to put in the transaction. ""mam, i'm afraid I can't sell tickets without your zip code. The system requires it to be put in if the card can't be scanned""

Her: well then just scan the card

me: mam, I can't this strip won't work. you either need to get a new card soon or you will have to start giving your zipcode at POS transactions...

We go back in forth when I get an idea.

me: actually mam, i'll try swiping it. But since the sale is 20 dollars or over, I'll need to see her i.d

she had no problem with this... good... verrrry good. 

I then proceeded to manually punch in her card info, take a look at her I.D which stated her zip code, and punched it in. Finally this sale was over. I decided that I would get the last word in on this ridiculous quest though so I checked to make sure nobody else was in earshot and said ""by the way, it's *****[redacted zip code].

1365188023.0,493,self.TalesFromRetail,1br122,Why I quit working for a computer retailer OR The night Oddjob tried to kill me,m1kepro,576,83,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1br122/why_i_quit_working_for_a_computer_retailer_or_the/,"Six and a half years ago, I worked for a computer corporation that was in the early stages of their retail store venture. I could point to any of a dozen reasons for why I left. My father and I went into business together, the store manager had self-confidence issues and took it out on anyone taller than his 4’7” self, poor scheduling, the practice of patting us down where customers could see because someone was stealing from Back of House... all good reasons. But let me tell you about the day that made me decide that I can no longer be in the business of retail-oriented customer service.

Three nights before Christmas, after working a closing shift, I got a call from a co-worker who offered to trade me his opening shift for my closing shift, so he could go to the doctor. I agreed, because I always like to do a friend a favor. As it turned out, the antacids he was taking weren’t helping his stomach pains because he needed emergency surgery to remove his appendix.

My manager, joy that he was, told me that since I traded shifts and my co-worker couldn’t show up now, I had to take my original shift too. I didn’t blame my co-worker, but I think the manager could have at least *attempted* to bring someone else in for that closing shift.

So the night drags on. Most of my work is fairly mundane. Replace an mp3 player, help a customer pick a replacement battery, format an external hard drive, etc. But I’m dragging. I’m starting to make little mistakes after completing 22 of my 26 hours of work over the course of that two days.

Finally, the end of the night approaches. But 90 minutes before the doors are set to close, everyone suddenly remembered that it’s December 23, and they all decided that little Timmy would hate them forever if he didn’t have the latest MP3 player or smartphone under the tree. So the store is all of a sudden flooded, and those of us behind the *long wooden high-top table in the back of the store* are asked to come out and help customers.

There’s only one guy scheduled for an appointment, and he won’t be here for another twenty minutes, so I go and start selling Things and Thing-related accessories. Well, this guy... let’s call him Ted... comes in and just stands there staring at a computer. He’s not touching it, not reading anything. Just staring at it. I wander over to him, and give him the normal routine. At this *non-descript, nameless computer company*, you never ask “Can I help you?” or other questions that could end a conversation with a single word. So you just engage the customer and start conversing about whatever it is they’re looking at. Ingratiate yourself.

He waves me away, says he’s waiting for something, so I wander off and help someone else. The appointment time comes, so I go back behind the *long wooden high-top table*, check to see if my guest has checked in. He hasn’t, so I shout out above the noise “Ted? Is there a Ted in the house? Ted F.!”

No response. So I go back to helping customers. Well, ten minutes later, my manager wanders over with Ted, who I’d talked to just before, and starts berating me in front of my customer about why I didn’t get ahold of him. I try to explain that I did talk to this man, he waved me away, and then I shouted for Ted for a solid thirty seconds from behind the *long wooden high top table*. Manager Fred (also a fake name) won’t hear it.

So I resolve to deal with Manager Fred later, and go on to help the customer. Well, after ignoring me twice, he’s in no mood to deal with my “attitude problem.” He reaches into his bag and pulls out a 17” notebook computer with an aluminum case that’s been dinged to hell. I ask him what the problem seems to be, and he begins to rant. It’s too long to write here, so I’ll just touch the major points. Only two months old, screen “suddenly broke” while he was asleep, shoddy workmanship, battery “only” lasts five hours, blah blah blah.

I open the screen and press the power key. The screen lights up, but is f-ed to all hell. What had happened was that he’d placed a pen, pencil, stylus, tiny marital aid, or some other device on the keyboard and had tried to close the lid. I carefully examined the machine, just trying to buy time because I knew he wouldn’t react well to what I was going to tell him, then took a deep breath and plunged in.

“Sir, as it turns out, the cause of your issues with the LCD is a pen that was placed on the keyboard on this row of keys here. I can replace the LCD, but because this is accidental damage, it isn’t covered by your ThingCare plan.”

Those were the magic words. All of a sudden, this guy is bright red and bulging out of his shirt. I attempted to stay calm, but this guy was scaring the living hell out of me. He starts to shout about how I’m attempting to rip him off, and this computer was working just fine, and he doesn’t even *own* a pen, and how dare I accuse him of being so stupid, and a hundred other things.

I wait for him to finish, and then I told him “Sir, I’m sorry, but as you can see on the LCD-” to which he replies by screaming at me about how I need to get off the drugs and stop hallucinating before I come to work. “I’m sorry, sir. That’s LCD, not LSD. As you can see, the LCD has two distinct points where the ends of a long, thin cylindrical object came in contact with the screen and crushed it. That’s why there’s these jagged points. It’s like how a windshield spiderwebs if a rock bounces on the highway and hits it.”

Well, he’s had enough of my attitude problem now. He’s leaning over the *long wooden high-top table* and yelling six inches from my face, using some seriously vile language to threaten lawsuits against my job and my company. He even at one point alluded to the idea of waiting in the parking lot for me. My manager heard the word “lawsuit” and was there in a flash to try to defuse the situation, which failed spectacularly.

Manager Fred attempts to tell Ted the same thing I did, while I’m backing away slowly. Manager Fred always had a gift for antagonizing people, and this guy was already close to physical violence. Finally, Ted shouts “That’s **NOT** accidental damage! **THIS** is accidental damage!”

He picks up his 17” computer by a corner, and flings it across the *long wooden high-top table*, as if he’s [Oddjob from GoldenEye](http://imgur.com/L7ZIvhA). It barely missed me and smashed the white plexiglass behind me. Someone had apparently heard the commotion and ran to get the mall security, who saw the guy throw the notebook at me and tackled him to the ground.

After an arrest for assault and attempted battery, police reports, sworn statements, and all sorts of other mess, I’m now well over my 26 hours of work and into hour 28, and the store is still yet to be cleaned up for closing. I clear it with my fellow workers, then go to the office in Back of House and ask Manager Fred if I can be excused early as I’ve just suffered a near injury and a terrifying experience, and the adrenaline I was running on has run out.

Manager Fred launches into a truly insulting speech about my incompetence in defusing situations, how I’m too lazy to do my job, and just as he’s starting in on me about trying to take off work early cause I’m “a big pussy,” he notices I’ve got my iPhone (first-gen, gifted to me by my former company when it premiered) out and asks what the hell I’m doing.

I reply “I just put in my two weeks via email, so it’s in writing.” He hears the email ding on the iMac behind him, shouts “You don’t *get* two weeks. You’re fired **NOW**.” and escorts me out. I smiled the whole way out, and the next morning I went to the labor offices for my state’s government and filed a report. Manager Fred was called in for a hearing some short days later. Of course, he lied his ass off, even attempting to say I never turned in a resignation letter.

I proved I did by showing them the email on my phone, and the labor board ruled that because I was fired as a result of turning in two-week notice, I was entitled to the full 80 hours of pay I should have received had I been allowed to complete the work. I thanked them, gave Fred a mocking bow so that I came down to his height, and walked out. The pay was direct deposited into my account the day after the hearing.

So that’s my story. Never told that one in it’s full form before. Thank you guys for the opportunity to get that night off my chest, and for bearing with me through that 1,500 word soliloquy of a terrible night.

The first, if you missed it is [""I have cancer and a lot of money""](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/17fuaq/i_have_cancer_and_a_lot_of_money/) .

This event took place last spring while I was working as a cashier at the Orange competitor of the store of the previous story. 

It was just me and the Head Cashier up at the registers, and because of the really crazy spring we had last year it was 75F and busy in March (don't worry, the snow came back). So, I'm doing my job as efficiently as pleasantly as I could and then this guy shows up in my line with three products. Innocent enough. He has his son with him, and his son is probably about 26-28, so this guy was early-mid 60s, so we'll just call him CWAK (Creeper with a Kid).

I start ringing CWAK's stuff and do the pretty standard 'Did you find everything all right today?' and of course, as is the traditional response of creepers, he responds, 'No. I need a phone number.' 

So, I very hesitantly suggest that we have a phone book at the Service Desk and he might do well to check there.

CWAK of course doesn't realise that this was indeed a cue to CUT THAT SHIT OUT so he decides to clarify that it was indeed my phone number he was looking for. At this point, his son has his head buried behind his hands and looks like he wants the world to swallow him there. That or this wasn't the first time his dad had done this. Whatever.

I politely indicate that that is not available. And CWAK continues pressuring, offering a date. Then suggesting that maybe I 'check him out' too. The son is now over by the double doors, just hoping that this ends.

Eventually this guys stops his shit and realises that he's not getting my phone number by just asking so he tries as different technique. The really fucked up compliment-like-insult.

""I bet your parents are really disappointed in a girl like you working retail at your age. Don't worry, I like it.""

Ew. I'm so appalled now that I can't respond. My head cashier is giving me the 'Do I need to step in?' look. But before I can indicate one way or the other I get.

""Wow. Just look at how red you are."" Then he calls over to his son ""Look at how embarassed she is!""

At this point, I've pretty much had enough. So I respond ""Well someone needs to be embarassed for you.""

That did the trick! CWAK quietly grabbed his stuff and shuffled off, his son giving me one last look of 'I'm sorry. I can't help him' before disappearing off into the unseasonably warm afternoon.

Anyway, one night this woman comes in and wants to exchange an old car battery. It was still within its warranty, but had entered the ""prorated"" portion of its guarantee. In other words, she only got some money back, not the full purchase price. I explained this to her, she was cool with it, and for simplicity's sake let's just say she was going to get $20 back, which we agreed would be applied towards the purchase of her new battery. She gets her new battery which rings up with tax to (let's just say) $40. I apply the $20 cash to the total, she pays the other $20, takes her battery and leaves.

BUT WHERE'S THE FUNNY?

The funny came 10 minutes later, when Giganto the Mountain King came thundering into the store, the battery in his big, beefy, stubby hands. Homeboy slams the battery down on the counter and just lays into me about ""ripping off his wife."" I was used to this kind of treatment, because I was in the shithole south and nobody is nice to clerks at return desks. I ask him to explain the dealio and he pulls out the receipt and *shoves* it in my face. ""Where my $20 credit!""

Oh joy.

I show the man where I had applied $20 in cash at the bottom, which had come from the return of the old battery. Nope, not good enough. He was zeroed in on the fact that the battery *rang up at the full price*. I explained to him that the $20 off was a cash credit, not a discount on the battery's regular price. He just didn't get it. AT ALL. Homey kept getting louder and louder, accused me of pocketing the $20 and making his wife pay the full price, typical moron bullshit.

Then it happened. 

After the umpteenth attempt to explain that the reason he saw two cash entries in the tender section, and showing him the slip from the return and how the amount from that equaled the first cash entry, THE FAT STUPID MOTHERFUCKER PICKS UP THE FUCKING CAR BATTERY AND THROWS IT AT ME.

He hucked it straight at my chest. I jumped back and spun to the side but it still caught my upper arm and left a hella-nasty bruise on it. The car battery landed on the floor and promptly began spewing/leaking/bleeding ACID everywhere. I look back at Giganto, whose 400lb ass is trying to come over the counter at me, and I grab the phone and use the PA system to call for every manager up to the front because EMERGENCY.

They all come running, and one manager is pulling Giganto back off the other side while the store manager (to her credit) is doing her best to neutralize the acid with baking powder and contain the mess. They FINALLY get Giganto calmed down, and then the he said/she said bullshit starts. The managers review the slips, and while they did determine I did everything by store policy, the one manager bends the truth just a hair (making up some nonsense procedural mistake I had ""made"") so Giganto could, in theory, exit the situation with a little dignity. I'm used to this tactic, so I apologize for the (completely made-up) ""error"".

That's when round two started. Giganto's wife was back in the store by now, she was crying, cops got involved, etc. Long story short: Giganto swore to God he was never come back to our store, because it was full of liars and cheats. I had a nasty bruise on my arm for a while, and the floor behind the returns desk was ruined. We reviewed the security tapes later and my direct boss couldn't believe my sweet Matrix-style moves.

That place was seriously just the worst six years of my life. I have dozens, if not hundreds, of shitty stories from there. thought this would be my first foray into /r/TalesFromRetail. Hope y'all enjoy!

I have always carried many different phones, from the iPhone to basic flip phones that can barely text. I, personally, prefer my android phone. After having an iPhone then working in the industry I made my choice. I don't hate the iPhone, selling it pays my bills, but I try to get customers to know about androids and their pros over the iPhone. Some people just want the iPhone, period. No problem, it's yours, I am not one to argue with you.

But this one guy... damn... I had to set him straight.

Before we begin, this is before the iPhone 5, and the Galaxy S3 was coming but not out yet.

Two friends come up, One guy we will call Steve, because he was the apple fanboy, the other we will call Fred. Fred wants a new phone, and wants to know about all of them. Steve keeps saying ""You're wasting your time, just get the iPhone."" Fred ignores him, and I present a few phones to him.

After going through one or two phones Steve speaks up. ""Don't listen to this guy, he just gets paid more to sell the crappy phones, isn't that right bro?""

I am not your bro. ""No, it doesn't matter what phone I sell you, I get paid the same"" (actually, a slight lie, there ARE phones I get extra spiffs on, but it is usually the cheap crappy ones and I never push those sales. Apple never gives those spiffs, but it is an easy sell for fanboys).

""I bet you got an iPhone. You know what the best is.""

""Yes, I do."" I pull out my Galaxy S2, which is one of the phones Fred was looking at. ""I love this phone, it's really great, and I would pick it over an iPhone anyday. But that is my choice.""

Fred - ""Yeah, it does seem like it's one of your-""

Steve - ""That ain't got shit on the iPhone""

*sigh* okay, this is where I start going into pushy mode. I pull up the specs on both the Galaxy S2 and the iPhone 4s. The S2 outshines it in pretty much every catagory.

Steve - ""Whatever, numbers don't mean anything! Preformance matters.""

Me - ""Can I see your iPhone?""

I open his iPhone and open the internet browser.

AFTER that I unlock my phone, open the browser. Load the homepage, then go to google, look up something random (giraffe I think) and load the wikipedia page.

Oh look, the iPhone has finished loading the homepage.

Steve - ""Well I hear Samsung makes really crappy phones, they break all the time!""

I throw my phone across the store. Pick it up, pull out a pen and stab it repeatedly on the screen. not a dent or scratch.

Me - ""Now can I see your iPhone and try that?""

Steve - ""HELL NO!""

In the end, Fred laughed at the whole spectacle. Steve tried to bring up a few arguments (more apps, easier to use, etc) but I brought them down (more FREE apps on android, more customizable to work the way you want it, etc.) In the end Fred bought the same phone I had, but Steve still said he would regret it.

They were always incredibly polite to us and the more senior employees knew them by first-name basis. I had only been working there for a few months at this time and I'm incredibly shy, but they were slowly getting me to open up.

At the time I was working there, it wasn't mandatory to wear smocks, so I was just in my every day clothes. That day I was wearing one of my favorite shirts. It was a picture of a squid and it said ""Free hugs."" I was working the register while their group came in and ordered their drinks, so I'm making small chit-chat with them. They ask me about my infant daughter and how we are both doing (things had been really tough because I am a single mom) so I greatly appreciated them asking. Chit-chat continues and one by one they start paying for their meals.

The mother (this is a family owned construction company, so they all work and own together, and go to lunch together) finishes paying for her meal and comes up to me from around the register counter and I am freaking out a little bit. ""Ma'am? Uhm?"" is all I can mutter and she reaches out to give me a hug. She says, ""We all get a free hug with our meals today, right?"" and gave the warmest laugh I had ever heard.

I work in a small clothing store that is present in most malls. Because we sell brands that are affiliated with drugs and sometimes gang related emblems, a lot of our shoplifter base are guys in gangs. And we have A LOT of shoplifters, the most in our mall. A few weeks ago, a coworker of mine and assistant manager of the store was working alone from open-five. She is petite, 5'1"" and no more than 120 pounds. We are going to call her Jane. Due to our company policy, approaching shoplifters must be with respect and kindness. We may only offer to hold their items that were clearly stuffed in their bag up at the front for them. Basically, every approach towards a shoplifter must be riddled with a ""customer service"" angle. Anyway, back to the story. So in walks two guys, regular shoplifters. We identify one of them in conversation with eachother as ""kiss lip tattoo guy"" as he (and the rest of his inferred gang) have a tattoo of a red kiss mark on their necks.  This guy comes in all the time and gets away with boatloads of clothes. He is the slickest motherfucker. 

So Lip Kiss guy grabs some camo skinny jeans and asks for a fitting room. Jane lets him in. When he comes out, he doesn't have the jeans in hand (SHOCKER) and he walks over to ""shop"" around some more. Jane then notices that he has the camo jeans underneath the pants that he wore into the store, as she can see the camo print peeking up from the top of his other pant's waist band. Then she notices that he his tightly gripping the sensor in his hands, obviously looking for a hiding spot. She walks over to him, puts on her fake smile, stands about six feet away and says 

J: Did you find that on the floor? I can take that for you and put it in our bin.

KLG: What the fuck are you talking about?

J: The sensor in your hand, it's the store's property and it will set off an alarm if you walk out with it. I can put it in our sensor bin for you.

KLG: I dont have nothin' in my hands (he says, as he not-so-discreetly slips the sensor into his pocket)

J: Well, I just saw you put it in your pocket. 

Kiss Lip Guy then turns around so that his back is facing her, then just as quickly turns back around and punches Jane square in the jaw while saying ""Dumb white bitch.""

Jane fell to the ground from the force of the punch after her neck whipped around, and hit her head on our concrete floor. A woman and her two very young girls run over crying as the woman tells Jane that she is calling 911. The men (If you can even call them men) calmly walk out of the store. When Jane re-gains her ability to stand, she chases after the men making a scene in the mall so that they will be caught. She screams ""That man just punched me in the face!"" over and over while pointing at the man. All the other mall workers come out from their stores to see what the commotion is all about. When Kiss Lip Guy hears her screaming, he comes after her AGAIN. He turns around, running at her, fists ready. At this point, a man working at another store runs out and creates a barrier between Kiss Lip Guy and Jane, and this sends Kiss Lip Guy running. A pack of mall workers chase after him and got his license plate number. Jane is feeling really terrible at this point, obviously in pain. And the pain is even greater because not a week earlier Jane got a concussion while doing manual labor by herself at work and our company made her work a twelve hour shift the very next day. 


The best part about this fucked up story? Jane got punched around 3 o clock. She immediately called our District Manager (as our store is without any managers right now besides Jane who is a mere assistant still in her teen years) and she explained the situation to Our DM while crying and obviously shaken up. Our DM's response? ""Haha, Oh man that sucks. You're okay to work the rest of the day right? Just let me know how things go. Talk to you later."" And she hangs up. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME. Jane then emails our DM explaining that she doesn't feel safe in the store and has had a horrible day and would like to recover at home. Our DM responds ""Well who do you think is going to come in for you? you are going to have to work with [Manager from nearby store] on that."" the message was very cold and unsympathetic in any way. Jane then calls our Loss Prevention guy and explains the situation to him and the fact that our DM wouldn't let her leave. His response? ""Oh I understand, yeah just go ahead and take a five in the back. Freshen up."" Wow, what a savior. Thanks for the five mins off, amirite? Should be enough time to recover from being physically assaulted by a grown man! 

Eight o clock rolls around, one hour before closing time, and Jane gets a call on her cell phone from human resources saying that she can leave. Gee, thanks. 

Jane then has to work two days after this incident, and every day for the rest of the week. Jane sent an email to our DM on one of these days and explains that she is quitting and cannot work her two weeks for fear of being in the store. They had not caught the guy that did this, not to mention he is, as I said, in a gang (the police confirmed this from his record of past assaults and gang affiliation) and she feared for her safety. I don't fucking blame her. Our DM then called her threatening her saying that if she quits then ""she cannot use [Store] as a reference."" Really? Worked here for three years and she can't use the store as a reference because she feels unsafe and doesn't want to be there anymore?

Which, like today, will always ensure good service. Sorry for the wall of text.

So I'm at the furniture store picking out a chair. I decide on the one I like (has 4 legs, not too high or low, comfortable, average quality but a good price, you know the deal) and I place the order for the chair I want at the counter.

The kind young lady said ""That's all fine, if you could just take this receipt to the warehouse around the back of the store and ring the green button, they will bring it out for you."" She repeated this again, as I'm sure these simple instructions must baffle numerous customers each day.
Take receipt to back of store, ring green button.

So I drive around to the back of the store, where there are 3 cars waiting at the store's clearly signed warehouse door. A middle aged woman (another customer) was being very animated with her hand signals about where I should pull up. She was closest to the door, then two other cars behind her. So I pull up to the end of the line, and I'm walking towards the door when I hear from the woman in the front, let's call her WIF:

WIF: ""Excuse me, I'm first in line and I've been waiting here for 10 minutes already.""

To which I reply: ""That's fine, I'm just handing in my receipt."" as I ring the green button. She looks baffled.

A young lad (YL), about my age, comes out. 

YL: ""Hey mate, how's it going?""

Me: ""Well thanks, I'm just here to pick up a chair""

YL: Looks at recepit ""Ok man...Oh, these are right at the back of the warehouse sorry, it'll be about 5 minutes, I just have to move a few things to get to it.""

Me: ""Yeah, take your time, I'm not in a hurry.""

In an instant, WIF is at my back already raising her voice at YL. 

WIF: ""Why haven't I got my things yet?!""

YL: ""I'm sorry, have you handed in your receipt to someone?""

WIF: Confused ""What?""

YL: ""I need your receipt to see what you purchased, they would have told you to hand it in here when you were at the counter.""

WIF: ""They just told me to drive round here and you'd give me my stuff!""

YL: ""Oh I'm sorry, they should have told you to ring the green bell. I just need your receipt to know what to get from the warehouse.""

WIF: ""Ugh!"" as she troddles back to her car.

By now the other two customers had remembered that the cashier told them to hand the receipt in, and were now at the warehouse door also. So we had all handed our receipts in just as WIF had returned from her car with hers.

As she hands it into YL she states:
""Just so you know, I was here first, the woman with the baby is next, then the couple, and this guy, (pointing at me) who got here first, is the last.""

And then it happened.
YL gave me that look. I'm sure all of us in service have given that look. The unspoken eye contact where we both know what's going on that just says ""seriously?"".

Me: ""Yeah, like I said, I'm not in a hurry, so take your time.""

WIF: ""Well I AM in a hurry! AND I've already been waiting here 25 minutes! (although she told me it was 10 minutes about 2 minutes ago) SO I GET MY STUFF FIRST!""

YL: Looks at her receipt ""You purchased this at the counter 2:04, it's now 2:15.""

WIF: ""Yeah, 25 minutes!""

The looks between all of us now were priceless.

YL: Being polite enough not to make here look even more foolish ""Well I'm very sorry, but you didn't ring the bell so I didn't know you were here, I'll go get your items now.""

YL hops on his forklift and we all return to our cars. A minute later he returns with what seems to be some nursery furniture for the mother with the baby. I'm two cars length from WIF but I can still hear her claiming ""But I was first"" and ""That's her job, not yours!"" as he is helping the new mother lift and fit heavy items into her hatchback.

Young mother drives off.

And then there were three.

I was pretty sure I knew what was going to happen next, but I was also not going the be surprised if he would return with WIF's furniture just to get rid of her.

But nope. Out YL comes with an outdoor dining set for the couple in the middle.

WIF: ""Aw, for FUCK'S SAKE!""

YL: As he's passing her ""Yeah, sorry, this was right in front of your order and I had nowhere else to put it.""

WIF: ""Uuuurrrrrgghhhh!"" Like she had just stubbed her toe. 

YL: Who is now clearly giving no fucks and just wants to rub some salt in those bitchy wounds ""I'm sorry, but if you handed in your receipt when you got here, we wouldn't have this problem.""

WIF: Some under her breath muttering

YL: ""What was that, sorry?""

WIF: ""Just Hurry. THE. FUCK. UP!""

This woman is now so irate, and YL is just continuing to be the most chilled guy on earth as he helps load the couple's dining set onto their trailer.

Now it's just me and WIF. And while YL is in the warehouse, she start's yelling at me, like all this is my fault.

WIF: ""He better not bring your stuff back now, you even said that you're not in a hurry!""
Me: ""Umm...No, I'm not""

WIF: ""Why not?!""

I'm pretty sure even she knew how stupid this question was after I gave her a confused look and chose not to answer.

The heat was now on, she was tapping her feet, pacing back and forth, shaking her head. It was like someone had just told her  that someone had stolen her identity and used her credit cards to purchase shitty furniture and they also had to wait in line.

And then it happened. The knight in shining fluorescent returns with his forklift carrying one single chair. He rode straight past WIF, just smirking at me the whole time during his slow and steady voyage.

WIF: ""You have got to be fucking shitting me!""

YL just pays no attention as he very carefully helps me load up my chair.

Me: ""I know how it is man, you're doing this deliberately right?""

YL: ""Yep. And it just happens to be my smoke break now, so she can wait at least another five."" 

We both shared a little chuckle as obscenities were being screamed in our direction.

I drove of with a sense of joy, satisfaction, and a well priced piece of Chinese assembled furniture. All in all, it was a good transaction.

Sometimes, it just pays to be pleasant and follow simple instructions.

Long time lurker, first time poster.


**BACKGROUND:** I work as a Box Office Assistant for a well-known theatre in the UK. We have 3 venues within the theatre and at least 5 shows a day (including stand-up comedy, straight theatre and musicals). Because of the amount and the diversity of the shows we get a lot of varying customers.


The way that a customer can collect their pre-paid tickets is simple. We ask *What show are you here for?*. Customer replies. We then ask *And what's your surname?*. Customer replies. We find their tickets in the box marked with the show name. The we ask *Can you please confirm your postcode..?*. Customer confirms the postcode. We hand over the tickets. They go enjoy their show. We get on with the rest of the waiting customers. Simples.


Except when apparently we are not seen as people...


I had one customer this evening that was just so rude and necessary that it made me question how some people get through a day treating other as they do.


I saw this guy walk up to the desk: Tall, skinny, around 25-28, visibly gay (you know the type) and he was eating a sandwich.


Now it's annoying enough when someone is eating at the desk, but most people have the common decency to stop when they are talking to you. This was not one of those people.


He approached the desk and shoved his credit card straight in my face while he was stuffing his face. I calmly made eye contact and asked what show he was here for. He once again just pushed his card in my face. I tried to look around it and asked again. He had finished his bite and so he very kindly answered me. So I asked him his surname, hoping I would be able to get it out of him before his next mouthful. Nope. He takes a large bite and once again thinks that his card is enough. So I clarify that I need him to confirm the surname that the tickets were booked under, as it can sometimes differ to the one on the card. He tells me, in the most condescending, rude manner that I nearly wanted to refuse him service, because it had been that kind of **week**. But I kept my calm and got his tickets. He then tries to grab them out of hand, but I manage to keep hold of them. I then ask him to confirm his post code.


The look he gave me was one of absolute shock and horror. It was like I was asking for his first born...


So I say *""You just need to confirm your postcode for security reasons""*. And he just looks at me. Leans in and says:


&gt; ""I'M EATING!""


Right in my face. Sandwich flies out of his mouth and hits my face. At this point my colleague [lets call him PC] who was manning the register beside me, shot up out of his seat and pushed the man back. I was just in total shock. This guy showed no guilt in what he had  done. Just took the tickets out of hand and walked away. I couldn't say anything. The other customers who were there (remember at least 5 shows on, so the foyer is constantly busy) just stood around agog at what they had just seen. 


A very kind lady came up and gave me a napkin to wipe my face. I was shaking at this point. PC radioed the DM who was there straight away. PC told her what had happened, as I was still shaken up, and gave a description of the man. She radioed for security (which we have because there is a public bar on the ground floor) and told them what happened.


The next thing I heard were shouts from the stairwell, along the lines of: ""You can't treat me like this!"" / ""I'm a paying customer"" / ""I haven't done anything wrong"". And then I saw him being escorted off the property, still eating his bloody sandwich.


And then he said those magic words: ""This isn't the end, I'm calling my lawyer""

To which the security man replied: ""Great, maybe he can explain what 'threatening behavior' and 'right to refuse entry' means"" and slams the door in his face.


I then went on my break and just about broke down.


I've had unpleasant customers in the past, which I can get into at another point, and I've had absolutely brilliant customers, but this is the first one that really affected me on a personal level. 


I don't know if I'm being stupid, but it's those kinds of people that make me loose hope in humanity...

They do not open for a while now, so the place is a CRAZY mess of pallets, boxes, no product out, and employees from various other locations in sweats and casual gear helping set up. Huge signs on the door reading ""GRAND OPENING ON (date)"", windows mostly covered in half rolled up signage/paper and incomplete, well, everything. The area this place is located is also newly developing and many other stores (including a different store next to us, a few in the center elsewhere) are not open for business. All the stores have large signs informing the populace of the opening date. You get it.

Anyway, due to the volume of employees entering/exiting, it's really hard to have the front locked constantly since we usually worked in waves all around the HUGE store. So we would have people stroll in and look around at the CHAOS, realize their mistake and leave.

This is not about those people. This is about the one who strolled in and was fucking ANGRY that we have nothing to sell them. Unfortunately, we also have brand reps who come in and set up their section. They're nice enough but resemble our customers a lot (don't know where their area is exactly and look around a bit) and it's too hard to check every one of them out each time. No product out so not too concerned about theft.

Well, Mrs. Bitchy Bitch-Bitch (as I shall call her) happened to pop in while we were all busting our collective asses in the back doing a trash run. I happen to go towards the front to retrieve a wayward pallet, when someone rudely shouts ""Uh, EXCYOOSE ME!!"" I look over and figure it's just a tired brand rep and say ""What's up?""

""What's UP? That's how you talk to people?? What's UP is that you have literally NOTHING for sale. What is 'UP' is that I drove all the way here and you have NOTHING for sale.""

""Uh.. We aren't open yet, pretty sure we aren't even listed yet, we don't open for a long time. We're setting up. The store will be open next month. Sorry for the confusion, please come back then and we will have plenty of products out. Sorry again.""

""Oh, of course, that's why nothing said that you weren't open out front, you all need to fix that.""

""The signs on the doors and windows say ""Coming Soon"" with our Grand Opening date, ma'am.""

""No, they *don't*.""

""Ma'am, this way, please. See these doors? The signs here say ""Grand Opening (date)."" Just check the door signs, a lot of places over here are just getting set up, like next door and (business) over there.""

Mrs. B B-B leaves in a huff. Whatevs, my hour's break in in like 5 minutes.

**FAST FORWARD A FEW MINUTES INTO MY BREAK.**

Outside, having a smoke, chilling in-between next door to other unopened store. Guess who comes walking back towards my store? Yep, Mrs. B B-B. Not clocked in for my break so I go into ignore mode with my headphones in just rockin' out. She walks past me, over to other closed store. She's halfway there when I turn to watch this unfold and take out my headphones. This store has merchandise being stocked so it's locked. She does.. not expect this. Pulls hard, door doesn't open. Pulls harder, then tries to push. Smacks the door with her hand when an employee of that store opens the door. Immediately tell employee is a SASSY Black Lady. ""Yeah, you here to set up?"" 

*""Uh, NO*, I was trying to *shop.""*

""We ain't open yet, sign's on the door."" *SLAM*

Mrs. B B-B starts cursing at the door, I guess S.B.L. probably didn't stick around to listen. Mrs. B B-B looks over, sees me.

""Oh, you probably thought that was HILARIOUS don't you? You'll think it's funny when I call your store when it opens and complain about your treatment of customers. Or I should just walk back in and tell your manager now, how about that?""

""Yeah, it was pretty *fucking* funny actually, since I told you about this. I don't work at this place, I just help set up the store, I'm off the clock now, you have no idea who I am, and you aren't a customer since we have nothing to sell, you're just an intruder at this point. The signs clearly say ""Authorized Personnel Only"" which obviously doesn't include you, so you trespassed and I was nice about it. I even warned you about other businesses being similar which I didn't have to do. Also, the signs are on EVERY FUCKING STORE'S DOORS. Learn to read. *Bye-bye now, go away*."" *wavy hand motion*

The big box store basically allows a pizza place and a coffee shop to operate out of it, and in turn, the coffee place and pizza place kind of work like privately owned versions of the normal store. They can do most of the things a chain can, but we lack the ability to do things like issue cards or, in the pizza places' case, do special orders. Both of the food places are well known, national brands with at least three shops just within our city.

So today, I was running the coffee place by myself. This lady in a yellow shirt and big sunglasses comes up. She will be Yellow for the purposes of this story.

Yellow: mumblemumble

Me: I'm sorry, what was that?

Yellow: -gesture of annoyed shock, as in 'can you seriously not hear me?'- a [XL] sized [DRINK].

I can't really get into words the opinion she seemed to have of me. A lot of people who come into this type of coffee shop are super particular people used to dealing with the same baristas day in and day out somewhere else. They get really, really snippy and pissy if you ask them to slow down or repeat complex orders, and that was what she was doing. Anyways. I go to the menu to punch it in, but I find that we don't have it available in the XL. We have other drinks like it available in that size, but because of how she has modified it I simply can't ring it up in that size.

Me: I'm sorry ma'am, but I can only do [DRINK] in a L size. Is that alright?
Yellow: -more annoyed shock. Up your mental image from a bratty teen to someone who was just told a ridiculous story that ended with their car being soiled by a large dog- Uh, yes it is. I get that here all the time. Are you serious? They do that for me here every time I come in! What...?

She said all that rather quickly, and looked like she was prepared to continue. I interrupted, trying my best to stay cool, and tried to explain that whatever she'd had here before, I was physically unable to process her request. And honestly? If she had been a bit nicer about it I would have even considered doing it for her.

She settles for a large but makes a really big deal about it. Whatever. I remain polite throughout the remainder of our time together, and she even seemed to get a lot nicer the longer she was there. Not apologetic, just... Not as 'holier-than-thou'. I finished her drink and that was that, right?

Nope. A few minutes later she comes back with half the drink consumed and stands at the cash register. I'm on the other side of my little drink makey area doing something, and I looked up to address a customer next to her about what toppings -that- customer wanted on their drink. She immediately interrupted me and got between us.

Yellow: Excuse me, I'm sorry, but I'm a VIP gold member at this store and I -trails off and kind of huffs and shrugs-. This just isn't acceptable, I would like you to refill this with-

A lot of people that come into my store are regular customers because it's a small town. I ALWAYS try and make sure my customers, who aren't dick bags, get 110% amazing customer service. There's a lady who is a stroke victim who frequently shops at our store. She's the nicest lady and everytime I'm working I'm her personal helper, which I don't mind. I've actually been doing this for the last 3 &amp; 1/2 years. She comes in, finds me, and I help her shop. Everyone at work knows this, so it's no biggie if I disappear off my register. She always ask where I'm at when she comes in and is disappointed when I'm not there (from what my managers have told me).

So tonight I'm on my lunch break. My closing office assistant tells me the lady is asking about me. She told the lady I was at lunch, and the lady said she would patiently wait until I was done. The last time I had talked to this customer, my fiancee's grandfather had been put into I.C.U. from a massive heart attack and was on life support. This was a week and a half ago. 

When I come to help her tonight, she looks at me and ask
""Was that your fiancee's grandfather that I saw in the paper?""
Me: ""Yes, sadly he passed away"" 

She tells me she is sad to hear about it. I continue to help her with shopping, get her checked out, and help her out to her car. 
Even though I have refused every time, she tips me the usual $3-$5 as she usually does. I'm getting ready to go back inside and finishing chatting and telling her how my fiance and I are going to cook spaghetti for her Grandmother tomorrow night. Just as I'm about to leave....

Customer: ""Here hobbsarelie83, take this"" 
She pulls out a $20
Me: ""I can't take this""
Customer : ""Take it and use it to buy the food for tomorrow night""

That being said, porn gets stolen—a lot. Since it was one of my jobs to help reduce losses as well as stocking the new magazines I decided to start putting no-go's on the porn. On top of that, I would quickly count the ones on the shelf every week, and correct our inventory for missing ones (usually 5-10 a week). 
One night just after completing aforementioned task I leave to go home, but since I was hungry I decided to eat fresh across the street first. Well upon returning to pick up my car, I notice that there are several police cruisers parked to block the entrances. Intrigued, I go inside to see what the hubbub is about. Well I guess in the ten minutes or so that I was gone a group of four boys only 10-12 years old triggered the theft alarm. Two of them just ran, and two stayed behind. My manager was a wizard at convincing people that they should stay since we couldn't actually make them stay.
So the police are there, and we decide that they are just dumb kids so they shouldn't be charged. The police call the kids parents, and get the first two to give up the names of their accomplices. They are being very calm and professional (I for one don't much like the police). They tell the kids that they are going to not be in trouble this time, and how what they did was immoral and stuff like that. I was going to leave at this point, as it was really a boring and routine shoplifting procedure.
But, as I am leaving the office a lady comes in saying she is the mother of one of the two. She was way too calm about the whole thing. She asked if her kid was being arrested, not worryingly more like she was making a note of how much dinner she needed to cook. And when the officers say ""no"" she asks if they could anyway, just to teach him a lesson. The officers say they really cant if the store doesn't press charges, which we really didn't want to.
Anyway, enter mother #2. This lovely woman immediately starts yelling at the police for wrongfully detaining her child. To which they explain that the boys not only admitted to it, there was video evidence. They also mention that they are not arresting or charging him, so he is more or less free to go.  Well, she just refused to believe that her little angel would do such a thing. And instead of taking her child and leaving with dignity, she starts screaming all sorts of profanity at these 6 or 7 cops. We are not in the office at this point. we are on the sales floor at the entrance. And she is yelling about how she will sue everyone here, she even points at a few customers and threatens to sue them for I assume existing. 
At this point the manager asks her to leave with her child. To which she refuses. Conveniently the police were there, so they say she can leave on her own or they could remove her for us. Begrudgingly she leaves, still yelling. But only for a couple minutes. She came running back in throwing rocks, I shit you not ROCKS. The police were in the office, just chatting with the manager about something, when one of them shatters the window between the office and the floor. I rarely enjoy watching police arrest people, but my god did it feel good to see that woman pepper sprayed. 
As I was leaving for the final time that night the first overly calm mother looks at me and said, ""I always hated that bitch.""

A little information first. The chain of stores had recently changed a coupon from an open ""10 dollars off"" to a ""10 dollars off an item 10 or more"" because customers were coming in and getting $9.99 items for free.

So i'm working at the register, blessed that most customers are nice and reasonable. megabitch walks over with an umbrella that costs $9.99 and the $10 off coupon. I had a similar situation the day before and the man understood and found something else. 

me: I'm really sorry, the coupon requires the item to be over ten dollars.

megabitch: No. I refused to be played with for a penny. I want your manager.

I call over my supervisor who is just as good, if not better than the managers, L.

L: I'm sorry, the computer doesn't allow for this to go through.

megabitch: Are you the manager? 

L: I'm the floor supervisor...

(cutting in)MB: NO. I want to talk to the MANAGER.

I call over the Manager in charge, S, who is pretty relaxed.

Before he can say anything, MB starts going off: This is ridiculous I am going to your corporate office and complaining I refuse to be played with for a penny!

S: Why are you being so mean? I didn't even say anything yet.

MB: Are you the manager?! This is ridiculous! 

S:Yeah, I'm the assistant store manager here. I didn't even say anything. You really don't need to be so mean, I was going to help you, jeez.

She was caught off guard and he put it through. she pulled out a piece of paper and wrote down his name. As I bagged her umbrella she said thank you and acted like nothing happened.

Apologies for it's length, but it's a semi-complex tale that deserves detail.

I worked at a rather busy gas station in a quite rich neighborhood for several years.  I was the closing cashier (rich people near an Interstate think that a 24-hour gas station would bring in ""undesirables"") which actually gave me quite a bit of authority.  The Manager usually left around 4pm, and we were open until 10.  So for six glorious hours, I was king of my little domain, which was the convenience store, the 12 pumps, the parking lot, and the car wash (which will figure into this story).

It was a rather nice spring day, and nice days tend to mean that the car wash will be busy.  Rich people with nice cars want their nice cars to stay looking like nice cars.  I was inside, selling cigarettes and trying to keep the local bored teens from stealing beer when a nice car drives at a higher-than-normal speed up from the car wash, through the gas pumps, and parks in a fairly incongruous angle in front of the doors to the store.  Out jumps an older lady, somewhere in her late 60s, dressed like she was trying out for Meryl Streep's part in The Devil Wears Prada.  Kinda looked like Streep, too.  She marched toward the doors with a ""*this transgression shall not stand*"" look on her face.  I steeled myself, and put on the CS fake smile.

Sadly, it's been a few years since this happened, so I cannot quote the conversation verbatim, but the upshot was that she was QUITE displeased with how clean her car was after going through the car wash.  I apologized, and offered to run her through again for free, which was Standard Reply #1 for anyone having an issue with the car wash.  Ah, but that just won't do.  Okay, Standard Reply #2 was to offer to cut her into the head of the line, something we didn't like doing because it made all the other customers mad.  But that wouldn't do, either.  Standard Reply #3, refund the money.  Nope, that won't do, either.

I'm now perplexed.  What did she want me to do?  Which is what I asked her.  Instead of getting an idea of whatever it was that she wanted done told to me, I was instead impaled by a gale-force tirade about the quality of the store, the employees, our intelligence levels, why we found it necessary to hire high schoolers, and several choice coarse epithets that drew concerned and irritated looks from the two other women who were in the store with their children.

At this point, I realized that nothing was going to placate this harpy.  I again apologized, and offered to give her the card for the General Manager so she could talk to her.  Which the lady slapped out of my hand, but added that she wanted to know what *I* was going to do about this.  I responded with ""I don't know, ma'am, you haven't told me what you would like to happen.""  This, of course, set her off on another tirade, but I was now the full focal point of her anger.  The more general comments she'd made earlier were now very specific insults about my intelligence, my work ethic, and my value as a human being.  With several swear words thrown around quite a bit.

Now, another minor bit of back story.  There was a reason that, at 26, I was working at a gas station.  I was in school, working on my second degree.

In law enforcement.

Customer Service smile dropped away, and it was replaced with Authoritative and Stern.  Calmly, I told this ""lady"" (though she didn't fit any definition of the word I know, exception the biological one) that if she insisted on insulting me and the station, and swearing in front of customers and their children, then we didn't want her business any more, that she was to leave, and that any further contact would have to go through the GM.

I'll give you a moment to allow your imagination to come up with a suitable idea of her reaction.  I'll give you a hint, it wasn't unicorns and rainbows.

So now I went from calm to rather loudly commanding her to leave the premises or else I would be calling the police.  To which she seemed completely nonplussed, and continued to rant.  Now, being someone who's going into law enforcement, I don't bluff when I say I'm gonna call in backup.  So I made the call.  (Another bit of backstory, the local police LOVED our store, because we were one of the few places they could come get snacks at prior to graveyard shift, and we called in DUII drivers to them on a regular basis).

Five minutes later, here comes the black-and-white cavalry.  The officer, whom I'd had numerous official and unofficial interactions with, comes into the store.  I gave him the ""holy hell, this idiot REALLY needs to be smacked and tossed out of here"" look, and he gave me a ""what, the she-hag?  She's that much trouble?"" look back.  She then turned and lit into the officer about what happened, lying the whole time.  She said that I had threatened her, that I had used racial and sexual slurs, and that I hadn't actually gotten her car cleaned, which was *obviously* theft.  The officer turned and looked at me, to which I simply responded ""We have five cameras and a microphone in the store.  Everything has been recorded.  If you'd like, I can call the GM and have her come down here and show you the tapes, because that's not what happened at all.""

The officer escorted the lady outside, where another newly-arriving officer faced the same tongue-lashing.  The first officer then took my statement, and asked what I wanted to do.  I told him that she had to be off the property, and that she could talk to the GM in the morning, but I didn't want to deal with her ever again.  The officer smiled knowingly, and walked back outside.

What followed was the officer telling her that, no matter what may have transgressed, he could find no evidence of a crime, and that since I was an employee here and had told her to leave, she had to leave.  Period.

I'm kind of surprised that the lady's head didn't just explode right there due to high blood pressure.  She started screaming at the cop, almost incoherently.  I could understand words or phrases here and there, like ""never"" and ""treated"" and ""have your badge"" and ""fuck.""  But she wouldn't leave.  The officer, keeping his cool, asked her three separate times if she was willing to leave.  She wouldn't directly reply to the question, just kept screaming.

So he arrested her for criminal trespass.  She did not go quietly.  I applauded.

Now, this is where the REAL fun begins.  Because, as it turns out, her rage slowly turned into dawning realization as she was driven to jail, and she began to plead with the officers to be let go.  When they declined, she tried to name drop by stating that her husband was a circuit court judge for the very county we were in.

Which turned out to be true!

So it became a minor bit of local drama.  Since she was, in fact, married to a local judge, none of the other judges in the county could try her case due to conflict of interest.  Not just that county, but two others as well, seeing as how she was a social climber and therefore was heavily involved in social events, elections, political groups, and such.  She had to be tried in court almost 100 miles away.  She plead guilty, got a fine, and did 100 hours of community service (which, really, for that kind of trespass is a reasonable punishment).  Her husband, publicly quite humiliated, retired early and divorced her.  I never saw her again after the trial.  My boss gave me a raise for ""dealing well with a difficult situation"" and a paid day off.  I spent that day at the beach, eating ice cream.

TL;DR - Entitled she-devil tries to push around a wage slave, he gets her arrested and gets mint-chocolate chip in a waffle cone as a reward.

I have gotten really good at pretending to be pleasant and ignoring other people's weaknesses and attitudes, but yesterday, I had a customer get to me. 

At my store, you have to have a military ID to shop there. People get around this by saying they are placing three orders (or whatever) and then have the person with the ID pay for all three orders. Now most of them are smart enough to understand that if you are placing three orders, you need to somehow separate the three different orders, so I know when to stop ringing. The black plastic bars found at the edge of most retail registers are particularly good at splitting up these orders, but if one is not skilled enough to know this, leaving a gap and telling me, ""Hey, this is where my order begins, so stop here.""

Yesterday, I had someone who for some reason had never been to a retail store ever before and did not understand this concept and did not tell me when her order began.  I rang in half of her order before she started screaming at me that that was her order.  She actually said to me, ""How dare you ring my order with hers!!!!""  She kept on for a minute or two about how I was so stupid.

Normally, I would apologize and let it go, but yesterday I didn't want to be fucked with, so I looked at her and said, nicely in my best sugar coated condescending voice, ""I am not a mind reader."" I grabbed the bar on the side of the register and showed it to the lady, and said,""This is a separator bar. It is used to separate orders. You place it in between orders, so I can tell when your order begins and the next one ends. Now you know.""

In fact, the person doing returns was also the only cashier. This worked about as well as you think it would: it didn't.

If a customer had a return, they would wait by the side of the register until the cashier had cleared the line, then if anyone had a return they would get serviced. If someone came along and wanted to check out during the return, they would have to call for back up. It sucked.

So, a black man comes into the store and needs to return something. No problem - I direct him towards the cashier, who has two people in line. He waits patiently for the cashier to finish, and once the line is empty, starts the return.

Not five seconds after she greets the customer and begin his return does a black woman come JOGGING down the aisle, waving her arms in the air at the cashier, screaming ""HEY HEY HEY"".

She gets up to the register and starts berating the cashier. She claims that the cashier had seen her coming, and because she was black, rushed to get the *other black person* there in front of her to *intentionally delay* her checking out... because she was black. That the cashier was racist and did not want to check out a black person, and proved it by doing a return for a *different* black person.

Absolutely mind boggling what her logic was. Long story short, the cashier thankfully did NOT say ""but he's black too!"" because I'm sure that would have caused a shitstorm.

So, today isn't being fun for me, for a bunch of personal reasons that I'd rather not get into.  So instead of the normal, crazy, 911-is-getting-called-at-some-point stories, I'm going to share a story that happened just after I stopped working at that station which should help me feel better, and restore just a tad bit of faith in people for everyone else.

In July of that year, I was fired from the station.  This came about because I had been caught by corporate on my cell phone while at work (didn't matter that I was getting a call from my mom telling me that my Grandma, who was in hospice, had just slipped into a coma, and probably wouldn't make it through the weekend) and the manager had no choice but to send ol' Osiris a pink slip.  I don't look good in slips, and pink is SO last year.  Seriously, keep up with fashion trends!

Anyway, while I was no longer an employee, I was still there on a semi-regular basis.  Several of the co-workers were good friends of mine and lived in the area, and my grandmother (the other one, the one in a coma didn't make it through the weekend.  She was 104, and I miss her terribly) lived just a mile away.  So I was in the area visiting on a regular basis.  The station had good prices for gas and a decent beer selection, so I would stop in and chat.

As I turned on to the cul de sac, I realized that there was a news van in the parking lot of the station, it's antenna extended and what looked a lot like an interview being conducted in front of the store.  I thought to myself ""Self (for that is what I call myself), this isn't normal.""  I looked around, but couldn't see any police cars, firetrucks, ambulances, or other governmental/emergency vehicles that may provide a clue as to what's going on.  So I park, walk over to the corner of the store out of camera shot, light up a cigarette, and proceed to try and overhear what's going on.

The reporter, resplendent in his dark blue I'm-on-the-scene-of-a-human-interest-story blazer, was speaking to the camera about someone's generosity.  However, I didn't see anyone with him aside from the camera man and a rather bored-looking broadcast tech.  Strange.  Stubbing out my cancer stick, I walk into the store to see a couple of my old co-workers.  They are BEAMING.  Not that stupid forced customer service smile we've all had to shove onto our faces like a bad Dia de los Muertos mask, but real, honest smiles of joy.

""Okay guys, what's going on?  The news is here, and you're all smiling wider than when we got those surprise Christmas bonuses last year.""

One of the guys then explains what's been happening all day.  Early in the morning, a man came in and asked to speak with the manager.  They went back to the officer and talked for a short while, after which he came out with a happy smile and she (the manager) came out looking stunned.  The man then went outside and stood in the middle of the pumps, waiting for the next car to arrive.  As it drove up, he walked around to where the attendant was talking to the driver.  The man held up his hand to stop the conversation, pulled out a $100 bill from his pocket, and said, ""fill them up, it's on me.""

And he had been doing that, for ever person who came into the store.  All day long.  When I arrived he'd been doing it for about 11 hours.  He hadn't left once.

The station had become quite busy about an hour after the guy showed up, as people called their friends and family and told them to come get free gas.  Even in a town as affluent as that one, $4 a gallon isn't exactly cheap.  It had died down as the evening wore on, but the man was pointed out to me, still standing out there at the pumps, talking with one of the attendants.  I asked the cashier why.

Apparently, the guy had recently been given a rather large inheritance, one he didn't feel that he should keep.  So he decided that the best way to get rid of the money was to make a whole bunch of people very happy by filling their tanks.  Over and over and over.

The reception by the community was shock, then a little suspicion, then grateful thanks.  Many people had told him throughout the day how that rather small act for him had made their day or week so much easier.  Several people who had been emptying change jars just so they could have enough gas to get to work were suddenly looking at full tanks.  Tears were shed.  Lots of them.  The entire station staff was in the best mood I'd ever seen.  And, obviously, someone had tipped off the local news, because they were down there covering the story for the evening news.

Not everyone had taken him up on his offer.  A few had declined so that one more person other than them could get it.  A few standoffish people didn't want anyone thinking they were getting charity.  But the vast majority of people simply thanked the man and left the station, holding money they had expected to spend and smiling broadly.

I never found out how much the guy spent that day, but it had to be a lot.  Our average intake per day was well over $100,000, so it wasn't cheap for him at all.  I also don't know where he kept the money, since even in $100s that would mean a pretty damn thick stack of cash.  All I know is that it was a beautiful thing to do, that his name was Dave, and that for one day he made a lot of people happy.

Most of them are nice, patient, and quite friendly. But there are some who make me want to rip my hair out. Anyway, to my story.

Last Tuesday, I was waiting in the foyer (where they keep the carts) for my boyfriend to pick me up after work. It had been a LONG day...a lot of grouchy, rude customers who seemed like their only purpose for living was to be difficult and mean. So there I was, leaning against the windows and watching for my boyfriend's car...when I hear ""I need that cart!"" So, being naturally curious, I turn around.

A rather obese woman was standing in front of an old woman in the last motorized cart we had available. The woman had her walker in the basket and was shopping with her daughter. The old woman looked up at the obese bitch and said, ""Excuse me?""

Bitch: I said I need that cart! It's the last one, I need it!

Old lady: I'm sorry, but I need it. I cant'--

Bitch: Get up! You have a walker! You don't need this scooter! I do! 

The old lady paused and looked at her daughter, then back a the bitch: Why do you need this cart?

Bitch: I'm disabled! Now get up!

Old lady, sweetly smiling: I'm sorry, but as far as I know, being fat and lazy is not a disability.

Then she swerved around the obese bitch, laughing her ass off. Her daughter whispered, ""Mom! I can't believe you just said that!""

The few of us who saw it were laughing to no end. The obese lady turned red and ran (more like shuffled) back out to her car. 

**Tldr; Fatty tries to take last scooter from old lady, old lady tells her off.**

**EDIT** I forgot to note that I watched the obese lady run back to her vehicle--which was at the BACK of the parking lot, no where near a handicap spot, she wasn't limping or showing signs of breathing troubles.

The wall blocked behind me, so he was effectively stopping me from being able to go anywhere.

""Give me your money!""  He said, aggressive voiced.
Without thinking I said ""no.""
""Give me a dollar?"" he responds, less aggressive.
I repeated no, and he looked downward and sad, then responded ""ok, ok"" and wandered off.

I rushed into work, only to find out that the same had happened to a coworker, only she gave him money.  We called the cops, and were told they were already on their way--someone else had called in the same issue.  

As soon as the cops arrived, blues flashing, several other people rushed out of the nearby grocery store.  This guy had tried to rob them also.  Altogether there were probably a dozen people freaking out, and it was devolving into a full scale panic.

Next thing you know, with a cop standing next to me, taking my statement beside the cop car, the guy comes right back to me and says again ""Give me your money.""  The cop immediately grabs the guy, who begins to bellow and yell incoherently in confusion.

I don't hear anything more about it for a few days, then I happen to look out over the parking lot and there's our friend, harrassing an old lady.  I call the cops again.

The cops take him away a second time, and one of them tells me that I should continue to call him in--but don't be surprised if someone tells me otherwise.

Later that day I get a call from a social worker, who says he heard I had an issue with Johnny.  Turns out Johnny isn't really all there and lives at a medical facility nearby.  Somehow, Johnny has found out that if he demands money, people will give it to him.  But I shouldn't think of it as unarmed robbery.  I should see it as ""aggressive panhandling"".

They were working on the issue, he said, but it would help if people would stop giving him money.  Doing so only reinforces the behavior!  It would be helpful to tell my customers just not to give any money to the large aggressive man demanding their wallet.  Did I have an email list or something to reach out to them?

I took his name and contact info, then called corporate.  Corporate, I have found, lives for this stuff.  They contacted attorneys against him, contacted the mall landlord, and we all got a memo that the guy was banned from mall property and we should call police if we even saw him (regardless of what he was doing).

Johnny was arrested over a dozen more times.  ",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1f71l7,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1f71l7/aggressive_panhandling/,

We all know customers can be the worst people walking into your doors, but I was not expecting this yesterday.

Since it was Sunday, we were slammed around noon. I work at a large sporting goods store in the footwear department. I was busy helping customers, and there was only one other person scheduled to work in my department. 

I notice a guy and a girl sitting on a bench, holding [this Nike shoe](http://www.nikefree50store.com/images/50store/mens-nike-free-50-5-hyper-blue-tint-black-volt-neon.jpg).

I would have to say that 75% of the time when someone is holding a shoe, they are looking for me or one of my coworkers to get a size for them. Naturally, I ask if he needed help finding anything. We'll call him Offensive Customer.

Offensive Customer: Well, I was wondering if you had this shoe in a masculine color.

Me: (confused) Well, sir, blue is a traditionally masculine color that has marked the male gender for quite some time.

OC: Yeah... well it's not.

At this point, I stood there and stared for about 10 seconds, and since he didn't say anything else, another customer caught my attention and I excused myself. 

About 20 minutes later, the OC is standing by the giant wall of shoes with the girl and again, I decide to approach them because maybe he ""found a more masculine shoe"".

Me: Did you find anything that you would like to try?

OC: No, actually. Do you have any shoes that don't have queer colors?

Me: (in a state of shock, yet anger) Wow, that's offensive.

I walked away. I completely refused to help him anymore. While I was walking away, I heard, ""No it's not"", so I replied, ""Yeah, it is.""

I radioed over to one of my coworkers who was helping out our department from fitness and asked him if he could help out the customer. He didn't second guess the call I made, and I later told him what happened. To my surprise, the customer fed the same offensive line to him, and didn't respond. He just stood there silently until he decided to try on a shoe that was ""not queer"".

This happened a while ago but for some reason sticks with me*

One fine day a man comes into the store with his girlfriend. They browse my department and bring a computer headset up to me asking for a discount, as the man believes it has a slight scratch on the microphone as seen inside the clear packaging. I tell him I can, I'll just double check with my manager for the percentage.

I'm back on the floor within 60 seconds, ready to tell him we can discount the headset for X dollars. But he's nowhere to be seen. I quickly scan some other departments and aisles in the store, he's gone. I think nothing of it, just another phantom customer.

As I'm giving up my search for the man, one of my friends who I hadn't seen in quite some time happened to enter our store. We had a quick chat and he told me some kind of amusing story (Cant remember what about, but it was enough to make me truly laugh out loud) 

A few minutes pass after my friend leaves, and I notice the man who was asking about the discounted headset earlier is now back in the store, browsing again. I grab the headset and head over to him. ""Hi, I couldn't find you before... but I checked with my manager and we can take X dollars off the price for you."" He looks at me with a death stare and says ""I saw you laughing at me, and I think it is disgraceful... I'm not buying anything from you"" 

Confused, I asked him what he was referring to. ""Before- I saw you with someone laughing about me and how I wanted a discount"" (Umm I'm pretty sure making fun of customers is not something we do in public view...) I realize he must have spotted me chatting with my friend. I just so happened to be holding the man's headset in my hands during the chat, so he's assumed we were both having fun at his expense. I apologize profusely and tell him its all a misunderstanding, I had no reason to make fun of him for trying to get a discount from us, etc...

I did service in the back room while my boss handled customers and sales in the storefront.

My boss was pretty accustomed to dealing with customers who believe they have the right to barter for everything. He had been there close to 10 years and did not barter with any of them. 

One day, a month or so after I started, a short, round man with a heavy, south-african accent walks in the door. ""Hello, my friends!"" he bellowed out to nobody in particular. The boss was handling a different customer so I had to go greet the man.

""How can I help you?"" I asked him. ""Well, my friend. I have a problem."" he replied. At this point I feel something bizarre is about to transpire, but wasn't sure what it was yet. ""Ok...?"". the response oozed out of my mouth with thinly veiled confusion. 

""I need a computer"" he says, then stares at my intently as though that was some secret code for something I was supposed to understand.

""Well, you've come to the right place. We have many computers."" I am sure at this point I had a half confused look on my face, my brow was probably starting to scrunch up like a dog would when it's master is making baby noises towards it.

""Well..."" he starts... ""I don't have any money."" 

I stood there, unable to respond for a minute. I tilted my head and leaned forward a bit, about to ask him the obvious question... ""How do you intend to buy a computer with no money?"" but instead as my body tilted forward, after what seemed like 5 minutes my bravery crumbled and I nodded then replied... ""Let me go get my boss...""

I go relay the conversation to my boss and head back to the service area. A short time later I hear a disgruntled sigh followed by ""Well I will take my business elsewhere!"". I peer around the corner to see the man storming out and my boss shaking his head in a dismissive fashion.

Apparently, the man believed he could take a computer home on the honor system, as long as he came in and paid for it when he felt like it... ""from time to time"" he said. When my boss explained that business in this country doesn't work that way, the man was genuinely offended. 

My boss just shrugged it off and said ""Get used to it, there are more where he came from..."" and there was. He was just the first of many facepalm inducing customers I had to deal with while I worked there.

**Background** Working at the children's circulation desk was by far my favorite desk. I got to read the kids books that were returned, less foot traffic and I got to experience some of my favorite conversations and kid quotes ever! Below are the highlights of either conversations I've had with kids or things they said while running past my desk. All names have been changed.


African drums are being played in the children's room for an African Heritage Celebration. Lots of kids dancing and learning about Africa, it was cool. A boy and his mom are checking out books at my desk...

**Boy** *Mama, are we from Africa?*

**Mom** *No, sweetie our family is from Germany.*

**Boy** he gets a thoughtful look on his face then says *If I get REAL tan this summer then can I be from Africa?!*

His mom smiled and took his hand to go get some books to help explain heritage.

**Random quotes**

Kid says to me *You have HUGE boobies! When Ima big girl I'll have them too*

*But daddy! The fish dared me to do it!* (I still wish I knew what that one was about!)

Kid says to me, clearly pleased with himself *My poo was green today!* 

**Me** *Well that's quite a feat!* We fist bumped.

Kid asks me *Are you pregnant?*

Kid holds up a scratch and sniff book *Can I eat this?*

*Gra'ma if there are giant space bugs, do you think Buzz Lightyear will stop them before they eat us?*

Girl hold up a Disney book *Which Princess is your favorite?*

**ME** *Ariel*

**Girl** *I don't like her, I bet she smells like fishes poop....*

*Mom! I put my nose on his [baby brother's] butt and he smells like farts!* (This I actually got to see happen and I nearly fell out of my chair when he yelled it at top volume)


Girl named Annie walks up to my desk. I've seen her in with her dad the entire summer. Since he teaches and is off all summer they basically lived in the library. Now she's with a woman who I assume is her mom since school is back in session.

**ME** *Hey Annie!*

**Annie** *Hi, Miss Library* (most kids called us Library, using it like our names)

**Me** *Is this your mom?* 

**Annie** *Yep! My mommy's a prostitutor!*

I look at her mom with a grin.

**A's mom** *She mean prosecutor. I work at the court house.*


And now for my favorite conversation with a kid ever!

8 year old girl comes to my desk with a stack of probably every dino book in the place, including the Zoobooks. She hands me her card with a smile.

**Girl** *What's your favorite Dinosaur?!*

**Me** *If we're talking herbivores, the Brachiosaurus. Carnivores? The Raptor or the Allosaurus for sure. how about you?*

**Girl** *The T-Rex, because of his awesome teeth! I feel bad for him though, he's got little arms...Have you ever seen Jurassic Park?*

**Me** *Heck yeah, I love that movie! You're favorite part is the T-Rex scene isn't it?*

**Girl** *Sort of, I love it when the guy gets eaten off the toilet! The Raptors gave me nightmares though, so mom won't let me watch The Lost World or the third one.* She looked so sad.

**Me** *Yeah, I had nightmares too when I first saw it. I was even younger than you! You know the best way to feel better? Pretend Dr. Grant is there helping you fight them off, worked for me every time.*

Her mom had been intently listening this entire time and seemed so happy with my response she piped in...

**Mom** *Honey, if what the librarian suggests works maybe we can try watching the Lost World together. What do you say?*

The girl got so excited she hugged me over the counter, grabbed her books and ran out the door with her mom to go re-watch the first movie and see if she got scared. I found out a month or so later that she was no longer having nightmares and was watching every dino movie or special she could get her hands on. I'd never felt so happy to have accidentally helped a child get over a fear I had had as well.

TL;DR: Lots of weird questions and comments heard from kids in passing and making a connection with a girl over dinosaur interests and fears.

Given the median age around here, this means that most of you were either crawling around pooping your diapers, or were still just a glint in the mailman's eye. As usual, I'll probably be verbose. TL;DR to follow...

I'm still all gung ho about customer service. In my teenage rubric, I know the secret of keeping customers happy, and everyone else must be doing it wrong. What's so hard about selling Big Macs?

And then I met my first intractable customer. We'll call him Bill.
Bill was probably around eighty. He walked with the careful, deliberate pace that comes from knowing that you're one broken hip away from being a terminal invalid. He apparently was supposed to have a walker, but refused to use it. The upshot of this was that you could see him coming from a mile away. As soon as he mounted the stairs outside, you had a good ten minute window before he made it to the counter. In future visits, I would spend that time getting everything prepared just right. But at this point, he is a stranger to me.

He makes his way to the empty counter at a glacial pace. The dining room was empty. It was a bit like watching someone traverse a minefield: one hesitant toe forward, transfer weight to the heel, slowly slide the other foot forward...I give him the standard spiel. Big grin, ""Welcome to McD..."" He cuts me off with a guttural grunt. 

""I'm sorry, sir?""  ""GRUNT"" I'm sorry, I cant understand you. Can you speak up?""

""ARBLEGARBLEBLARGHBA!"" This guy's got marbles in his mouth. I start to panic. What do I do here? Do I get a piece of paper and ask him to write it down? Point to the menu? I see my shift leader rounding the corner to the office. I call out to her. She looks up, sees him, and comes over.

""Bill"" she says, ""this is toxlab. He's new. He doesn't know you yet. He'll get your order, but you have to be nice."" She runs me through his order. Every day, he comes in and gets the same thing. Fish sandwich, cheapest thing on the menu. This entitles him to use a senior discount for a free small coffee. He wants a small water and two lemons. On the tray, not in the water. He takes two creams and three sugars. Three. Not four, Not two. Three. One plastic stirrer. And he wants three napkins. Placed on his tray, away from the lemons. 

This order nets the store the grand total of $1.03. And God help you if you get any of that wrong. 

At first, I pity him. I think, maybe he had a stroke. Maybe that's why he has trouble getting around and speaking. My shift leader says that's not the case. He's been a pain in the ass for a year now. He can speak perfectly fine. She knows this because he threw a temper tantrum in the lobby after a kid was being stupid near his table. The cops showed up, and all of a sudden he could speak just fine.

I found this out when the senior card program decided that card holders had to pay tax for their free drink. I had no idea until I rang him up and it came to $1.06.

HE. LOST. HIS. FUCKING. MIND.

He went ballistic. Suddenly I could understand every word out of his mouth. Most of them were insults to my mother. The word ""asshole"" got a lot of use too. Other customers around the restaurant are prairie dogging: Heads are popping up. I try to cut in. ""Sir, I...If you'll just let me...I'll get..."" Nothing. doesn't slow him down at all. A customer leaves the dining room to come to my aid. He engages Bill. Now they are both yelling. I am very confused. I turn and run to the back. My shift leader is doing inventory in the basement. I tell her what's happened. She sighs. She's too busy to deal with Bill today. Call the police. 

Okay, the cops. I can handle this. I babble into the phone, and return to the front. Surprisingly, Bill has quieted down some. The guy he was arguing with went from respectful but annoyed to flaming mad and ready to kick ass. I think Bill sensed he was getting close to having that hip break. He turned and made his way towards the door, like some foul mouthed tortoise. I breathed a sigh of relief. 

Two days later, I'm back at my post. I see him approaching. Oh shit. The other cashier today is a trainee. Hey, she's gotta learn sometime, right? I didn't totally throw her under the bus. I told her everything I could in the three minutes it would take him to make it inside. Grab the tray, lemons, napkins. She gets the water. Ring in the sandwich. Don't pour the coffee yet, he'll say it's cold. Two creams, three sugars. He's getting close. Fish will be up right in time to ring him through. Out of sight. We got this. 

He makes it up to the counter. He gets the welcome. ""Hrmrmrm"". ""The regular today? Coming right up."" she turns and gets the fish. I stand nearby making happy meal boxes. Watching. Waiting for this to get bad. She totals. $1.06. No reaction. Thank God. Lemons far away from napkins. Good. She sets the coffee on the tray. He grabs it, takes the lid off, and throws it in her face. 

She drops to the floor, screaming. I yell the shift leader's name. I get a cup of water and start pouring it on the girl's face. Shift manager comes out. Sees us. Sees Bill holding his empty cup, looking at nothing. I tell her what happened. She vaults the counter, grabs Bill's shirt. He puts his arms up. She steps inside his hip, and judo tosses him to the floor. 911 is called. 

These many years later, I remember the girl was burned, but okay. I don't remember what exactly happened to Bill. I don't think he got jail time. I know he was never allowed in the restaurant again. And I know why he did what he did. 

He was upset because when she put the coffee on the tray, the lid wasn't secure and a drop of coffee got out and got on his napkins. 

**TL;DR** Old man terrorizes fast food joint, assaults worker because napkin got damp.

Some of it is hypo-allergenic, some of it really isn't and contains nickel which some people react very poorly to.

So one day this 20-something guy comes in and right off the hop he's acting like a total prick. He snapped his fingers at me and pointed down in front of him to get me to come over, like I was a dog. So I go over with a smile on my face and ask what I can get for him.

He says he wants a new lip ring, but it needs to be black. I showed him the black lip rings but warned him that they weren't hypo-allergenic, so if he has any problems with nickel he should opt for one of the titanium ones instead. He looks in the case with titanium lip rings and rolls his eyes.

""I said I wanted black. There aren't any black ones in there, are there? Do you even listen? Why are you trying to sell me something I clearly don't want?""

To which I reply, ""Oh no, I'm not. I'm just warning you that if you are prone to reactions then I wouldn't buy the black ones.""

He goes off on me and demands to see my manager. My manager is not in the store. So he tells me he's disgusted and sick of pushy sales-people trying to convince him to buy things he didn't ask for. Calls me a stupid little girl, wonders aloud how I managed to get a job working with people in the first place, etc.

So I ring him up and he leaves. A little over a week later he comes back with a swollen, red lip. He screams at me and my manager that I sold him non hypo-allergenic jewelry when he explicitly told me that he needed titanium. He demands a full refund.

Luckily I had told my manager as soon as she returned from her lunch the previous time all about that asshole. So she told him that hell no, he would not get a refund. She told him she doesn't allow her employees to be harassed at work and that no one from her store will ever serve him again.

So he left, taking his shitty attitude and grostesquely swollen face with him.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1dvea1,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1dvea1/xpost_from_rpettyrevenge_well_deserved_lip/,

I usually worked in the back, which meant I did not have to wear the store uniform. One day another worker and I helped a customer put a TV into her car. As we were walking in the store a lady came up and asked if we worked here. We replied yes. She then told us how here son would constantly wounder off away from her, and she would loose track were he was. She then pointed her son out who was playing with some clothes in the clothing department. Meanwhile I was standing there wondering to myself ""OK so you cant keep an eye on your kid, and please don't ask me to babysit."" She kept talking about how he doesn't listen, and blah, blah.
She then asked us something that to this day, I cannot believe a competent parent will ask a complete stranger this question. ""Can you go up to my son, grab, him and take him out of the store and pretend you are going to take him away?"" When she asked this I can swear my jaw hit the floor! My and my coworkers reaction was, ""Are you fucken serious?""
She then said to act mean and scary, and she will be watching he whole time and waiting outside the store doors. She wanted to scare her son, into not wondering off, and that bad thing might happen if he does. I then replied again, ""Are you fucken serious?""
We told her no, we are not going to pretend to kidnap your child. It is just completely wrong, and so many horrible things can happen. We also told her maybe you should keep a better eye on your son, it is your kid and you need to be looking after him. When we told her this, she then became very upset yelling profanities and, asked for a manger. Apparently she did not like that two young ""punks"" were trying to tell her how to raise her kid, and that we used profanity at her. She even told our manager that we refused to help her in teaching her son a lesson by kidnapping him, and this was not customer satisfaction. At this point my manger also replied ""Are you fucken serious?"" and then with a ""Get the hell out of here, before I call child protection services!""
She then argued more, when she was done we had to find her kid because he disappeared again. When we did find him, she left and yelled some profanity on the way out.

She calls as I'm in the middle of catching crickets.  I pick up the phone, planning to put her on hold for about 30 seconds so I can finish up with the live customer in front of me.

 ""Thank you for calling, can you hold for just a moment please?""

""NO!  I need to talk to the reptile person NOW!""

""I am the 'reptile' person, but I'm with another customer it'll be just a moment""

I'm already cringing.  I put her on hold as soon as I finish explaining I'm with somebody, because I know people like this, and if I ask her to hold again, she'll just refuse.  So she gets put on hold for a little less than 30 seconds.  I finish bagging up my other customer's crickets and turn my attention back to the phone.

""Hello, how may I help you today""

""I told you not to put me on hold""

""I apologize, but I have to take care of the customers in the store first m'am""

At this point she starts going off on me.

""Well, my lizard is DYING, he won't eat, and I don't think he's drinking, and I NEED HELP and he could have DIED when you put me on hold!!!""

""I'm sorry, please slow down, can you tell me what kind of lizard?""

""He's a leopard gecko""

""And when did you buy him from us?""

""Oh, I didn't get him there, I got him at a reptile show""

(At this point, I could have just told her that it is not my responsibility, as she did not purchase it from our store.  But I can understand that she is under stress and trying to help this poor little lizard survive, so I'm going to do my best to try and point her in the right direction.)

""Well, I can tell you what we would do for our reptiles here if they seem to stop eating.""  I go on to explain to her how you can sometimes open their mouth and get them started on a cricket, on using different supplements to make sure he's getting nutrition out of it.  But most importantly, I recommend to her that she go find a vet who deals with exotics.  If he's really looking that bad, she needs to take him to a professional.

""I'VE ALREADY TRIED TO! I tried putting a cricket in his mouth and he won't eat it!!! I don't WANT to pay for a vet bill!  He doesn't look good! What do I do???""

""It sounds like you're doing all you can, the only other thing you can do for him is you need to take him to a vet.""

I almost laughed out loud at what she said next.

""I want to speak with your manager.""

""Please hold""

I put the phone on hold.  
Ok.  I can be empathetic to a point.  I can understand that somebody might take their frustration out on me when something is wrong with the pet we sold them.  The problem is, we didn't sell her this gecko, and I am not a certified veterinarian...if he's really that bad, she needs to get off of the phone with me and CALL A DAMN VET.

I told my manager the short version of the story and he picked up the phone and reiterated to her what I already had said.  

According to him, she threatened to call corporate on us and hung up on him.

We have a bit of downtime, so I decide to organize our meats. As I'm doing this, I notice we don't have an open black forest ham. People buy that shit all the time, so I figure I'm going to take some initiative and have it ready to go for when someone asks for some. I weigh it, take it out of the package, put it on the slicer, and set it to a 10 so I can cut the butt off.

Up until now, I had been pretty cocky about the safety of the slicers. You really have to try to cut yourself while catching the meat. That's the thing. I wasn't catching the meat when it got me. After I caught the butt and disposed of it, I reached for the ham to wrap it up with its date and all that, which is when it happened. I never bother turning off the slicers because they're on a really short timer anyway, so it's usually a waste of time worrying about it. At a 10 setting, though, I really should've fucking turned it off.

So I'm bleeding profusely from my knuckle, and they take me to the back to clean it up and call for my manager. Somehow, one of my coworkers doesn't hear me shouting profanities about how I had just cut myself and decides to give a customer a sample. Using the same slicer I just cut myself with. The exact fucking one. The customer eats the sample containing traces of me and decides to order a whole pound of the stuff. After my coworker cuts it up and hands it to them, someone informs him of what happened. I can only assume how wide his eyes went, as I was still in the back, but after finding this out he runs out and stops the customer and demands that they return it. I smell a lawsuit.

Anyway, at this point I've been sent to the back of the entire store (not just the back of the deli area) to fill out some paperwork. While I'm waiting for my manager to come back to take me to the hospital, I overhear one of the janitors talking to one of his buddies. Apparently, as I was dealing with my hand, he had been cleaning one of the restrooms. It was blockaded and everything when an older employee jumps the blockade, shoves the janitor out of the way, and proceeds to shit all over the floor in one of the stalls, just barely missing the toilet.

I worked for a long time for a grocery store chain. This is about when I was  a lowly assistant manager. On this occasion I was working at store in a downtown area that had been gentrified. The building the store was in used to be something else so it's layout was unique. 

One busy afternoon I got called up front to ""help a customer"" which was always a code for a ~~compliant~~ complaint.  I straightened my god awful company tie and headed up front. The customer in question was a conservatively dressed older women (CDOW).

CDOW: How many handicapped parking spots do you have?

ME: I'm not sure ma'am (looking out the window  into the parking lot) about 6 I think. I see there are some empty ones.

CDOW: You have eight. Why do you have so many?

ME: Well I know we are required to have a certain number but I don't know what that number is.

CDOW: You are required to have 8?

ME: I'm not sure.  Probably.

CDOW: Are you the manager? Why don't you know? (at this point she wanted me to understand that I was scum of the earth and likely an impostor)

Me: (This flipped my switch from ""bend over backwards"" mode to ""say whatever to get this bitch out of my face"" mode.) Assistant Manager and it has never come up before.

CDOW: I come to this store every day and I spend a lot of money here. I can never find a parking space because your parking lot is too small and you're wasting all that space on empty handicapped parking spaces.

ME: Yes the parking lot is small, but you know this building used to be a *major old school department store* and so when we turned it into the grocery store the parking lot was already in place. One of the costs of being in such a neat area, I guess.

CDOW: you should have put in more parking.

ME: I wish we could have but the building and the current parking lot are bounded on all four sides by city streets.

CDOW: If you couldn't provide me parking you shouldn't even have a store here (storms off)

*(I talk to the police.)*

Me: “He grabbed me, but I never hit him. I don’t know how he got hurt!” 

*(The man, a known criminal, is handcuffed and put in the police car. The officers and my manager go to review the security cameras. About ten minutes later, I get called to come back to the office.)*

Manager: “You have got to watch this!”

*(The camera footage clearly shows the man getting the book, getting in line, arguing with me, and then grabbing my shirt. At that moment, the customer in line after him, a tiny, middle-aged Asian woman, leaps up, grabs the hair on the back of his head, slams his face into my counter, and then calmly steps back to where she had been standing. She did it so quickly, that we have to run the footage back on slow to see exactly what she had done. After the thief is out cold, she walks over to the new line that the assistant manager opened, buys her bag of cat food with cash, and leaves without a word.

I told her she could return it for a refund but would have to pay the return shipping.  She wrote me back a nasty email and demanded a postage paid return label.

[Front page post about fake $100 printed in a five reminded me of this:](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/135t51/if_you_work_in_retail_watch_out_for_this_just/)

We had an old employee come back through our store 2 years after he had moved to AZ. The fucked up part was that this old employee passed us a counterfeit $100. He and his buddy decided to target one of his old girlfriends and keep her occupied while the bought some $3 item with the fake hundred. It worked... in a way. She took the money but someone else caught it later that day in cash office. It was a horrible bad forgery. It was on some thin construction paper and the pic didn't even line up. The damn thing almost could be split into two pieces through the middle. 

So we called the cops and the bank, they took care of it. Not the first time we had been given fake money. /shrug Fast forward 2 days.

I get a call asking for a manager, I respond that I was one or we had the OPs manager here today. He asked how long we would be there today and if he could ask for us when he got there... (I am thinking oh great, what kind of customer was I gonna get this time) I say yep and I tell him we will both be here till two. 

About an hour later in walks two guys, *very* nondescript. Average hair cut, nothing remarkable about either of them. They ask the front desk for me by name and I get the radio call and head up there. 

""Hi are you (Me)?

Me: Yep, what can I do for yah?

SS: Hello we are Agent X and Agent Y with the Secret Service. Can we talk to you in your office?

About this time, you heart just starts racing. The motherfucking Secret Service is asking for you to step into the office. I call my other manager and I tell the girl at the front desk to divert calls and such. We go to the office. Heart still going. I head in with the manager and they tell us the situation. They were sent from Denver to track a long trail of fake $100's that started in AZ. The Secret Service had been following our old employee and his buddy. 

Me and my manager now feel like secret agents tracking spies and shit. We show them our footage of the money transaction (we had already made a tape for police) and everything. Turns out these were two of the most laid back guys I had ever met. Despite their job title, they were extremely cool. We spent about 45 minutes in the office when I get a radio call ""He is here...."" ?

Me: ""Who is here??"" 

Front desk girl: ""Employee with the fake money...""

He never left town. He was coming back to the store to flirt with his ex-that he had just given fake money to a couple days before.... I look at the Secret Service guys with an almost gleaming smile and said, ""The dumb bastard came back, he is in our TV section right now."" They both lit up like it was Christmas. They weren't expecting this.  I show them the camera and where he was and what he looked like. 

""Stay here"" We did.
 They both stand up, unzip their jackets reveling the gun you knew was there but never actually saw until then and they march out of the office. They dumbass never saw them coming, with his back turned they swooped in. One grabbed him by the shoulder while the other came around front. (we were watching on the surveillance cameras). Both had a hand on their gun, they asked him his name and identified themselves as agents with the Secret Service. The story I was told from the Ex-gf was the he turned white as a ghost and started shaking. We went to the front counter, where the one agent nodded us an appreciation nod while their other marched him out in handcuffs. 

He gave up his friend in a matter of minutes and last I heard he was serving a 5-10 year sentence for counterfeiting and something about doing it over state lines.  I since then met the FBI twice for fake checks and ATF once for a gun log but these guys stuck out in my mind the most.

 My favorite story about shoplifting happened one Friday night at work. It was pretty slow in the store and I was outside on my 15 minute break shooting the shit with a coworker. We're standing out in front of the entrance when we see two girls, probably in the 18-20 age range, hustling from the store with a couple bottles of liquor. Usually when this happens they are heading to a car to drive off immediately. Not these geniuses. They get into a car, in plain sight of me and my coworker, and sit in the backseat presumably waiting for one of their accomplices to return from god knows where. 

My manager comes strolling out about 30 seconds after them and says, not expecting us to be of any help, ""Hey, did you see where those girls went? They stole some alcohol."" 

My coworker and I shrug and point at the car they are sitting in, about 40 feet away from us. My manager gives us a look like ""Seriously?"" and walks over to the car. We watch the scene from a distance: he knocks on the window, berates them for a minute, snatches the bottles back and tells them never to come back to the store. The girls are bawling.

A couple of years ago I was working in a sandwich restaurant. A guy came in with his young (5ish) daughter. He ordered 2 subs. I made his according to his specifications, then asked what veggies he would like on his daughter's sub. 

He tells me ""Lettuce, tomato and no mustard."" So I put the veggies on the sub and said to him ""So you don't want mustard, but would you like any other sauce?"" He repeats, ""no mustard."" I figure that means he doesn't want sauce at all, so I close the sub and start wrapping it.

He then proceeded to flip the fuck out and yells at me, ""I want mayonaise on that!"" I apologize, re-open the sandwich, and he starts screaming again ""listen honey, I've been a manager at (different fast food restaraunt) for 10 years now, your job isn't that hard""

Since he's flat out screaming at me, I'm getting pissed, so I retorted with ""I asked you what sauce you wanted, you didn't tell me, I may have an easy job, but it sure gets hard when my customers can't pay attention.""

He continued to scream about how dumb and rude I was, and how easy my job is until the store across the mall from us called security. It took the security guard almost 10 minutes to get him out of my store. Once the security guard almost had him out of the mall, no mustard guy started threatening the guard and the cops ended up coming, he was arrested for uttering threats, and child services were called.

It was an especially busy day in the red and khaki store. The new Jason Wu clothing line had just dropped and a bunch of women were waiting outside the door before opening as if it were Black Friday. 

Knowing I was scheduled in the Fitting Room I had a wave of anxiety crash over me, but I held my head high. I knew I could do this. 

The doors opened and sure enough all the women went rushing to the clothing line. I busied myself as much as I could while I braced for the oncoming storm.

It actually wasn't too bad. All the women were incredibly respectful of one another. If a woman tried on something that didn't fit, a complete stranger would ask if they could try it on. People were becoming friendly with each other, swapping clothes, laughing while they waited in line. It was very pleasant. 

As the day went on, the Jason Wu items were scarce. The accessories (the scarves and handbags) were the first to go. I found myself having to make calls to our surrounding stores to see if they had any in stock. Some did, some didn't. 

There was a nice African-American couple trying things on. I struck up a conversation with the boyfriend/husband while his girlfriend/wife was trying on clothes. 

Enter Rich Old Bitch. This woman came to my desk decked out head to toe in animal fur clothing, designer hand bag, nails done, and her face freshly Botoxed. Her fake nose was as far in the clouds as I could see. 

ROB: Excuse me, but I would like to know where all the handbags are. 

You know how in movies and television shows rich people have that...accent/tone of voice where it just oozes with ""I'm rich therefore I'm better than you""? That is how she sounded. 

Me: I'm sorry, ma'am, we sold out of those fairly quickly. If you would like, I can call other stores for you.  

The lady said that was fine and she waited while I called up stores. During this time, I noticed she was very put off by the African American couple. Her nose kind of scrunched and she pursed her lips. The African American gentleman was very nice, said hello to her, and tried to make conversation. The old woman didn't have any of it. 

After a while, I hung up the phone and told the lady that one of the stores still had one handbag left. Since they are a promotional item it couldn't be put on hold but if she left now she'd have a good chance of making it. The lady said that was fine and asked what store it was. I told her the location. Now, I live in a primarily rich town. Myself and my family aren't rich by any means but we are surrounded with rich folks. This location was in a safe area, but not the wealthiest area in town. 

She came out with this lovely statement: 

ROB: Oh, never mind. I don't want to shop where all the poor black people and illegals shop. 

The couple had left, at this time but they were still within earshot. The boyfriend went to turn around but the girl stopped him. I was furious with this woman. From the way she treated the couple up until now i just couldn't stand her ignorance. So, I came up with a white lie on the spot. 

Me: EXCUSE ME? I'll have you know my stepfather, who is a lawyer, is black. How dare you. If you need any more help I will call one of my associates because I refuse to help you. 

The lady did not know what to say. She paled and mumbled an apology and got the hell out of the store. The couple approached me and the boyfriend asked if my stepdad really was black. 

Me: Nah. I don't even have a stepdad. I knew I couldn't yell at her so I got back at her the only way I could; making sure she knew she was an embarrassment. 

The guy laughed, gave me a fist bump, and told me to have a good day.

Totally fine by me.

Except for when the customers insist that I am a weakling or not fit. 

I am about 5'8"" and on the thinner side, but I've got some serious guns going on. I could probably kill an elephant with my thighs [note: this may be a bit of an over-exaggeration]. I love being physical on the job and getting the chance to get a workout in when I have the chance, ex: stocking shelves with heavy items, loading up hundred of pounds of rocks, etc. 

Several times I have offered to assist customers in loading items either on the dollies or into their cars. Many times, however, I am flat out refused. I am told that, as a woman, I just simply cannot deal with such laborious tasks. I usually just crack them a mischievous smile, ask them what they needed to load and proceed to do it myself. For some reason, most end getting a kick out of it.

One small incident stands out in my mind, however. It was a busy afternoon at the store, with tons of customers checking out. The regular lot guys/loaders were slammed with duties at the other end of the store. I walked up to a distressed-looking man who had about 600lbs. of pebbles in about 12 plastic bags. I proceed to ask if I can help him, and he proceeds to look me up and down, exclaiming, ""You can't do th-"" As he is saying this, another man turns around and interjects, ""Naw man, you need to get this [male coworker of mine]. *He* will get the job done, but you have to wait a few minutes. I mean, not that you can't or anything, *sweetie*."" 

I give the interjecting man (IM) a look, and turn back to the original customer (OC), ""Seriously, sir, I am fully capable of loading this into your vehicle. I reallly love the workout."" And I grin that fake customer-service smile that we all know so well.

OC&gt; Are you sure you can do this?

IM&gt; Trust me, man. The [male coworker] will do so much better. He's still working on mine, but...

Me&gt; I am still wonderfully and fully capable of doing this, we could be done in a moment, and you won't have to stand around and wait. May I ask where your car is parked?

Unsure, the OC points me to a large SUV outside. I start towards his car, when IM emits his final word, ""Alright man, don't say I didn't told you so...""

It took me all of two minutes to load the pebbles onto the vehicle. I turned around, asked for the customer's name, shook his hand, smiled, and said, ""Thank you for shopping at [my place of employment]. Have a wonderful day.""

Our security guard, let's say Mike, was hovering near the door, as is his norm.

I flag him over and tell him about Jane, only to then notice a black shape poking out of her top. It was clearly a bottle of tagged vodka. He and I both gave each other 'that look' and she was confronted about it. Paraphrased conversation goes something like:

This was my second day on the job and I was stocking the shelves with toothpaste when a customer came up to me and asked if we had measuring tapes. As the store is rather large and I had no idea where things were at the time, and as I only had an hour to finish up the shelves I didn't want to waste too much time running around the store. I turned to my supervisor (who was a few metres away) to ask her if we had any measuring tapes. The supervisor simply answered ""no we don't have any"" (out of earshot of the customer) I relayed the message to the customer, apologised and carried on with my shelves. 5 minutes later the customer came back to me quite annoyed with a measuring tape in hand saying ""what type of worker are you? You don't even know what you store sells!"" I apologised saying that it was only my second day there so wasn't a 100% of what stock we had and that a colleague had said we didn't have any (I wasn't going to make out that I'd answered 'no' because I didn't know and wanted to get rid of her). When the customer walked off I informed my supervisor that we did have measuring tapes and her answer was ""F***ing customers are just too lazy to look around the store themselves, I can't be bothered with them so I just tell them we don't have whatever they're looking for"".

I was having an absolutely abysmal day at work. One of those days where several times the thought of walking off the floor to go have a good, few minute long cry and scream fest makes its way into your head. (Or maybe that's just me...) 


Anyway, part of why it was such a terrible day was I was working the drive thru speaker. I have ""the voice"" for it, so I'm always there. I went from loving it, to liking, tolerating, disliking... to loathing. Policy is to suggestively sell what our hot item is right now. To every car. I hate doing this, but its part of my job.


There's one customer who really hates hearing this. So much so he will cut you off as soon as you say ""would you like..."" with a very loud ""NO!"" and go on into a long-winded rant about how we need to stop with the advertising and how it annoys him very much, and repeat that same speech to the person working in window when he gets his order. Managers told us to just tell him to write head office or visit our Facebook page. I've dealt with him about a couple of dozen times. After a slew of rude, mindless, dumb people, I hear the abrupt ""NO!"" while I'm in the middle of one of my ""leave the floor and cry"" thoughts. 


I take a deep breath, grip the counter as tight as I can, and interrupt his speech with my own. ""Sir, this is part of my job. I hate it. I hate it just as much as you do, if not, more. (I get gradually louder, and end every sentence with more emphasis.) You know how much this annoys you the one time in the span of a few days you hear it? This annoys me just as much, every time I say it. To hundreds of cars a day. 5 days of the week. But, I am required to do this. Being a person who likes having a job, I do it. Yelling at me will change nothing. Yelling at my coworker in the window will change nothing. There is nothing we can do about it. So I beg you sir. Please tell head office how you feel about this. Visit the Facebook page, write them letters, call them, show up on their doorstep. Whatever you have to do to show them how much you hate this and want it to stop. Because I want that just as much as you do."" 


There's a very heavy, uncomfortable silence. All my coworkers are staring at me. My shoulders are moving with my deep, shaky breaths. I'm hunched over the counter, fingers hurting from holding it so hard. Now at any point he could have driven away, but he didn't. He listened to everything I said. He mumbles his order, and I tell him his total, and that my coworker will meet him at the window.


There were no cars ahead of him in the queue so he was the next vehicle up to the window. I'm watching from close by. My coworker repeats the total. He fumbles for a debit card. When he hands him the machine the customer asks, without looking at him ""So you guys have a Facebook page?"" Coworker nods. ""Yes sir. Our Facebook page is for people to leave comments, concerns and dislikes about the service we offer. You can write on their wall, or follow the link to the guest service form you can fill out online, or call the phone number posted there."" He hands back the debit machine, takes his order, blinks slowly and gives a quick, gruff nod before leaving. I like to think that was an apology.


Now I was very lucky that my manager had left for the day and it was a supervisor on the floor during that in-between time waiting for the afternoon manager to start their shift. The supervisor on the floor came up to me, took my headset away and sent me to replenish every bit of low stock we had, then clean any bit of mess or disorganization I could find. Basically keeping me away from customer interaction. Nothing was said about my rant. It's as if it didn't happen. I honestly don't know if I'm in trouble or not. I feel like this particular supervisor wouldn't bring it up to a higher up, but I suppose I'll find out tomorrow. Now even though the supervisor didn't say anything about it, my ears were practically bleeding from praise coming from my coworkers.


Tl;dr - Customer hates up selling. I told him to get off his ass and instead of yelling at me, yell at head office to see it gets changed. Coworkers rejoiced. Not sure if I'm in shit or not.

I was working cash register at a clothing retailer.  A customer came up and I rang up her purchase like normal.  Then it gets confusing.

This one in particular has stuck with me very clearly over the years and frankly is one im sure that most people in retail that have stores that 'hold' stock can relate to. Tl:DR at bottom

In my last year at the store we were taken over by new owners (again) and frankly they were rather nice. South african family who were straight shooters and albeit did things differently, were still great to work for. They allowed all of us in our respective roles to have more responsibility. I became known as the 'Comic book nazi' (see Seinfields soup nazi) for dealing with people that others were afraid to, such as the person in this story. 

Our store meant that your could pre-order figurines before they were made, 3 months in advance with a deposit and the customer would know the date the figures would come into the store and had 2 months to pay and pick it up due to us calling them and/or letter. (amazing amount of time in my opinion).  It should be noted that even with a small store markup, most of these figures were minimum $100 if not over $1000 for the epic collectors pieces. 

I started going through a lot of these orders and discovered that a number of customers had been taking advantage of these extended collection period and would not pay for and/or pick things up for 6 months or greater. More when they felt they had the spare money, which had lead to the back of our shop overflowing with boxes. It was honestly silly to the point of where we had no where to put our own bags in the back of the shop due to there being no room. 

I took it upon myself to start chasing a lot of these people up to collect their shit or at least start making consistent payments on it instead of just the minimum (deposit) and if they didn't it would be put on sale for another customer. 

For the most part customers were appreciative. Many had forgotten they had ordered it or were embarrassed to have been taken advantage for so long, which cleared a lot of space in a short time. Some were a bit more aggressive until i explained things to them. 

eg sinspider: most places will only hold orders for a week or less and you've had this in storage for 4 months with no additional money paid etc and if i had not called you likely would have forgotten about it at all so at least we had the courtesy to call you.
customer:...ill be in this afternoon

Anyway, this particular customer has never left my mind (lets call her FM for fucking mole). This was a person who believed anyone else (especially retail) was beneath her. Which was ironic because she was a militant feminist bogan which was...well she was the first i had encountered in my life. FM had been a customer since the store had opened but for rarer, hard to find items and upon checking how long her orders were sitting out the back some had been sitting out there for as long as 18 months! 

This woman was also one whom knew when our busiest periods of the month were but would still call up and keep one of the staff on the phone for half an hour or more looking for specific issues of specific comics and then drive straight to the store expecting that they would all be waiting for her in the 5 minutes it took her to get there. She did this to me twice. 

FM: I want all these things. (list as long as my forearm)

Sinspider: sure thing but you understand most of these comics have not been in print for many months, even years. I will do what i can to find these for you and put them aside for you. Just be aware the new catalogs are out and we are very busy at the moment so they might not be aside until tomorrow.

FM: sure thing, thanks.

(fast forward **7minutes**)

FM (at counter behind other customer): **loud sigh**

FM (reaching counter): **exasperated sigh** so have you put everything aside for me?

Sinspider: um...i told you on the phone that we were extremely busy and i have not left this counter since you rang me. Id be happy to go looking for you and see what i can find but it may take some time.

FM: so go.

(containing rage, jump ahead 30 mins)

I have found maybe half the list after neglecting every other customer in a very busy period to help FM and the rest we simply dont have in stock (from over 9000 comics) and cannot order in. FM lets out a loud sigh every time i don't walk up to her with the counter with her entire order, enough that the whole store could hear. I explain this to her but instead of thanks she begins to complain about the service. We are not helping her. We are not looking after one of our best customers **cough** and so on. No thanks for the thousands of comics i searched through to find her the crap she wanted to begin with. Anyway i digress, i was just setting up the type of personality this FM is. 

Back to the 18 month old orders. It turns out she was coming in and picking up the 'must have' pieces every 6 months (still way over what we allowed) and leaving other pieces behind. I called her up and the conversation followed as thus:

Sinspider: Hi FM, im sinspider from *comic store* and im just calling to let you know that it has been 18 + months since you have made any form of payment on 'x' items and many others. If you don't come in to collect your items in the next 7 days they will be put back on the shelf.

FM: **abuse and more abuse and then some occasional words** I paid for a deposit and i continue to order from you guys you have no right those are legally mine i will take you to court if you try and take them from me.

Sinspider: True you paid a deposit for them but you have not paid any further amount since then, being well over a year and we very rarely see you in the store. Our policy is to hold stock for only 2 months and you have clearly exceeded this.

FM: **abuse followed by your doing this because im a woman** 

Sinspider: FM i have just told you exactly what our policy is and you can take it from me and my bosses that no longer are any freeloaders taking advantage of our policies anymore. 

FM: **FUCK YOU**
*hangs up*

I thought i was going to be in trouble from the newer owners for how i handled the call. Instead they were happy for me dealing with her for taking up an entire shelf with items that weren't profitable. I find out later that she came in the next day. Picked up the cheapest figure that she had (**$40**) and abused the staff again and continued to do so after purchase. I arrived on my shift to see this abuse carrying on. Not knowing who she was told her to GFTO of the store and not come back and she recognized my voice. She leaves the store and doesn't meet my gaze and we dont hear from her again.  

Her crap gets put back out for sale and all sold within the next week earning the owners some $600 from her deposits that were nullified and some of her figures were worth even more netting them $1500 total. And thus earning me my new title of Comic book nazi. I wore it proudly and no regular customer ever fucked with me again for fear of loosing their stuff.

Hordes of women would descend on our store in that one week, ripping through clothes, destroying the store.  The workload shot through the roof as women decided they NEEDED one shirt, but it wasn't available in their size, and an employee would be tied up for an hour calling around for it, only to find that the sole store that still had that size in stock had it on hold for a customer who may or may not ever come back.  Worst, the reduced prices on everything meant that our staffing (decided by hourly sales) was actually less than it logically should be.

Management took turns closing the store during those hellacious weeks, and I had the bad luck of closing during the pre-sale.  This was when we only opened the store to certain customers after hours, an act that only ramped up the self entitlement.

The store closed at six, and reopened for the VIPs at 6:30.  It was catered, so as the droves descended on our store, I sent employees to vainly grab up spilled and stained clothing, and wipe up the wine splashed on the carpet.

The event ended at 11, but the last VIP didn't leave until midnight.  I turned around to look at the destruction that used to be high end retail.  Clothes on the floor, clothes literally drifted against the walls in the fitting room like snow after a blizzard.  Heaps of put backs burying the tables they were on.  All of which was punctuated with abandoned plates with half eaten food, grapes chased under tables, cheese trampled into the carpet underfoot.

I rallied my crew, doing my best to beat their demoralization, and we set to reassembling the store.  I signed them all out for extra labor hours with an email to corporate, and tucked into the big clean.  Along the way, we abandoned uncomfortable high heels and jackets.  I ended up half in clothing out of my gym bag, hair pulled back, just battling the mess left behind.

By 1:30, we almost had it licked.  Then, I heard the noise of someone yanking the door.

We actually had an issue at this location, where people would pull the doorhandle repeatedly.  Our neighboring store actually had their door handle ripped off by customers just not accepting that the store might be closed. And this was obviously one of those times.  The customer was just banging at the door to get in.

They looked tipsy, which made sense.  There were two restaurants in the mall that served mixed drinks until the wee hours.  They probably had just gotten kicked out.

Puzzling over why they were here, I remembered that a set of keys had been found earlier in the evening.  So, I summoned my best retail smile I could muster, and unlocked the door.

They instantly shoved the door open, hitting my foot, but I wasn't about to let them in.  Through the open crack they looked at me confused ""Are you open?""

I know that question deserved a firm but polite no, but instead it just broke my brain.  I stammered out a confused ""n-no?  No?""

She stared at me confused for a minute and then asked if she could come in and ""shop around"" a little.

I still was not processing this.  The stupidity of it just made my brain cease and I just kept repeating ""No?"" at her.

She turns to her friend and says something about having to come back ""tomorrow"" in a snarky voice.  At which point one of my employees, fueled with retail rage comes up behind me and yells ""It IS tomorrow!"" and slams the door shut on them.

I've got quite the story for all of you. Indulge me for a moment if you have the time.

---

I work at a home-deco/fabric store. In my department (fabrics) we have 6 rows of shelves to display the fabrics we have for sale. The first row is for the clearance/discount fabrics that we need to get rid of. the other 5 are for the regular priced items. Atop the large discount shelf sits a large sign that reads: ""CLEARANCE FABRICS, $2-10 DOLLARS PER METER *All prices are as marked"".

 Every now and then, some inconsiderate moron will take a bolt of the most expensive fabric we have (usually raw silk or velvet, which is on the opposite fucking end of the department), ogle at it for a little, maybe let his/her kids bite and piss on it, take it on a little stroll throughout the store, and leave it (unrolled, of course) on the bargain shelf. This is a story of what happens to naughty boys and girls that don't read the price tags and signs in stores.

This happened about a week ago. Dialogue is recreated from memory. Most of it is correct. 

---

Enter, stage left: Mrs. Illiterate McFuckface and husband, Stubborn von Butterballs. 


Fuckface decides to browse our rather large selection of upholstery and dress fabrics, deciding that it needs to make a new dress or whatever the voices in hear head tell her to make. It lays it's eyes on the bolt of velvet, deciding that it's going to need a few meters of velvet for it's next creation. 

Lo and behold! The sleek, smooth, high-quality, elegant-looking, crimson bolt of velvet, gives off a soft, warm radiance, even under the cold, unforgiving, fluorescent ceiling-light. Like a diamond in the rough, it's (untidily) perched, next to the dirty, stained, torn, dusty-old bolt of bleached cotton. Quite a contrast, some might notice.

Discount shelf...

Velvet...

Velvet on discount shelf...

---

After expending it's mana reserves, the Fuckface has put two and two together! It has deduced that *because* the velvet on the discount shelf, it must *obviously* be on sale! To hell with the price tag that clearly says it's $50 per meter, it's on the discount shelf! This must be her lucky day! Perhaps the stars have aligned and have given her the big break she needs!

It commands it's brood-mate, Stubborn von Butterballs to transport the material for her, as she is obviously too important for such simple tasks. Without hesitation the drone uses it's grubby little arms to carry the bolt of velvet to the payment/cutting counter. As it lays the bolt on the counter, Fuckface says with a silver of triumph in it's voice: ""I want five meters of this"".

Like all the other good employees, I process her request, scan her fabric, and total up her purchase.

---

&gt;""That'll be two hundred and fifty dollars, ma'am"" I say with a semi-forced smile on my face.

&gt;""No. You've scanned it wrong, this was on the discount shelf"" it replies.

&gt;""No madam, that was incorrectly placed. I can see why you'd mistake this for a discounted item, but still, it clearly indicates on the price tag that it's $50 dollars per meter. I'm sorry, this happens every now and then, I'd be happy to give you 5% off for your trouble if you'd like.""

Unable to process the information given, the Fuckface replies: ""No, this isnt two hundred dollars, it was on the discount shelf.""

&gt;""Madam, the sign on the shelf states that all prices are as marked. Even if this *was* on sale, I'd still have to charge you according to the price tag. If you don't want to pay for this, we have some similar materials that are a little cheaper."" 

&gt;""THE DISCOUNT SHELF SIGN SAYS FABRICS THERE ARE TWO TO TEN DOLLARS PER METER. I WANT THIS AND I'M NOT FUCKING PAYING TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THIS."" It replies, confused and infuriated

&gt;""The sign *also* says that prices are as marked.""

Confused, irritated, and unsure of what to do next, the Fuckface musters up the energy to follow whatever instruction it's simple brain tells it to do.

Fuckface used Mating Call!

It wails for it's significant other to come to it's aid, till suddenly, a wild Stubborn von Butterballs appears!

&gt;""THIS FABRIC WAS ON THE DISCOUNT SHELF. THIS BOY WONT SELL IT TO ME FOR CHEAP"" it screams to it's partner.

Obviously enraged by this, the muscle-bound oaf storms towards the counter.

&gt;""WHERE'S YOUR MANAGER? I WANT TO SEE HIM NOW.""

&gt;""I'll call him right away! I'll be right back, sir!"" I reply, with a smug grin on my face

---

I scurry to the intercom like a child on Christmas morning, and page for my manager to come. Like a knight in shining armor, my manager arrives to the rescue. There's already quite a wall of text here, so I'll spare you the repeat conversation that occured.

Back and forth, like three warriors in a heated battle, the angry couple relentlessly spammed: ""It Was On The Discount Shelf"", while my manager replied with the super-effectve: ""Read The Sign"", occasionally re-enforcing our defences with: ""Sorry, We Can Still Give You A Discount"". By this point, a small crowd of people had paused their adventure in the mall to watch the bloody battle. Some of them even tried defending us, but for all their efforts, all they got was an angry: ""SHUT THE FUCK UP STAY OUT OF THIS"", by the savages. Things finally came to a close when my manager had to drop the nuke and call security.

---

After about four minutes of verbal ping-pong, my manager paged for mall security. Three burly, intimidating security guards arrived to *escort* the Neanderthals out of the store. Instead of thanking their escorts, all  they received were a bunch of barely comprehensible death and lawsuit threats.

The crowd of people started applauding and cheering, as Fuckface and it's drone walked out of the store, sulking in defeat. It's final words were: ""IM GOING TO CLOSE DOWN THIS FUCKING STORE JUST YOU WAIT AND SEE YOULL ALL BE FUCKING JOBLESS WHEN IM DONE WITH YOU"". Eyes were rolled and groans were groaned, when out of nowhere, a teenage boy yelled just out of earshot: ""THE PRICE TAGS ARE THERE FOR A FUCKING REASON, LADY!""

All in all, the battle was won, and the fight was over. The crowd, my manager, and myself, all retreated into the staff room to revel in mead and song, and we all lived happily ever after.

Hooly shit. Glad I got that out of me. If you've managed to read this far: thanks, and good on you! My thoughts and well-wishes go out to anyone that has had to deal with customers like these.

As she rounded the corner and came through the electronics department I gazed in awe at the sheer...

Perhaps only a description will do it justice. She was like...400 pounds. Her two toddler children were screaming in close vicinity. All the while she was speaking loudly on her cellular device. 

While the ""'Murica"" radiating from her appearance may have been one thing, her actions truly solidified her spot in my retail bullshit hall of fame. It takes an amateur customer to be mildly rude, a professional to demand special treatment, and a seasoned veteran to cause a scene.

But it takes a superstar, a customer in a class of their own, to commit a retail feat of this caliber. Chatting on the phone loudly, riding in her electric cart, ignoring her two screaming toddlers, the bitch weaved through the aisles of DVDs without a care in the world. So much so that she neglected to maintain the basic spatial awareness to situate herself in space and time.

A deafening blast of metal upon metal echoed throughout the store. I jumped at the initial sound of it. My fears were only heightened when the sound repeated itself shortly thereafter. Was that a gun? Did someone get hurt?

I rounded the corner and laid my eyes upon pure evil. Her head was tossed back and she was LAUGHING. In the midst of chaos...LAUGHING. In an altogether sinister concoction of retail bullshit, this bitch had successfully DISLODGED AN AISLE from its proper location, caused DVDs to spill across the brilliantly polished floor, and to top it off...done it twice.

As she left the scene in her electric cart, fat spilling off the sides, with her two children, I could only stare. I had just witnessed greatness. I deal with people's bullshit on a daily basis. It only serves to anger me. What this master of retail hell had done was serve me up a giant plate of ""fuck you"" so steaming with evil that I could only laugh...harder than I ever had on the job.

So I'm having a pretty good day at work, it wasn't a slow day, but there were 2 of us there, but there is only one till at our store. I was on cash and my coworker was reading the paper.

Then, an older guy comes in yelling at us about how ""the pumps not working"". I tell him there seems to be nothing wrong, (a message pops up on the till if there are any problems) and that we can complete the transaction here inside if he likes. He then starts swearing at me saying that he hasn't even pumped his gas yet. I then see his licence plate, he's from the wonderful province next to us that doesn't have this law.

I calmly explain to him that in our province you have to pay for your gas before you pump it, its not just you, everyone has to do it, and that its been the law since 2008. 

Me: ""There's no way I can turn your pump on until you pay for your gas.""

Douche Bag: ""I just filled up at [gas station] up the street and they didn't ask for me to pay first!""
(you'd think he wouldn't need gas if he ""just filled up"")

Me: ""Its the law for everyone sir.""

The old man is clearly frustrated and mad by this point, and there are a few people waiting in line behind him now. This is when my coworker chimes in.

Coworker: ""Sir, the law was put in place because a young man working at a gas station in-""

The old guy cuts him off.

Douche Bag: ""I know the whole fuckin' story! Its just stupid that we should suffer because of *some dead kid*.""

Everyone in line behind him looks at him. 

Coworker: ""That kid lost his life. This law is helping save lives from-""

Douche Bag: ""It was stupid of that kid to step out in front of that car! He would have been alive and none of us would have any trouble getting our fuckin' gas if he wasn't such a fuckin' idiot.""

By this point we are allowed to kick him out of the store for causing a disturbance, and if he doesn't we can call the police.

Me: ""Back then he was responsible for any gas not paid for.""

Coworker: ""That $12 would come out of his pay cheque and he would be fired. I'm sorry sir but your going to have to leave.""

Douche Bag: ""What the fuck is this! You can't kick me out! Just turn on my god damn pump!""

Me: ""If you don't leave now I have to call the police.""

Douche Bag: ""This is bullshit! I'm going to [other gas station up the street]! You just lost a customer!""

The old guy stormed out of the store and back to his car and drove off, forgetting to close his gas cap.

This is the first time a customer has really gotten to me. I already get the occasional ""immigrants stealing out jobs"" because I'm half Middle-Eastern (born in Canada by the way), but just the fact he didn't give a shit that someone like him killed a young guy because they didn't want to follow the rules really made me mad. Both me and my coworker were really mad for the rest of our shift, thankfully the rest of the customers today were generally nice.

I work for a small business that has two shops right next to each other. I work as a barista most days, with two shifts in the other store, where i'm a sales person and manager. We're in one of the most well off suburbs of Melbourne so sometimes we get rather entitled people. On this day I was working a cafe shift, with one other girl. 

So this older woman walks in, and thankfully, my coworker took her order and not me. Let's call her Fingers. You'll see why.

**Fingers:** I want a sandwich. 

**Coworker**: Okay, great what would you-

**Fingers:** I want it cut into fingers. Not those stupid squares you do. 

**Coworker:** Sorry... fingers?

**Fingers:** Yes. Cut into three (makes motion with her hand). Do you know how to do that, honey?

It may not seem like much but when she said, *""do you know how to do that?""* you could hear sarcasm dripping from her voice. I actually turned around from my spot at the coffee machine to look at my coworker to gauge her reaction. To her credit, she kept a straight face and soldiered on. 

So this lady eventually tells us whats in her sandwich and what she would like to drink. It's a tea.  I make it, and go to put it down and her paper is covering the entire table. She looks at me and makes no move to rearrange, so i put the tea on the edge of paper so it's easily moved, and start to walk away.

**Fingers:** No. You're going to pick that up while I move my paper. 

I'm a bit taken aback by how she said it, but alright, customer knows best. I pick it up and stand there... and keep standing there. She's situating her paper and she does not give a rats ass how long I have to stand there holding her tea. She finally gets everything where she wants it and looks up at me. I put down the tea and walk away, jimmies only slightly rustled.

As soon as i get back to the coffee machine, there she is. Holding her mug at the front counter. It has a few black specks. If you've ever been a barista, you know it's pretty much impossible not to have some coffee grounds around. They're harmless and you can brush them off.

**Fingers:** This is dirty.

**Me**: Oh, sorry, it's just a couple coffee grounds, we-

**Fingers**: Get me a new one. Don't give me excuses for your dirty dishware.

**Me**: Okay, sure I'll-

**Fingers**: And i want boiling water as well. (walks away)

I'm sort of flaberghasted at this point how bluntly rude she is, and her lovely habit of cutting people off, but okay. I'm not going to let it get to me. It's a slow day and I'm having an okay time.

I get a jug of water and a cup and set it to the side and finish the coffee I was doing, planning on walking them out together. Fingers has other plans. Ten seconds later she's back.

**Fingers**: Yeah, i wanted a new cup. Remember me?

**Me:** Yep, I was going to bring them out to you but if you want I can hand them- oh, you're already walking away, okay.

I go take out the water and mug. Here's where it gets good folks. I almost lost it. 

**Fingers**: No, i want another teapot of water. (taps tea) *Do you know what a teapot is, girl?*

I got her the teapot. I wanted to pour the teapot over her head, but i held off. Yeah, i work a shitty barista job to save money before I go back to school next year, but for the love of all that's holy, **don't you fucking act like you're better than me.**

I worked on a gas station, and we just started using this new system where you had to pay before you could fill gas on your car.

This particular day was nothing out of the ordinary. That was untill this costumer showed up. A middle-aged woman that looked distressed. 

I asked her what was up, and she said that her car had run out of fuel and couldn't refill it. Her credit card had been blocked and she had no cash. She still had 100 km home, so she really needed gas. 

I tried my best to help her - asking my boss if we could release a pump and let her pay later - but there was nothing. Unless, of course, I paid for her gas out of my own pocket. 

I may be a bit naive and trusty, but I really wanted to help her. So I explained to her that I would pay for her gas myself and gave her my information so she could transfer the money to me when she got home. It ended up being like $10 worth of gas. Not a huge loss, but still not something I feel comfortable with trusting to a total stranger.

She thanked me profoundly and went on her way. A few days later, I checked my bank account, and I had received a transfer of $30 with a note saying ""thanks!"".

I've worked in retail for nearly 20 years. I have deep, deep scars.*

**THE TALE:** So this was few years back. My kid was diagnosed with cancer. I did not tell my boss, a known dickhead, right away. Instead, I filled out the FMLA paperwork first and he found out a few days later when approval was sent from HR. So I'm all set with intermittent leave and a butt-load of banked sick time. It has to be intermittent, because I have no earthly idea when I need to be gone or for how long. If you've ever had a family member with cancer, you know there's surgeries, chemo, unexplained fevers, calls from school, etc. And this is my kid, so, you know I'm going to be there for everything.

(Also kind of important: I'm divorced, and my kid lives primarily with his mom.)

So it's all fine. My coworkers bend over backwards for the me while I'm away for chemo, surgeries, and other scheduled stuff. As it happens, my kid gets sick with a high fever. We think it's an infection, so off to the hospital we go for an assured overnight (at least). Dutifully, I call the boss and let him know what's going on. 

""OkaaaAAAY,"" he whines, ""Call me in a few hours and let me know what's going on.""

""Well, honestly I'm going to be out today. My kid has to be here overnight, so I'm staying.""

""Well, call me back later and we'll talk about it,"" he says.

""Fine. Whatever.""

So, as predicted, nothing has miraculously changed in two hours, so I call back, ""He's still here. The doctors think it's an infection, but they don't know for sure. I won't be coming in. I'll let someone know ASAP if I need to be out tomorrow, but it would help if you could cover me just in case. I want the others to have more than a few hours notice if they have to change their shifts.""

There's a small, but significant pause, ""We get truck tomorrow.""

This is not an unexpected response from the known dickhead, but even so, I find myself barely containing my rage, ""Yes. I know that. What would you have me do?""

""We need you. It's warehouse day,"" he says.

""Listen: I think I need to be clear about something. If my kid is in the hospital, I am in the hospital. Warehouse day, or no."" I'm not known for my ultimatums. Parenthood does that.

Another pause.

""Fine. Call me tomorrow morning.""

""Fine,"" I say.

My kid ended up staying three days. I was with him the whole time.

Normally when a customer walks into my shop I greet them and ask if they need help finding anything. If someone on their phone comes in I just don't even acknowledge them.

Today I had a woman with her sister and ~20 year old daughter. I had already rung up the sister's transaction and she stepped up to purchase her item separately. She only had one little shirt. Just one item. During this transaction of ONE item, she decides that she just cannot wait to call her friend back about their plans for Sunday night. She completely ignored my prompts (the customer has to choose yes or no to donate for a charity before the computer system will let me ring out the purchase), so I decided I wasn't going to talk to her anymore. Just to save my own ass, I said ""your total is $5.14"" and just stared at her. 

I stared right at her face for about a full minute while she was planning her dinner at Granite City with Julia and Max. The younger girl tried to get her attention by saying the total to her but even that didnt work. I could tell the younger girl was getting embarrassed so she apologized to me and tried to take the money out of the lady's hand to pay me. 

This is when the dumb old bitch finally got the clue that it was time to pay. She said to her friend, ""hold on. Apparently I  have to pay"" in a voice that was pretty clear she thought I was a total bitch for not helping her. She looks down at the PIN pad and says ""my total is $5.14?""  and I say ""sure is.""

So at this point she knows I'm going out of my way to be a bitch to her and she dumps her coin purse on my counter and expects me to pick 14 cents out of it. No, lady, I don't think so. So I continued to stare at her. Right in her face, for the entire duration of her phone call. She got the hint and threw 14 cents and a 5 dollar bill at me, so I threw her receipt in her bag, purposely did not give her promotional coupons, and shoved the bag at her without saying ""have a nice day.""

It was a really good job, and I met some really great people. However, I also met some pretty awful people. I will share one of the lesser cases with you here.

First things first, I'm half Nicaraguan, but I don't look it. I didn't learn much Spanish as a child, but whenever my dad's family would visit, I would practice. I also took seven years of Spanish in school, so I have a pretty solid handle on it.

Back to the story

In the thrift store, there were only usually two people working. Upon closing, one would take the drawers and count out the deposit while the other vacuumed, straightened, and swept. On this particular night, I was working with the manager, so when we closed, she took the drawer back, and I started vacuuming. The front of our store is floor-to-ceiling windows, and I can see a group of people approaching the door. All Hispanic, there was a man, his wife, their little daughter, and an older woman. I assume she was the grandmother for the sake of the story.

I will say here that the worst feeling in the world is looking someone in the eye as they try and open a door. Because then they look stupid and they know you know they look stupid and you know that they know and so on. I hate that.

So I turn my back as they approach so I don't have to see them try and fail to enter. But when I turn around, they've opened the door. The fuck?

Turns out, my manager thought I locked the door, while I thought she locked it. So I'm tasked with the wonderful duty of telling these people they can't do the exact thing they've just done. Nobody likes being told they can't do the exact thing they've just done.

Me: ""Oh my gosh, I'm sorry! That door should've been locked! We're actually closed.""

Dad: ""Oh...ok...""

Grandma: ""Que paso?"" [What's up?]

Dad: ""Este cabron no va a dejarnos entrar."" [This bastard isn't gonna let us in.]

At this point, I am excited. I love when people don't know I can understand them.

Me: ""Debes saber que hablo espanol..."" [You should know that I speak Spanish...]

I grab the door that he's holding and slowly pull it closed, locking it as loudly as I could. He started to become visibly angry that I had the nerve to close the door in his face, and then I saw as it all clicked in his head, and he just kind of backed away.

Not as bad as other stories I've read, but it was pretty funny to me and I thought you might enjoy it.

We use large pressure fryers that have a long trough for collecting runoff water from the chicken. While they do not have to be changed after every fry it is important to empty them before you start frying and afterwards to prevent them from overflowing on to the floor which makes a disgusting greasy mess.

So its Sunday afternoon and I am getting ready to start frying. We have two fryers that differ slightly and I normally use the middle one. I get everything set up for my first fry and go down to empty the water trough. I barely move it before greasy nasty water comes pouring out of it over my hands. For it to get this full means that no one has emptied it in days. Once it gets this full it is impossible to empty it without making a huge mess. Needless to say I was pissed. This isn't the first time my lazy coworkers have left this mess for me.

I decided enough was enough. I looked at our fry log sheet and see that that same coworker (Moody) has used that fry for the past four days. I get out a pen and paper and make a nice big note and write

""Empty your water tray. Don't just leave your mess for others""

I stick it on the fridge, slide the overflowing water tray back into the fryer, and use the other one for my chicken that day (it was not overflowing so I could actually empty it).

The next day I go into work and notice my note had been taken down off the fridge. I mention it to my coworker and she says that she never saw a note this morning and that Moody or the Manager must have taken it down.

This past Saturday I was working an eight and a half hour shift, and for the most part people were pretty nice all day and gave me no trouble.

At about 5:20pm, I was ten minutes away from getting off work and put on the floor, so all I had to do was wander around and ask customers if they needed help with anything. It was pretty dead, but I found a middle-aged couple looking at dog food, so I approached them in my normal friendly way.

**Me**: Hello! Do you guys need help with anything today?

The husband flicks his hand at me in a ""shoo"" motion, while his wife cocks her head and sneers:

**Wife**: We know what we're getting.

Ooooook then. They were annoying, but what did I care? I got to leave soon. Since there was no one else in the store, I headed back up to front cash to speak with my manager and co-worker about various things, and watch as the clock runs out to 5:30.

I should mention that right at this time, I can see the wife approaching in my periphery vision. She's about five feet away from me when she very clearly hears me tell my co-worker I'm off. I begin to walk to the punch-card room, when she *cuts me off*, standing directly infront of me and staring daggers into my face.

**Wife**: We need help with dog food and *you* offered to help us, *remember?*

**Me**: I'm very sorry, but I'm actually off work now. I can get someone else to help you if you want.

**Wife**, scoffing: Well, I really don't understand why you would offer to help us if you weren't going to.

At this point, my manager who'd overheard the exchange stepped in to help this entitled lady before I had the chance to tell her I offered to help her during my shift, and my shift was now over. I really don't understand why some customers think that even though you're finished work, they are still entitled to your service. If she had even just been pleasant or asked me nicely, I probably wouldn't have minded staying an extra five minutes to answer her questions. 

I don't think these people have ever understood that ""retail employee"" is not synonymous with ""slave"".

TL;DR: Lady wants me to help her with dog food even though my shift is over, based on the fact that I offered ten minutes earlier and she declined.

Edit: for everyone informing me that I was technically ""still on the clock"" and should have helped, I completely understand your point. However, my work has a strict ""only work until your shift is over"" policy, and because I'm part-time I never make any overtime, there was nothing for me to gain. We were definitely not swarmed, so there was no issue with her getting immediate help from another associate, which she did. I had the legal right to leave and nothing to gain by staying, and I make a point (even in retail) to not let people treat me like a doormat. 

The fact that she, very literally, cut me off on my way to clock out and then rudely implied that I should stay past my assigned time to help when there were clearly others available, simply because I offered ten minutes prior and was declined, is not acceptable behaviour to me nor to my work.

Cashiering, cafe, music seller, you name it and I can probably do it. Mostly, I work at the customer service desk where our job is to see if we have the book in stock, and then take the customer to it. Over last holiday season, the neighboring competitor bookstore had just gone bankrupt and closed, resulting in a lot more people in our store. This story occurs just as I had gotten off my shift.

It was very busy and I had to order a book. Since we're not allowed to order books for ourselves, I was standing on line at customer service waiting for a free coworker. Now, the coworker that had relieved me has a sort of mental disability and while she can get the job done, it often takes her a lot longer. She also looks and dresses a little weird, but she is a very nice person when you talk to her.

Since I was no longer on shift, I had my jacket on and nametag off. There was one lady in front of me and I could see her getting uppity at how long my coworker was taking (keep in mind, this lady did not know I worked there). She turned to me and opened her mouth, and I knew it was going to get ugly:

Self-entitled lady: Can you believe this place? Look at the quality of people that they hire. I can't stand around all day waiting for this RETARD to help me

Me: Excuse me ma'am? What did you just say?

Lady: The people that work here are so weird and this girl can't even help herself, let alone others.

Me (silently fuming, realizing I have no nametag on): Listen, I don't know who you think you are to call who is going to HELP you a retard, but if you ever talk about one of my coworkers that way again I will get my manager down here and get you thrown out. Have a very merry christmas. 

The lady turns red in the face, starts mumbling about how much money she spends here (never seen her before), and how she refuses to be treated like this. She gets off the line and goes upstairs to find the book herself.

In my days working at the big blue electronics retailer, I worked in a couple different stores, one being in a mall in a large college town in New England. Other than the colleges, the area was rather dumpy and we had a good amount of theft that happened in the store, so for the most part, the employees were rather vigilant. I worked in a large appliance department next to the rest rooms and break area. 

On Halloween one year, the managers all decided for a morale boost to allow all the employees to come to work in costume for the day. It was a fun time, and there were some great costumes. I had class before my shift, so I didn't have time to get changed. This comes in later.

So I'm working my shift, and as expected it's pretty slow. I see a few high school kids walking around shopping for cds with a bag from the mall, and I notice one of the kids grab a cd (nothing wrong with that), and then the group starts walking towards the bathroom, but only the one with the cd goes in, and the other two stand outside the area. I call our LP officer, and follow him into the bathroom.

Now because the break room door is directly across from the men's door, I pretend to be walking into the break room to fool the first two kids, and then redirect to the bathroom. He's the only person in there, with his feet pointed towards the toilet. All I can hear is the distinct sound of the wrapper on the cd peeling off. I look under the stall, and it hits the floor. So I stand in front of the stall door, grab the top and pull myself up. I see the back of the kid, cd in hand. As I hold myself up, I say ""You know kid, if you were trying to steal from us, you could of at least pretended like you were going to take a crap."" He turns around, bright red, oblivious to the fact that he got caught red handed. He comes out of the stall, with all of the evidence in hand. He then says to me ""Come on man, I can't get caught again."" I respond with ""Again? wrong answer!"" 

So we walk out of the bathroom, and we've got two managers and the LP supervisor waiting. All in costume. So I hand this kid over to Barbie, a milk carton and a vampire to go into the LP office. Before they move, another one of the employees dressed as Captain America (shield and all) comes walking up asking if he can be of any assistance. 

Needless to say, it was an interesting day.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_14pzqv,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/14pzqv/you_should_at_least_pretend_to_take_a_crap/,

Now, these 2 litre pop come on containers that fit 8, and while this doesn't seem like much to me, the constant lifting and carrying these really hurts my coworker. So she told my boss that she had scoliosis and couldn't carry it. My boss's reaction? ""NO EXCUSE"".

So back when I was in high school, acter I rage quit O'Fastfoodigan's, I decided it was time to take up a more white-collar profession: grocery store cashier. Perfect timing, as a new grocery store was just about to open near my neighborhood. So I put together my ridiculously overdone resume for a 16 year old, complete with personal references, volunteer experience, h.s. GPA- all kinds of stuff that doesn't matter in retrospect. Got the job! 

Anyways, within a few months' time, I became to cashiering, what a korean kid is to Starcraft gaming. Super fast, super accurate, all while perfecting the fake-nicety that makes the old ladies' knees buckle. TL;DR, I was awesome at what I did.

Management, however, as I would learn in life, didn't care. This was MegaFoodCorp; nobody noticed. It was a great life lesson, really. I was the lowest of the low. Just some kid slingin' boxes and bags. And in this WASPy area, I was to take whatever shit the customers wanted to dish out and say 'please sir, may I have anova'?

And so slowly over the months, my dignity-tail ever further between my legs, ever biting my tongue, I soldiered on. Until one day I finally decided to take a stand!

It was late for me, approaching the 10pm end of my shift. Tired from school and six hours of scanning and smiling, I shut off my light. Two more medium-sized orders of cereal and 4011 and ahh fuck WIC; and it's be time to count down my drawer, take off my clip-on tie, and go home. The light at the end of the tunnel! I ring up the one order, and am halfway through the next, when this middle-aged d-bag wearing the bluetooth earpiece of the day- the single earphone clipped to his polo shirt- conversing loudly with someone on the other end, rolls his fully-loaded cart up to my register.

""Excuse me, sir"" I firmy but politely say, ""I'm closed, she can help you in the next aisle"".
""No, you're NOT!"", he exclaimed loudly, continuing to unload his cart. I reiterated my previous statement more firmly, and retail-apologized to him. They teach you this in their training: never say 'I'm sorry' because it is admitting fault, but instead say 'I apologize'.

That was it. I had had enough of these nouveau riche dirtbags walking all over me just because they're in a position of power over me. I finished up ringing up the lady in front of me, thanked her warmly, and proceeded to log out and pull my drawer. Incredulously, D-Bag starts screaming at me, ""You're going to ring up my order!"". I looked at him, ""I told you I was closed. She can help you in the [now significantly longer than before] next line. Grabbed my drawer and walked away.

Counting my drawer at the front desk, I could hear D-Bag yelling at my shift leader, shift leader telling him he could use the next line. Dude was irate!

1373819488.0,432,self.TalesFromRetail,1ia5pf,8 glories of working the self checkout (A little angry/long),sjmoore,521,89,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1ia5pf/8_glories_of_working_the_self_checkout_a_little/,"Sometimes, I really don't think our customers understand what SELF checkout means. I get a lot of this in my lanes: 1) ""Can you just take the hand scanner and zap all these items for me? I don't want to pick them all up ya know?"" No, fuck off to a cashier. 

2) Also, I don't know what magical powers you think this little hand scanner has, but when you're in the self checkout LINE, don't ask me if I can scan your items while you wait. Obviously not. How would you pay? By swiping your card through my asscrack? Just wait a minute.

3) Speaking of which, there are GIGANTIC signs above the registers and small ones ON the registers saying ""credit/debit/gift card only. NO checks, NO cash, NO bottle slips, NO reward checks"", so don't get mad at me when you spend your time ringing all those items and I say no cash. It's your fault for being unobservant, not mine for not being magical.

4) Sometimes if the cashiers have crazy long lines and self scan is slow, I'll call people over, and more than once I've gotten this: ""I'll only go over there if YOU'LL do it for me."" No, I was offering members with smaller orders to disperse to the self scan where there isn't a wait time, not offering to hand scan all of your giant items cause you don't wanna wait for a cashier.

5) Then there's the people who forgot something. ""Can you run back and get me x and y? I forgot them"" No. Do you see how often I get called over to these registers for ID checks and register issues? I can't abandon all the other customers because you forgot to get some damn bread. Use your eyes and brain and figure it out. And don't you leave your items/order up and run back there to get it. The world doesn't revolve around you and other people are waiting. Pay out this order and start a new one after you grab your item.

6) Which brings me to another issue - I don't have any beef with people buying alcohol through the self checkout, but don't you goddamn dare get mad when I'm not immediately free to approve that you're 21. YOU KNEW someone would have to check your ID/face regardless of age because it's a MACHINE and not a person with their full, undivided attention on you. If you didn't want to wait for that, you should've gone to a cashier. Period.

7) And the wait times. There's 4 registers and 1 clerk. If you need a clerk and your register light is blinking and you SEE ME with another customer, don't fucking ""M'am, m'am, M'AM I NEED HELP M'AM"" me. I KNOW. BUT YOU AREN'T NUMBER ONE ON MY LIST. Also, when I walk past your register to the person behind you who paged me first, don't throw a fit. I go in order of who's been waiting longest, not who cries the loudest/stands the closest. 

8) Last but not least, I know machines aren't perfect and they can be really frustrating at times. Especially our self checkout machines. If you accidentally lay anything else on the belt with an item, the belt takes the weight for the item wrong, and sends it back/voids it off your order so you have to rering it. I know that's annoying when you're in a rush. I'd love to help you cause I feel your rage. But don't be like the guy I had yesterday (the inspiration for my rage post):

Man: *sees me with another customer* M'AM. M'AM. JESUS CHRIST M'AM ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME? AT LEAST GET ANOTHER FUCKING CLERK.

Me: As you can see, I'm with someone else. I'm the only clerk and there is only one badge to work the machines here. Wait your turn.

Man: I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING.

Me: Nor should this customer have to wait for me to help you. Just wait a second. *finish up, walk over to him*

Man: I'M DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT (direct quote) AND THE STUPID MACHINE STILL SENDS MY STUFF BACK. 

Me: *Looks at screen* sir, all of your items rang through just fine. Your raspberries got sent back one time and it looks like the second time around they went through just fine. You could have paid and left at any time.

Man: FUCK *places raspberries on belt*

*machine asks him to remove unrung items off the belt*

*he refuses, seems confused as to why the machine won't let him pay now*

Me: Sir, you can't leave the item on the belt, the machine has a scale in it and now thinks you're putting a new item you never rang into your basket.

Man: IS THIS OFF THE BELT ENOUGH FOR YOU?! *throws raspberries to end of line, where they smash open all over the place* NOW I NEED NEW RASPBERRIES. *stares at me angrily*

Me: You can go get yourself new ones as soon as you're done. I'm not going to do it. You're a grown man who just threw fruit and ruined it, and that is not my fault or my problem.

Our menu changes several times a year, and our most recent seasonal menu started this past Tuesday.
 
Yesterday our district manager and her boss, the regional manager, came to visit our store. I do prep in the back of house. I portion our ingredients and prepare all of our fresh vegetables and fruit, and pull and thaw frozen entrees to be prepared hot by line. I do a lot of inventory control and assist my managers with counts and truck. A little while after the DM and RM arrived my DM came to me with an e-mail detailing some new information about times for shrimp, which is our newest menu item. I thanked her for the information and told her ""Boy, do I have some questions for you!"" She laughed and asked me what I needed. I had four or five different questions about procedures for preparing the shrimp, and myself, the DM, RM and my store manager had an active discussion about various shrimp-related topics. Both the DM and RM called several people to ask them for answers. After a little while, my RM said to me, ""Hey, these are great questions. Thank you."" I thanked her for talking with me and then, 
naturally, at eleven o'clock in the morning, the lunch rush from hell arose. 

There were customers filling our lobby, out into the foyer, having to place to-go orders because all of our tables were full. We did the most profitable hour we have ever done. I have been at my job for two years now, doing prep for a year and a half, and it was the first time in an extremely long time that I really felt like I was having to hustle. I felt like I did a pretty good job making sure the line was stocked up, and wasn't overly concerned about the corporate managers being in the store as I am always on top of my product quality.

After about three hours, things started to die down. The DM and RM (who had been helping out the entire time on the line and bakery) came back and continued their inspection of the store. After an hour or so, my store manager called me into the office and shut the door behind me. He told me that our RM was so impressed with me and the questions I had asked that she wanted to give me a raise! I was floored. I thanked him and went back to work. 

A little while later after they left my store manager and I went outside to take a well earned break. He told me that the RM asked him how much of a raise she should give me, and he had asked them for, and gotten, a seventy-five cent raise for me. This is absolutely huge. The day before yesterday I was approved for an apartment. I have never had a place strictly of my own before, I've only ever lived with my sister or people I was in a relationship with. I was feeling pretty worried about my potential to afford this place by myself, and so hearing this news out of the blue has alleviated much of my concern. I am also just really proud of the fact that someone at my workplace recognized the hard work I do, especially someone from the corporate end who is known for having high standards. I really do take a lot of pride in my job even though it is not something I see myself doing forever. 

Just wanted to tell you guys a happy story. This is one of my favorite subs and it seems like so many of us deserve better. 

TL:DR: Corporate managers come to visit my store on a record breaking day, I ask them a few questions about shrimp and get a surprise raise!

A client (R.B) calls me up and asks why his house's listing hasn't been cancelled yet. He faxed us the signed cancellation form yesterday, so why is his house still listed?

I tell R.B. that I was here at the office all day yesterday, and I didn't receive any cancellation forms. He starts flipping out, calling me a stupid liar, etc. I tell him to send me the cancellation form again, and I would take care of it right away.

I technically can't take care of it right away, as after I track down the manager and get him to sign the form, I still have to send it to the head office to finalize the cancellation, and head office doesn't operate on weekends. But I tell him I will just to get him to STFU.

I was promptly informed that it was already sent, no way in hell would he send it again, I better find it and take care of it IMMEDIATELY. I told him again to send it to me, and got hung up on.

I called the agent selling the house, who did not receive a copy of the signed form either.

20 minutes later, him, his wife and their (seriously) smelly little 5 year old come barging into my office. His bitch wife sets the kid up on top of the [counter](http://i.imgur.com/EE7z5Ik.jpg) in front of my desk. Within 30 seconds the kid was fooling around, leaned over backwards and dunked her hair in my coffee. The brain-dead parents laughed at her, and continued yelling at me.

After I told him for the 20th time that I don't have his goddamned form, he 'magically' finds the link to the form and emails it to me. I print it out, and have him sign it. R.B and his family leave. 5 minutes later, I've already washed my hands of the whole ordeal, and suddenly I see my manager's (W.T.) number pop up on the call display.

W.T. is the type of manager who almost always sides with the clients. In his eyes, none of the administrative staff can do anything right, so now I know R.B complained, and I'm in deep shit now.

I was wrong about being in deep shit, W.T started the conversation by saying, ""So, I just talked to the assholes from (address), are you ok?"" I just about had an aneurism. This is the first decent thing I've ever heard out of W.T's mouth... I wish I could have heard the call R.B made, to see how rude he was to W.T

I do the first transaction which was the exchange, easy peasy. I get to the second one, and learn I want swallow the barrel of a gun. 

Me: Okay sir, since you are only returning one pair of jeans, and you got them on sale for BOGO $10, I'm going to have to adjust the price of these to remove the discount from the original purchase since you're not actually getting 2 now. 

Stoner Dude (SD): Saywhanow?

I do the return, price adjustments, double check with my manager to be sure I've got it all the right way and ask for his card to refund him.

I wish I had a TARDIS so that I could go back in time and video record this entire thing. 

I was at the red and khaki Bullseye store (used to work there, shop there all the time) and was waiting for my mom to get out of line. All of a sudden, I hear a bit of an altercation going on between a guest and a cashier. 

I don't know what exactly caused this argument to go down, but I am going to make a guess that since this woman was ranting about her children being ""angels"", her kid did something and the cashier told them not to do that. I am going to guess, since they were making references to the conveyer belt, the kids were putting their hands on it and the cashier told them not to, out of concern that they could get hurt. 

So this woman just starts SCREAMING at the cashier, and kept referring to her children as her ""Little angels"". They were going back and forth until she asked for a manager. So the cashier got the GSTL (Guest Service Team Lead) who is pretty much manager for the cashiers. 


Woman: I COME HERE ALL THE TIME AND SPEND LOTS OF MONEY HERE. I COME HERE WEEKLY, BUT IF HE CONTINUES TO WORK HERE, I WILL NOT SHOP HERE ANYMORE. 

She makes several references to her children being upset. By this point pretty much EVERYONE in the front lanes - guests and other cashiers are turning their heads and watching this until a woman comes up to her and says, ""Ma'am, excuse me, but you are upsetting MY children. There is no need to make a scene."" 

The woman: ""YOUR CHILDREN AREN'T MY PROBLEM. STAY OUT OF MY BUSINESS."" 

So the GSTL calls one of the LODs (Leader on Duty). Meanwhile, the cashier is trying to keep doing his job. 

The woman: I don't want you to help me. In fact, stop talking to me. Just be quiet. 

I know this cashier. I had worked with him for a while before I quit. He is a very nice guy; great cashier. And he's also kind of quiet. He doesn't speak a lot, so I know he must have said something to her children that wasn't inappropriate, he's just dealing with a helicopter mom. Her telling him to ""be quiet""...I have never seen him so angry before.

Cashier: You do NOT get to tell me to be quiet. First of all, I am NOT your child. I am not EVEN a child. I'm a GROWN MAN and you have NO right to talk to me that way (he's in his 40s, mind, so not a teenager) 

This woman becomes outraged that someone would DARE talk back to her. The LOD tells him to get off the registers. Other guests are coming up to this woman and asking her to lower her voice. She wouldn't. The LOD and GSTL finally get her to calm down. 

Then my mom was done checking out and I didn't see what happened after that. 

The best part out of all of this was that I'm wearing jeans, a black coat, had my purse, shopping bags and was texting my boyfriend telling him about  this scene, and a shopper comes up to me and asks if my lane (register) is open. I just laughed at her.

The first job I had in high school was working at a gas station. The gas station was family owned and the gentleman that owned it treated me like family. He worked with me on scheduling while I attended community college and was a downright nice person. 

I worked my way up to the position of assistant manager by showing up for every shift, speaking English, and being overly responsible for 19. The other guy that worked my shift with me was Antonio, a flamboyantly gay Mexican. He spoke English well after you spent enough time around him to pick up on his dialect of Spanglish. 

One day I receive a page from Antonio to come to the cash register. Standing at the register are two fake tab blonde girls in their early 20's. I walk to the register and ask what's up. I'm informed by Antonio that the girls wanted a water. I offer them a courtesy cup and point toward the soda fountain. One of the girls explains with a semi valley girl twang (obviously from CA) that they don't drink tap water and that they've already explained to Antonio that they want a bottled water. I say alright, go head and purchase one and I'll ring you up. Valley girl is getting irritated, ""We shouldn't have to pay for water.""

""Well, the fountain has a filter and is essentially the same stuff as the bottled water, you can have some of that for free or you can purchase a bottle."" I responded, ""I'm sorry, but we have to pay for the bottled water and so do you.""

The girls are visually upset, they huff and sigh and I finally walk toward the back of the store. I go back into the cooler to go about my business assuming its handled. A couple of minutes later Antonio calls me back to the front. He shows me two water bottles in a trash can. The girls had emptied water bottles in a fountain cup and told him they got water from the fountain. This absolutely set me off. I look out at a gas pump and see them getting ready to pump their gas. I wait for the girl to start pumping her gas before I stop the pump after less than .25 G of gas. This occurs 2-3 more times before the girl comes in to complain about the gas pump. I explain that maybe it's broken and she should try another pump. She moves her car to another pump and we replay the same scenario. She comes back into the store even more upset and shorter on patience this time. I explain that there must be an issue with her card and that she should call her bank. She then asked why the pump said ""Stopped by Attendant"". 

Shit. I'm busted. What do I do? 

I ask to see the card and say that I'll try running it inside. I promptly ring up the two stolen waters as a credit transaction, hand her card back and tell her that she can buy gas somewhere else. 

TL:DR bitchy girls think they're too good for tap water so they steal bottled water from a gas station I was working at. I keep turning their gas pump off when they're trying to get gas. When they come in to see what's wrong I ask to see the card, ring them up for the water and tell them to leave.

She was in her 40s but easily looked 60 because of how run-down she was. This lady was actually shaking. Her 8 year old adopted son was next to her. She was trying to exchange two items that she had a replacement plan for. One was an mp3 player and the other was a  Nintendo 3DS. Both items were smashed to pieces (which was covered under the plan). I looked into her customer history and saw she had exchanged the Nintendo many times before. My coworker, who was standing next to me started wondering if it was maybe a scam. While her son was getting something out of a vending machine, I asked the lady what happened to the Nintendo.

She told me a story (while shaking) of how she adopted this boy when he was 2 years old and how his mother had lots of kids and they're all now separated. The mother was on drugs and then died when the child was 2, so this woman adopted him. Subsequently, this kid developed some pretty serious problems with authority and became very anti-social and destructive. He has smashed all of the Nintendos on purpose because he was mad about something. This woman said she loves the kid like he was her own and she's known him and has tried to adopt him since he was born, but that everyone in her life told her to give him away because he was ruining her life. I felt bad for her.

The kid came back and she and I kept talking about him. I told her that I've heard of a form of discipline where you take away literally everything that the child has so that he has nothing to destroy. That she takes anything he could possibly destroy out of the house and padlock her room and any other room she can so he can't get in. She should take away TV and any other privileges completely and even take his clothes away from him, only to be doled out by her daily. She was intrigued. The kid knew we were talking about him and said ""Why don't you just shut the fuck up?"" I look at him and say he can't talk to adults that way. He starts talking back to me. The mother doesn't intervene. I can tell she's just defeated and no matter what she says, he won't listen anyway.

I deliver pizzas around town for a local pizza joint that starts with a D. I've been doing this for a few months now and I've gotten to become familiar with some of the customers who ordered alot. One of them was the mother of one of my old girlfriends in high school, so I knew her quite well and she ordered probably twice a week while I was working, not sure how often she ordered any other time.

Anyways, one time I showed up and she was short two dollars so She was very kind to me even in break up so I didn't mind returning the favor. I told her it was fine, I'd cover it. I went to the car and took 2 dollars out of my wallet and used it to pay up what she missed. No big deal.

Anyways, this happened again the next week. She was short five dollars this time, and once again I paid the difference. This happened every time that I delivered to her house for about a month I'd say. And I probably didnt get every single one of her deliveries. I figured it was just something that she did with me, but I was wrong.

Apparently, she had begun doing this to other drivers too and when they refused to give her order to her, she said ""well that nice boy Ryan lets me have my pizzas for half off."" 

As you can imagine, this got me into quite a bit of trouble with management. The next time I delivered to her place I told her what happened and how I didn't appreciate her taking advantage of me and the other drivers, so she paid and I was on my way, thinking that the problem was solved.

I was off on the day after that, but when I returned to work two days later I was fired. Apparently, she called back and told them that I had given her two extra pizzas than she ordered for free and she was calling because it hurt her conscience to know that she was taking advantage of the company. As you can expect, that was total bullshit and I didn't even give her the pizza she ordered for free, nevermind two extras that would've belonged to other customers. 

Here's the real kicker though. My manager said that another female customer called in that same night and said that their pizza didn't arrive. It's fishy but I get the feeling it was her daughter, my ex, and they were fucking with me, but I like to think the best in people.

Very large purchases, maybe. But not everyday stuff. Anyway, this took place about four months ago or so.

It had been a rather slow day at work, and we had planned for that by scheduling lightly. Behind the counter was one of our newer workers, who was still being trained/getting used to using the registers. Maybe fifteen feet away, I was restocking and sorting our greeting cards.

About halfway through the shift, an older woman came up to the register and started a transaction with him. As payment time came around, I was just walking past when my coworker didn't notice she'd started to fill out a check. Interjecting, I said to the woman (Check Lady, henceforth) ""I'm sorry miss, we don't take checks.""

And in an instant, it's like I'd called her a cheap whore. On the offense, she replies ""Well I've already started to fill this one out. What do you expect me to *do* with this now?""

Me: ""Void it out, if you've got to. I'm sorry, but our main office forbids any location from taking checks as payment.""

Check Lady: ""That's absolutely ridiculous. I paid with a check last time I was here, I'm going to pay with a check this time too.""

Me: ""Again, I can't let that happen. If we let that you pay with that, both of us can be fired.""

Check Lady: ""Ugh, fine. I'll put it on my credit card. But I'm billing *store name* for the interest fees. You really ought to put up some signs if you're going to change your policy.""

At this point, I'm free to leave him to the card transaction. Several seconds later, however, that changes. Her card is one of the few types of cards that have several extra steps to put through our system, and coworker has never dealt with one before. Not blaming him at all, he'd only been there a month or so at that point. And 95% of that had been out on the floor, helping with the holiday rush.

As I come back over and take over, the woman continues on her entitlement spree. In the 30 second it took to finish the sale, she had the gall to inform me that ""This is absolutely ridiculous"" and that she'd ""lost a lot of faith in *Store Name*'s customer service today."" Luckily, she promised she would never be shopping with us again.

We're a pretty niche store. As far as I'm aware, there are only six stores in the state that sell the merchandise we do counting ourselves. Three of those are our other locations. I still smirk when I see her walk in.

It's a little longer than the last one but hopefully it's not too bad. It also isn't so much funny as just plain annoying.

This happened around Easter time and I was working stock in the stationary department when a woman aged perhaps 40-50 years old walks up to me with some craft stationary items. Let us call her CL (Craft Lady).

(CL is carrying a few packets of polystyrene ""decorate your own"" easter eggs and is looking at the pens, pencils and paints in the stationary section which I am currently filling.)
**CL**: Excuse me but do you know which would work best on these eggs? Would it be pen, pencils, paints or something else? I'm decorating them for my garden, you see.

**Me**: Oh, sorry ma'am but I'm not entirely sure! I think perhaps a paint that is resistant to water once dry might be best but I'm not really sure if that's correct. I'm sorry I can't be of more help to you.

**CL**: What do you mean you don't know which works best?! 
(Her voice gets ever so slightly louder and high pitched.)

**Me**: Well I'm not a craft expert and I wouldn't want to give you advice that I wasn't 100% sure of as I don't wish to ruin your display that you plan to make. It would be inconsiderate of me to give you some information that I have no guarantee is completely correct. 
(I start to blush a little as she steps closer and stares at me very intently before looking me up and down.)

**CL**: And *you* work **here**?
(She stands and raises her eyebrow at me, waiting expectantly for an answer.)

**Me**: Well yes, ma'am, I do work here... Why do you ask?
(I had to keep myself calm at this time because of the snort of absolute derision she made at my answer.)

**CL**: How can you even work here if you don't know what you're talking about? How **dare** you sell craft items if you *aren't* an expert. Where is your manager? I want to speak with them **right now**.
(She raises her voice at the last sentence and makes a point to continually look me up and down before rolling her eyes at me.)

**Me**: Ma'am, I am one of the store managers and I would appreciate it if you do not act so judgemental towards me when I am simply doing my job to the best of my abilities.

**CL**: **YOU** are a *MANAGER*?! No *wonder* this shop has no helpful staff if their **boss** is so f~king useless! 
(She then turns to the other customer in the aisle and begins to point at me and snort some more.)

**CL** ^(to the customer) : Can you *believe* this girl?! She's *lying* about being a manager! THE NERVE!

(Now this customer is a regular in my store and he is one of the quietest men I have ever met but she must have pushed his buttons because he spoke up for me. Let us call him Knight.)

**Knight**: Excuse me love, but this young lass actually *is* one of the managers and you're being a total c~t right now to her. I think she deserves a damn apology from you right now!
(He stood with his arms crossed and glared at CL who began to stutter and go red in the face.)

**CL**: HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME LIKE THAT! I'M GOING TO GET THE MANAGEMENT OF THIS STORE TO KICK YOU OUT FOR YOUR RUDE BEHAVIOUR!

**Me**: Well I am sorry to disappoint you ma'am but I **AM** the management and I feel that you are the one being rude right now. I am sincerely sorry that I am unable to be an expert on the 5000 plus items that we sell in store, items which change every single week might I add, but I am trying my hardest and you are out of line in your behaviour towards myself and your fellow customer. I am going to have to ask you to either apologise or remove yourself from my store.

**CL**: **YOUR** store?! You aren't even the manager! 

At this point I actually had to call the mall security to have her removed. She got a little mouthy and I was glad to have the security there as witness to her verbal abuse because she tried to bring the local papers into it, thankfully that never came to anything.

As for Knight, I gave him £5 worth of store credit (it was all I was authorised to give him without getting permission from my Head Office) and he still comes in every so often to talk to me.

TL'DR: Stuck up woman treats me like dirt because I am not an arts and crafts expert while working in a pound/dollar store. Other customer sticks up for me and woman is escorted from the premises by security. Tries to take the story to the papers, gets laughed at by them. The end.

* Me: We do offer a data backup service where we do just that, it runs for $lightly Overpriced Fee dollars.
* Customer: I was told it would be done for free.
* Me: I am unaware of such a service, do you the name of the associate of whom you spoke to?
* Customer: Yes, myname, it was you.
* Me: Are you sure?
* Customer: Yes I remember reading it on your name tag.
* Me: I'm sorry, but that is impossible, I have been away for the last three weeks and could not have been able to help you. If you would like to have the data backed up and transferred you can pay for the service. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

The customer then hung up.

The next story is at the tech counter of my store. A customer who I had sold a PC to roughly 6 months ago enters and puts his laptop down on the PC.

* Me: Hello, what can I help you with today.
* Customer: I need you to fix my computer.
* Me: Ok let me take a look to see what is wrong.
--The PC would POST but would not go into windows.
* Me: Ok, it looks like there is an issue with Windows. I can charge you a diagnostic fee that can be credited towards any repairs or to a new PC if your current PC needs to be replaced. I can probably find out what the issue is by tomorrow.
Customer: I bought the PC here, I want it fixed now. I know you have easy click click tap tap methods.
--I was a little bit startled by his statement.
* Me: It could be an issue with either the hardware of software. I need to run some tests in order to find out what the exact problem is so that I can fix it.
* Customer: No I want it fixed NOW!!!
--The customer then performs verbal diarrhea on me explaining his life story and how the world has been woe to him. My somewhat-of-a-bonehead manager exits the office swinging his keys in hand. The customer points at me and is calling me incompetent in doing my job.
* Manager: Sir, I realize you're in a tough spot and are having trouble. I'll return the PC for store credit or give you a new one right now.
* Customer: No, I want it fixed now.
--My manager then explains that we can not help him, the customer then says how it will be in the paper that he could not get his PC fixed (lol?). While walking out the door the cashier bids farewell.
* Cashier: Have a good day sir!
* Customer: I'm never shopping at storename again!
* Cashier: Have a good day sir! 

I just loved how the girl working as cashier had no change in tone after he said that haha.

Today I got this call, a bit odd as usual.

* Me: Hello, Retail Store townname, myname speaking, how may I help?
--The customer had a thick long island accent, not that there's anything wrong with people from Long Island, I used to date a girl from there.
* Customer: Hi, I would like to purchase computer xyz.
* Me: Yes we have it on clearance for $320 dollars
* Customer: Ok, and what comes with it.
* Me: A trial version of Norton.
* Customer: That's it? I want Office.
* Me: Yes, we have office for $140.
* Customer: I the office for free, I'm not paying half the price of the computer on Office.
* Me: I'm sorry, but I am unable to do that.
* Customer: Why not?
--Yes I was just asked that....
* Me: I'm sorry, I am unable to modify the price on anything.
Customer: What do you offer in terms of setting the PC up.
* Me: We can do (I describe a bunch of services I'd do) for $100.
* Customer: I want you to do that for me for free like businessname does it.
--I know for a fact that the other business we compete with does not offer the service for free...
* Me: I'm sorry, I am unable to do that for you, you need to pay for the service in order for me to perform it.
* Customer: So let me get this straight, I go in and buy the computer and you do nothing to service me as the customer? I saw you helping a customer with a new PC just the other day!
* Me: No, we do offer a (I describe an offer we give with every PC) with your computer to help you get started. I have customers buy a setup package every day, I was likely just helping another one.
* Customer: I'll just go to businessname. Goodbye.

--She never did. Ironically later that day the customer came in and quietly bought the laptop anyway. My cashier told me a woman with a thick Long Island accent had just bought a certain PC, I was laughing inside.

Personally, I would never send my little kid into a gas station alone. 

So the kid comes in and says ""This is for pump 8,"" and he hands me a check. 

We have strict check policies. We had a lot of problems with bounced checks for a while, so corporate made the check policies stricter. One policy is a customer can only write two checks per week.

Now, I can't run a check unless the person with the name on the check gives it to me. Fortunately, we have intercoms at all the pumps, so I hit pump 8 and said, ""I'm sorry, but you have to come in for me to process the check."" She get upset and asks why it's such a big deal. The manager told me, ""Just run the check. That customer has been here before and I know that's her name. I'm not dealing with this lady today."" So I run the check and it declines. The error tells me she already wrote two checks this week. I get on the intercom again and said, ""Ma'am, you have to come inside. Your check was declined.""

Me: ""Ma'am, I can't discuss your check information over the intercom.""

Lady: ""Why not?""

I turn off the intercom and just wait. I tell the kid to be patient and his mom is coming inside in minute. I assume she will get impatient and just come inside. It took 5 minutes before she stormed in. She yells, ""Michael! [her kid] What's taking you so long! Let's go!""

I say, ""Ma'am, your check was declined. You already wrote out two checks this week and we can't...""

Her: ""WHAT? I though it worked. I thought that's why you stopped talking!""

Me: ""I stopped talking because I can't discuss you check info over the intercom."" 

Her: ""Then why didn't you send my kid out to tell me?!""

Me: ""One, I need to talk to you, not a little kid. Two, I'm not sending a little kid across a busy gas station where people drive recklessly. ""

About 10 years ago, I found myself working in a department store after dropping out of high school in Australia. It seemed a good buffer before figuring out how I was going to get into uni.

While working there, I quickly learnt that were nasty customers, but there were also nice customers. I always enjoyed striking up conversation with the nice customers, which helped the day pass faster. One such nice customer was a woman, in her mid-40s, who always came in with a smile; but she never spoke back to me. 

She was deaf.

Nevertheless, I always made an effort to attempt conversation, which meant I usually carried a small notepad and pen in my pocket, so we could write notes and pass them back and forth. I decided that if I had a chance to learn sign language, I would take it.

Eventually, I left retail to finish my schooling, and where I went (TAFE) offered a variety of subjects to study - including sign language. I really enjoyed the class, and it was a rewarding 12 months of study.

Fast forward 10 years, to when I have a graduate degree, and someone deaf walks through my office. I excitedly introduce myself in sign. It's enough to make a connection, and exchange contact details so that I could continue to practice my signing.

That office later closed down, and shortly after, I found myself working as a project manager... in a deaf community services organisation. The person I introduced myself to turned out to be a director in the organisation, and when a new job was created, my name came up as someone to recruit.

Retail can be hard, unrewarding work, but it spurred me on to learn another language. Deaf communities in each city are small, so it shouldn't be too long before I run into the woman from the store again, and have a conversation without the use of my pad and pen.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1jjv9m,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1jjv9m/retail_made_me_learn_a_new_language/,

Reception is in the middle and we can all hear what each other is saying. My boss is kinda cool.


**The story** I recently had a customer come in to look at a fake stone product we sell. He asked what stock we had at the time and I advised we don't have any but we are expecting a new shipment in 6 weeks time (it comes from overseas). Customer nods, thanks me for my time, grabs a card and walks out.

The **very next day** the same guy comes in. Lets call him asswipe (AW)

**AW:** Hi, I want to pick up 35 cartons of the stone I looked at yesterday. My car is around the side. *Slams his credit card down on the counter.*

**Me:** Sorry sir, as I mentioned yesterday, we don't have any of that particular stone in stock for around 6 weeks. I can give you a call when it is in if you like, or we can go back to the showroom and you can have a look at the range we have in stock to pick again. 

**AW**: Are you telling me (voice starts to rise) that I drove for FIVE hour to pick it up and you don't even have it?!

**Me:** Sorry sir, I did mention when you asked yesterday that we don't have any in stock until (insert month I can't remember). 

**AW:** Don't treat me like a dickhead! I know you have it and just don't want to sell it to me. Get your fucking manager out here now, I am going to get your lazy ass fired you fucking bitch.

**Me:** No problem sir.   *Sticks my head into the bosses door to see him grin and wink.* 
He is coming now sir. 

**Boss:** (after taking his time to come out) Hi, I'm Bob (not real name). What is the problem here?

**AW:**(suddenly polite again) Hi, I came to buy some stone. Yesterday *she* told me that you have plenty in stock so I said I would be back today to get it. *She* is now telling me that you don't have any for a few months. I'm not happy as I wasted several hours driving here when she **knew** I was coming to get it. 

**Boss:** I was here yesterday when Rusty told you we don't have any in stock. She advised you when it would be in and offered to call you when it was in. She *also* offered you free shipping due to the inconvenience of not having it when you want it. 

You have come in here, abused her, acted extremely violently and told her that she is just choosing not to sell it to you. Do you think we would just decide not to sell to a customer that is so keen to hand over their money?

Guess what mate, you are right, we don't want your money and you can fuck off out of here. Take your fucking card *picks it up off the counter and throws it at him* and piss off. Don't come back. 

**AW:** Fine, I'm going to your competitor (insert name here) anyway. They were better to deal with than you dumbasses. *Storms out the door, reverses out of the parking spot hitting a large concrete planter and damaging his nice new Audi before pulling into the street, cutting a cop off and getting pulled over.*

The boss laughed, stood out the front and openly pointed and laughed as the guy got dealt with by the cop, before calling our competitor and giving them the heads up (though we run in direct competition with each other, we warn about fuckwits so staff don't have to get abused). 
He then shouted me a pizza for lunch and we laughed at the look of the guys face when the boss had a go at him.

**TLDR; Fuck with me within hearing shot of my boss and he will make you feel like a total dick, piss you off causing you to do stupid shit, ruin your chance at buying similar stuff from competitors, then buy me a pizza and laugh.**

We clerks were employees of the state, and had to follow stict guidelines for all sales.  For instance, we could be fired if we sold alcohol to someone who appeared to be intoxicated.  Also, if one clerk refused a sale, no other clerk was allowed to sell to that customer.  So...

One day I was stocking shelves and my coworker, let's call her Guadalupe, was on the register.  We were the only two clerks on the sales floor, as our manager was a boob who rarely left the office, even if there was trouble in the lobby.  This meant that, as the Senior Clerk, I was in charge.  

I was just opening a case of tequila to stock when Guadalupe surreptitiously sidled up to me and, in her thick Hispanic accent, pointed out a customer at the back of the store.  He seemed to be having trouble keeping his balance, and was swaying back and forth as he studied the vodka section.  Guadalupe told me that if he came up to her register, she intended to refuse service, as she suspected that he was drunk.  I agreed, and assured her that I would back her up if he became irate, as inebriated customers often do.

Sure enough, the man tried to purchase some vodka, and got very angry when he was refused service.  I heard Guadalupe very patiently and politely explain that it was state policy, and even point out the (giant!) sign stating that we do not serve customers who appear to be intoxicated.  He started screaming in a very heavy Russian accent that he wasn't an alcoholic and what kind of person did we think he was?  So I went over to him and tried again to explain our policy.  He would not listen, and shouted at us that he was going to call the police!

He stomped out of the store (nearly colliding with the doorframe), pulled out his cell and made a call.  He spent the next 40 or so minutes furiously pacing back and forth in front of our store, until.....a policeman arrived.  Guadalupe and I watched him yell at the policeman for a few minutes, and then the policeman entered the store.  

He asked me if I had refused the sale, and I replied that it was Guadalupe, but that I absolutely agreed with her decision.  The policeman looked surprised, turned to Guadalupe, and asked if it was true that she had refused the sale.  She, of course, admitted that it was.  

The policeman started laughing.  When he was done, he informed us that the man had called in and reported us for discrimination.  He said that we wouldn't sell to him because he was a foreigner!  But, after seeing the obvioulsy drunken man, and hearing Guadalupe's accent, he concluded that this was a false allegation.  

The intoxicated man, meanwhile, was outside smirking very smugly at us through the window.  Obviously, he expected the policeman to reprimand us and demand that we sell him the vodka.  He was very pleased with himself.

The policeman thanked us and went back outside to the waiting man and spoke to him.  I don't know what he said, but we could see the man visibly deflate more and more with each passing second.  Then the policeman pointed away from the store, obviously sending the man off.  And, on top of that, he sat in his patrol car and made sure that he didn't get into a car and try to drive away!

TL;DR: A drunken man called the cops when legally refused service at a liquor store.  The cop sided with the clerks, and made the guy walk home.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,standard,True,t3_16wxkq,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/16wxkq/the_policeman_was_amused/,

I take recalls very seriously, especially since we've had so many lately. I'm sure customers have noticed the empty shelves recently. 

I came in at 4:30pm and assumed my spot at the register. Not 15 minutes later, a middle aged woman walks in. 
Her: ""I paid $23.99 for this cat food when the food rep that was here told me it was $9.99."" I wanted to tell her to learn to read labels. 

So I called the manager. I'm not in the mood to argue with this crazy lady. I was enjoying the peace and quiet because it was dead in my store. So the manager goes back and talks to her and shows her the food, then they walk up to the cash register and the manager refunds the difference because we just don't care at that point. No use in arguing. 

While my manager is refunding the money, the lady walks up to me and says ""Wasn't Nutro recalled? That's the food I bought!""

Me: ""No ma'am, Natura was recalled. That's why there's a huge empty spot where the Innova food used to be."" 

Her: ""But I *saw it on the internet*!""

Me: *internally facepalming* ""No, Natura was recalled, NOT Nutro...""

Her: *Talking to phone* Google Natura! *pulls up website* It's on the FDA website! See!"" 

Me: ""Yes, NATURA was recalled NUTRO was not. You've got them mixed up!""

Her: ""B-b-but it's right here!"" 

Me: ""Are you accusing me of selling recalled food? I take that *VERY* seriously. I know the recalls before they are even announced. I took that product off the shelf. You can take the lot numbers from that site and you're welcome to go check the dog and cat food sections because I would never sell recalled products.""

Her: ""But they sound so alike.""

Me and Manager in unison: ""But they're NOT!"" 

I missed the end of the conversation because I had another, non-annoying customer to help so I turned away. I am still amazed at that level of stupidity. Natura doesn't even sell food under their name. They're just a parent company and manufacturing plant. I have pulled almost $5000 worth of product since December.

Just to put things in perspective.

It was a new store and the store manager was younger than me. God only knows how someone so young made it to that position, my opinion was that he worked the shaft, HARD.

As I stated previously, I worked at a well known video game store. This tale of yore happened mere days after starting in the wonderful world of retail. I was young, naive, and was excited about selling something I loved so much. 


It was early, 9 in the morning and I had just driven up in my crappy '88 Honda accord. The day was full of possibilities. Quickly jumping out of my car I noticed a man much older than myself, I being a mere 18 years of age, coming out of the store. I thought nothing of it as I skipped in youthful merriment into my place of employ. The bell sounded, I waved happily at my Boss at the time, Josh, and headed for the back to place around my neck the vestige of most retail employees. The name tag.


Hearing the bell ring again, sounding the entrance of a potential costumer, I darted back out with a grin on my face. I was surprised to see the gentleman from before had reentered the store. In my naivety, I thought, *Surely he just decided he wanted something else as well.* I clocked in and smiled brightly as he stared confusedly at the computer games.


I glanced at Josh, who was hard at work putting away the daily deliveries. I shrugged and headed over.


Me: Hi, Welcome to &amp;lt;Game store&gt;, I'm sweetsrmything. How can I help you today?


Man: uh...yeah...uh...I'm looking for a computer game, do you have anything you'd suggest?


Me: Well I just got into WoW. 


I proceeded to tell him about all the games I enjoyed on the computer and why, he eventually settled on World of Warcraft and I helped him to the register to check him out, having easily spent half an hour working with him. Not a big deal, he was our only customer at the time. I happily chatted with the man as I rang up his game and time card. 


Then, I made my first mistake.


Me: Can I help you find anything else?


Man: Yes, you could help me find your phone number.


I froze, surely I'd misheard. I was only 18, a mere 5' 3"" and 110 pounds looking far younger than I actually was. This...gentleman, was easily my father's age. His striped polo pinned shirt was tucked awkwardly into his slightly baggy pants, which flooded far above his ankles. His long white socks easily visible, one bunched the other straight. He wore no belt. I could see my shocked expression gleam from his beginning to bald head, his gray hair reminding me of one of my mother's horses. His mustache was astounding, like one you would find from the seventies, and his Coke bottle glasses accentuated the shine of anticipation and hope in his beady eyes.


I was flummoxed. I had never been in a situation where a man so much older than myself had clearly been attracted to me. I hurriedly wondered how my friendly nature could be so misconstrued.


I glanced desperately at Josh, not knowing how to handle the situation. I was shocked to see him hunched over a game case, giggling like a madman. I thought quickly, how do I make this man leave me alone.


I lied.


My second mistake.


Me: I'm.... sixteen.


Man: So?


He smiled! SMILED at me. I was horrified, I stared in abhorrent wonder at this man ahead of me. I couldn't believe the horror I felt at that single word. I slowly, so very very slowly, shook my head. In a quiet voice I muttered, no. 


He seemed surprised by my answer, and suddenly dejected. He made no fuss, and just took his items and receipt. Like a kicked dog he slunk out of the store, never to be seen again. 


I turned to Josh and in utter bewilderment asked, ""What the hell was that??""

I work at the front desk of a hotel; I'm not sure if it's classified as retail, but I have to deal with plenty of rude people and idiots. This happened a while ago, but I'll try to recall it the best I can.

I work the night shift, and it's about 1am on a holiday weekend. We are pretty much sold out of every room except for a $149 suite. An asian woman walks in with her boyfriend/husband. (note: my hotel is in a well-off incredibly asian area, so just read her lines with a very, very think chinese accent).

woman: I need a room, please. I stay here before.

Me: Well, we're pretty much full tonight, the only thing I have available is a $149 suite. I can give you a 10% discount, would you like that room?

woman: No! I stay here before, I want regular room, 1 bed.

Me: I'm sorry, but like I said, we are full, and those rooms are not available.

*woman leaves in a huff*

The next night, at almost the exact same time, she comes in again. O course, still being the weekend and all we are out of rooms except for the *$169* suite.

woman: I need a room. regular, 1 bed.

Me: Do you have a reservation?

woman: No, I come here all the time, dont need reservation. 1 bed, regular room at my special price!

Me: I'm sorry, but we're still pretty full, all I have left is (I explain)

The woman then gives me one of the worse death glares I have ever seen. She cocks her head to the side and scowls. I can see her husband stepping back...

woman: you telling me that there are no more rooms left but suites. You tell me same thing last night! I think there plenty of rooms and you just want me to buy a suite!

Me: I can assure you, ma'am, that's not what I'm doing. I can't sell you a room that I don't have.

woman: Then I want a regular room, 1 bed, special rate!

Me: Those rooms are unavailable ma'am. I can give you a discount on the suite, though, if you want it.

woman: I dont want suite! I want regular room! You go kick someone out and let me have room!

Me: I'm not going to do that.

woman: WELL I STILL WANT a ROOM AT MY SPECIAL PRICE!

Me (envying the dead at this point): Like I said, there are none of those available.

woman: I know you lying! You have plenty of rooms!

I print out the official report of how many vacant/ready rooms are available. It clearly shows the one suite room available, and that's it.

woman: HA! I want THIS room, my price!

me: Ma'am, that's the $169 suite.

woman: I WANT IT FOR MY SPECIAL RATE!

I look up her ""special rate"". She was a frequent customer months ago so she had a running rate of $69 for a regular, no frills 1 bed room.

me: (I explain my discovery)

woman: OK! Give me that room, my price!

me: I'm sorry, I can't give you $100 off on a suite. Only a manager can authorize a heavy discount like that.

woman: THEN CALL HIM! RIGHT NOW! SPECIAL RATE!!!

me: ...it's 1:30 in the morning. I'm not going to bother him.

woman: (screaming at this point) I WANT ROOM SPECIAL RATE!!! I STAY HERE ALL THE TIME!!! $69 FOR SUITE!!!!

me: ....that's not going to happen.

I started with the regular spiel, and he said, “I need to furnish a whole house.” Uh, yes, sir! His house was being built and was due to be finished in a few weeks, making it the opportune time to buy our made-to-order furniture, because it can take 6 weeks to get here, but as I was selling, he never really had an opinion on any of it, just kept asking for mine. I’d push a little, “This or this?” and might get a response more than, “Which do you like?” but not by much. It was really very odd. Then I asked this question: Do you have any other furniture to incorporate with the new? He said, “No, nothing.” I figured kicked out/divorced. I didn’t ask, but he decided to explain, “My wife left me.”

Me: Oh, I’m sorry.

Him: She had Lupus.

Me: That’s very unfortunate.

Here is where the story actually begins. He goes on to explain to me that they had gotten married about ten years before, and he worked in oil (didn’t look like a roughneck, but I didn’t ask) and was away a lot, so she spent the her time in school, earning a bachelors and then a masters. Shortly after she got her masters, she was diagnosed with Lupus. They put her on steroids, as is the norm, and everything seemed to be mostly okay, except every time he talked to her she said the steroids made her fat and she had half a mind to stop taking them. He’d tell her, “No, take your meds,” and when he was home he always saw her taking them and she really didn’t seem to be gaining too much weight, so he didn’t think anything more of it than that she was noticing her jeans getting a little tighter. One day he got a call from his mother-in-law saying that his wife was unconscious in the hospital and her kidneys were in failure. When he arrived, they had her on IV steroids, the failure had started to reverse, and she apologized to everyone, told them she hadn’t been taking her meds because she didn’t want to get fat, said it wouldn’t happen again, and so on. A couple weeks later, he had to go back to work, and she was doing well and back on oral steroids, so it seemed life was back to normal. Until she died. She had gone back to live with her mother, and apparently her husband was the only one who actually watched her take the pills, so when he left, she stopped and no one noticed.

This is where is gets kinda crazy.

Her family blames him for her death, and decides to sue. They want everything of hers, period, doesn’t matter if it was shared or not, and want half the value of the house. Judging from the way he told the story, I believe they were harassing him and threatening to sue, not that they actually did sue, but I don’t know any of that for sure. So he packed up her personal belongings (family pictures, personal jewelry, and other personal mementos) in a box and mailed it to her mother, and then donated the house and everything in it to charity, including both cars. He said that if they wanted to sue a church, that was their business. He bought a new car, bought a new house (that was in the process of being built), and was set to leave it all behind.

Now, I’m sure you can all imagine that there is absolutely nothing that can come out of my mouth at this point other than, “Wow.” He looked me dead in the eyes and said, “And don’t accuse me of being a heartless bastard, because she left me for her pant size.” Yes, sir.

After the story, he was more receptive to picking out his stuff, and he sure enough did buy an entire house of furniture. Today I saw him at a local restaurant, and I, of course, had not forgotten him, but I was a little surprised when he waved at me and came over to the cash where I was. He thanked me because when he walked into the store last year he felt like he killed his wife, and when he started to tell me the story, he realized it was her decision and her doing, and he couldn’t beat himself up over it forever. He paid for my milkshake, thanked me again, and left.

It was a weird experience all around, but I will definitely never forget that customer.

I had worked as a server at a restaurant for the previous two years so I'm pretty used to shitty people but nothing could have prepared me for this experience.

I had just started my shift at the front register. Pretty normal day so far. Then the front doors open and the stench of stale sweat and cigarettes hits me like a brick wall. In walks 'Murica, the living, walking embodiment of nearly every negative American stereotype: morbidly obese, terrible hygiene, camo shorts, wifebeater shirt, 'Nam veteran hat...etc. You get the picture. I give him as friendly of a greeting as I can muster ""Hello sir, welcome to _____, is there anything I can help you with?"". He responds with an unintelligible grunt and walks past, barely acknowledging me. I figure he might be a bit of pain in the ass when he checks out but hope he won't be too much trouble.

After about ten minutes of ringing up customers as usual, the smell of sweat and cigarettes hits me again as I look up and see 'Murica shuffling towards me as fast as he can with the angriest look I have ever seen on his face. He moves in front of the customer I'm currently working with and starts screaming ""GET ME A MANAGER RIGHT NOW, BOY!"". I quickly finish up with the customer I had been helping and turn to help him. The managers are usually extremely busy so I politely ask if there's anything I can do to help him. He get's even more pissed and yells ""NO! THAT DAMN CHINK AT THE PHARMACY CAN'T SPEAK AMERICAN! I NEED TO TALK TO A MANAGER ABOUT ALL THESE DAMN MINORITIES Y'ALL ARE HIRING!""  He is obviously referring to our head pharmacist who is Vietnamese but speaks very good English with a barely noticeable accent. 

I try to keep my cool and get on the intercom and call for an available manager. Mr. B, the assistant manager leaves the office and makes his way towards the front. Mr. B is extremely professional and well spoken and is also one of the friendliest guys I've met who will go way out of his way to help customers. He is also black. I get a bad feeling about how this racist asshole is going to react to him.

Mr. B approaches him and politely asks how he can help. 'Murica immediately goes off about the ""chink"" pharmacist,, how our store should only hire white people, and how immigrants are taking over America...etc. Somehow, Mr. B is able to keep calm and says to him ""Sir, I think you need to leave"". 'Murica immediately shouts back ""AND I THINK YOU NEED TO GO BACK TO AFRICA YOU NIGGER!!!"" By now, everyone in the store has gathered around to see what all the commotion is about. Mr. B is usually very patient when it comes to rude customers but this was the last straw for him. He gestures toward the door and sternly tells 'Murica ""Get the hell out! NOW!"". 

All the commotion has gotten the attention of our head manager, Mr. K, who is white. Mr. K runs to where we are and asks whats going on. Mr. B and 'Murica both give their sides of the story. I expect Mr. K to promptly kick this asshole out of the store. Nope. He profusely apologizes for the inconvenience and ""unfair treatment"" Mr. B gave him. He then proceeds to give 'Murica a $20 gift card to our store to make up for his ""bad experience"". 'Murica strolls out of the store with a smug look on his face while going on a rant about ""chinks, spics, homos, and niggers"". Mr. B was then called back to the office and disciplined for his ""poor customer service"".

I've never been so pissed in my life and I'm still fuming at this. Ugh.

This story has never personally happened to me, as when I worked in the back I never had to stay late. But recently hours have been cut (we close at 8:30) but many coworkers have to stay until 9 to clean everything, mostly because my boss will take an order at 8:05 when the take out portion should close at 8. 

So, when people stay late, they write it down on the schedule, no big deal right? Wrong. My boss will white out any extra time put on the schedule. He refuses to pay anyone for any extra time because, and I quote, ""I am the boss. I make the rules"".

 Well no, you don't, the government makes the rules, and I do believe what he is doing is illegal, but I can't approach him since it has never happened to me, and my coworkers just go along with it.

She just about exploded. More yelling, more cursing, more name calling. Right about that time our area security guards come by because they patrol and heard her shouting.

The poor security guards are confused since they know I am the manager and dont understand why she thinks I am not the manager.

She wasn't listening to me or the guards, so they gave me the option of asking her to leave the premises. I ask to to please leave and say that i am sorry she cannot return the game.She gets pissed,crumples up the receipt, and throws it at me and leaves.

The kicker is the receipt was for [National Chain Game Retailer] in Modesto, CA. My store is in south western LA county.

So... I work at a retail store in Israel, where we sell computers, smartphones, etc.  
I've been working there for a couple of years now, and I've had my share of abrasive customers. Today, however, was the first time that I've actually refused service to a customer.

Our stores are usually pretty busy. We have a tech-support bar in-store, where people come to get help for their products.   
Usually they have a line of people waiting for service, so every customer that buys anything in our stores is advised to schedule an appointment (by phone or online) before they arrive for support, so they won't have to wait.

So today, this guy comes in. I finish with a customer and offer my assistance. Before I even get to ask what his name was, he began to complain about how he's been waiting there for over 10 minutes (though I saw him come in approximately 90 seconds earlier) and how rude we are for not coming to help him immediately.

After about a minute of listening to him complain about the service, he finally told me why he came in. Turns out that his Apple TV has stopped working, so he came in to get it looked at. When I asked if he had set up an appointment, he said ""no I haven't. I'm here now, so I expect service now, and **don't give me that face**"".   
What face? I have no idea. That's my regular face! Should I be insulted?

I told him that I noticed there were quite a few people waiting in line, so he can either stay there and wait until every person with an appointment had been given service, or I will gladly set him up with one for tomorrow or some other day.

That wasn't a smart thing to say, apparently. He was visibly angry, saying that when he bought his device at one of our other stores ""they wasted my time for over an hour, **and you're wasting my time right now**"".  
I told him that I'm sorry that he had a bad experience at the other store, and that I'm just trying to help. He answered by saying ""so what are you waiting for? So far, **all you've done is annoy me**"".

I was obviously quite stunned by that. I began a sentence by saying something that roughly translates to ""listen, man"", and he cut me off by saying ""I'm not your friend, I'm not your brother, **so watch your mouth**"".

At this point, I've had enough, so I told him that if he wants he can go talk to someone else, because I'm not willing to continue this conversation.
I walked back to the office to get a drink of water and regain my composure. My manager was there, so I told him what happened, knowing that he'll probably need to face the guy in a few minutes. 
Not 10 seconds later, the guy **steps into the office**, screaming that he demands to see the manager right now.

After we got him to go outside, my manager, who is awesome, told the guy that after the way he spoke to me, it would be best if he would set up an appointment and come back another day.

From lazy to crazy, I have seen some stuff in my time.

Today I had an experience unlike any other. A customer calls in to ask if we have various common items, which we always stock. The customer also asks if someone would help ""get the items"". I said, ""sure, not a problem"".

An hour later a middle aged man (tall and in shape) in a suit walks in, grabs a folding chair and a shopping cart and sits at the front of the store. When he is asked if he needs help he tells our cashier, ""somebody needs to get these items for me, because they told me they would"". Confused the cashier asks me to come to the front and help the customer.

When I asked the man if he needed help, he became quite agitated and raised his voice. ""Well, how many times are you people going to ask me the same questions!? Just get the stuff so I can leave already!"" I asked what he needed and was handed a stack of papers printed off the our online website (probably 30-35 pages of items with sizes/colors written next to the items and quantities. I called my manager for help at this point and met him while gathering the items. 

My manager found the situation odd and went to talk to the customer, while 3 other associates rounded up the merchandise. My manager came back agitated and told us to ""get the asshole out of here pronto"" he wouldn't say why (but promised further explanation later).

Checkout total was just south of a grand and the customer had two cards declined. He blamed our cashier calling her an idiot, and then thankfully the third card went through. We then had to load the bags of merchandise into his car, while he waited.

After leaving our manager told us that the customer had informed him he could not walk around the store it was beneath him. He said ""your people get paid to do this, they can earn their keep today"". He had to walk away or he would have said some awful things to him, and I'm sure we'll receive a nasty complaint that corporate will harass us about.

I wear many hats in the company, one of which is fill-in sales person. Not my forte, but it's a nice change every once in a while. 

We do offer a rent-to-own option, but the more patient and budget conscious customer may choose to take advantage of our layaway program. No fees or interest, but you don't get to take the item home until it's paid in full.

One fine day when I'm filling in on sales, a couple customers are browsing the store. One customer is a regular... she's a bit of a quack (often calling the store drunk to ask about a purchase), but we don't mind her because she buys the most expensive items and she shops often... buying things for herself, as well as her fully grown adult children. We'll call her Drunk Quack. The other customer is yet another regular; she comes in about once a week to pay on her layaway account. She's a chubby, quiet lady who we'll call Chubby Lady. 

Chubby Lady browsing for a few moments while I'm helping Drunk Quack. I leave Drunk Quack to thumb through a couple catalogs while I ring Chubby Lady's layaway payment out. She leaves and shortly after that, Drunk Quack leaves, stating that she'll talk to her hubby and be back. 

Not even a half hour later, the phone rings and it's Drunk Quack. She has also obviously enjoyed a few beverages since she got home. 

Me: ""Thank you for calling [store name], this is Jen, how may I help you?"" 

Drunk Quack (slurring): ""HI JEN! You know that pregnant girl who was in the store when I was there?"" 

I'm slightly confused. There was only one other person there... Chubby Lady... she is chubby, but CLEARLY not in a pregnant sort of way.

Me: ""Ummmm... I think I know who you're talking about."" 

Drunk Quack: ""She was paying for something on layaway. What was she buying? She can't afford anything for her baby?""

Me: ""She's paying on a television.""

Drunk Quack (suddenly enraged): ""WHAT?! Why is she buying a goddamn television?! SHE SHOULD BE BUYING BABY THINGS!!! I was going to buy her crib for her... but she's not buying a crib! SHE DOESN'T DESERVE MY HELP NOW!!!"" 

She slams the phone down. I don't even know what to say. Some people... maybe I should have mentioned that I had just found out I was pregnant. Free baby stuff? Why not?

First, a little backstory. I supply staff for most raves in my city, and throughout the night, I'm normally running the coat check. I love what I do, but because these are raves, obviously a lot of the people I deal with are high as fuck on one thing or another. Keep in mind, since I took over the coat check for one organizer in particular over a year ago, not a single thing has ever gone missing/gotten stolen from the coat check.

So one night I'm running the coat check, my girls and I are keeping things running smoothly, up until disaster strikes. One girl brought her ticket up, and the girl dealing with her couldn't find her coat. I take the girl's ticket and go looking myself, and the hanger with the matching ticket attached is empty. I go see the girl and ask her to describe her jacket. 

""Black canada goose jacket with fur on the hood""

*facepalm*

So I spend, I kid you not, two hours checking every jacket in my coat check, and cannot find hers anywhere. I call one of the organizers to coat check, as nothing has ever gone missing before, and I'm not quite sure what to do.  The girl spends an hour fighting with us, demanding we give her the $600 her jacket costs. I remind her we have signs stating we are not responsible for any lost or stolen items, but she is welcome to come into the coat check with me and look for her jacket.

Obviously she is not pleased with this, and I tell her the only other option is to wait until the end of the rave, and see if we can find her jacket then.

She keeps fighting with us, and eventually I stop and turn to her and say what was going through both mine and the organizer's minds the whole time: 

""I'm sorry your stuff is missing, but in all honesty, who brings a $600 dollar canada goose jacket to a goddamn illegal rave?!""

And this is the best part. An hour later, my friend comes inside with a jacket, saying he found it in the snow outside. I found the girl and showed it to her. Her reply?

""Oh that's right. I forgot it outside! teehee""

TL;DR: bitch high as fuck, buried her $600 dollar jacket in the snow.

And to the MODs: Sorry, I know this should probably be in r/talesfromthejob , but it's just not as good as this subreddit. I'm security but do a lot of customer service. So that counts... right? Guys? Hello?

Anyways, besides all the calls we receive for *Cablesight*, we get a myraid of telemarketers.  The three most common ones are 1.) You've been selected for a free cruise  2.) You've been selected for a free home security system, and 3.) You may be eligible for a small business loan from the government for free.  

After several requests to have our number removed from the lists, we started messing with them.  I mean fuck it, they are scams.  Just wanna get you to give away your info.  So why not mess with them?  Here's a couple scenarios we went through.

**Security System Scenario #1**:

Scammer: Hi, thank you for holding. My name is Douchbag Scammer.  How are you today?

Me: I'm fine thank you.

S: So you're interested in our FREE home security system.  (He really liked to stress the word FREE).

M: Yes sir.  I got a neighbor whose spying on me, and I want to put an end to it.

S:  Oh well neighbors can be annoying sir.

M: Not like this. This guy works for the government. He's spying on me, I know it. This system is just what I need. But I could never afford one. Credit got destroyed when I went to jail.

S: Jail?

M: Yea but that bitch deserved it. Anyways, now that I got an alarm system, I can invite him over, set the alarm, and when he trips it I can shoot him dead and say he tried breaking in.  It's the law.

S: umm. Sir. I don't think you can do that.

Me: Don't tell me that, I know my rights. Someone breaks in and I can kill him dead.  I'll get rid of that fucker reeeeaaal quick. 

*Scammer hangs up*

**SecurityScenerio #2**: (I'll just skip ahead to where they ask if I'm interested in the system)

S: So you wan't to know about our free system?

M: Yes but I had some questions first.

S: Go ahead sir.

M: So this is for doors AND windows right?

S: Yes sir.  

M: And I can set the alarm, and still be in the house, long as no one opens the doors.

S: Yes sir.

M: Good. I'll tell you. My daughter just turned 14, and I caught her sucking her b/f's cock the other day when I followed them out on their ""date"". Can you believe it, my baby, A WHORE!  I tell you it took all my rage not to murder that little bastard b/f of hers.

S: Uhhh....

M: You have a daughter?

S: N...No sir.

M: Well let me tell you. You don't know rage until you see someone's balls resting on your daughters chin. (at this point, I almost lost it, because my co worker is next to me, and couldn't hold in his laughter anymore)

S: Well that's a shame sir.  If we could just get your info we cou...

M: I tell you, I'll make sure that slut doesn't get out there to suck anymore guys off. I'm sure she has a reputation.  If she's anything like her mother, she can suck a golf ball through a garden hose.  

S: Sir I'm not really comfortable with this.

M: I know I'm sorry for unloading on you.  I also want to make sure that you send a female installation tech.  If a guy shows up he better be castrated cuz he aint gonna get near my daughter.  She's a whore, and I know how these things go. If a male shows up I'll kick his ass then come kick yours.  Put your security system to the test, you feel me boy?

*Hangs up*

**Security Scenario #3** (Note: For this one I gave a really germanic name. Like Victor Von Shaft or something)

Me: So this will connect to fire and police and EMS right?

S: Yes sir it will.

M: There is a way to leave a special note for my account right?

S: A special note?

M: Well you see, it's a delicate situation. My parents are both gone, and my grandmother is somehow still kicking.  She tends to wander out of the house a lot, and we want to keep her inside.

S: I'm sorry to hear that. My grandfather had alzheimer's and tended to wander. I know it's not easy.

M: Well she's not senile. She's perfectly sound for someone her age.  It's more of the fact of our neighborhood.

S: Neighborhood?

M: Well, we live down the street from a Jewish retirement home.  And you know old people. Always holding a grudge.  Grandma never was very forgiving after the Nuremburg trials.  Grandpa was stoic and accepting of what had happened, but Grandma has always been outspoken about it all.  It can be a hassle. You know how it goes right?  Despite the evidence, people just think this so called ""Holocaust""  *ACTUALLY* happened.  Crazy right?  But anyways, we just want to avoid issues with her going and yelling shit at the people there.  

*Hangs up the phone*

**Free Small Business Loan from the Government Scam**:  
(Once again skipped all the unnecessary introduction parts)

Scammer: So you have a small business?

M: Well no. Not per se.  But I am in the middle of a venture at the moment, does that qualify?

S: Well is it a business?

M: Well. No. I'm writing a play that I hope to perform for the world.

S: Well actually we can work with that I think. What is the play about?

M: Well, it's hopefully, depending on licensing, going to be a musical version of Harry Potter.

S: Well that sounds nice. A lot of kids would like that.

M: Well it's not for kids. You see the entire thing will be performed in the nude.

S:  In the....

M: Nude. Yes. It will envoke the real essence of magic from the HP universe.  You've read the books right? Imagine that world, full of beautiful naked human beings, just being themselves, not ashamed and hiding.

S:..... I don't think we can fund this.

M: Please. You have to. I quit my job for this. Everyone else said it was crazy.  I just stay in and write all day. I'm on the last book. Im *SO CLOSE*. My wife even left me, saying I was creepy and obsessive over it.

S: Well I'd have left you to.  I know you think you're being funny, but it's not.

M: It's better than scamming people out of money. Let alone sticking around for a call to a security office where everything is being recorded.

S: Recorded? 

M: Yup. Everything  logged and recorded audio too.  Isn't technology grand?  I can do all that just as easily as you steal information from your victims.

I opted to work the midnight shift, as it paid more and afforded me the opportunity for me to get more hours.  Since my place of employment borders on a rather bad neighbourhood, we have a security guard monitoring the premises all night long.  On my shift we have two waitresses (myself included), a cook, and the security guard on the premises.  There is no manager or shift leader present.

We have a regular customer, Lenny, who is about 6'5"" tall and weighs at least a solid 300 lbs that really, really likes to hug female employees.  He is also slightly mentally handicapped, but is still functional enough to have obtained a commercial driver's license (he is a trucker) and live on his own.  Most of the other waitresses allow him to hug them and ""get it out of his system.""  (These being the same waitresses who sit on customers' laps and flirt heavily for tips, and see nothing wrong with staying with abusive or cheating boyfriends.  Not exactly women's rights advocates, here.)  I, on the other hand, really don't appreciate physical contact from strangers.  My usual coworker, Angela, feels the same way.

Now, Lenny's ""hugs"" are not your typical hugs.  He only hugs women, and also seems to enjoy fondling women's bra-straps during the hug.  He also forces these hugs on people, grabbing them and pulling them in HARD if they don't reciprocate the hug.

After being taken aback and rather upset my first encounter and forced hug from Lenny, I couldn't exactly yell at him to get the hell off me, as that would probably have resulted in my being fired.  I started resisting by standing behind the counter to take his order.  He walked around it and hugged me anyway.  I tried anticipating the hug and backing away quickly, to no avail.  Extending my hand for a handshake was equally fruitless.  Planting my feet firmly on the ground to avoid being pulled in when he approached didn't work, either.  I'm barely 100 lbs and rather petite, so no matter what I did, I'd be physically overpowered and have my face smashed into Lenny's smelly, unwashed man-boobs while he fondled my bra-strap every time.  Angela and I would trade off on who had to wait on him, and neither of our strong nonverbal cues worked.  Whoever wasn't waiting on him had to hide in the back, because he'd hug whatever females he saw.

A few weeks ago, Angela had the night off and I was working with a male server who we'll call Bruce.  Bruce, knowing how I felt about Lenny and his hugs, offered to wait on him in my stead.  I was very grateful, and started sweeping up the back to keep myself busy and out of Lenny's sight.  As soon as Bruce approached Lenny with the menu, Lenny started yelling and cursing, saying he didn't want Bruce waiting on him and demanding to know where I was.  Bruce and the security guard managed to calm him down, and Bruce waited on him anyway.

Later that day, when Bruce and I told our boss what happened, she said that she flat-out didn't believe us; that Lenny was just a ""big Teddy Bear"" and that she had never seen him act in a hostile manner toward anyone.  She did not take our complaint seriously, and pretty much thought we were lying.

Lenny came in again a few days later.  i was off for the night, and Angela was working with another girl.  Lenny hugged the other girl first, which made her extremely uncomfortable.  When he went to hug Angela, she stepped back quickly and said, ""Please don't touch me.  I don't like hugs.""  Lenny started screaming and yelling, and made such a commotion that both the cook and the security guard approached and escorted him from the building.  Apparently my boss was informed, and had a talk with Lenny, telling him that he must respect the personal space of others, ask before hugging, and keep his cool or he would not be allowed to return.

Fast forward to two nights ago.  It's nearly 5am, and Angela and I are almost finished with our shift.  It has been a very slow night, and the restaurant is peppered with a few (mostly elderly) coffee-drinkers who are quietly watching the weather report.  Lenny lumbers in, and stands near the counter.  Aware of Angela's previous incident, I volunteer to wait on him, and approach him with a menu.  He walks around the counter, goes in to hug me, and places his hand on my back.  Being very careful to keep my tone and expression as pleasant as possible (figuring that he reacted poorly to Angela due to her brusqueness), I quietly say, ""Please don't, sir.""

And that's when all Hell breaks loose.

Lenny starts yelling and screaming and cursing.  The only words I could make out were, ""If you don't want to be friendly, then I won't be fucking friendly!  I can be REAL FUCKING MEAN!""  I take a few steps back toward the doorway leading to the server line.  In a single bound, he is practically nose-to-nose with me, screaming at an unbelievable volume and making threats and flailing his arms about.  He had clearly lost control, and I was fairly shocked and terrified.  Angela, who had walked up behind me by this point, grabs me by the elbow and yanks me through the doorway and out of sight.  The cook RUNS out to get the security guard.  Lenny continues his tirade until the security guard approaches and asks him to leave.  I can't see what is happening at this point, but I can hear Lenny start screaming even louder.  I hear a few loud THUDS and peek out to make sure the security guard is okay.  Lenny is throwing things and kicking things and knocking things over and having a violent tantrum near the front doors.  The few other customers are looking on in silence, wide-eyed and too afraid to stop Lenny because of his massive size.  

The security guard, having lost control of the situation, tells Angela to call the police.  She dials 911, and is explaining to the dispatcher what is going on when the shift leader for the next shift, Liz, walks in.  Liz is a veteran waitress, having worked at this particular restaurant for over a decade, but is still shocked to see the commotion in the dining room.  She asks me about it, and I manage to blurt out that Lenny started raging when I asked him not to hug me.  Liz, apparently having balls of steel, walks out into the dining room and approaches Lenny.  I excuse myself outside at this point, to get some air.

When I returned a few minutes later, Lenny was sitting down at the counter chatting with Liz.  I asked Angela what happened, and she said that Liz invited Lenny to stay and eat, allowing him to hug her in the process, and assuring him that he wouldn't be denied any more hugs...which apparently calmed him down.  Angela was FUMING.  As she finishes telling me this, a police officer approaches us.  The officer in question is an almost nightly customer of ours, whom we know rather well.  As Angela explains the story to him, Liz walks up and essentially tells the officer to go away, and that nothing is wrong and she'd gotten it under control.  The cop sees the horrified looks on my and Angela's faces, shakes his head, and leaves.  Liz then allowed Angela and me to hide in the back until Lenny left the premises, fearing right along with us that he might snap again or lash out at one of us if we got too close.  She told us to just let him hug us next time, regardless of whether we want to, to keep the guy happy.  I was rather appalled by this response from a shift-leader, but there was nothing I could do.  When I spoke with my boss, she said she'd ""talk to"" Lenny again.

As of today, the situation has still not been handled, I am still expected to submit myself to unwanted ""hugs,"" and I am frantically looking for a new job.  Sorry for the wall of text; I'm pretty pissed off.

One of those chains that makes burgers, steaks, fish, pasta, etc.  Nothing fancy but not fast food either.  Anyway, the waiter we had was fantastic.  When I was asking him about the new additions to the menu and how spicy they were, he was very helpful, asked me a few questions about what I liked, suggested something else that he thought I would like better, and said he would make sure it wasn't made spicy (I don't like spicy food).  The food was absolutely delicious, my mother's food was too (he suggested that dish to her), he was attentive, polite, and an all-around great server.  I made sure to thank him, and gave him a good tip.  Now, what made me feel kinda sad for servers was this:  I saw the restaurant manager walk by our table while we were eating, so I flagged her down.  As soon as I said I wanted to say something about our server, she got this terrified look on her face.

Anyway, my employees have to explain this to every single guest who comes in. It was the first Saturday we were open so we were very busy. I hear some guy raising his voice from my office so I go to investigate and my attendant is walking over with an annoyed look on his face and says ""he wants to talk to a manager."" I walk over and this huge bald guy in a suit and his huge wife are standing there. I say ""how may I help you"" and he looks at is ugly wife and says ""look at this fucking asshole, probably just a little bitch for the owners."" I keep calm and say ""did you need help?"" and he said ""give me a fuckin access card so I can go play craps."" I say ""sure thing, that will be 10 dollars each."" He said ""I ain'y paying, just give me the fucking card."" I stand silent and stare at him in the eyes for a long 30 seconds. He said ""is this guy fucking serious? JUST GIVE ME A FUCKIN CARD!"" I ask ""is that usually effective?"" ""What the fuck do you mean?"" ""Is treating complete strangers like they are pieces of shit on your shoe usually effective?"" He said, with his nose in the air ""I always get what I want."" I said ""Not today, get the fuck out of the casino."" He was so shocked he looked stupid and he stormed away.

You can slice a pound of ham and discuss things simultaneously without your work suffering, right?

So on the day in question, I was working with two other employees.  One was waiting on a customer and I was talking with the other, who was a 16 year old girl whose father was in the hospital and probably dying.  It was not a frivolous conversation.

Had she asked nicely, I would have helped her, but I was angry that she thought her fucking deli meat - which she WAS getting - was more important than this little girl whose father was dying, so bitchy employee - as in me - told her only one person could help her at a time.

Afterwards, I started to feel kind of bad and resolved to apologize when I saw her next.  A few weeks went by before I saw her again.  I went up to here in the aisle and said ""Hey, I wanted to apologize to you about the last time you were here.  The girl I was talking with was upset because her father was dying.

Then something awesome happened.  She said ""Oh, I was kind of rude, too.  I'm sorry.  I had actually just begun labor and I was uncomfortable and cranky and wanted to go home.  I had my baby later that night.""

A few years back I needed a new bed so I decided to move up from a queen sized bed to a king sized bed. Mostly because, fuck it, it would fit in my bedroom. Like an idiot it didn't occur to me that none of my queen sized sheets and bedding would fit the new bed. So I head to a store that rhymes with arget. 

I get in line with a new set of sheets, a mattress pad, a blanket and a new comforter. When I get to the cashier, all of 16 and nervous looking, I give her a friendly smile while she rings though my stuff. This is the conversation we had. 

her - ""Wow you've got a whole new set of bedding."" 

me - ""I needed it. You'd be surprised how much blood is in a 95 pound Asian hooker.""  

her (after she stopped ringing and turned slowly to me) ""Seriously?""

me - ""Yeah, because I killed a hooker and thought I'd randomly confess it to you."" 

her - ""Really?"" 

me - ""No."" 

As I was walking out I turned back and saw her waving a woman who I assume was the head cashier over to her register. She looked at me nervously as she did this. I waited in the parking lot for a few minutes to see if the cops were going to show up. 

I still can't decide if I should feel sorry for freaking her out, or sorry that she wasn't smart enough to get that I was joking. ",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_17fk3r,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/17fk3r/the_other_side_of_the_register_for_a_change/,

A little background to this story: We just got a new part timer in our department and even though she's been here about two weeks yesterday was the first time I've met her. She witnessed this whole thing go down and hopefully she doesn't think this happens often.

Yesterday at the shoe department it was pretty bonkers; tons of clearance going on so I had a lot of customers wanting shoes and I was by myself until 45 minutes before my shift ended. New girl, who I'll call NG from here, had just gotten in but I was helping a customer so I hadn't really gotten to chat. After I left the customer, a teenage girl, I go talk to NG. Halfway through finally introducing myself we see this kid bolting down the front center aisle of the accessories department, yelling ""I didn't steal nothing!"" followed by our two LP officers charging after him at full speed. The kid was carrying a backpack full of Polo shirts and dropped it while he was running. After they turn the corner me and NG and another customer start chatting about what happened. A few seconds later a couple other kids (one carrying a Victoria's Secret bag--an important detail) cut through our department, heading toward the direction the other kid was running. I saw in my most threatening, authoritative voice, ""Are you with the kid who just ran by here?"" They denied it, acting like I was crazy but I knew full well they were. I can't do anything to them so I let them go.

A couple minutes later the teenage girl I was helping before the incident comes up to me and tells me that one of the two kids who walked by stole her Victoria's Secret bag! At this point I see them walk toward the front exit so I follow after them. 

Now as most of you fellow retailers know you just can't tackle someone on probable cause (or at all, unfortunately), so I follow closely behind. I call out to them but the keep walking. Once they leave the store I can't follow anymore so I turn around and go back to my department. I feel like a jerk at this point for letting them get away and tell the teenager I'll have to get a hold of security about it.

The LP officers come around to accessories a couple seconds later, huffing and puffing and I tell them what happened. They go talk to the girl and mall security gets involved. All the while I'm standing there like an idiot because I let some kids get away with theft right under my nose.

Later after all the info is taken about the incident the teenager and her mother return to the shoe department and I apologize a million times. They say it's ok, it was only a couple of t-shirts. I tell them that the girl who stole the shirts is probably going to be disappointed because she's a little too fat to be wearing size small shirts. They laughed and thanked me and though I still feel a little guilty I think I made their day a tiny bit better.

So, within the first 45 minutes of meeting me NG got to watch an attempted robbery and a definite robbery. I told her after all was said and done that things like that don't happen too often. She seemed like she enjoyed the specticle and hopefully she likes me and working in the shoe department.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,standard,True,t3_1keyxl,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1keyxl/that_girl_just_stole_my_bag/,

About a decade ago, My (ex)-boyfriend and I were living together, and he got an offer to manage one of those self storage facilities. You know the places, like the one you see on those reality auction shows. He was also able to bring me along as his assistant manager.  I have many stories from that place.  This is the best (worst) of them.

Now, a big selling point of this place was it had an apartment where the manager would live, so someone was on premises at all times.  The manager would live there, rent and utilities free.  Now, while it was a great idea in theory, in practice, it was its own special kind of hell.

We had this one customer, let's call her S, who was about a hundred and fifty years old.  She lived alone, was a hoarder, and her son and the town forced her to take out some storage rooms to get some of the crap out of her house.  Lucky us, we got her.  She needed some help moving, mainly because her kids wanted nothing to do with her, so my ex (let's call him X) called these guys who specialized in rubbish removal, because he figured they'd be best best equipped to deal with the disaster her house was.  

When they arrived at the storage place, they were so not happy.  R, they guy who was in charge, told us that they dumped the worst of the stuff while S wasn't looking, because it was too gross to be moved, and S freaked out whenever they threw anything away.  The other guys just kept shaking their heads and muttering about ""feces"" and ""bugs giving birth to other bugs.""  R didn't talk to X for a while after that.

S would come by the storage place to, I don't know, hang out with her stuff I guess.  Sometimes she'd come into the office and sit in the chairs and mumble at us.  We'd ignore her and eventually she'd wander out, but leave a nice big wet spot on the chair.  Good thing she could only drive about 5 mph, because we'd see her coming and quickly wrap the chairs in plastic wrap, telling her she had to sit on the plastic because we just had them cleaned.

One day she comes in and goes into the bathroom.  At first, I'm thrilled.  ""Yes!"" I say to myself, ""she's going to piss in the bathroom and not on the seats!""  But then 10 minutes goes by.  Then 20.  30.  By 45 I'm starting to freak out.  ""Oh no, she died in there.  I can't deal with that."" I'm thinking as I knock on the door.  ""You ok S?""  I call and almost fall over in relief when I get an answer of ""I'm not dead yet!"" through the door.  Thank whoever, she's alive.

The door cracks open.  ""Excuse me, may I have another garbage bag?"" S asks meekly.  And this smell...oh my glob, the smell.  I jump out of my seat and go over to the bathroom.  ""Another garbage bag?  S, what did you do?""  She tries to block me from seeing into the room, but she's only about 4 feet tall, so I easily see over her.

It's shit.  The room is covered in shit.  It's everywhere.  It's on the toilet.  It's on the sink.  It's on the floor.  It's on the walls.  It's on the...

""S....what....did....you....do?""  I gasp. 

She glares at me ""I'm sick.  Haven't you ever been sick?""

""Yeah, but not on the floor and the walls and the how did you get it on the CEILING??"" I just couldn't go on.

S just stands there and stares at me.  ""Aren't you going to clean it up?"" she demands.

 X comes in at this point (I forget where he was), sees the disaster.  He always had a weak stomach, and turned completely green.  

I groan, knowing I'm going to have to deal with this.  ""She needs to go,"" I tell him as I go in search of cleaning supplies.  ""She needs to go now.""

S then bends over to get her purse.  It's at this point I realize, (she had a long coat on) she's not wearing pants.  Or underpants.  Nothing.  I saw IT in all of IT's glory.  IT looked like a purple wallet with red lollipop sticking out of it.  X gets a pair of his own sweatpants and gives them to S.  He gets her out of the office before I completely lose it and immediately gets her son on the phone.  S needs someone to take care of her, obviously, and her son needed to step up.  X made sure he knew that.

I lost track of how much time I spent in the bathroom, scrubbing it down.  I scrubbed and bleached and lysoled and scrubbed again and bleached again.  The shit (no pun intended) was everywhere.  I guess she had tried to clean it up, but just ended up smearing it.  I found the garbage bag that was in there, full of shitty clothes and paper towels.  The bag was warm.  I'll never forget that.  The bag was warm.

tl;dr: Old woman paints public bathroom with her own shit.  Doesn't think she did anything wrong.

His name will be Cranky.

Me (ringing items up):  Do you have a (insert store name) card?

Cranky: No, I don’t have one.

Me (beginning to bag his items):  Would you like to sign up for our free rewards system?

Cranky: No, I don’t want to.

Me:  Okay, your total comes to twelve fifty.

Cranky (staring at me):  Are you done with all the harassment yet?

Me (surprised):  Excuse me?

Cranky:  I bet you don’t see it that way, do you?  You stand there and ask all these stupid questions.  I just want to pay and leave.

Me:  No, I don’t view it as harassment.  I view it as being part of my job.  I’m required to ask all customers if they have a card and if they don’t, I am supposed to ask if they want one.

Cranky (still not showing that he intends to pay for his items that have been bagged since before I even told him the total):  Well, it’s a waste of time.  I don’t like to be harassed when I go to the store.  I just want to buy my things and go.

Me: Okay, well, your total is twelve fifty.

Cranky:  That’s more like it.  I don’t want to stand here and answer a thousand questions.  I am tired of people asking me if I want a store card.  I just want to buy my items and leave.

Me:  Okay.

Cranky:  How much did you say it was?

Me (slightly more enunciated this time):  Your total was twelve fifty.

Cranky: There we go.

He finally got out a twenty dollar bill to pay with and tosses it on the far side of the counter behind his bags, you know, as far away from me as possible.

Cranky:  What did you say the change was?

Me (slightly exasperated at this point, fighting to keep it out of my voice): Fifty cents.

Cranky (digging out dimes, pennies, and pocket lint that he drops on the counter):  You get it.

This annoys me further, but I pick up his coins because I just want him to leave. I finally complete the transaction and think I am going to be free from his presence when I give Cranky his change and put the receipt in his bag.

Instead, he continues to stand at my register and give me a lecture about how people just want to buy their products and leave.  He says they don’t want to be interrogated as they are paying and he thinks it’s ridiculous that all these cashiers are always harassing people asking about cards everywhere he goes.  He says that he says no every time and for some reason we can never just remember that he doesn’t want one.

This is the thing about people like Cranky.  They don’t want to just pay and leave.  They want to give people like me a hard time.  It is part of my job to ask about cards and if they want them.  All they have to do is say no.  I work it into the process of ringing them up and I don’t make them wait any extra time.  He wasted more of his own time than I did.  If you just want to buy your items and leave, then shut up and do it.  It is not difficult.

TL;DR:  Customer just wants to pay for items and leaves. He wastes his own time and mine by lecturing me for a few minutes.

1359501326.0,405,self.TalesFromRetail,17ixnu,That's not how returns work. Not here or anywhere else. ,BAWWWWful,487,82,143,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/17ixnu/thats_not_how_returns_work_not_here_or_anywhere/,"Today I present you with a familiar retail tale, you know the type. Corporate sets a policy, management communicates that policy to the sales associate, sales associate attempts to enforce policy, spineless manager bends policy to avoid confrontation. It makes you wonder why policies exist in the first place. This tale is not as gross or shocking as some of the other stories about returns, but it is one of the more memorable from my experience. 


This occurred circa 2009 when I worked in the Men's department of [crappy department store]. Our store's return policy was more than fair if you ask me. Most merchandise, except for electronics, could be returned with a receipt and we would return the amount paid for the item in the form that it was given. If you had the receipt, you could return merchandise in virtually any condition, there were very few limitations on this. If you had no receipt, we could return the item for store credit so long as the SKU came up in our system and the item wasn't visibly worn. We even accepted merchandise with no tags, as long as it was something we currently carried and therefore could obtain a SKU and process the return. Exchanges were allowed as long as the item was of equal value, preferably the same brand and style. You get the idea. Often when customers found out that they could only get store credit without a receipt, they would opt for an exchange. 


One day, a middle-aged man approaches the register brandishing a visibly used Fossil belt with no tags. I shall call him **Belt Guy**. Belt Guy asks if he can return the belt. It's me and two other employees working that day, **Michelle**^not ^her ^name and **Lindsay**^same ^deal. 

*Foreshadowing: Michelle in particular is known for not taking shit from anyone, and for regularly complaining that management makes the sales associates look bad by not backing them up on policy issues.* 

At that moment, Michelle was elsewhere in the department straightening merchandise. Lindsay and I were talking with Belt Guy at the register, we explained the policy and stated that a belt in that condition was not returnable without a receipt. Given that it was a Fossil belt, we didn't even know whether he bought it from us to begin with. We directed Belt Guy to the corner of the department where the belts and wallets lived so that he could buy himself a new friend. 


Belt Guy returns about 10-15 minutes later carrying a brand new Fossil belt with tags. If memory servers, it wasn't even the same belt as the one he was attempting to exchange. As he casually passes by the counter, the following dialogue ensues.


**Belt Guy**: I put the other belt on the rack and I exchanged it for this one, OK?


I'll pause the dialogue for a moment so we can all take that in. This customer thought it was totally normal to ~~exchange~~ take new merchandise without presenting his original merchandise, and that he could just walk right out with it. OK, *resume play*.


*(He starts towards the door.)*

**Me**: *(flabbergasted)* What?

**Lindsay**: Sir, you can't do that.

**Belt Guy**: *(looking perplexed)* What?

**Lindsay**: We would have to actually process the exchange at the register, we need a record of the transaction in our system. 

**Belt Guy**: But someone said I could!

*Lindsay and I exchange looks, knowing none of us would tell a customer they could do such a thing.*

**Me**: Who?

**Belt Guy**: It was a lady... she had brown hair.

Note: the description he gave seemed intentionally vague, and the only one of us who could be described that way would be Michelle. We knew she wouldn't approve something like that.


It was pretty clear to us what was going on here. This guy knew he wasn't going to get his return through the proper channels because he had probably worn his old belt for years and knew we couldn't turn around and sell it to someone else.


Fortunately, Michelle was just coming back to the register at that point, perhaps seeing the commotion. 

**Belt Guy**: You! *(points at Michelle)* You said I could just leave the other belt on the rack and take this one!

**Michelle**: *WHAT?* No I didn't. 

**Belt Guy**: Yes you did! I want to talk to a manager!


You can imagine our joy^facetiousness upon hearing those awful words. At [crappy department store], the procedure is to call customer service and request that a manager come to the department. Whichever manager is available will head over. So, one of us makes the call while Michelle, understandably, continues arguing with the customer. I would be angry too, being accused of something that I know I didn't and would not ever do.


We quietly groan among ourselves when we see who we won playing the manager lottery. It's **Nancy**^still ^with ^the ^made-up ^names! . Nancy isn't your run-of-the-mill spineless manager. Oh no, Nancy was much worse than that. She had no business being in a management position. She was the epitome of non-contfrontationalism, a complete doormat. Don't get me wrong, she seemed like a nice enough lady and all, but why take on a position of authority if you're incapable of telling people what to do?


Nancy strolls up to the register, already looking meek upon seeing all the commotion. Michelle argues her case, the customer argues his, Lindsay and I chime in with bits of policy, particularly underlining the reasonable notion that when you exchange merchandise, you should ACTUALLY GIVE US THE MERCHANDISE. This back and forth goes on for a while, Nancy nervously glancing between the four of us, until she just can't take it anymore. She throws her arms up in consternation:


**Nancy**: Oh, just let him take the belt!


And that was it. She walks away. The three of us are wearing our best *are you fucking kidding me?* faces, and the customer gleefully strides out of the store. 


That's right. The fucker got away with it. I don't remember if that was the last straw, the one that broke my morale, but I do know that not long after that the job became nothing but a paycheck to me. I started to just cut out the damn middle man, give the customers whatever they wanted, and deal with the repercussions. Spoiler alert: there never were any.

I have now worked in a public library a bit of time and I have seen some strange things.  

**Background:** I am a female college student in my 20s and, by far, the youngest employee of the library.  Usually, I handle the computers, the teen room, and occasionally the textbook area.  Here are some of the incidents I have encountered in my short time here:


**IDENTITY THIEF**
This happened during my first month.  I was working the circulation desk (where people check out books) and an older gentleman comes up to me.  He says hello, asks how I am doing, and seems very pleasant.  He then asks if I could look up a book for him about gardening.  I ask for the name of the book, and I find it in the system for him.  It is, unfortunately, already checked out so I offer to place it on hold for him. He agrees and I ask for his library card.  He lets me know that he actually is new to the area and doesn’t have one yet but would like to get one.  No problem.  I just need to see proof that he lives in the city limits.  He pulls out a bill that has his name and address and I tell him I just need to see some ID, preferably a license.  This is when he goes ape shit.  

He yells: “I KNEW IT! I KNEW THE GOVERNMENT WAS TRYING TO STEAL MY IDENTITY! YOU AINT GETTING MY BRAIN, YOU’LL HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT I KNOW FOR YOURSELF!” He then pulls out little bits of paper from his pocket, throws them in the air, and runs out the door. Never saw him again.


**PRINT, PLEASE, THANK YOU**
At this point I had moved to working at a different desk where I took care of people who needed to print things.  A Chinese man comes up to my desk and holds out his flash drive and says “Print, please”.  I try to ask him exactly what he needs, but soon realize that he doesn’t speak English.  I tell myself that I will try to help him as best as I can and take his flash drive.  I open it up and, of course, none of the files are in English. I ask him which file, and show him the screen and he says: “Thank you. Print, please”.  Although more frustrated, I decided to continuing helping.  I opened up each file and each time he shook his head no until we reached the file he wanted.  Keep in mind, there were about 100 files on this flash drive.  Eventually, we made it to the paper he needed to print and it ended up being a sign-up sheet for a class to learn English.  It had taken 20 minutes, but when he saw his paper he beamed and said “Please print, thank you!”


**ITS OKAY, I’M A TEEN**
This story wasn’t that frustrating, just kind of scary for me.
The library has a teen room that they reserve only for teens.  Others can go in and grab any book they want, but the computers, desks, and couches in there are meant just for teens.  They have that rule because more teens are likely to come if they have their own spot.  Teens are anyone who is anyone between 12-20 years old. 

One day, a man goes and sits on one of the computers.  It was incredibly obvious he wasn’t a teen.  I let him know the rules about the room and he says that he didn’t know.  I go back to my station.  15 minutes later, I look over and he is there again.  Now this isn’t someone who is bordering on maybe being a teen, he is a big, burly, black man that was at least 40 years old.  I let him know again that he can’t be there and that there are computers elsewhere.  

He smiles at me with what teeth he has left, and we have this dialogue:

Man: Looking me up and down “It’s alright sweet thang, I’m a teen”

Me: “Sir, it’s obvious that you aren’t. I’m going to have to ask you to use a computer elsewhere in the library.”

Man: “I promise, it’s okay, I’m a teen.  It must be your girl hormones getting all worked up over how manly I look”

At this point he is trying to get near me and touch me so I exit the room and go to my desk.  From my computer I shut down his account so he can’t use that computer.  He comes up to me, fuming, and says his computer is broken and that I have to fix it.  He was getting too close to me.  I told him that our system was fine, and that that computer must be broken but he could try another computer if he wanted.  

Man: “Bitch, I ain’t payin’ for your shit computer. Fuck off”

And then he left the library.  


**THAT’S NOT WHAT I’M LOOKING FOR**
I was now working the information desk where I helped people find a book they were looking for.  A man comes in and mumbles a bit and asks me where the romance section was.  I point him in the direction, he thanks me and leaves.  Another man then comes up and he starts asking for a book recommendation and we start chatting about various books.  The other man then comes back, pushes the person out of his way and looks at me angrily.

Mumbling man (MM): *indiscernible mumbling*

Me: “Sir, I didn’t get that, could you speak up”

MM: “THAT’S NOT WHAT I’M LOOKING FOR.  THE SECTION WAS THE WRONG ONE. WHERE ARE YOUR GRAPHIC NOVELS”

Assuming he meant comics and such, I sent him to the graphic novels section.  I continue helping other patrons.  

About 5 minutes later he comes back, angrier.

MM:  *indiscernible mumbling*

Me: “Sir, could you repeat that”

MM: “THAT’S NOT WHAT I’M LOOKING FOR. AHH! THAT WAS 
WRONG TOO! WHERE ARE YOUR MAGAZINES”

He was yelling loudly but it is my job to help him so I pointed him to the magazines.  At this point, I was catching on to what he actually wanted and asked our security guard to stand near me in case he decided to get physical.  The man comes back, as expected, and this time he is fuming.

MM: “THAT’S NOT WHAT I’M LOOKING FOR! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU, ARE YOU A RETARD”

Me: “Sir, if you would calm down and let me know what you are looking for, I could help”

MM: “FINE. I’m looking for your exotic section”

Me: “Our…exotic section?”

MM: “Yes. Your pornography. Books, magazines, DVDs if you got ‘em”

Me: “Sir, this is a public library, we have no pornography of any sort”

MM: “Oh. You sure?”
Me: “100% positive”

MM: “Oh. I guess that makes sense.  That’s alright. I'll just find something else to read”

He leaves and heads off into the Children's department. At this point the security guard follows him and eventually escorts him off the premises.


I have lots more stories and will post them later if I have time.

I used to work in a music store.  We sold all the usual good stuff. Guitars, drums, horns, DJ gear.... you get the picture. For the most part, we had pretty good customers.  A nice blend of kids getting their first instruments, home pickers, seasoned pros.  We even had a couple minor/former celebrity types that would come through on occasion.  We also had our fair share of douchebags.  Musicians, right?  We're a special breed.  

The one guy who sticks out most in my mind was a guy in his late 50's, let's call him Don.  Now Don was the sort of regular that all of the staff cringed at the sight of.  He was short with a protruding beer gut, draped with oversized rings and chains, and drove a loud firebird complete with the giant emblem painted across the entire hood of the car.  He was incredibly self important and would frequently butt into staff conversations with customers so he could give his very own opinions on whatever they were talking about.  And he loved to name drop.  I've never seen someone drop so many names in a single conversation!

So there we were one sunny afternoon and all was going well.  In comes Don who immediately makes a bee line for our one guy who seems to indulge/tolerate his usual hot air.  I'm at the counter as well restringing a guitar so I get to listen to our hero go on and on about his many conversations with Joe 90s Rockstar who is not only going to produce Don's new album, but is going to bring Don in as a session player on his own new album.  

Restringing a guitar is pretty simple stuff, so I'm just taking my time with it as I listen to the hot air flowing to my right.  A customer comes up from my left and I look up to see none other but Joe 90's himself!  He was the type that had his 15 minutes back in the early 90's and then faded into general obscurity, his One Big Song still getting a bit of radio play here and there.  He's local, as regular a guy as can be, and stops into the shop from time to time for a bit of gear or some fresh sets of strings.  I greet him with the usual ""Hey Mr. 90's.  How's things?  That everything today? etc."" and start ringing his purchase through.  My colleague looks over with a grin and says ""Oh hey Joe.  Don here was just telling me you guys have a couple big projects coming up together""  
Well Don turns to spot Joe and gets this huge deer-in-headlights look in his eyes.  Joe just takes a look at him and says ""Buddy, I don't even know you""
Don's response is to stammer for a second or two while turning beet red before making a hasty exit.
Joe, for his part, just finishes up his purchase and we talk a little shop about the new strings he's checking out, then he heads out.  
I left that job shortly after so I never found out if Don ever came back or if there was any follow up to the incident.  Still... it felt really good to see a name dropper get called on his actions like that.

For 2 years, I worked in the customer service area. I was about 20-21 at the time. If anyone works in retail now, avoid customer service areas at all costs. At our store, we did money wiring transactions, lotto, and some bills were able to be paid here. A majority of the time, we dealt with people who had forgotten coupons, or we explained the weekly ad a little more clearly for people who didn't understand at first. My story occurs with the latter, and a special kind of asshole.

I had this guy come up saying he wasn't given the special discount for a certain type of ketchup. The sale we had running was a list of items throughout the store that when you bought ten of them, you received so much off of your order. It was always easy to tell which items were on sale on the receipt, because they were marked with an asterisk. I **always** hated these sales. The messed up thing was, for specific items, they were specific sizes or ounces. This ~~dick~~ customer came up and said, ""I didn't get my five dollars off."" Common complaint. I check his receipt, and notice his two ketchups are not the correct brand. I let him know which brand is actually on sale and I would be more than happy to give him a rain check if we happen to be out of stock. He gives me the look. We all know that look. This is our conversation. 

C-""I don't use that fucking ketchup."" 

Me-(dumbfounded) ""I'm sorry sir, but that is the ketchup that is included in our sale.""

C-""I don't give a damn, I want **THIS** ketchup, and I want it **NOW!!**""

C-""Sir, this ketchup is regular price, if need be, I can always get a manager to see if there is anything they can specifically do."" 

By this time, I have a line of about 3 people. There is a stocky woman in her mid 30's, who I know by name. Lets call her Sally. Sally usually comes in to buy lotto tickets. Midday/Evening Pick 3. Always the nicest customer I had. Sally walked up midway through this conversation, and is giving said ~~jerk~~ customer the dirtiest look. 

C-""I don't need your manager, I want **YOU** to quit being so god damn lazy, and give me my $5 dollars back!""

Me-""Sir, this isn't something I can just do, I need management approval.""

C-""You know what, this is why people bring guns into places like this..""

My jaw hit. the. ground. I have never been threatened with a gun in my life. I froze, and didn't want to move. Everyone around the customer service/self checkout heard him say this, and I thought of one quick retort. 

Me- ""Unfortunately, I have to take that statement as a threat. Now, the police need to be involved.""

C, obviously nervous-""I'm leaving anyway, since you won't do shit for me.""

Dickhead bolts for the door, with Sally on his heels making a call to the police.

Sally-""DON'T THINK YOU'RE GETTING AWAY WITH THIS!""

Sally was my savior that day. She followed the guy out to his car, and gave the police his licence plate number. She stayed until the police came in to talk to me. The store manager, who was usually a jerk, let me sit up stairs with Sally while we both talked to the police individually. After the cops talked to the customer himself, they ended up banning the guy from the store completely and I got to go home early. They never found any evidence that he had a gun on him, or if he even owned a gun. 


Even telling this story now gives me chills. I sincerely hope no one is ever threatened with a gun while working.

**EDIT**- formatting/spelling

**EDIT 2**- I didn't expect this many comments for my story, but a lot of people said how great Sally was. I did buy Sally about $20 worth of lotto scratch off's, and paid for her daily pick 3's for a week. I wish I could have done more, but she refused me buying her a gift card, or giving her cash for anything else. I have since lost touch, but she is a great person, and I hope she continues to be blessed to this day.

I will exclude certain names with ~~.

It was a typical Sunday morning, rather slow when a SUV pulls around. My crew was already working on a car so I walked over and did the usual, ""Welcome to ~quick lube~, my name is SuchNSuch, are you here for our ~main service~""

He looked at me with a fire in his eye and said, ""just pull my damned car in, change the ~FLIPPITIDO~ oil and let me go!"" So I did the usual as calm as I could, ""alrighty sir! Just gonna have you release your hood latch for me and ill escort you to our waiting room"" with a giant smile on my face as he says, ""why the ~FLAMBOOZLE~ do I have to open my hood?! That's your job!"" So I explain to him, ""well as a liability reason we ask all customers to release the hood latch so that if it becomes damaged we are not responsible"" he mutters some words and complies.

I take him inside and show him around the waiting area, coffee, restroom and magazines located. He then turned to me as if he was ready to kill. 

He screamed, ""I WANT TO SEE A MANAGER NOW!!"" So I tell him I am the highest ranking member of the team as the General Manager and ask him what I can help him with.

He begins to say the following.
&gt;I brought my car here 4 months ago! I saw YOUR employee pulling a plug out of my rear differential and I guess he didnt put the ~FLAPPING~ plug back in because when I was driving 4 days later my rear differential was bone dry and locked up!! I had to spend three-THOUSAND dollars on a new one!!!&gt;

( Side note - I that business, if you have ever had service done at any location nationwide we can see it immediately on the computers, we can see what day, time, services done and everything. And this guy had never been to a location ever)

So I asked him to hold on a moment I would pull up some records, find out who was working the lower side on his vehicle and if he brought me in the receipt for the new differential I could have my Director of Administration cut him a check to reimburse him the cost. At this point he had this dumb look on his face like ""oh shit"".

Trying hard not to laugh at this point, I walked over to the computer and typed in his info and asked him if he changed any information because I couldn't find it in the system. 

He said, ""well look harder! You guys did it!""

So I typed some stuff in and nothing. I told him nothing was coming up, he became infuriated and started shaking in anger, trying to hold back my laughter I told him to wait a moment I would speak with some employees to see if they remember. Walked downstairs and had myself (along with the employees who were witnessing the events) a real good laugh. 

When I returned he screamed, ""you know what?! ~FLIP~ you! And ~FRIGG~ this place!! 

At this point his oil change had already been completed as he brought in his own stuff. He jumped in his car and bolted without paying.

I called my district manager and told him the story in all it's hilarity. He told me he would take care of the rest.

3 weeks later we got a visit from the local PD saying that he was actually going from place to place trying to get money for his ""busted differential"" and stealing services from quick lubes. He was arrested and case closed.

It's also a fairly low-income town. So needless to say, my clientele doesn't always represent the cream of the crop. 

Tonight I had an older man at my register, and he didn't move about very well. His cane was in the shopping cart, and it was obvious that he wasn't going to get very far without support. He didn't have a whole lot of stuff, but it still wound up being two bags worth. 

Now he'd planned to cart it all to his car and return the cart, like any reasonable person would do -- but we've got such a theft problem, carts included, that the carts all have poles on them that prevent them from being taken out the door. (There's normally a couple that don't, in case someone *really* needs one, but... they're missing. Again.) 

Right behind him was a kid, somewhere in the 10-13 range. He'd obviously been sent on an errand; all he had was two boxes of tissues. Not to be judgemental, but honestly he looked like the kind of kid I might have to watch in the store in a couple of years. Saggy pants, lopsided ball cap, oversized hoodie. 

As I'm scanning his tissues through, I explain to the old man that I can help him with his bags in just a moment, as soon as I've finished with the kid. And before anyone else can say anything, the kid steps up and says, ""I can get your bags for you, sir."" 

Sure as anything, he gathers up that guy's bags, waits for him to get his cane all situated, and walks him right out to his car. 

I *know* something like that shouldn't move me that much. But it's just so damn rare around here to see kids display any real initiative to help others that my manager and I just stood there as they left, shocked. It made my day.

In fact, it was the first time I'd ever worked more than 9hrs in a day. So expect this post to be long. I'm warning you now. It's going to be a read.

I work in Make-A-Monkey, Create-A-Cat, Build-A-Bulldog, etc. You get the idea. As usual, I will preface this by saying I LOVE my job. Love, love, love my job. Anyways, on to my lovely Valentine's Day. 

It was busy. The day before that, I'd prepared to be called in early. My original shift had been 4-close. (store closed at 9, usually finish cleaning around 9:30) However, my ASM woke me up at around 10:30 and asked me to come in early. No biggie. In fact, that awesome. More hours and more money for me. 

When I got there, my ASM apoligized profusely for taking time away from Valentines(she knows I live with my bf) and thanks me for coming in. It really wasn't a huge deal though. My boyfriend and I had basically already decided that since we are so poor, there is no sense is celebrating a money-spending holiday like V-day. As he said, ""We don't need to spend scrupulous amounts of money on each other just to say 'I love you'."" 

So basically, Thursday is truck day. One manager usually stays in the back to unpack the boxes and put all the shit away. While 1-2 floor associates handle the floor. Since it was going to be a busy day, they had a floor associate and my GM working the floor while my ASM did truck. The problem soon arose when they realized a newbie had been the scheduled floor associate. So my GM was having to try to work on the new floor sets, work register, answer questions for guests, *and* help put away any of the new stock that was supposed to go on the floor. The problem had become worse when they realized that out of the remaining three people to come in, I was the only one who wasn't a new hire...somebody really screwed the schedule up.

I ended up getting put in the hole to unload the boxes and put them either on the floor or top stock. Which took a good 2hrs. The whole time I was in the backroom, I could hear it getting progressively busier but I did not expect to see what I saw when I went back on the floor. It was literally worse than Christmas. The store was trashed, there was a line out the door and down the hallway, and there was a steady crowd forming in front of register. 

I hopped on register for a few hours until we go to a slow point then made a stock list. I was about halfway done pulling everything when my manager(I think I called her Kate in another story) who had just took over floor after the ASM and GM left, came to the back to tell me she needed me on the floor. The store was swamped again and remained that way steadily until around 8:30. It didn't really slow down, it just got to a point where nobody was waiting the be rung up and I could talk to my manager, Kate, for a second. We had to send one of the new girls home because she had stayed 30min past her shift and we had to leave the other one on the stuff machine because that's all she had been trained on so far. 

Kate and I made a game plan basically. She told me what we needed to get done before the end of the night, so I made myself, Kate, and the new girl all a to-do list. I felt bad for the new girl because she got all the shitty cleaning jobs but she was too inexperienced to know how to stock, reset the floor set, and box away the Vday stuff. Tonight was definitely not the night to teach her either. I got the lists handed out and then put the gate halfway down to discourage any more customers from coming in the store. It was starting to slow down around 8:45. The lines were going down, but it was 15 until close and we still hadn't even finished the midday stock, started a close stock list, or began to put out the new floor sets. 

7 minutes until close about 10 families ducked under the gate and started browsing. I let everyone know the store was closing in 7minutes and got complaints from everyone that, ""Well we thought you had later closing hours on Valentine's Day. You really ought to. It's almost offensive that you don't."" 

Like what the fuck? Okay, don't wait until 8:50 at night to go shopping. Dafuq people?! Then this one family. They topped it all. They'd driven over an hour to our store because the one closer to them was closed for renovations. That store sent out mailers and handed out flyers for MONTHS letting people know to come to our store instead and still people call us all like, ""OH MY GOD! You're actually open?! Oh thank GOD!"" Like every single one of our stores closed for renovations at the same.

Anyways, back to this family. They'd driven over an hour. The wife was hearing impaired and talked in a way that made it very hard to understand. Her husband had a thick African accent and they often switched between speaking English and their native language...which did not help for communication. Their kid/grandkid(not sure which) obviously did not even want to make a bear. It was like they were talking him into it essentially. Like for example, I overheard this convo while they were looking at clothes.

Dad/grandad : Hey didya see this outfit? It's really cool.

Kid/grandkid: Yeah, it's alright.

dad/grandad: Well let's get it then.

Kid: I don't know

Dad: well you said it was cool so why not get it? Oh my God, we are just getting this.

Kid: Fine...I didn't even want to come here anyways.


So they're making their frustrating way to register and then mom/grandma suddenly remembers she must make three more stuffed animals for her daughters/grandaughters. But it can't just be any one stuffed animal. Oh no, she has to ask extensive questions about every single one of them. Like which ones were most popular. I tell her why. And she's like ""No, those are ugly. Why would a girl want that?"" I wanted to scream at her ""I DON'T KNOW. YOU ASKED ME WHAT WAS POPULAR AND I TOLD YOU!"" But, of course, I was polite and asked if there were any colors or animals the girls were interested in.

She finally decides on our V-day themed animal. Fine. We make three of them. Then she needs three matching V-day themed outfits. Well our stock has dwindled and we only have a few things left. She doesn't like what we have left and proceeds to spend another 20 minutes looking. At this point, they were the last people in the store and it is now 30 minutes after close. 

I tell the new girl to start on her checklist because it was just cleaning stuff that could be done whether a customer was in the store or not. She starts on that. They finally get up the counter and I start to ring them up. Of course, she has to complain about pricing and ask the price of everything even though it tells her on our penpad. Then she decides to remove something so I void the item from the transaction but it's still telling her it's there on the penpad. She doesn't understand that it's not a live update and doesn't refresh right away.

She has some coupons so I apply those and some point reward certificates. Now. These things basically count as cash. They're usually like $10 and they run as a tender. Like a $10 check from corporate to you. So once I run it through, there's no going back. Even if I void the transaction, it'll take a call to corporate to get the certificate back. So naturally, what do you think she does? Oh well she decides she does in fact want that item I voided and not just one but like an odd number like 9 or something. Whatever. I tell her it'll have to be a seperate transaction. She doesn't flip her shit or anything but she's obviously pissed and not having any of it. Complaining and alike.

Finally, got her and her family out of the store at....(drumroll please).... 9:50!!! 50 minutes after close. So Kate starts closing out the registers because she couldn't do it while the family was there. I start pulling the V-day stuff to the back. Since Kate was opening the next day, she said she would box it up if I could just put out the new floor sets. So I started on that. Which took a good 30 minutes. Then we realize we are missing some of our displays, so I start on that.

Oh and the POS system pretty much crashed so Kate was on the phone with our DM for a while trying to sort that out. Then she had to send our V-day numbers and other promotional offer info to the RM and all that other manager-y stuff. The new girl kept cleaning and straightening...at a slow pace. At around 10:45 I started making a stock list(FINALLY!!) I made seperate lists and took them to the back so Kate could pull them. We got everything re-stocked decently. Not perfect but at this point we were way past caring. Sent the new girl home. Finished  the new girls cleaning list and finally clocked out at 11:30. I worked a 10.5 hour shift that day. Damn was I tired. 

I then proceeded to work an 8hr shift the day after V-day and a another 10.5hr shift yesterday. So in three days I racked up essentially 30hrs. 

The pros - my store manager is asking the DM for the go ahead to give me manager training

The cons - I lost my voice from talking to customers so much.

Thing is, this ""taco salad"" is not served with an edible shell like most restaurants serve them. It's just the salad part. I thought that was kind of an odd move, but whatever. I just work here.

(For some people that might give away where I work, but I don't care; it's necessary for the story.)

A few weeks ago, I got a lady who came in huffing, demanding a replacement order for an order we messed up. She correctly names a manager she talked with on the phone, and she has the receipt. Okay, so I honor it. 

I look at the receipt and see that she had ordered a taco salad and nothing else. I say to her, ""Ma'am, just out of curiosity, what was the matter with the taco salad? I just want to double check that we don't make the same mistake twice.""

She says, ""They didn't give me a taco salad. I don't know what I got, but it wasn't a taco salad.""

Immediately, I start thinking, *Oh god, this better not be going where I think it's going...*

So I dutifully remake it, exactly to specifications, and I give it to her and apologize about whatever the problem was. Internally, I'm crossing my fingers that the lady would accept it. She doesn't.

""What is this?! This isn't a taco salad.""

I cringe and say, ""Ma'am, that's our taco salad. That's exactly how we make them.""

She says, ""No, it's not a taco salad. Taco salads have shells.""

I try to say, ""Ma'am, the salad has seasoned taco beef on it, and crunchy tortilla strips on top.""

She says, ""No, I ordered a taco salad, you need to make me a taco salad. I want one with a shell.""

I apologize and say, ""We can't make taco shells. This company doesn't stock the tortillas we need to make them.""

Her face turns red, and she starts rambling, ""That's false advertizing! Why do you advertize a taco salad if it doesn't have a shell? Taco salads have shells, that's what makes them taco salads! Without the shell, it's not a taco salad!""

In one last attempt to be polite, I pull out a menu for her and point out the picture clearly labeled ""TACO SALAD,"" showing that it doesn't, in fact, come with an edible shell, but a bowl. It looks exactly like the one I made for her. I show her that it's exactly how we advertize it.

She says, ""This has to be a misprint. That can't be right.""

I say, ""What do you mean?""

She says, like a broken record, ""This picture isn't a taco salad. It doesn't have a shell.""

At this point, internally, I'm screaming ""GO TO (Popular Mexican Restaurant), you crazy woman!"" but on the outside, I restrain myself. Instead, I say, ""Ma'am, I'm very sorry for the confusion, but that is actually the way we serve our taco salads. If you would like something else from our menu, I'd be happy to make it for you.""

She says, ""So you can't make me a taco salad? Is that what you're saying?""

I get the manager and walk away because I'm fuming at her. Manager says something to her and makes her leave. Later, we get a corporate complaint, presumably from her, that a customer got a taco salad made ""incorrectly"" without an edible shell, and that we were rude and refused to make it ""correctly,"" which puts a negative mark on our store's score. But whatever; if that's the price for never seeing her again, then so be it.

Some of these people... they give me funny stories to tell friends, that's for sure. I just need to keep telling myself that, and maybe I won't end up pulling my hair out.

Our return policy is sixty days for any reason and we give you back your money in your original form of payment as long as the item is UNWORN. You wore your item and then decided it didn't really go with the rest of your wardrobe or it's past our sixty day return period? No problem! We'll just give you merchandise credit for the price that you paid for the item, or if you prefer, feel free to exchange it for something else.

It was closing time at our store and I was working on checking out the last crowd of customers. All was well when I hear the word “manager” escape from the lady that my coworker is checking out. I mentally brace myself and finish up with my transaction then walk over to my very pregnant coworker and her transaction. In the five seconds it took me to walk over there, our customer turned to yelling. I will call her Grouchypants. GP for short.

AoP: How can I help you?

Grouchypants: I am in a hurry and I need to return this coat. I will be fine if you put it back on my credit card or if you give me cash back. I need to pay a bill today before they close at 9!

AoP: (I glance at the receipt) As my cashier explained to you, you are returning this coat well past our sixty day return policy. I will be happy to give you the money you paid for in a merchandise credit. They never expire and you can use it to find something else in our store you like better.

GP: I want cash back.

AoP: (now studying the receipt more closely) Miss, it would appear you used a merchandise credit from our store to pay for your coat. Even if we override the system to allow you to get a refund for this item, it would go back to a merchandise credit because that's what you originally paid with(!!!)

GP: Can't you just put it back to my credit card?!

AoP: Miss, I can't give you credit back because that is not what you paid with. You didn't paid with a credit card. You paid with merchandise credit. At this point, I should mention that the only way you get merchandise credit is if a cashier gives it to you when you do a worn or past 60-day return, so I already know this lady has returned something in the past, probably worn, too.

GP: (shouting) I need to take care of my mother with Alzheimer's! Just give me the cash! It's just 37 dollars!

AoP (recognizing this isn't going anywhere) I can let you speak with my manager, but that is not going to change our answer. She will tell you the same thing (I call for a manager on my headset to come to the front).

GP: (Angrily) Just ask her over the walkie! I need to go!

AoP: Ma'am. It's ten minutes past 9. You said it yourself. Everything is closed including our store. This is an issue for which I want to speak to my manager in person, so I am going to call her up here so that she can try to help you. It would really be in your best interest to let me get her up here because if you really want money back, she has to be physically present for the transaction, anyhow. Isn't that what you want?

GP: (grumbles) 

So I go back to my customers, who are laughing at this lady and talking to me about how she needs to stop shouting and just leave. My manager arrives and she tells her: NO. The reason? “Because you didn't pay with cash. I can't give you cash back.” GP starts getting louder and saying stupid things like she will sue us and blahblah and then my manager does something very genius on her part: She approves the return and puts the money on her credit card, writes down her name and relevant information. The lady smugly leaves, and when she is out the doors my manager calmly proceeds to void the return she just processed for this lady. She then got on the phone with our district manager and told him the story.

Apparently, this isn't the first time she tries this with us. The lady never got back her money and she now has a red flag on her account permanently. Awesome.

Tonight's takes the recent cake though.

I have 14 or 15 rooms on the third floor booked by a middle school basketball team for a tournament in town this weekend. The kids were done for the day, and were terrorizing the hotel with all of their leftover energy.

Aside from sprinting up and down the hallways/stairs, they were all congregating in the halls outside their room (a big no-no). I went to tell them, for the third time, to stay in their rooms- and suddenly a coach that had been sitting near them jumps up and gets in my face.

He starts screaming about how I shouldn't talk to his kids like that and that by disrespecting them, I was disrespecting him. He is all up in my face, and the other coaches have to calm him down while he demands a refund if we want him to leave. Note, I never asked him to leave, just to keep the kids quiet.

Ten minutes later, Mr. Sunshine comes down and I think (in a moment of misplaced optimism) that he is going to apologize. Nope. He says that they're going to leave and he needs a refund. One of the choice quotes s the title quotes. He honestly expected the guests that complained to find a different hotel because HIS children couldn't behave. I had the unfortunate duty of telling him that we need 24 hours notice to cancel a night, and that I'd have to charge them as the rooms were dirty and I couldn't rent them back out.

As this is going on, some of his kids come through and sprint up the stairs and down the hall. Even from the distance we were, it was incredibly loud. Once he heard it even from the front desk, I was able to explain why there were so many complaints. He was still pissed, but at them now instead of me.

Of course, he'll still complain in the morning, and my manager will still probably give him a discount. FML.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1aw50i,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1aw50i/if_they_wanted_a_quiet_hotel_they_should_have/,
1362756557.0,393,self.TalesFromRetail,19wyae,The worst customer I ever had.,lunalilly,455,62,111,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/19wyae/the_worst_customer_i_ever_had/,"This story takes place in a video store, so you know it's a few years old since they really do not exist much anymore. I used to work for a major video store chain in Canada. I was the assistant manager in the busiest store in our area. Our manager had two or three stores that he took care of, so our store was generally left with just me in charge because the other stores were 'problem' stores and weren't doing as well. This is relatively important, since he makes an appearance later on.

It's a typical Friday night and we're slammed. I'd already been there for 8 hours that day, I'm stuck on cash when I have so many other things to do, and I'm just generally hating my life. I was an expert at putting a smile on my face though and I never let my mood dictate how I treated a customer. I wanted them in and out of the store as quickly and smoothly as possible. 

It was going alright until this effing woman came up to my line. This woman who, years later, I still resent for treating me the way she did.

She comes up to my cash register (with about 6-8 people behind her) and slams a movie down on the counter. It's some bullshit romantic comedy with Sarah Jessica Parker in it. The conversation starts off as hostile right off the bat.

**Her:** I rented this an hour ago, get home, and my husband says he already rented it.

**Me:** That's no problem - if you'd like to go exchange it for something else, you can go ahead and do that. Otherwise we can just put a credit on your account for another movie the next time you're in. Up to you!

**Her:** I don't want another movie, I don't want a credit, I want an explanation as to how you'd let something like this happen.

**Me:** Okay. It is a bit weird that we didn't see that the movie was already rented out on the account, what's the phone number?

----

She gives me her phone number and two names pop up. It's obvious that her husband has a separate account from hers, so when she went to rent this movie, we didn't see anything because it's on a different account.

I explain this to her and she loses her damn mind.

**Her:** Well, you need to combine those accounts, but this is bullshit. How can you not see it was rented already?!

**Me:** Because there are two accounts. When you went to rent this, there was no way of knowing that there was another account in your household and what was rented on it. You used your card which linked directly to your account, not the phone number which shows two names: yours and your husband's.

**Her:** Well that's a stupid system and I need you to combine them.

**Me:** Can't combine them, but what I can do is delete yours and then just add you to your husband's so you'll be using the same account rather than two separate accounts.

**Her:** NO. I want them separate but together.

...

**Me:** That's not possible. If they're separate, then they're separate. There's nothing I can do to combine accounts. I already gave you the solution to the problem.

----

At this point, my manager comes in. He sees we're slammed and gets on the cash register beside me while I'm having this argument with this woman. 

**Her:** Stop telling me what you CAN'T do, and tell me you're going to do what I'm asking of you. Keep my separate accounts, but combine the two so this doesn't happen again.

----

**Me:** I can't do that. It doesn't make sense. I can't combine two things but keep them separate. Either keep the accounts the way they are, or you can delete yours and get on your husband's.

**Her:** If you say something about combining separate things one more time... I'm not an idiot!

----

I sigh and look over to my manager who's overheard the last part of this discussion. I am silently pleading for him to intervene and say something. Anything. Whatever has to happen to get this bitch out of my line and out the door. It's gone on for too long, the lineup's getting worse, I'm losing my patience.

He finally steps in and I breathe a sigh of relief. I step to the side while he takes over my computer. He lies to her, tells her the accounts will be combined but separate, and gives her THREE. FREE. MOVIES for the trouble she's experienced in our store this evening.

I am seething. I don't even know what to do. This chick gives me this smug look of satisfaction and I almost lose it.

**Her:** I knew it was possible, some people just don't want to do the work. 

----

In disbelief, I walk away before I say something I'll regret. I go to the backroom for some peace and quiet, pacing while I try to evaluate what just effing happened.

My manager comes walking into the backroom, telling me he never wants to see me treat a customer that way again and that it's never worthwhile to argue with them. Give them what they want, EVEN IF IT IS IMPOSSIBLE, and move on.

This woman continued to come in, and I had to honor every one of her stupid free movies. She made a point to come to me, even when other cashes were open, and give me the same self-congratulatory attitude. 

Customers and shitty managers suck.

You run into the most ridiculous customers here, and if you think being a cashier is bad.. try spending at least an hour if not more time doing everything from sales to acting like a complete imbecile to try and make children smile for the camera.

We do EVERYTHING. Photography, clown around for the kids, pose them, sales (no commission, but it mattered), cash register, delivery (give portraits to customer who pick up), passports, customer service, phone calls, booked appointments, outreach, cold calling, contests... it was a jack of all trades type roll. (Yet jobs don't seem to consider it ANYTHING on the resume. *grumble*

Here are the events to one of the worst days working at this job:

It was a busy Saturday afternoon and it was only myself and my one coworker. We had only worked together a couple of months and I had been at the job maybe 6 months. I think one other girl was supposed to be there but ""called in sick"" - details are fuzzy on that one. If she did, it's no surprise. It happened often with [THAT ONE](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/15xe5c/compulsive_liar_aka_that_one/).. there are many stories with her I won't currently go into.

It had been an extremely busy day with almost all back to back appointments. No lunch breaks for either of us.. I know it's the law, but sometimes it's THAT busy. We have 2 camera rooms and my coworker was in one with a family. I was just able to get a breath after a customer left and in walks a man at around 2:15pm saying he has a 2:00pm appointment for a family portrait. Me: ""Are you the Smiths?"" (my 2pm appointment) Him: ""No, my name is Singh"". I don't find him on my schedule and let him know so (he's aggravated) while I'm still searching. Ah! I found it.... at 2pm like he said, but yesterday. I let him know his appointment was yesterday. He is livid. He starts yelling and blaming us for booking the wrong day. I say I can try my best to fit him in..My 2pm doesn't seem to be showing up and can take him in right away. ""Who's going to be in the photos?"" I ask. ""My family."" ...Me: ""And they are... ?"". Next thing I know he's on his cell calling his wife and screaming at her for them not being at the studio. He tells her they have an appointment. Gee, I wonder where the confusion of the appointment came about. He's a lot more calm now as he is embarrassed by this. He tells me they can be here in an hour. I say, sorry we have a 3:00pm and are fully booked until closing. At this point my coworker has come out of her photo room to see what is going on. She pipes up in front of him ""No, take him in. That 3pm canceled"". I stare right into her eyes, ""are you sure?"" ""yes."" ""your positive?"" ""yes"". Me: ""Okay, I can take you and your family at 3pm"". Situation was resolved... pfft, that's a laugh.

3pm rolls around and his family walks in ready for their photos. Who walks in next? Of course you knew this was coming. My 3pm walks in! They are pleasant and start getting ready in the lobby type area. Okay, so there are 2 camera rooms and only 2 of us and my coworker is still doing baby photos in one room and I now have standing here 2 families expecting photos right this minute. I HATE my coworker right now. She's actually quite lovely, but seriously HOW can you make a mistake like that? How could I listen to her and not just call the customer to confirm? Oh but reddit, I don't think you saw this coming. In walks a very plump and loud lady with 3 adorable but rowdy TRIPLETS! Triplets I tell you. I am not joking when as soon as they walked in they separated in a full run to play, scream and circle me JUST like in a film.  I actually stood in awe for a moment at how weird it was that they would do that as brats do on the hollywood screen. Who was this lady? Why she was my 2pm who never showed up. I let her know her appointment was over an hour ago now, and she was ANGRY. In a booming voice she blames ME! ""I told them I would be late when booking! I told them! How am I supposed to do this with triplets!"". Utter hog-wash because although we were heavily booked, they would have at least booked her at 2:30, not 2pm! Standing before me I had 3 families demanding photos that very minute. Out of all the chaos this one young girl walks in and asks to pick up her photos. Simple, right? Wrong.. it takes like 1/2 hour to deliver photos. You have to make sure the order is correct, then up-sell with the extra photos that are in the package and put it through the system so they don't come back saying they never picked up. All I can muster is ""I am SO sorry, is there any way you could possibly come back tomorrow?"" I'm usually great with customer service, I would have given her free stuff. She was extremely sweet and agreed. I was so overwhelmed and thankful she would do that for me.. I'm not sure I would have been so nice myself. The original man from yesterday's appointment? Oh, he went BESERK on my ass! Screaming! ""If that was me who came to pick up photos I would be SO angry! Why are you understaffed!? You have all these appointments! Why are you understaffed!!?"" I literally had tears in my eyes and took the berating and mustered that I would take in the original 3pm as fast as I could and would take both the other appointments in as soon as I could. The rest of the day was a blur. The portrait studio still gives me nightmares sometimes.. there are so many other stories. But I tell you, to this day I REALLY wish I had more courage and just said ""Your appointment was yesterday! Your appointment was over an hour ago! Even if we had more employees, we only HAVE 2 camera rooms, how does THAT help? If you don't like the amount of employees on, do you REALLY think I'm the one to yell at about it!? Both of you F* off, I'm taking in the 3pm!""

Thanks for letting me rant Reddit &lt;3

TLDR: Listen to your gut and stand up for yourself in a proper manner.

EDIT: I meant that I would take in the original **3pm** and fit in the others when I could. &amp; I really wanted to tell them all to fuck off except for the **3pm** who were on time for their appointment and did nothing wrong. Sorry, I just wrote the wrong number down, It was VERY late when I wrote this. Of course I took in the 3pm with the appointment who wasn't late, that was the most sane thing to do. The 2pm was the least of my worries of the group.

Not very diverse, but occasionally we would get contractors from out of town, some of whom were Latino and didn't speak English.  They would come in with co-workers who would translate for them so they could get lunch.  I don't speak Spanish - I took Latin in school - but I always felt bad for these guys because their co-workers would go to get their drinks and chips and stuff and if I had any questions about their orders, they wouldn't be able to answer me, but they often looked sad or embarrassed about it.  

Usually, my questions were related to toppings: ""Lettuce, tomato, or onion?"" or  ""Mayonnaise?""  So I learned to say those four words.  I can't spell them, but it was something like lechuga, tomato (yay - that one was easy!), saboyas, and mayonaisa (also easy).  I probably butchered the language, but I was able to communicate and these hungry, hard working guys got their sandwiches the way they wanted them.  And the cool thing was that they looked so happy and relieved when I was able to ask them directly if they wanted these things.  I wish I'd taken a language that people actually speak.

Backstory: The grill at the deli is turned off at a certain time every day. The deli remains open for another hour or so, but the grill is off early because it takes awhile to clean. Friend just finished cleaning the grill when he gets a phone call:

Customer: Yeah I'd like a grilled cheese delivered to [Vet office directly across the street from the deli].

Friend: Ah, sorry but the grill is closed. If you'd like, though, I make a pretty good version of a grilled cheese sandwich using the microwave, first I [explains what he does to the sandwich to make it delicious].

Friend: That would be the sandwich that you ordered. A grilled cheese...

Customer: This isn't a grilled cheese. This tastes like shit. You didn't even grill it.

Friend: I explained to you that the grill was off, and that if you wanted I would make it in the microwave. I make these all the time and I know that it doesn't taste like shit.

Customer: Well fuck you blah blah blah

*I should note here that, though I can't speak for the quality of the sandwich as I was not there, my friend is very competent and resourceful with food preparation. I've never had something of his that wasn't delicious.*

*Friend's boss overhears, comes in from the back room. Overheard the initial phone call so knows that the customer was aware the grill went off and had to have his grilled cheese made in the microwave.*

Boss: What's the problem here?

Customer: This guy [points to friend] made me this disgusting fucking sandwich in the microwave. (More complaining).

Boss: Let me see this sandwich. (Takes it from the customer, opens it up, revealing the gooey cheese. Takes a huge bite, then, with his mouth full...) This is fucking DELICIOUS.

I explain that to her, and expect a blow up, as I usually do. She looks upset, and I brace myself. She then drops a bomb on me by saying/asking ""Well, that's too bad. What do you suggest instead?"" I think my jaw hit the floor. When I tell people no, they almost never ask for alternatives.

I told her that the title she liked, and a lot of other titles were available as e-books. If anyone was taking their phone, if they download the book, they can use it offline and not use any data. I told her other stores in the area might have more choices too. I told her I would suggest gift cards, because then her friends could buy the book she likes in a different store, buy a different book, or buy any book through our app and read it on their phone/tablet/ereader/what have you.

This was back in the day when SNES and Genesis ruled the land, and the Neo Geo and 3DO were the shining examples of high end gaming.

I worked at an old school coin-op arcade in high school, and when they closed down the owners sold me a full sized Tapper machine for fifty bucks. It graced the living room of my bachelor pad for about a year before a friend told me that a new store had opened up in his neighborhood. The owner wanted coin-ops for the sales floor of a game store. I met with the guy and he was super cool. Turns out he needs someone with product knowledge to run a booth at a flea market on the weekends. After a couple of months of this, I earn his trust and start working 4 days a week at the retail store and doing weekends at the ""dirt mall'

""Gene"" was a different breed of cat. He wasn't a gamer, but he knew what was up. He DEMANDED we play new games the second they were released, and based his purchases on our recommendations. When games like Mortal Kombat came out, we would make up xeroxed cheat sheets for the fatalities and sell them for a buck a piece. If we could buy a used game and resell it that day, he would let us pocket the difference. Plus cash advances, gas money, and weekly poker and Jack Daniels parties in the back room.

The thing that really separated him from every other retailer I've ever worked for was his business savvy. If you brought him regular business and were a decent human being, he would move heaven and earth for you. He made a 200 mile round trip to pick up extra Game Gears one Christmas when none were available in our area. He got import games for Sega CD for our loyal weaboos. If you bought a new game we recommended and you felt it wasn't up to snuff, he'd give you full exchange value and just sell it as used. Our customers loved him. Most of them.

We had machines set up upfront to ""test"" used games. This was back in the dark ages when cartridge based systems roamed the land, and repairing a used game usually amounted to blowing on the pins. Still, we'd let you play Sonic for a couple of minutes to assure full value. The problem was the store was in a strip mall, and people would go into the restaurants with their friends, and tell Junior to go waste time with the vidya until mommy had her fill of gossip and came to collect their crotch-fruit.

Gene was not a babysitter, In fact, truth be told, he spent most of his time in his office watching porn on a pirated connection. He hated kids. They didn't understand release dates, trade in values, or system compatability. Little Vern would want Street Fighter Five Extra Mega Super Edition (The one with Pikachu and naked Chun Li) because that's what Timmy said he had at home, and Mom and Dad wouldn't understand why we couldn't fulfill a simple request for the birthday boy. After all, an eight year old knows better than SOME GODDAMNED MORON WHO PLAYS VIDEO GAMES FOR A LIVING AND ARE YOU CALLIN' MY KID A LIAR?

Gene gave these customers what I called, the ""Invitation to the World"". Hey, it's a big wide world out there. We sell games. What we don't do is babysit your mutant hellspawn until you deem fit to pick them up. Maybe there's someone out there who does that, Possibly while charging you a service charge. Go there. That's my version of it. Gene's version was more like, ""Hey, fucko. Collect your retarded offspring and get the fuck out of my store. Next time you leave them here, I offer them up to the creepy thirty year old with a paper route."" Hilarity would often ensue. When one clueless individual stated that he had a RIGHT to leave his children unsupervised in the store while he partook of frosty libations at the steakhouse, and then threatened Gene with physical violence, Gene calmly removed his 9 millimeter from under the counter, racked a shell into the chamber, and said, ""Walk out or get dragged out. Your choice."" We never saw Daddy dearest again.

It was a gamer's wet dream. Serious players come in? We got the hook up. You get top shelf gaming all day long. Rentals on street date, Used prices that cant be beat, and fair trade ins. New to games? We'll get that shit done, son. Find the perfect system from you, clue you in to the gaming franchises that will have you ballin' all night. Love Street Fighter II? Hell, beat my Vega and I'll give you a freebie off the rack. Come in with your three year old copy of Dragon's Lair for SNES (the rotten ringpiece of Super games), with no box or instructions, and insist it's worth sixty bucks because that's what you paid for it? I can't give that partial birth abortion of a game away for ten brand new. Why dont I trade your 75 Gremlin in for a brand new Corvette while I'm at it? No, I am the manager. Would you like to meet the owner? Okay. No problem. Let me tear him away from whatever vagina based programming he's watching and get him out here. Oh, he's obviously impressed by the big money you claim to spend here, despite no one on staff ever having laid eyes on you before. Wait. Is he? Yes, I believe he's bending over, spreading his cheeks, and demanding that you ""just shove it in and break it off!""

I spent two years at the foot of the master. Every day was an adventure. It was satisfying on so many levels. 
I may never be a master gamer. I may never have my own business. But someday, maybe, I'll be one tenth as cool as Gene.

(Warning: Long)

Now, when this story takes place I am working a nice 7-3 shift on a Saturday, which means my weekend manager is in doing her thing, and we have an attendant for the full service pumps. Our company was very big on the customer always being right, and only allowing the refusal of sale if we were in danger. Its important to this story to note that we only had one register and while at it I had to turn a full 180 in order to see the diesel pumps.

At around 10 am I am minding my own business, talking to a few regulars and just generally doing my thing, the manager is out getting change for the safe and running surveys. I see out of the corner of my eye that a rather disgruntled looking guy (Hereby known as DG) is storming towards the door, on the warpath. I greet him as sweetly as possible but before I can ask how I can help him he interrupts me with ""YOUR DIESEL PUMP IS BROKEN I GOT FUEL ALL OVER MY TRUCK AND I HAD MY WINDOWS OPEN AND I AM NOT LEAVING UNTIL SOMEONE PAYS FOR THE DAMAGES""

My response ""I'm sorry about that sir, unfortunately I cannot provide you with reimbursements"" (He had used his card at the pump, so the fuel was paid for)

DG: ""I SAID SOMEONE WILL BE PAYING FOR THESE DAMAGES, I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER""

Me: ""I'm sorry sir she isn't here at the moment, I can give her a call if you'd like""

DG: ""YES, DO THAT, I DEMAND REIMBURSEMENT. I AM NOT GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL I KNOW THAT THE DAMAGES WILL BE PAID FOR"" (I wish I was kidding about how many times he said that)

I call my manager and relay that there is a customer demanding her attention and she states that she will be returning shortly.

Me: ""Sir if you could step to the side so I may take care of these customers, she will be in shortly to talk to you""

After about 25 minutes she finally shows up, and I indicate that the idiot standing in the corner tapping his feet is waiting for her. He gives her the same spiel he gave me and she tells him exactly what I did. He demands she calls the head offices and she agrees to do so, leaving me with his oh so wonderful company while she goes to the back office to call.

After about five minutes of waiting on customers I hear ""I HOPE YOU AND YOUR MANAGER DON'T THINK YOU CAN JUST HIDE FROM ME. I AM NOT GOING AWAY UNTIL SOMEONE PAYS FOR THE DAMAGES TO MY TRUCK""

At this point I am getting pretty pissed off. This guy has been here for almost an hour at this point, is holding up a line to the diesel pumps, and huffing around my store like an entitled asshole. Instead of telling him this I say ""Sir, my manager is trying to get ahold of the higher ups, please be quiet and patient she will be back with you as soon as possible. I cannot just give you money out of the register""

In the end my manager backed me in that there is nothing we could do, if he wanted to file charges he could call the police or leave and call complaints on his own. After about ten minutes of her threatening to call the police he finally leaves, threatening to sue and have our jobs.

We didn't hear much about him until a little while later when my boss got a call from complaints telling us that they reviewed the tape, he had purposely sprayed his truck with diesel and then filled his tank, and was just trying to get free fuel and that he was banned from the stores. It's not much in the way of justice but it felt like a victory all the same",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1hvsr2,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1hvsr2/idiot_sprays_diesel_on_his_truck_and_wants_us_to/,

I became very good at spotting out shoplifters as I was forced to walk around a specific area of the store for hours on end. Once I noticed a kid playing PlayStation to a system attached to an end-cap at the back corner of the store. He was very fidgety every time I walked by and he would retract his hand from behind a small opening between the system and the endcap. I suspected he was up to something so I stayed in the area and he wandered off. When he left I looked in the area between the endcap and the system and sure enough there was a copy of a Wii game there unwrapped. The game was missing as well. The kid was about 12 years old and me being a high school student I decided to try to retrieve the game from him just by talking to him. I didn't want to get him into any major trouble, as my manager was known to be a terrible person. I basically told him that if he gave me back the game that I would not report him and that would be the end of it. He looked very ashamed and apologized to me but did give me the game back.

Fast forward about three months, the same kid is back in the store. This time I see him doing the exact same thing, only this time he is trying to steal a PSP (we had not spider wrapped them, as they were fresh out of the warehouse). I saw his eyes light up and he tried to exit the store but not before I told the asset protection guy at the front of the store. I'm not sure what happened to that kid but I hope he learned his lesson. Retail jobs are boring, the most exciting part of the job is catching shoplifters.

TL;DR Kid tried to steal, but I caught him and let him go. Kid came back and tried to steal again, and I reported him.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,standard,True,t3_1dwx15,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1dwx15/caught_a_kid_stealing_twice/,

This story hales from early in my time at the station.  This was around the spring of 2007, when gas prices were at all-time highs, the economy was in all-time lows, the war was at an all-time crap-fest, and everyone in general was feeling an all-time slump.  People weren't happy with their lots in life.  Where once people would ask to ""fill 'er up,"" we were now getting small and odd denomination requests, as it was obvious people were scraping the bottoms of their change jars just to afford to get to work.  In short, things weren't that great.  As Dickens said, the worst of times.

I had not yet been trained to be a cashier, so my duties consisted only of being an attendant, plus coming inside occasionally to help stock shelves or futz about in the cooler.  Which is where I was when this particular little mini-drama unfolded.  A small truck pulled up, and the driver asked to fill his tank with premium.  NOT A CHEAP REQUEST.  At the time, premium was around $4.80/gal, and his truck had something like a 20 gallon tank that was just shy of empty.

But the alarming thing wasn't that the guy wanted to spend $95 on gas, it's that he was obviously methed out pretty hard.  His pupils were so large it looked like he had no iris, just twin wells of deep blackness.  He was sweating hard even though it wasn't that warm, he looked gaunt and thin, his cheeks sunken and sallow.  His movements were jerky and had a random aspect to them, like the neurons in his somatosensory cortex had all gone on strike and the scabs they had hired to replace them really didn't understand the muscle movement user interface (this should be a lesson, always hire union workers).

After he had told the attendant that he was going to pay inside and grabbed his slip, he proceeded to wander aimlessly up and down the aisles of our store, looking at everything but seeing nothing.  The cashier and the assistant manager soon became worried that this guy was going to splash-and-dash, and this is where I realized that the crew at this station would be good to go when things got rough.  Through very sneaky use of the intercom, whispered instructions, body language, and general intuitiveness, all three of the attendants, the cashier, the AM, the GM, and the three guys down at the car wash were all now surreptitiously watching this guy like a cast of hawks.  However, he was oblivious to our watchful eyes.  Instead he picked up three 2-liter bottles of Mt Dew, placed them on the counter, then blabbered semi-coherently about needing the bathroom.  The cashier pointed to the door near the back.

At this point the AM, the cashier, and I had a hurried discussion.  He was obviously out of his mind on something very strong, he shouldn't be driving.  Could we figure out a way to hold the guy there long enough for the cops to show up?  The AM went into the back room to call it in, while I stood watch.

That last question, thankfully, answered itself.  The guy came back out, still dazed and confused, but now walked straight past the counter and headed outside.  I yelped into the backroom, ""I think he's going to try and drive off!"" as the AM was still talking with the dispatcher.  His tone became more urgent as he now described the fact that this guy was about to make off with $100 worth of gas.  Haste by the responding officers was promised.

But Lo!!  The gas station gods did smile upon us that day, for it is written that this man could not get his truck started, and he was wroth before their eyes.  I don't know what it was that was wrong with his truck, but he could not get it to start.  The attendant came over and asked for the slip showing that he had paid, but the driver just looked at him like he was a talking ficus or something, and went back to trying to start the truck.  The attendant then called inside on the intercom to ask if the guy had paid, and get the conversation on the microphone.  Nope, no money had been received.

The truck finally started, but all the guy did was back up and park alongside the store.  He sat in his car, fiddling with something in the front seat, as the rest of us waited with baited breath for the police to arrive.

With their usually alacrity, two units converged on our station with a timed precision that belied anything other than telepathy.  They contacted the driver, who seemed to be willing to go along with the program.  That is, until one of the cops reached out for him, and, like Usain Bolt coming off the blocks during the 100-meter finals at the London 2012 Olympics, he was off like a shot.

A short foot chase ensued.  I'm sure that if this man had not ingested some sort of heavy narcotic, he probably could have gotten away, because he was quite fast.  However, being fast means nothing when you don't have good balance or coordination, because he tripped and fell over himself about the time he got to the far end of the parking lot, followed quickly by flying tackles that would make any Heisman winner proud.

Cuffed and secured, he was lead back up to the station to be patted down.  And what would you know, he had ZERO money on him.  No cards, no cash, no checks, no *nuthin'*.  So the officers charged him with theft and evasion, and got him in one of their cars.  They then searched his truck, finding several small baggies of an oddly-familiar white substance.  Well then, add possession of meth to the list (got to watch them do the test on the material, it's very cool and incredibly fast).  The officers thanked us, we high-fived our selves several times, and then went back to work, secure in the knowledge that we had each other's backs and that at least one bad guy was off the streets.

**POST SCRIPT:**  The tale does not end there, but continues on a few days and about 100 miles later.  The guy made bail, hitched a ride, and was found south of the state capitol at a rest stop, naked as Helen Mirren in Caligula (but no where near as hot), doing his level best to murder a park bench with a wooden stake.  He was again arrested, but not before AGAIN getting in a foot pursuit, this time along the shoulder of the interstate.  I would love to have seen the faces of passing motorists as they saw a naked guy with a large chunk of wood being chased by several cops up the shoulder of a freeway in the rain.

I carded her LIKE I HAVE TO WITH EVERY GODDAMN YOUNG PERSON WHO COMES TO MY REGISTER but she not only refused, but she got downright nasty. Who am I to card her, she works at the store over in [nearby town name removed], and demands to talk to one of our shift supervisors, who I'll call A. A comes up, rings her up on his register because he knows her so I'm in the clear if anyone from the department of health decided to be in the testing our store that day.

A little ways, the nasty bitch came back trying to return an item without a receipt. As is company policy, I asked for her ID, and the exchange went like this.

N.B.: This is ridiculous, I work for [Company from Hell]!

Me: Then you should know, that I can't take this item back without ID.

N.B.: WHERE IS A? GET HIM UP HERE!

Luckily, A was on shift that day so I was able to call him. Once again, I get out of having to do a questionable transaction. It's also very suspicious when an employee at one store tries to return something for store credit at another store, but still, as long as I'm not doing this return which doesn't have her ID number on it, I'm not going to worry about this coming down on me.

A short while after that, we had a visit from our L.P. manager, and who comes in but the nasty bitch, this time with her sister, and her kid, who was in a toddler and was kept in a stroller. They started stealing from us off the floor when the management team along with the L.P. caught them. The L.P. introduced himself to the nasty bitch and she spat back something to the effect of, ""Big guy huh? Where did you go to school for that."" The three of them were detained and the L.P. instructed one of the managers to call the police. Upon checking the camera, we found her putting product underneath the stroller and leaving the store and coming back in. The bitch was fucked, and to make it even sweeter, her savior, A wasn't even working that day.

I used to work in a small music and DVD shop located on a train station concourse. The shop was very, very busy and very, very small. 

This story begins one balmy august evening when our keyholder (to whom I did, and will continue to refer to solely as ""The Idiot"") was taking the cash drawers out of the tills so we could close for the night. 

The Idiot decided to stack the till drawers so they were balanced on the edge of a bin which was full of customer's rubbish, and predictably, they all fell in. Several thousand pounds in coins and notes was thoroughly mixed in with customer's revolting rubbish. This stuff was all food and drink wrappers (bins are hard to come by in UK train stations thanks to the irritating habits of unsavoury people who kept putting bombs in them.)

I spent the next hour after closing digging through rubbish with my bare hands, trying to retrieve the day's takings. The bin STANK, it was a hot day and it was full of ice cream wrappers and almost a full inch of miscellaneous food sludge into which all the change had fallen. To his credit, The Idiot did help out a bit. This didn't stop me and the rest of our staff from giving him a hard time. The tills were eventually refilled and handed to The Idiot so he could waddle off and lock them in the safe in the office. I went home. 

The next day I got in for the 5:30am morning shift to discover my Assistant manager on the phone to our head office as the safe would not open. It turned out that in his frustration, The Idiot had continued to live up to his name by slamming the safe door, thereby breaking the safety glass and rendering it permanently locked. 

Head office told us that they could send someone out to fix it, but it would be 11am at the earliest, which would mean that we would have to operate for 4 hours without any cash drawers. 

We made signs with ""CARD OR EXACT CHANGE ONLY - apologies for any inconvenience"" and put them in front of all the tills. We were also explaining the situation to everyone who came into the shop as they walked in. 

Everyone seemed to understand, or so I thought.

So this oldish fella walks up to the till, he's in his late 50's and is brandishing a couple of DVDs. I explain the situation about the change drawers and tell him that he can either pay on his card or pay in exact change. He looked confused. His total was £19.99 and he had a £20 note. I told him he can either forego the penny or come back later when we've got the tills. (I had already checked my pockets and given out the four pennies I had on me that morning). 

His reaction was priceless. He exploded ""WHAT IF I WANT THE PENNY, EH? WHAT IF I WANT THE PENNY!?"" Again I told him that we don't have any pennies to give, again he got angry. ""THIS IS DAYLIGHT ROBBERY! LET'S SEE WHAT THAT POLICEMAN HAS TO SAY ABOUT YOU ROBBING ME!"" he gestured to a policeman who was patrolling the concourse. ""I'LL HAVE YOU ARRESTED FOR THIS!""

I told him ""You haven't bought anything yet. At present we do not owe you a penny, I am simply informing you that if you were to buy this DVD in cash, it would be on the condition that you would not receive your penny change. You can pay by card, you can forego the penny change, or you can come back later when we've retrieved our change drawers from the safe.""

I watched as the cogs and wheels in his head slowly whirred into place. He looked down at the DVDs in his hand and then back up at me.  ""I'm not happy about this"" he said as he handed over the £20 note. When he left he did go for a chat with the policeman, I think he was expecting plod to leap into action, round up all the shop staff and send us to jail. The less dramatic reality was that the copper shrugged and I got back to work.  

Addendum - Loose ends

The Idiot wasn't reprimanded too harshly for breaking the safe or dropping the till drawers, he sucked-up to the manager extra hard for about 2 weeks.

We received no overtime payment for the hour spent digging through the bins. 

I got an infection in the nail-bed of my finger about a day later. It was very painful and I blame having to dig through garbage for change.

I work as a cashier at a pet store, and it still amazes me how rude some customers can be. Expect more stories. 

ANYWAY.

I was working the register during the day, and we usually get a pretty brutal post-work rush around 4 or 5 pm. An older white woman, baggy cat t-shirt and all, comes in with her husband. I do my customary, ""Hello! Can I help you with anything today?"" ...and it begins. We'll call her Mary and her husband can be Bob.

Mary: Yes. I need cat litter.

Me: Okay! Cat litter right in that aisle [pointing] with all of our cat toys. 

Mary: Okay. [walks away]

And with a stern, tight-lipped look, she left, and I was able to deal with the other six people trying to check out at my one register.

Fast forward 15 minutes, and the lady comes up to my register positively fuming. I'm by myself again. 

Mary: Can someone help me with cat litter? I can't find the cat litter I'm looking for. 

Me: Yeah, no problem. I can help you! [At this point, I give a look to my manager down the nearest aisle, communicating that I'm leaving so he'll have to ring]

Me: [in the aisle] So, what litter are you looking for?

Mary: I'm looking for [lesser known cat litter]

Me: Ma'am, it's right here. [I can literally touch it with my hand. It is right next to me on the shelf]

Mary: Well, it should have been easier to find! The packaging all looks the same.

She's in a huff, and Bob is completely silent. He looks defeated. Poor Bob.

Me: I'm sorry about that Ma'am, but this IS the litter you're looking for, correct? 

Mary: Yes. I would like it to go in the cart.

Me: [uhhhhhhhhhhhh okay? Bob looks fit enough. He's a big guy. I'm a tiny girl but I can pick up bags no problem. Buuuut okay?] Sure Ma'am. How many bags would you like? 

Mary: Two

And without a thank you, I put the bags in her cart, and walk back up to the front with them to pay for their items. I find my manager with a line and a LOT of bagging to do, so I help him out. I notice Mary is once again, huffing and puffing like a blowfish. 

She finally gets her turn, and my manager has since gone to the office to let me ring up items by my lonesome. Cue real trouble.

I scan her items, she swipes her card, she gets her senior discount and loyalty discount, and I think I've done everything right. Not in her eyes! Just as she's slowly pushing her cart to the door, she explodes.

Mary: Um, excuse me! This is not the litter I wanted!

Me: [confused] It's not? 

Mary: Of course it isn't! This is non-clumping cat litter! I wanted clumping!

Me: [uhhhh but I asked you?] I'm sorry about that Ma'am, Would you like to return it?

Mary: Yes! Give me my money back! This is not the litter I wanted! Go get me the clumping litter!

Me: [little peeved, staying calm] I'm sorry Ma'am, but I'm just going to have to have you fill out this return form so we can get you your cat litter.

Mary: I'm not doing that! Just give me the different litter!

Me: [REALLY pissed] Ma'am, this is company policy. You have to fill out the form so I can give you your money. [I shoot a look to my manager, hoping he can see the necessity for his presence in my eyes]

I must add, that while this is going on, poor Bob has left Mary and is now looking at our pet-themed greeting cards. 

Manager walks over and asks: What seems to be the problem today?

Mary: The problem is that she picked out the wrong litter! This litter is WRONG!

Manager: Okay, we just need you to fill out this return form so we can give you your money back. 

Mary: I already told HER [jab of a finger in my direction] that I'm NOT filling it out! And why hasn't anyone gone to get my new litter yet?!

Manager: Let us call someone to get it for you.

Me: [paging unsuspecting stock boy]

He arrives, I tell him what we need, which is only a 15 second walk away, and he comes right back up with the bags and another stock boy. This is turning into a show.

As Mary stands with her hand on her hip, lips so tight I wonder how long she can sustain that face, my manager just rings her up with the returns. 

Manager: Ma'am, your total comes out to [about] 15 dollars.

Mary: WHAT? BUT I'M RETURNING THESE ITEMS. [She is so in our faces at this point that I back away from the register and cower behind my manager.]

Manager: Yes, but the new ones are more expensive, as they are clumping cat litter.

Mary: I did not know this! I thought they were the same price! 

Manager: No Mam.

She's deliberating in her head, then finally swipes her card. My manager remembers her discounts, thank god, and we give her the new receipt.

Bob comes back from his intense reading, starts pushing the cart, and Mary doesn't say anything back when we tell her to have a good day.

My manager turns to me and says, ""when that happens, just get them out of the store as quickly as possible. Just write that the customer refused on the return form.""

And with that I was left to explain Mary to my stock boys who had only witnessed the end.

What really gets to be about it is that I asked her if it was the litter that she wanted. She said yes! She saw the other litter bag, same brand, on the shelf, and CLUMPING and NON-CLUMPING have to be in the 72 pt font range. Ridiculous.

The Time: Late evening, near close

The Players: Me, an older lady, an unsuspecting cashier, and a random couple.

I walk into Qdoba late one evening, holding a coupon, a two-for-one with the purchase of a single entree and two drinks. There is a small line in front of me, so I shuffle in behind an older woman and a couple joins in right behind me. The lady in front of her orders a handful of things which take some time given there are only two people working the counter, which begins to frustrate the older woman. Eventually she gets up to the counter and places her orders and works her way down to the register. The girl at the cashier rings her up and the lady thrusts her coupon at her saying ""Here, I have this two-for-one coupon."" The girl takes the coupon and says ""No problem ma'am"" and places two cups on the counter next to her food. ""I don't want the drinks"" says the woman, pushing them back. ""I'm sorry ma'am, that's what the coupon is for. It's a free entree with the purchase of one and two drinks."" The woman gets a little flustered and thinks for a moment then says ""Okay fine, I'll just have one drink and both entrees."" ""That's fine, but you can't use the coupon unless you get two drinks"" says the cashier. ""But I don't want two drinks!"" she shouts back, ""Just ring it up"". At this point the other worker comes over and points out on the coupon where it says ""two drinks"" and the lady finally decides she won't use the coupon. She tells them she only wants one burrito and one drink. The cashier throws away the second burrito and begins to ring her up again, when the lady turns to me asking if I want her coupon, seeing that I have two burritos already made up. ""No, thanks, I've already got the same coupon."" She then goes up to the couple behind me, whose food is also now ready, and asks them the same thing. They gladly take the coupon, the lady pays and and walks out the door.

I give them no trouble at all, I pay my dues and go to get my drinks. The couple behind me does just the same and is being handed their receipt, when suddenly the lady comes back in. ""I changed my mind, give me back the coupon and the burrito."" The cashier and couple are a bit in shock, the cashier says ""I'm sorry, I can't do that. We've already thrown the burrito away and the coupon has already been used."" ""Well make me another one then and have them (pointing to the couple she gave her coupon to) pay for, after all it was MY coupon"" she demands. ""I can make you another burrito"" starts the cashier, ""but you'll have to pay full price for it. I'm not going to charge them for the coupon you gave to them."" At this point the lady realizes that not just the cashier and couple are staring at her in disbelief, but several other people as well, including myself.

""Fine, never mind, I don't need the extra food anyway"" she states and quickly rushes to the door.

Lets call this place MacFarmer. Now, in MacFarmer, I've NEVER seen the ability to take the card from them type it in the computer. 

Anyways, this lady comes in, makes a very large order (~$40) and tries to pay with her card. Tries being the operative word. I keep telling her it declines, but she's adament about making it work, blaming the decline on our machines. Yeah. Our machines screw up. Once in a blue moon, and thats usually because the card wasn't read right. This lady is getting angry with me. I'm sorry lady, but its your money.

She tells me to put the number in the computer. When I say she told me to do it, she ordered me. ""Put the digits in your computer. Your machine doesn't work worth a shit."" I tell her ""Ma'am, we don't do that here. Our machines can only use the card reader.""
She has the nerve to reply, ""Don't give me that SHIT, you have done it before!"" 

My manager decides to walk his happy ass over and asks what the problem is. He's looking at me to explain but before I get a chance, ""Dumbass over here is refusing to take my card!"" My manager is dumbstruck.

He asks her to swipe it, and she tells him our ""shitty machine doesn't work."" He then tells her to leave the store, and not to come back until she can behave herself. She calls corporate on us, and they take our side. But OH THAT'S NOT THE END OF HER.

Guy comes into parking, absolute shitter of a car. Normally I don't mind or care much, but he's not driving so great and parks in handicap without plates or tags indicating it. Also, his plate is duct taped to his car. This sets off a few alarms. I watch him come inside. 

Now, for some bizarre reason our merch manager decided that the pallet of Xbox 360 Kinect bundles should be the very first pallet. As in maybe four steps into the warehouse, and bam, there it is.

So the guy walks in, grabs one, and starts to head out. Notices me watching him. I'm a big guy, and while I might not be good at long distance, I'm close enough to snag him if he takes off. He turns to the greeter and asks where returns are. She knows what's up, but she's all of 95 pounds and wouldn't be able to pull it from him anyways, so she just points him to the line. I walk up to him while he's standing there, everyone watching. 

""Sir, that's not yours.""

""What? No, it is, I brought it in and I'm returning it.""

""Oh, okay. Tell ya what, it's cold and this is expensive. We'll take ya to the front of the line, get you out of here quickly."" As I'm saying this I'm gently pulling it out of his hands. He's too confused to even struggle for it.

""No man, I don't care it's not worth it. I don't even want to."" He walks very quickly back to his car and takes off. 

Right. You don't wanna return the $400 package you ""bought"", especially when I offer to expedite the return process. I almost ripped my manager's head off after that I was so angry. His idiocy put two employees in possible danger, not to mention could continue to put us in danger. The pallet was moved in about five minutes.

Of course, sometimes happy endings don't happen. A couple of weeks ago a lady came out the door, swearing up a storm. She had about $2,200 worth of merch in her cart, but about four cart guys all near her (just sheer luck). Her car pulls up and everyone is too shocked by her bizarre behavior and the erratic driving to even bother moving. She takes off with a $1,800 touchscreen computer. /facepalm/ We got her license and description as well as her face on camera, but I haven't seen her on bookings recently, so I can only hope some other department snagged her. Preferably one about a hundred miles west as that would slap two transportation of stolen goods across state boundaries to her list. Federal crimes, get her kids away from her. Oh, did I not mention that? She decided to bring her two kids with her on her felony spree.

F asked Dickens to look at the menu and tell him what he wanted from it. F turned to the 2 girls and started talking to them about what they might like to order. Dickens asks me about different burgers and what items they come with in a meal. 

As I'm talking to him, Dickens tells me that he is here with his stepfather and his 2 half sisters. F then tells Dickens to hurry up and order. 

Dickens gets this look of ""I'm sorry, I won't do it again"" and tries to tell him what he would like for his meal. Unfortunately at that moment, F decided that Dickens wasn't worth listening to and started ordering for the girls and himself instead. 

Dickens now has a look of shock and disappointment and tries to repeat what he would like for dinner. F says, ""No! you took too long, I am just going to get you (insert cheapest burger meal here)"".

Before I begin, I should preface this by saying that the stories I'm telling here are in no way actually in chronological order.  It's more of a ""oh, hey, remember that one time that..."" kind of story telling.

This even occurred late in the shift.  It was dark out, and traffic had died off to almost nothing.  Our station is (present tense, it's still there, even if I don't work there) located at the beginning of a cul de sac, along with an oil-and-lube shop, a family diner, a dentist's office, a McDonalds, and a flower/coffee shop.  There was just myself and another employee out playing gas attendant, but since there weren't any customers, we were instead standing in the middle of the pumps, conversing as co-workers do.  I also had my phone out, texting my then-girlfriend.  Aside from the roar of the nearby freeway, the world was, for the moment, quiet.

But slowly, we heard a noise.  It was obviously coming closer, but truck traffic made it hard to determine what it was, let alone where it was coming from.  After a few minutes, we determined that it was a human voice, yelling something.  It soon became apparent that the voice was coming from a woman up the street a bit from the cul de sac.  She was, in fact SCREAMING her lungs out.  As she wandered her way up the street vaguely in our direction, we began to ""understand"" what she was saying.  Mostly it was gibberish, word salad without form or grammar, with the occasional guttural moan or shrill yelp.  A few coherent phrases came through as well, the most memorable of which was ""Come back me up, Marines!""

My associate and I watched in stunned/disturbed fascination as this mad woman walked up our cul de sac and entered the McDonalds.  No, ""entered"" isn't the right term.  She *CONQUERED* herself in there, like a cowboy hero busting open the swinging half-doors to the saloon in an old western, right before he challenges the bad guy in a black hat to a high-noon show down.

Once inside, we could see her moving around.  Not up at the counter, but amongst the tables and chairs.  She spent several minutes in there, and it was obvious that the McDonalds staff wasn't happy about it, because the guy we knew to be manager was pointing to the door and saying something to her.  She did not appreciate being informed where the egress was, as she started to throw around items like trays, handfuls of napkins, straws, cup lids, whatever detritus she could find, and running full tilt from the counter to the bathrooms and back again.

My associate and I chuckled.  Poor Mickey-Ds schmucks.

At some point, her eccentric (ha!) orbit of the dining area destabilized, and she was ejected from the premises by her own inertia.  The two of us on the pumps then turned our heads, as we didn't really want to deal with something like that right before quitting time.  However, we were either too slow or not camouflaged well enough, because her next course change sent her directly our way.

I still had my phone out, sending updates on the weird event to my gf.  The crazy lady approached, but didn't really seem like she was interested in communing with whatever it was she thought we were.  That is, until, she saw my phone out and my thumb on the keypad.  THAT piqued her interest, and in none-too-kind a manner.  She stalked over to me, came within about 18"", and hiss-whispered, ""If you call the cops, I'm going to fucking kill you.""  Oh dear.  That's not exactly what you would call a smart threat, given that she then wandered towards the parking lot on the back side of the store, still shouting randomly and occasionally flailing her large purse around.  Out of reach and out of eyesight, I called it in.  My co-worker wandered a bit over to the side, to see if she was going to mess with anything in the back.

Apparently, I wasn't the only one who had called 911 about this lady, because the police response time, already quite quick, was extraordinarily fast.  Well under 2 minutes, as I was still giving information to the dispatcher when the two units arrived.  Just as the officers got out of their cars, we heard a loud crash of breaking glass, along with my co-worker yelling ""HEY!!"" and pointing at the woman.  The two officers broke into a run, as did I, and came around the corner to find her with a piece of pipe that had been left near the recycling bin, smashing the window to the small outbuilding which contained some sort of monitoring equipment for the underground gas tanks.

The moment she saw the two officers, however, it was like a switch got flipped.  She instantly calmed down, and became intelligible.  She put down the pipe, and complied with the officers as they asked her to come out to the front of the store (which was on camera and better lit).  The officers asked her for ID, which she calmly produced from a back pocket.  Another officer arrived at this point, but went down to the McDonalds to talk with the manager.  The two officers with the lady were interviewing her, asking her what might be the reason that people were calling about her, her responding that she was just having a bad night, etc etc.  After a few minutes of this, the officer who had been down at the McDonalds came up to talk to us two pump jockeys.  We relayed our perspective of what happened to him, and he went over to the other two officers.  Now, I'm uncertain as to what that officer said to the other two, but he soon went back to his car and began to drive it up to our parking lot.  As that was happening, the two officers with the lady asked her to stand, and if they could search her purse.

This is, as they say, the climax of the story.

For she stood, as she was asked, and grabbed her purse, as if to drop it.  However, instead of doing so, her hand returned with a small-caliber compact pistol, which she raised up and fired.  Now, thankfully, she didn't actually point the thing AT anybody.  Her aim was directly between the two officers, and both of us wage slaves were off to her left.  So the three rounds she fired weren't REALLY a danger to anyone, with the exception of a possible ricochet or that poor barkdust hillside which took three rounds amidships.

The two officers with her reacted instantly, not with guns drawn, but with a very well choreographed double tackle.  Her gun was taken from her hands as she squirmed and screamed all manner of vile epithets.  The third officer heard the shots, and his big V-8-Interceptor-Packaged-Police-Charger roared up between the pumps.  The three officers had a hell of a time getting her into cuffs, because even though she was slight, she was feisty.

Eventually she was controlled with handcuffs and leg restraints, along with the arrival of another couple officers and eventually an ambulance.  One officer had sustained a rather nasty cut to his forehead during the struggle, the cause of which I do not know.  The woman, now lying in the back of a police cruiser, still screaming and trying to kick the window, was being taken to jail for booking and then almost immediately to a hospital for a psych eval.  The two officers were visibly quite shaken, and I overheard them asking if they could take the rest of their shift off.  In a quiet community like that, it's not often that officers end up being shot at.

In the end, I believe that the lady was committed for sanity issues, which does make me feel bad for her.  A crime scene tech recovered the bullets from the hillside (which, I'm happy to say, recovered from it's injuries) and we were thanked by the police officers for our quick call to 911.  I went home, drank a couple beers, and went to sleep, dreaming of crazy ladies.

She says 'I have a £20 voucher and I need something for my neice.' I say that thats fine and ask what sort of thing she is looking for, and this is where it all goes down hill. 

'I don't know, anything, she's 19.' At this point I am a little confused, we are a large store housing many ranges to cater for as many people as possible, this means she has a LOT of options. I try to ascertain what sort of thing she might like only to recieve pointless snippets of info like 'she lives in australia and I need to send it to her' and 'she's quite conservative'. So long story short after a solid 30 minutes of selecting things and being rudely rebuffed I suggest one of our biggest orders at the time, a navy blue,  sleeveless, all-lace dress which is imo a gorgeous dress and it was £14.99 (a mega bargain) and a pack of silver bangles for £4.99. I've made the most of her £20 voucher and she agrees that they will be suitable for her neice.

She finds the voucher and throws it at me. I pick it up to notice that it is a voucher for Topshop, this is not where I work, nor is it even part of the group of companies that I do work for, so I can't accept it.

We're one of the first people to order so they don't have any veggie burgers made up yet and tell us it'll be a 10 minute wait. Not a problem, we step to the far right and wait for our food. A woman and her husband step behind us to wait a minute or two after us.

In just minutes, the concession is *swamped*. It went from less than a handful when we ordered to seven lines at least 15 people deep in moments.

This apparently *will just not do* for the woman waiting behind us. She starts out slowly, muttering under her breath about how they have time to make the real meat burgers but not the veggies. As more and more people walk away with their food, she gets louder and more obnoxious, saying things like ""COME ON"" or ""JESUS CHRIST"" every time a worker walks by the counter at which we're waiting. Two times now the woman who took our order has ran past us with a harried smile, saying it would just be a few more moments. We were totally okay with that and honestly, good on her for keeping tabs in the middle of this chaos!

The self entitled twat behind me gets more and more agressive and finally drops this bomb- ""I can't fucking BELIEVE this. I paid BEFORE ALL these FUCKING PEOPLE and you told me it would be only TEN FUCKING MINUTES.""  At that point I look at our receipt: 5:07. Look at my phone: 5:15. And this lady ordered *after* we did. She's freaking out and just admitted they told her the time, and it's only been 8 minutes!

The grill cook brings out our order- two veggie burgers and two fries. I know it's our order because he called the number, and the impatient hosebeast, who has been waiting on one hotdog and one veggie burger, actually tries to *reach over me and take one of our burgers off the fucking tray*. To make it even more absurd, there was an employee behind him *holding* another tray, on which was a hotdog, so I can only assume her order was LITERALLY a few seconds away.

At this point I'd had enough- I hipchecked the counter, cutting off her stubby arm from our food and I said to the cook, loud enough for all the concession workers to hear, "" These look *amazing* and THANK YOU for making them fresh, which is so hard to come by at a concession stand. And in only 8 MINUTES TOO, which is LESS TIME than what you SAID IT WOULD TAKE. Thank you SO MUCH and I hope *other customers* learn to tell time so they'll know how FAST and EFFICIENT you really are."" With that, I spun on my heel, shouldered my way through the scowling woman and her cowed husband, and headed for the condiments where my boyfriend was waiting. 

It feels so good to be able to say something without worrying about a write up.

It's comforting to know that others have to deal with the same wacky shit. Bosses will always tell you, ""the customer is always right"" but come on, the customer is hardly ever right.

On to my story. I work at a gas station. A nice one, though. I would prefer not to reveal the name, but it's one of those large re-modeled fancy ones. Okay, that's enough of me defending my job. 

A woman comes in. She's thin and blonde. Late 20's to early 30's. She's wearing a tight track suit oufit. I imagine it was from Victoria's Secret. She's yacking loudly on her cell phone. She comes up to the register and tells me she wants $40 on pump 1. She wasn't really rude or anything, it just bugs me when people talk on their phones and then whisper to me like I'm interrupting their important call or something. She leaves.

I go back to what I was doing. About 15-20 minutes later she comes back. I greet her. 

Her: You're not going to believe this! I left without pumping my gas! I was on the highway when I remembered. How crazy is that?

Me: Oh. Heh. That happens sometimes.

My Mind: If you weren't yacking on your cellphone 24/7 this wouldn't have happened.

Me: [I look at my screen] Um it appears that someone pumped your $40 worth of gas. They could have done it by mistake.

Her: Well put the $40 on there again then.

Me: I can't really do that. You're going to have give me another $40. 

Her: Just put another $40 on there!

Me: Well, there is no $40. The money is gone, it's already been pumped. In order to fill your car up you will need to pay again.

Her: YOU OWE ME 40 BUCKS. IT'S NOT MY FAULT THAT SOMEONE PUMPED MY GAS.

Me: You...drove off without it so...it kind of...is your fault.

Her: WHO'S THE MANAGER OF THIS PLACE? GET THEM.

There was no manager at the moment, so I grabbed the shift leader (SL) on duty.

SL: What's the problem?

Her: YOU OWE ME $40.

I explain the situation. The shift leader has a a major temper, by the way. They argue heatedly back and forth. I stand there dumbfounded by the stupidity of the situation.

Her: I AM NEVER COMING BACK HERE. YOU ARE TERRIBLE EMPLOYEES. YOU DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMERS. YOU'RE JUST GAS STATION WORKERS.

This made me angry. It's not a glamorous job, but I work damn hard.

She ended up putting $20 on a pump and stormed off.

Haven't seen her since. Thank God.

I have stories beyond number of my time in retail but this one will always stand out as the most absurd to me. This was many years ago, so I may not remember the dialogue word for word, but I don't think I'll ever forget any of the other details. 

I was 18 years old, fresh out of high school, and working part-time at a Shack that sold electronics. We were paid by commission at the time, with additional bonuses for certain items (like cellphones for example). Any large sale was always very exciting for us, but we never tried to sell a customer something he didn't need or want, since having it returned would have the same commission money coming out of our next paycheck.

One day I was helping a rather heavy set middle-aged man purchase a TV. It was a display, the last one we had of its model. We had a policy where instead of giving a discount on a display item, we would double the manufacturer's warranty up to one additional year. This guy was happy with that, and got to play with the TV to make sure it worked properly and everything. He even bought two cellphones while he was there, one for him and one for his wife. He complimented me on my service and left happy.

Fast forward a week or two later and I see the same guy come into the store, so I step up to see what else I can help him with. Turns out that was a mistake, because he was angry as hell. Started ranting about how the ""piece of shit TV"" I sold him was defective because it took a couple seconds for the display to power up when he turned it on. He demanded to know what I was going to do about it. Always happy to help, I said I didn't honestly remember if it was doing that or not when it was in our store, but if he's unhappy with the way it's working, we could either:

* a) send it to our repair center to have it fixed

 or
* b) take it back and give him his money back

But either way, he needed to bring the TV back to the store. He said that neither of the options I offered were good enough, and there was no way he was going to go through the trouble of bringing ""that piece of shit TV"" back in, and he wanted to know what I was going to do for him.

I was completely dumbfounded. I repeated what I said earlier, thinking maybe he misunderstood. Either solution seemed acceptable to me, but he disagreed and insisted I do something else because he just wasn't going to bring the TV in. We went back and forth like this for a couple minutes because I just couldn't comprehend what else he wanted me to do. When I flat out asked him he said ""What I want is for you to do your fucking job!""

Just when I thought that the situation couldn't get any more absurd, he then asked if I wanted to ""step out into the parking lot and settle this."" That's when a co-worker that was listening near by stepped in and told the guy flat out that he didn't care what his problem was, that was unacceptable and he needed to leave, now.

The customer started yelling even louder, said ""Fine then, I want to return THIS!"" and pulled his cellphone (that I sold him) out of his pocket and SLAMMED it down on the counter. The screen immediately shattered and bits of the case broke off and flew everywhere. Without thinking, I said the first thing that popped into my mind: ""We can't return that, it's broken."" (We couldn't have taken it back no matter what, once it was activated he had to deal with the cellphone service provider and not us. But the situation was so absurd that I said it without thinking).

He picked up the mangled phone and threw it against the wall where it exploded into tiny pieces. Then he turned on his heel and stomped out of the store without another word.

I was still so shocked by the encounter that I had to go sit down in the back, but once I calmed down I found the whole thing hilarious. To this day I still wonder if he really thought that a tiny 18 year old girl was going to fight him in the parking lot over his stupid TV.

A couple days later we got a call from the corporate headquarters saying they had a customer complaint about one of our associates stealing his phone. My manager said that we had his phone in a plastic bag here at the store and the customer was welcome to come pick it up whenever he wanted.

He never did.

Story of the Flying Vacuum!

I was roughly 5 months into my new job at Circuit City. They used to sell vacuums but not since I had been there. In walks a very pissed guy, (wife beater and faux gold chains kind) carrying his new looking vacuum like he was carrying a bundle wood. 

Mini Hulk: ""This fucking thing does work!"" 

Me: ""Ok, what is it doing??""

Mini Hulk:  ""The fucking thing doesn't work!"" (he is almost angry that I asked another question) 

How so? (further angers him)

Mini Hulk ""IT DOESN'T SUCK SHIT UP!!!"" now my manager hears this and comes out of the office. 

Manager: ""Hi, how can I help you?""

Mini Hulk: ""THIS FUCKING VACUUM DOESN'T WORK!"" loud enough the whole store can hear this.

I take a step back and let my manager do the talking.... After a back and forth, with a vein popping out on his forehead, he doesn't have a receipt, doesn't know who bought it or when, we can't even determine that it was bought at Circuit City. 

Manager: ""Ok so what do you want us to do here? We can send it off to services and they can take a look but that will take a couple weeks....."" (right about this point, Mini Hulk boils over)

Mini Hulk: ""FUCK YOU GUYS YOU CAN KEEP THIS PIECE OF SHIT!!!!

He picks up the vacuum and tosses it over the counter like a javelin, I side step and my manager ducks the incoming cleaner. Shit hits the wall loudly and now the whole store is watching this event. Managers come pouring out the office seeing what is going on. Mini Hulk storms out the building, dislodging our automatic doors and almost breaking one. 

Me and my manager stare at each other for a while trying to sort what just happened. The video replay of this is funny as hell, we saved a tape just for posterity. Everything calms down, we have a good laugh. About an hour later, we get curious about our newly acquired vacuum. We are looking at the bottom, brush spins, still works. But he was right, it wasn't sucking. We pull it open (some of you know where this is going)......

The bag inside was solid and I mean like a paper brick worth of dust and shit. It weighed several pounds. *They had never changed the bag out of the vacuum...* I look dumbfounded at my manager and our warehouse guy as we all just laugh hysterically when it dawns on me, the K-Mart next store probably has the bags to fit this. So I run next door almost giddy and sure enough they do. I buy a pack and take it next door. The damn thing works great!

My co-worker had been looking through our search history and found a last name, different first, different phone number, etc, that purchased this model around the same time. Guess what the serial numbers match! I decide to make a call... well because we were being so smug. 

Phone: Hello?

Me Hi is this Mr. Hulk??

Phone: Yes this is him...

Me: Hi, this is (Me) at Circuit City, I just wanted to let you know we figured out that vacuum!

Phone: ... What vacuum???

Me: Ummm, the one that was thrown?? 

Phone: ??? When????

Me: Today, (I then recount the story of the flying vacuum) 

Turns out, this is Hulk Senior. It was his vacuum that we had fixed and Mini Hulk was his son being a douche. We gladly invite him back to the store to retrieve his vacuum. :)

15 minutes later in walks Hulk Sr with Mini Hulk in tow, tail between his legs and head hung low. Hulk Sr makes Mini Hulk look like a small child in size...and he is PISSED. 

We pull the vacuum out, show them it working on a demo mat. We open it up and show how to take the bags out and replace. Shit we even gave them the bags we bought! We let Mini Hulk try it out as his dad watched glaringly. We are being so damn chipper but Mini Hulk never looks us in the face. We also showed the bag we removed. You could almost here Mini Hulk shrink three sizes as his Hulk Sr. slowly looks over at him like ""You fucking idiot..."" We shake Hulk Sr.'s hand with a smile on our face and Mini Hulk clutches his working vacuum like a small child as he leaves the store.

Everyone has to buy a ticket."" Fast-forward about a week later, I'm working the ticket taking area again. Same officers comes up, flashes his badge, and we have this exchange.


Me: Do you have a ticket sir?

Me: Sir, I can't let you upstairs unless you have a ticket.

PO: Excuse me? Why do I need a ticket?

Me: Everyone has to pay to see a movie sir. I can't let you in for free.

PO: Are you serious? You know I'm a (city-name) police officer right?

Me: I understand sir, but I cannot let you in without a ticket. I'll lose my job.

PO: Ugh. This is bullshit.


So the officer walks away. By now, his daughter is here, and they get in line to buy a ticket. I can see him talking to the box office people about me, as he's pointing at me and whatnot. I can also see that they're telling him the same thing, which upsets him. He's comes back over to me, glaring at me and not breaking eye-contact, and hands me two tickets.

1363039066.0,382,self.TalesFromRetail,1a3vgj,Gave a bitchy coworker a lesson in karma while making a little girl and myself very happy! (Posted because people suggested it was worthy of more than a comment),toxicpretty,459,77,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1a3vgj/gave_a_bitchy_coworker_a_lesson_in_karma_while/,"I had a similar experience when I worked as a makeup consultant for a small chain of  boutique makeup stores. We worked in a mall and gave free ""mini makeovers"" for customers in order to get them interested in our products. I worked along side a more senior associate who had quite the attitude. She made it a point to only target people who looked liked they had money to burn...she'd leave the rest to me. I didn't care cause it was just fun making people look their best...I loved showing people how to create a beautiful look for themselves and I actually like most of our products so it was easy to recommend them. 

One day a couple of little girls came in to ask for makeovers. Because they looked about twelve, the older associate quickly brushed them off saying they needed to ""go play"". We were slow as hell and they looked so eager...I immediately said that I would love to help them. The senior associate reminded me that I was wasting company time and resources on children and that their mom was going to be pissed as hell. But I figured that it was just for fun and, besides, I could show them how to make it look natural and simple. Maybe even help them avoid the god awful self-taught looks that little girls usually do. 

So I sit the first one down and start to cleanse. Immediately I realize that despite being an exceptionally beautiful little girl, she's sporting a serious cleft lip scar. She tells me that she's always hated it...and asks if I know how to diminish it. I tell her that she's in luck since I know some theater makeup tricks I learned in high school (not to mention I'm a painter). Long story short...I give both girls a killer natural look but most importantly, I completely hide the cleft lip . Gone. The look of utter adoration and joy was worth a dozen sales and I sent them off feeling pretty satisfied.

I thought that was the end of the story but I was wrong. A half hour goes by and suddenly a woman rushes in demanding to know who gave a makeover to her daughter. I immediately recognize the little girl with the cleft lip  trailing behind her. The senior consultant smiles and points to me...thinking I'm about to get a major chewing out. But instead I am immediately hugged. There are tears and laughs as the mother urgently explains that I'm a miracle worker and that her daughter has never looked so beautiful. She then goes on to tell me that her daughter is a steady pageant contestant who has racked up many a trophy despite the cleft lip ...but now she NEEDS me to teach her how to fix the scar. Fast forward...twenty hugs and a professional makeup consultation is scheduled. This is a 75 dollar service we offer for people wanting a full, specialized consultation, facial cleansing, and makeup application. I want to add at this point that I worked on a base pay/commission status...making a small bonus for each item I sell along with my hourly rate. The  professional consultation comes with a nice commission.

The senior consultant was shocked and then grumpy at this turn of events but wrote it off as lucky but unlikely to lead to any major sales due to the girls age.
Oh how wrong she was...
Three days later, at the scheduled time, three people showed up instead of two... The little girl, her mom, and her dad. There is a weird feeling in the air...not bad, just weird. It doesn't take long to realize that the couple is divorced, civil, and madly in love with their daughter. But there is some tension and some emotional ""issues"". It seems that dad's paying and mom is consciously/unconsciously using that to drive up the purchases. She's treating me like a makeup guru and every time I even touch a product, it's purchased. It was like something out of a game show shopping spree...with the piles of makeup up and cleansers building a metropolis at the register. I'm having candid camera moments, pinching myself occasionally to see if this is real. But I'm drawing the boundaries when suddenly I realize that it's going too far...after she began asking about whether we should add anti-wrinkle and cellulite creams(some of our most expensive and, IMO, useless product), I put the brakes on. I never let people buy those. She's twelve (I knew they were going to the mom) and besides, I told her, they don't work anyway. By this time they had bought nearly one of everything in the store with the dad seemingly unfazed and the mom and girl giddy as can be. It was the most fun I'd had in the month I'd worked there (oh yeah...did I mention that?). And then it was over to the tune of nearly $600 not including the makeover. Plus many hugs, compliments, and teary giggles.

My senior consultant had unfortunately not been scheduled to witness the crazy spree but was there the next day when my manager came in on his day off to award me an additional bonus and certificate for best individual sale to date. I guess I had broken a previously held record by nearly a hundred dollars!
The look on the Sr.consultant was priceless...almost better than the hugs and money...almost, but not quite! So much for working with lowly kids, eh?

I used to work for a major retail company . I worked in the Electronics Department and was one of our top performing employees. All of our guest scores had risen significantly since transferring to this store, and I was also a very well rounded employee. I worked not only within electronics, but any other department I was needed, including logistics and guest service. 

There was a Spanish teacher at a nearby high school who was nice enough to assign a video project in which these groups of HS students had to film a short ad, in spanish, in the specific store I worked. 
The problem is we do not allow video recording within the store without permission from the store and district manager, as well as a film permit. 

A group of high school girls and their overenthusiastic mother come into electronics and begin filming right in the middle of the main aisle, complete with other customers. I go up to them and calmly, and extremely nicely explain that they can not record within the store without a permit. Before I even have a chance to say anything more, the lady loses it. and by loses it, I mean she flips her shit. Starts berating me and my ""job"" saying that I work minimum wage and need to shut the hell up and let them do their assignment and get the hell out of their way. I ask her to please remain calm, that I would be more than willing to bring the manager over, but that she could not continue filming, especially if there are other customers in the video against their will. I think I honestly said something along the lines of if she posts this on youtube, the unsuspecting customers have every right to sue her to the full extent of the law... maybe not 100% true, but I was losing patience. 

So the manager, Derptina, comes over. She asks whats wrong and replies with ""Oh sure, go ahead and film! Have a great day!!""

Ok. This pisses me off. I'm a former film student, I know how much trouble our store, as well as my manager can now get in. I try explaining that to her, but she won't listen, so I make her move me to another department if there is going to be filming within electronics. 


flash forward to the next day. 
group of teenage boys comes in to film, I tell them they are more than welcome to go speak with a manager, but until they have her permission, they are not allowed to film. 
The lead guy of the group starts cussing at me, calling me every name in the book, and before I have a chance to snap and tear him a new one, I tell him to leave my dept until a manager gets there. 

I call Derptina back to the dept. ""Derptina, Could you please come to electronics? I have a verbally abusive guest, and need assitance before he turns violent."" 

her response: ""Sorry, I'm actually eating right now, so it's going to be at least 20 minutes before I can get over there.""

key words. Verbally abusive. violent. REALLLY? 

Then as soon as Derptina comes back she pulls me off the floor and proceeds to try and coach me. She says I did not handle the situation according to policy. I tried explaining to her what happened and reminded her that she was supposed to come to the dept, or at least send an AP guy over.
Needless to say, Derptina is seriously trying to blame me for the guy blowing up on me, despite the numerous other employees who have told her that I did nothing wrong. 
She then starts blaming me for the .01% drop in guest service, and all of the other problems within the dept. (that I had actually fixed.)

So, in a moment of lack of judgement, in a job I didn't really need, I did what I had wanted to do in every other retail job at some point or another, and told her to, and I quote ""Take this job and shove it""

The woman handling the register started asking him if he had any brothers or sisters. He said no, and she started on with, ""you have to tell your mommy and daddy to give you a brother or sister..."" Yammering on for a minute about this, ignoring my wide eyed appeals for her to shut her pie hole, eventually telling me directly I needed to give him a sibling. 

It was very hard work on my end not to chew her out and punch her in the face. 

See, we had already told our son a few months earlier that he was going to have a sibling, and then my wife miscarried. 

Now, the idiot at the register didn't know that, and in her head I'm sure she was being nice, but she couldn't have pressed a more damaging button if she'd tried. 

All she had to do was keep her mouth shut, and I hope any retailers reading this -- screw it, I hope any decent people reading this -- learn that sometimes they need to stop as soon as, ""no, I don't have any siblings"" has been established. 

(Ps - after 2 miscarriages we did end up with a healthy second kid. Just adding this because I am not asking for sympathy votes, I'm just asking for people to be aware before they tell a compete stranger they need to have more kids.)

Edit: thanks everyone for the kind words, but seriously, it's ok.  Both miscarriages were at around ""first heartbeat"" time and my wife and I were both approaching 40, so as much as it sucked, we were relatively prepared for it.  And again, we did have a 2nd child eventually and he's just months away from turning 3.  We are all well, it was just a frustrating story that stands out because it was so --- well, she was TRYING to be cheerful while talking to a cute little boy, she clearly had no clue it was a stupid thing to say and continue talking about, but boy it pissed me off.

Baby red potatoes look exactly like our ""jumbo"" red potatoes. There is barely any size difference. One is the size of two golf balls, one is the size of two and a half golf balls.

A lady comes up with her all organic, perfectly healthy order. Great, people with organics are usually friendlier than most! Nope. She's immediately rude, criticizing how I'm bagging her order as I scan it. She tells me to stop bagging.

Apologizing, I take off the potatoes while she rants and re-ring them through as petites.

But wouldn't you know, the first time I rang them through, I had scanned them incorrectly as a bit underweight. The second time, the weight was correct. She ended up paying 16 cents more than if she hadn't said anything to begin with.

I work at a Petrol Station, which also has a supermarket section to it.

So there I am working the closing shift. A few customers every now and then, having to stock shelves and fridges between customers.

In walks a customer, who heads straight for our gift card stand. Grabs about 4-5 of them, and heads to the front counter and asks to buy them. I'm a little bit suspicious by this point, as we usually only sell 1 or 2 at a time. I think to myself that if he is paying cash, I wouldn't have much of an issue, except making sure the cash is not counterfeit.

The guy then pulls out one of the company cards that we have for business accounts. Alarm bells go off in my head and I'm thinking ""What should I do? We never have sold gift cards on business accounts"" and wondering how the guy will react if I deny the sale.

I excuse myself to ""check for authorisation"" and head to the office. The guy decides to tell me he bought 5 earlier in the day with no issues. I then decide to call my boss and try to hint to them that it is a potential fraud situation, without letting the customer know.

I told my boss that I had 4-5 $100 gift cards, to sell on a business account, and that I needed authorisation for the transaction. Thankfully they pick up on it straight away and ask me a few ""yes or no"" questions (do you suspect this to be fraud, are they regular customers, etc), and told me to deny the sale and mention they can call Accounts in the morning if they have any problems, and to call my boss back after they leave.

They get a bit annoyed but leave without further issues. I called my boss back and we discussed the probability of it being fraud, whether they really purchased 5 earlier (they did, and one of my coworkers got into trouble for not picking up on the potential fraud &gt;.&lt;), and told me to fill out a report for it.

I get a call the next day from my boss. I am told that the guy is the son of the owner of the business the account is linked to, and that he was buying the gift cards on his dads business account, then selling them for cash to fuel his drug habit. 

Got a little certificate for being attentive to potential fraud and got a free scratchie from one of the higher-ups (a simple incentive kind of thing).

We sold your everyday bra and panties. 

We had a stupid policy that as long as you had a receipt, or if your item had the original tag, we would take it back. It didn't matter if it had been worn 500 times, or if it was 10 years old. 

We also had a special going on, 3 bras for some amount a piece, not counting clearance or special-marked items. All the signs are clearly marked. 

This woman comes in and heads to my counter. I ask if I can help her, and she hands me a bag, and says she has a return, but wants to shop. I tell her no problem, I can process the return at the same time as her purchase. She goes somewhere in the store and a CA is helping her. I open the bag and this pungent smell of B.O. exists the bag. I pull out the bra. It at one point was white, but now looked grey and cornflower blue, had broken underwires, and had that feeling of sweat/had been sitting in the car for months. No receipt, but there's a tag without a price. I type in the UPC, and it tells me that the bra is now only worth $2. The bra is from 2003 when I catalog it. 

This customer was awful. She tried on no less than 30 bras, several of which were the same style and size but were different colors. She got makeup and deodorant stains on the dark colored ones, which we have to damage because they can't be resold. She questioned the price on every item, even though the sale had been explained to her repeatedly. Her total store time was over an hour. 

She comes back up to the desk, and decides she wants her return purchase and regular purchase to be separate. I give her additional items to my CA, who I was training. I process her return, which comes to $2.17. She asks, ""Why am I only getting $2 back for this item? It was 17.99 when I bought it and I just bought it a few months ago.""

I say, ""Ma'am, this is now a clearance bra and I can't give you the original price because it is not listed on the tag, and you have no receipt--"" and she cuts me off. ""But I came in 6 months ago and it was 17.99!"" I reply, ""Ma'am this bra is 10 years old. The style number is one I don't have in books from 5 years ago, and I have been here 3 years, and we haven't sold anything for 17.99 since 2009."" She stares at me for what feels like an hour. ""Can't you just take my word for it?"" I tell her sorry, there's nothing I can do. So, she takes her $2.17 and disappears in the store again and comes to the CA's register shortly after. 

She comes up with two promotion bras and a clearance bra. The clearance bra will already be half off. CA explains to her three times that the promotion won't work on two, only three, and the third she picked was clearance. She exclaims, ""This one was on the rack with these other ones I found"". CA explains that it clearly red marked and it must have been put there by mistake. Customer gets very angry at this point, ""You are trying to rip me off! I know you can give me the price I want but you are selfish!""

My CA looks at me, and asks what to do. I told her, ""Just give her the promo on the other two. I am tired of hearing her mouth."" The customer shuts up after that. CA finalizes her purchase. The customer looks up and says, ""I had a 20% off coupon. I don't have it with me, but can you look it up or use another one?"" I am so livid. ""Ma'am, the coupon is tied to your reward card, but unfortunately I have no way to look up your information."" Customer again throws a fit. ""WHY CAN'T YOU TAKE MY WORD FOR IT! I COME HERE ALL THE TIME!!!!"" 

She snatches her bag off the counter. I stop her at the door, and hand her the bag of the nasty bra. ""Take this with you. This is something I can call OSHA over, and I do not want to subject my employees to touching decade-old filth.""

This lady come in with a shopping cart that is covered with a blanket. I ask her how I can help her.

She proceeds to lift the blanket off the cart. In the cart is an automatic kitty litter box, full of cat shit and piss. Then the smell hit me. My nose was burning from the smell of ammonia.  I asked her to put the blanket back over the cart and she started yelling at me because the litter box would no longer ""push the clumps into the container"" and that her house smelled like that for weeks now. 

I looked at her and said ""did you have it plugged in?"" she looked at me like I has spouted a second head. After about 30 minutes of going back and forth about the nasty litter box I asked her if she had a receipt, ""No I ain't got the damned receipt!"" I asked her if she had the box, ""Why would I keep a box that it came in?"" I then told her I could not do the return. I asked her to take the nasty litter box back outside with her. 

She took the blanket off the cart, picked up the litter box and dumped it on the floor in front of the service, then, and I shit you not, she got down on her hands and knees and started rubbing it around on the floor with her hands and meowing like a cat. I called management and they escorted her out of the store.

This store was the only grocery store on the small island that caters to the richest locals and the large group of tourists that visit each summer.

I was a cashier at this store and I was used to these kind of transactions but one in particular will stay in my memory forever.

I froze. I felt that gutteral, composure smashing laugh welling up inside me. I prayed to every god I could think of, in that split second, for no one to look at me. I could let it go and keep it together if no one acknowledged my existence.

The layout of the restaurant is simple, it's basically one big room with windows that overlook a lake on the far end. People always want to sit at the stupid lake windows.

One weekday afternoon I was working the lunch shift. It was fairly quiet as usual, when in walks this 50-year-old Barbie doll. She had bleach blond hair done up like she was auditioning for Hairspray, turquoise eyes (color contacts I assume) with matching eyeshadow, and was as thin as a cancer patient. She clacks in on her high heels, taking those tiny beauty pageant steps while swinging her hips back and forth, walks right into the center of the room and loudly asks, ""Can we sit anywhere we want?""

Now, our restaurant was not seat yourself. Typically people would wait at the hostess stand, like you normally do, and one of us would come seat you. This was important because it ensured that the customers were fairly distributed among each of our sections. That, and we would also bring menus with us when we seated people, so no one ever had to wait for a menu (this is important). However, if customers asked for a specific booth or table, we would put them there. This got really annoying because people would always request the lake windows, which meant whoever was assigned to that section got way more customers and way more money than anyone else. Anyway, I digress. Since we would have put them wherever they asked anyway, one of the waitresses said, ""Uh, sure, I guess,"" and Barbie strutted over to a lake window booth.

A few minutes later, in walks Barbie #2. Obviously her sister (twin?), she looked exactly the same except that her hair was cemented into a slightly different (but equally big) hairstyle, and her eyes/eyeshadow were violet instead of turquoise. 

Now, the lucky waitress assigned to the lake windows today was Holly. Holly was everything the Barbies were *trying* to be: she was 40 but looked about 25, cute, thin, *naturally* blond, and just overall really pretty. She brought the Barbies their coffee, and as far as I could tell she didn't say anything more than ""How are you doing today"" to them.

As soon as Holly left their table, Barbie #1 approached me.

""Excuse me,"" she said, ""I don't mean to be rude, but we simply *refuse* to be served by that blond waitress.""

""I'm sorry,"" I said, ""but she's assigned to the table your at today. Is there a reason why she can't serve you?""

""We just do not want her serving us!"" she exclaimed. *Sigh*

""OK, I'll see what I can do."" I found Holly in the waitress station and told her that the Barbies had rejected her. Holly laughed and said she didn't care, she didn't want to serve them anyway. This is when I found out that the Barbies are apparently notorious in the town my restaurant is in for their bad attitude and major middle-aged sluttiness. Apparently they always refuse to be served by waitresses who are younger and prettier than them (I was OK to serve them though. Thanks, I guess?). I offered to take care of them, because I was intrigued and figured I could get a good story to tell my friends about the time I served ""The Whores of [Town Name]"", as my coworker Laura called them.

I went to their table and told them that I would be serving them. As soon as I got there, one of them said, ""Excuse me, but we need some menus. That *blond* waitress forgot to bring us any! Can you believe that?!"" Bitch, maybe that's because you decided to seat yourself! I put on my best customer service smile and brought them some menus. The rest of the meal proceeded with them just generally being really demanding, pulling stupid power trips like asking me to bring extra extra extra cream and then not using any of it. The icing on the cake, though, was when they called me over to ""apologize"":

""I hope that blond waitress isn't offended that we didn't want her serving us,"" Barbie #1 said.

""Oh, no,"" I said with a giant smile on my face, ""not at all! Don't worry about it.""

""It's just, we don't want people *talking* about us, is all!"" said Barbie #2. Barbie #1 nodded in solemn agreement.

I reassured them that no feelings were hurt and no one would be talking about them. Then I went to the waitress station, where Holly and Laura and I talked about them for the rest of the day.

If we're too busy or I have literal shit to clean on top of every other maintenance job, it ain't gonna happen unless they're looking to buy.

Me- ""I'm catching crickets for that lady over there.""

Recently I've been receiving a lot of messages asking for tales from my days as a security guard at the two amusement parks I worked at, and my time working in a psych hospital.  I would love to tell these tales but don't know an appropriate subreddit yet. So for now I'll stick with my LP stories here, which as sadly starting to dwindle.  But today's tale is about two mischievous young scamps, and their quest to acquire some video games without paying for them.


It was a slow, hazy afternoon in my part of the country.  I was working for a blue shirted electronic retailer, and having a bad day.  See, in the summer time, I don't like AC. I'd rather drive with the windows, and sunroof open, enjoying the air.  So I tended to keep my windows and sunroof cracked open a bit when I parked for long periods.  This afternoon, mother nature decided to take a shit on me, and it rained, for all of 3 minutes, with a torrential downpour.  Naturally, by the time I got relief from my station, and my car keys, the rain had abated, leaving me with a slightly soaked car interior, a shit ton of humidity, and a bright shining sun that seemed to be a giant middle finger right in my face.

So naturally, I was looking to improve my mood.  Well, I must have done something right in a past life, because my opportunity presented itself shortly after.  Being a slow day, I was following the few customers in the store, not really paying attention to them, if I'm being honest.  But when I switched to the camera that watched the video game aisles,  I noticed two young kids, with a stack of games in their hands.  They weren't too old, maybe 10 and 8.  Obviously brothers, and from the way they were whispering to each other, and darting glances around the store, it was obvious they were up to something. Most of you, I am sure, are aware that most games in these stores have plastic security cases around them, supposedly to deter thieves.  Though I've seen them removed easier than a repressed catholic school girls panties during her first week of college.

Anyways, next to the regular, ""secure"" games, is usually a bargain rack or bin.  Cheap $10 and $20 games, usually pretty shitty.  But sometimes you can find some gems in there.  Well these boys had searched and found a few apparently. Each kid had about 3 or 4 games in his hand. I watched them move to a remote corner of the store, and begin to unwrap the games.  Hands shaking, they removed the plastic, and stashed it in a laptop bag.  They quickly peeked inside of the game case, verifying their treasure was indeed inside.  Once the first game was free from is cellophane prison, the boys quickly liberated the rest of the games.  Each case getting stripped of its binding quicker. Their hands learning and becoming more deft with each progression.  It reminded me of learning, as a younger man, to remove a woman's bra with one hand.  First time is always a fucking disaster, an impenetrable Fort Knox protecting those glorious mounds that feel like a bag of sand. But soon you learn and it's almost as easy as snapping your finger, like a reject back up from West Side Story.

At this point, I made everyone with a radio aware of what was going on, but told them we were just going to fuck with these kids.  I had the computer supervisor walk over to the aisle they were in.  The two young lads scampered off as soon as they saw the blue movement of a scratchy polo being warn by some one making minimum wage.  Next stop was apparently appliances.  I could see the two young men conversing in hushed tones.

""Why brother,"" said Boy 1, ""It seems to me, without much forethought, that we could stash the wrappings of our contraband in this here refrigeration box.  Then we can take this disk containing games of video back to our domicile and spend many an hour together rejoicing in our conquest!""

""Splendid!"" cried Boy 2 ""Let us at once good sir.""

Well at least that's how they sounded in my head.  For some reason, they decided to throw the case, AND THE GAME, in the fridge. They did this not once, but 3 times.  Then they wandered off to the music section, and watched the appliance aisle.  My guess is they wanted to see how often people checked before actually removing the games from the cases.  And this is where things get interesting.

An older black woman walks up behind them.  She apparently scared the crap out of them, and they all began to talk. Now this woman seemed like she had just gotten back from church.  She looked like an extra from Big Momma's house. One of those little old ladies who stops to talk to Martin Lawrence and then isn't seen again.  She was pointing at the games remaining in their hand, and shaking her head no.  She led them over to the video game aisle to have them put them back on the shelves.  With a forlorn glance at the appliance aisle, they followed, dutifully.  That is when the fuckery began on my part.  I had our appliance manager go to the three fridges containing games, and remove the disks from the cases, and leave the cases in the fridges.  She brought the disks over to me, and I smiled a devious smile, like a guy who is stuck in an crowded elevator with the boss he hates, and releases a smelly, yet silent fart of quiet revenge.

Eventually, released from authoritative grip of their grandmother, the two boys return to the appliance section, and begin to go for their main target.  I wish I could accurately describe the look on their faces as they opened the Fridgidaire, reached in to open the game case, only to discover its empty.  A look of pure joy , slowly morphing into a look of utter complexity.  I imagine its like being handed your child after your wife gives birth, only to discover that it has both sets of genitalia on it.

The boys looked around in a panic, and quickly abandoned the cases and walked over to the home theater section.  Sitting on two giant leather chairs, the two boys held secretive conferences.  Clearly the message had been sent, and I could rest easy knowing two little shits had been taken down a couple of pegs.  But NOPE. One of the boys quickly ran back to the game aisle, picked up two of the games their grandmother had made them put back, and returned to the chair.  He removed the two disks, and handed them to his brother, who quickly place them under the chair.  Then the first brother went and put the cases back into the game aisle. 

Naturally I raised the Theater supervisor on the radio, and he agreed that an impromptu changing of the furniture in his department was a good idea.  So he and the biggest guy in the store, proceeded to shift around couches and chairs.  Eventually they reached the chairs where the two boys sat.  The Supervisor, knowing a bit of fuckery himself, held down his radio so all could hear the conversation.

Supe: Hey guys, we're moving furniture, would you mind letting us just place these chairs over there?  Then you can have them back.

The boys shared a glance with each other, the horror apparent in their eyes.  Yes boys. You were stupid before, then you went full retard.

You never go full retard.  (Shout out to Robert Downy Jr.)

Supe: Hey guys cmon it'll take two seconds. I know they are comfy, but I'll make sure you get them back.

Boy 1: Umm.. Our grandma told us to wait here. We aren't allowed to move.

Supe: I'll tell her I ok'd it.  Or stand here and we'll bring a couch over for you.

The two boys got up and STOOD THERE, as the supervisor picked up the chair, spotted the two games, and picked them up after putting the chair down.

Supe: Oh hey these weren't yours were they? Fell out of your pocket?  No? Sorry, we get people trying to steal this stuff all the time,  someone must have left it here. 

The two boys acted suprised, as if anyone would actually steal.  That was just unthinkable, and wrong.  They decided then that an area that had been host to criminals, was surely no place that they wanted to be, lest they tarnish their purity, and quickly left the area.  At this point, everyone on the radio is laughing, or trying not to laugh while dealing with customers.  My manager comes up and I tell him I'm gonna make sure they understand. He gives a nod and goes out and gets all the games and cases and brings them up to me.  Now the boys didn't remove anything from the store, so legally, I wasn't allowed to do what I did next. But fuck them. I'm awesome.

After several more minutes, the boys find their grandmother who had just finished her purchases, and they head towards the door. I ask the sweet old lady for her receipt, and ask her if she has a minute.  She says yes, and I pull her aside, with her two rapscallions in tow.  

Me: ""Ma'm are these your grandsons?""

Madea: Why yes they are. Is there a problem?

Me: Well, Ma'm I apologize if this seems rude, but it appears they were attempting to remove some video games from the store without purchasing them.

Madea: What? How dare you accuse them of stealing?  We just got back from church!  These are good boys!

Me: I'm sure they are.  And I don't normally say anything or act unless they have removed something from the store, but I figured this is something you'd want to know about.  If you don't believe me, I have it all on video and can show you, so you can talk to them

After much hooting and hollering about how I'm racist, and it's hard enough for young black boys growing up without the white man putting them down, she agrees to watch the video.  She sees everything unfold, and the stare she gave her boys would make Hitler hug a Jew just to make it stop.  She turned to me, apologized profusely, and assured me she would take care of it.  At this point we were in my office, and she asks if she can have a moment alone with her grandsons.  I agreed and closed the door behind me.  The smacks were audible, even though she was screaming at them full force. A minute later the ruckus died, and they walked out, quietly, into the sweltering day.

**TL;DR-Aint no justice like angry black woman justice.**

I would much rather work 30 weekend days in a row versus an entire week of weekdays.

This past Monday was extremely annoying, more than usual. Not only did those idiot customers come in, but we had a few styles of shoes that we no longer being sold in our store. In addition to other projects that needed to be completed, we were running around like crazy. Of course we were helping out customers when they came into our department, but otherwise we were moving shoes from back, making new displays, and pretty much rearranging our entire department. 

I was by the cleats section when I saw her. Middle aged, blonde woman with her middle-school aged son. They both sat down on a bench in the section, so that was my cue to give my best retail line, ""Can I help you find anything today?""

The lady looked me up and down (pet peeve of mine), and said that they're fine. Not that they're just browsing or that they need a few minutes, just that they're fine. I told them my next normal line that if they need help, that they can feel free to ask me or my two other coworkers that I mention by name and point out where they are. She says thank you, and I leave to keep rearranging the department.

About 5 minutes pass, and we're all deep into our projects. All of the customers in our department, minus the lady and her son, are satisfied with trying on their shoes and we're all at a happy balance. In the background, I hear the store phone ringing, but keep working as I cannot answer it. 

My manager, who happens to be my favorite manager, goes over our radio saying that a lady just called in asking for help in footwear. What?

My coworker sweeps the area looking for someone who has not been helped, and finds the lady in the cleats looking for something for her son to try on.

I see my manager, and I decide to ask her what the hell the phone call was about. Here's what my manager said:

""The lady said that she sees three people working in footwear and nobody will come up to her to help her. She literally said, 'Your employees will not approach me. Tell them to do their job'""

What the heck? She admits to seeing us in the department, but knows we're busy busting our butts to get the place rearranged and thinks we're blatantly ignoring her? Instead of waving us over or approaching us, she decides to not get off her lazy ass and find our store's number on her phone only to call my boss to try to get us in trouble? 

The best part is that my manager thought that was bizarre and didn't care about that lady's concern. She had admitted to seeing us all on the sales floor, which is something that management tells us that we must do, which is be visible at all times. We were all on the sales floor, doing work that has to get done that day. My coworker made sure to be annoying by checking in with her a lot. I know that's the point where it sounds immature, but what was this lady's intention? Trying to get us in trouble to get fired? I don't know, but I'm glad I'm getting about 3 weeks off soon for my wedding and honeymoon.

It is a roughly 30 foot long counter with the deli at one end and prepared food at the other. The deli is open much later then prepared foods.

Every Wednesday we sell fried fish in the prepared food section. Now our fish is really good and we sell a lot of it. Sorta famous around the old people community. So much so that we actually have call ins and orders for it to be reserved. We usually sell out around 3 pm but always stop selling a 6 pm. Our story takes place at 6:30 pm

This belligerent angry blob of a human being walks in and stares at the empty section where the fish is normally kept.

Me - Sorry but we sold out hours ago. We also stop selling them 30 minutes ago

So despite by better judgement to say ""Yup you caught us then throw her out the same door"" I spent 5 minutes trying to tell her the fish was gone before just passing her off like a screaming child to my manager. As i went back to my other duties, I watched as it took my boss 17 minutes to console the belligerent blob finally she yells ""You are all fish hoarding liars! and storming off""

I work at a big cinema company in the north of England, we get a lot of 15 rated films there and because of a police incident that happened a few years back, we've become extremely strict in ID policies. We must ID EVERYONE. We have signs EVERYWHERE.

But of course, kids don't understand ID at such a young age and we have to deal with a lot of bullshit. Here are some stories just from this years summer holidays:

**But I liked Simon Pegg!**

Opening day for *The Worlds End*, thankfully a lot of teenagers have brought in ID. Two young irish lads come up to the tills requesting if they can see the new Simon Pegg film, note one of them is really quiet and the other extremely cocky, they look like they're 10. I ask how old they are 'I'm 11, he's 12.'.

Me &gt; I'm sorry but you aren't allowed to watch this film by law, as it's an age restricted film

CockyOne &gt; What? Well that's bullshit. I've seen every single Simon Pegg film ever.

Me &gt; Well I'm sorry but you can't see this film in cinemas, you're too young, the only other film on at the moment you can see is Despicable Me 2.

CO &gt; What? Fuck that, how old do you think I am?! Just let me in for Simon Pegg

Me (any patience I've had gone) &gt; No. You're not seeing a film today. Bye!

CO &gt; Well we'll just come back tomorrow then!

They came back the next day. And the next day. And the next day. They never saw the film.


**Are you working tomorrow? I wanna watch the film and you won't let me!**


Final film of the night, *The Worlds End*, 3 young lads come in who look 14. Request ID.

GlassesDude &gt; Are you being serious?

Me &gt; Yes. I need to see ID or you can't see the film.

All 3 walk out, assuming they're getting ID of some kind.  They come back 20 minutes later as me and my coworker are cleaning and sorting the retail stand.

GlassesDude &gt; So, are you working tomorrow? You've IDed me and I can't get any ever and I wanna watch the film so I'll just come in tomorrow.

...wut.

Me &gt; Well, maybe? I'm not saying. But thanks for letting me know. I'll tell my other co-workers.

GlassesDude &gt; WHAT. But I've come in for a 15 before and never been IDed!

Me &gt; What films were they?

This list was brilliant by the way.

GlassesDude &gt; Fast and Furious! Woman in Black! Avengers! (Wut)

Me &gt; Well...all those films you've mentioned are actually a 12A, I'm pretty sure Avengers was a PG.

GlassesDude &gt; Oh...*storms out*

He came back the next day. He never watched a film.


**Someone won't let these girls in so I'll buy them their tickets!**


Last week, *The Heat* came out in cinemas, which is popular amongst all the young girls. Children note, dressing like a slut will not stop you from being ID'd.

So these 4 girls came in who looked borderline 15 were dressed in the smallest dresses I'd ever seen, fake tan, orange faces, monkey lips, everything. They wanted to see The Heat.

Me &gt; Sure, can I see some ID?

One presents ID, the rest haven't got any. She only turned 15  a month ago. Suspicious brows.

Me &gt; OK thank you, has anyone else got any?

Other 3 girls give blank stares, isn't 1 form of ID enough for all them? Wut no. They leave. 1 comes back with ID.

Notice that she only turned 15 5 days ago. Suspecting the other 2.

Me &gt; OK thanks, you and your friend can go in but I can't let the other 2 in without ID.

Remaining2 &gt; But we can't get any! Can't you just have our word? We can show you our facebook accounts!

Please note, facebook is not a legal form of ID.

Me &gt; No, I need ID or you can't see the film.


They leave and some middle aged woman with no bra and nipple-ons comes storming in asking for 4 teen tickets for this film. I ask who it's for as its an age restricted product.

NippleLady &gt; Well some woman won't let them in without ID and it's ridiculous so I'll buy their tickets instead!

Me &gt; That was me who ID'd them, I'm sorry but by law I can't let them in without proof of age.

NippleLady &gt; WELL LET ME SPEAK TO A MANAGER THEN THIS IS FUCKING RIDICULOUS.


Call out my manager, who is awesome and doesn't take shit from anybody. This lady had the look of 'If I speak to the manager she'll apologise and let my kids in'. Nope.jpeg.

NippleLady &gt; Hi, you're members of staff won't let my daughter or her friends in for a film without ID. I can vouch for them so can I please have 4 tickets for The Heat?

AwesomeManager &gt; I'm sorry, but without proof of age we  can't let them in. Once ID has been requested we need to see it by law. 15 rated films are treat the same as an 18 and age rated products -

This woman literally has stopped listening and loses her shit.

NippleLady &gt; THIS IS MY DAUGHTER AND HER FRIENDS. YOU THINK I WOULD LIE ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS?! WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS CINEMA. I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS KIND OF THING BEFORE.

M &gt; I can respect that you may know them but I don't know if you are actually related to her, we can let the girls in who have ID but we can't let anybody else in. There are plenty of other film options available.

NippleLady &gt; I want the name of YOUR manager NOW and I want your name written down I want to complain about you not doing your job.

M &gt; Certainly, my name is [managername] and I am the regional and general manager of this cinema. I run everything here, my name is also on the website along with a customer service number for complaints. All complaints from this region are forwarded to me.

Tonight about one minute before close a man walks in with a work order and says, ""I'm supposed to work on some displays in your store overnight.""

Me: I have no idea what you're talking about.

Man: (Shows me the work order- it says our store name, etc. and that's about it) Well it says here to report to store manager at this address.

Me: Let me call my manager.

I called my boss and got him up to speed. As expected there was no work to be done at our store. There has never been anyone there overnight except floor cleaners in the five years I've worked there. He tells me to get that man out of the store and make sure he's gone before we leave the building. I tell the man that it must be a mistake  and he leaves. He did so very agreeably.

He had nothing with him except that paper. No instructions on what he was doing, tools,  or any details whatsoever.  He walked to his car and just sat in it. He was there for over 20 minutes, during which he called the store and asked for me.
When I picked up the phone, no one was there.

It all felt wrong, so I called the police. He drove off about one minute after I called them. The officer told us to call again if he came back and that was that.

I just looked up the name of the company on his work order and it is a legit local contractor, so maybe it was a mistake. At any rate, I'm glad nothing happened.

Is this a thing people do to rob stores? It didn't occur to me at first, but I could see that trick working on a few people.

**TL;DR** I was potentially visited by a robber posing as retail contractor.Called the cops but he left before they arrived.

edit:tl;dr


**I will be back from work at about 6:30 PM eastern and I will let you know what I've found out (no smartphone so I can't update from work). My store manager wanted to handle everything and he hasn't gotten back to me yet, so I will find out when I get there in a few hours.  Thanks for the interest everyone. Even if it turns out to be nothing I think it's a good lesson in safety.**

**UPDATE**:The guy was legit, but was sent out for the job ONE MONTH EARLY  for some insane reason. He was just a temp worker that would have been assisting the actual contractor who would have had all the tools, instructions, and so on... which is why he had no idea what was going on. He was sitting in his car calling  his temp agency to see what was up and apparently they called him back when I went to pick up his call, which is why he didn't answer. He was innocent, but everything he said and did made him seem completely creepy.

The moral of the story: play it safe, folks. If it feels off to you, don't ignore that. Better safe than sorry.

About six months ago, we introduced a new rewards card, that you need to have in order to get our sale prices. It's also corporate policy that we don't have store cards available if customers don't want to sign up for one. For most customers, it isn't a problem, and they'll either sign up or just pay full price, but every once in awhile we get someone stubborn who demands to speak to a manager, who invariably tells them that there's nothing they can do. This usually shuts up the customer, who either pays or leaves. Usually.

Then, of course, there's this lady. An older woman, probably about 55 or so, she first came in a few months ago, about an hour before closing, and brought a pack of toilet paper, some chips, and a few other sundries up to my register. We chat normally as I ring up her items, then ask if she has a rewards card with us. ""I don't,"" she says. I tell her our store policy, and she just stares at me. After literally about 15 seconds of this, she asks me to get the manager. I do so.

He comes up, she asks him to override the policy. He explains that he can't, it's store policy, it only takes about a minute to sign up for a card, and she'll be able to use it every time she comes back in the future. She gives him the same 15 second stare, then says, ""this is price discrimination, and I'm going to call the police on you, and your anal retentive employee here [me].""

We both look at her in disbelieving shock, then both simultaneously try to explain that the police won't do anything, because there's nothing illegal going on. She cuts us off, and demands the name of the store's general manager, who we'll call Mary. My manager tells her, and tells her she'll be welcome to come in or call tomorrow and talk to Mary about our policy.

Not. Good. Enough. She demands Mary's home number so she can call her *right now* (nearly 10:00 PM by this point). My manager refuses, naturally. She demands it again. This goes on for an absurd amount of time, until before we know it, it's five minutes until closing time. Finally my manager throws up his hands and tells her that we need to close, so he'll price modify her purchase to the sale prices this once, but that she shouldn't expect to be able to do this again. I change the prices as she glares at me, then she pays, all of this in silence. She grabs her bags, and as she walks out the door, says, ""thank you SO MUCH for your help, you two. I'll make sure to call Mary tomorrow and let her know what a good job you did, being Nazis."" My manager and I both agree that we're going to close as quickly as possible and go to our respective homes to drink heavily.

Fast forward to the next weekend, and wouldn't you know it, about an hour before closing in walks the same customer. I recognize her immediately, and immediately call the manager on duty (a different one than last time) to warn him that his services are probably going to be needed. She walks up and pretends not to recognize me. I ring up her stuff, then with a mental sigh, ask her for her rewards card. She starts the 15 second stare, and halfway through, I say, ""why don't I just call the manager now and save us both the trouble."" Before she can answer, I grab the phone and page him up to the front. 

While we wait for him to come, she says, ""I don't understand why you're being so disrespectful. I hope you know that you're being extremely rude to me already, and I don't appreciate your terrible attitude."" As I bite off my retort, the manager comes, and since I've already briefed him, he knows what to expect. The lady goes through the same price discrimination spiel, the manager pulls out our store policy, which he had grabbed as soon as I had talked to him and quotes the relevant passages verbatim to her. Once again, this continues for an excruciatingly long time, as she drops Mary's name repeatedly and tells the manager that Mary had told her personally that she was allowed to be the one exception to the policy. My manager tells her in the most polite terms possible that this is clearly not true, she asks if he's calling her a liar, and so it continues. Finally, it once again is about five minutes 'til closing time, so he tells her that he's not playing games with her anymore, and she's not going to get the sale prices this time. She stands there, her mouth agape, and huffily decides to pay full price (about $0.75 more than the sale prices). Naturally, she can't leave without a parting shot, and tells us that we're both racists and generally scummy people, and that this time she's calling Mary *for real* to tell her about it. We just shake our heads.

Several months pass, and I don't see her again, until last weekend. Same deal - an hour before closing, she comes in. We have a new manager, and it's her first night ever closing alone. I call her and apologize profusely for what's about to happen, and I can hear her facepalm over the phone.

The customer comes up and, once again, pretends not to recognize me. I politely ring up her stuff, and ask her for her card. She gives me the stare. ""Look,"" I tell her, ""our policy hasn't changed since the last time you came in here. You can either sign up for the card, or pay full price."" She demands to see the manager. As a last-ditch effort, I tell her, ""Look, I'll call her, but seriously, nothing has changed. It's just going to waste the time of all three of us."" She gives me the stare again. I call the manager. Whatever.

As we wait for her to come up, she tells me, ""I think I'm starting to dislike you, *sir*."" I respond by telling her that she's disliked me for awhile now. She acts all offended, saying that she's never seen me before in her life. I remind her that she's called me an anal retentive scummy Nazi racist. She insists that I'm lying, and says that I have a terrible attitude (again). I tell her, with all the disdain I can inject into my voice, that I'm sorry she feels that way.

The manager comes up, and the customer launches into her usual routine. The manager cuts her off after about five minutes and tells her, ""Look, I just talked to Mary this morning. She mentioned you specifically as an example of how we can't change our policy. Further, you can't insult me and my employees here. So, you have three choices here: you can sign up for the card, you can pay full price, or you can leave. End of discussion."" She walks off.

The customer is left speechless. Finally, she mutters under her breath for a bit, then tells me that she'll sign up for the card. She gives me obviously fake information (like that her birthday is in 1999). Whatever, I don't care enough at this point to call her on it. I scan the card, and lo and behold, none of her items are on sale, meaning she saved no money at all. She's flabbergasted, and tries to argue, but I pull out our weekly ad and point out that none of her things are in it. I can't help but smirk at her, and she tells me that I've completely humiliated her, and she's going to complain about our entire store, from Mary down to me, to our CEO himself. She then storms out, and my manager immediately walks back up to the front from behind a shelf where she was observing, high-fives me, and tells me to go take an extra break because fuck that bitch.

I was at work a few days ago when I had some projects to do on the computer, where we do most of our ordering, prints for customers who can't make it into the store, and emailing. Anyway, I want the customers to know I am there when I am at the computer, so I usually turn the screen and my chair so my face faces the front so I can see when they walk up. In addition to this, I also move one of the signs we have sitting on the counter so I am fully visible. 

A woman walks up to the counter, and RIGHT before I was about to say hello and greet her, without taking a SECOND to see if someone is here, she turns around and SCREAMS...""EXCUUUUSE MEEE?!?????"" towards the front. I was like ""Woah! Ma'am, I'm right here.."" And she was like ""oh."" Like it's necessary to scream throughout the whole store to the front to get someone to the back of the store (walk up to the front, why do you have to SCREAM?) Anyways, she was a horrible customer to help.

She brings me a 250 page booklet and wants me to print 6 copies. Okay, no big deal, that's 1500 copies, I will have her come back in an hour. This is how the conversation went.

Me: okay ma'am I have started your copies, and can I have your phone number to call you when it's done?
Her: no I want it right now.
Me: You want 6 copies, of this very large booklet, it will take some time but you can wait if you'd like.
Her: of course I will wait, where are your chairs at!?
Me: In the furniture section, at the front...
Her: I WILL WAIT THERE THEN.

She then sat in a chair up front and STARED at me until I told her she was all set. She came to pay for it and said, ""oh I have another thing."" ...At this point I am like okay, fine, what could be worse? She hands me a paper with typed information on it, and wants me to change the information on it. The only way I could do this, is if I photoshop it and try to match the font (because she had a hard copy, not a digital one) and to do this, we have to charge a little over a dollar per minute and she has to sit and wait again. When I told her this she said ""IT WILL ONLY TAKE 30 SECONDS WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"" I told her this was the policy and that's what happens when you have a hard copy. 

She stormed off and while she was walking away she said she would take it to our competitor store. Luckily I have connections there as well and I called and asked them if they did her service for her, which they told me they could not.

I have five items so I make my way to the Express Lane. A woman with a huge cart piled *HIGH* with food appears suddenly, like a wild Pokemon, from one of the aisles and makes it to the Express Lane before me.


*The Express Lane.* Twelve items or less lane. With a full sized cart. She must have had over a hundred items! It's not like there weren't other lanes open. Lanes with baggers and conveyor belts for carts such as hers. But *NO*. Instead she picks the Express Lane, with its tiny counter for placing your purchases and no belt and only room to bag items *one bag at a time*. 


I move over to the full size lane *that was open and right there* because I don't have twenty minutes to just stand there waiting for this woman to finish putting the poor express lane cashier through hell. My cashier in the full size lane, a really sweet women who is normally right on top of cheerfully greeting me, is busy just *staring daggers* at this woman.  The woman is acting totally oblivious to her social etiquette massacre, casually flipping through a copy of US weekly while her children scurry to unload the cart.


""Ma'am,"" she says, ""It will be much faster for you if you use a full size lane.""


""Oh, it's fine. You already have a line,"" the woman says, like her choice makes perfect sense and is totally logical and not at all an inconvenience for everyone. It's true about the line, though. Upon seeing the woman with the gigantic cart the other patrons have all chosen to file in behind me. The Express Lane cashier looks extremely flustered by this point. Clearly pissed, my cashier turns to me and we go through the normal pleasantries.


As I'm accepting my change from her, I see that the laborious process of partially unloading the cart and bagging items one bag at a time has only just begun. I can't resist commenting at this point, ""People like that should be tarred and feathered.""

A few months ago, they changed the register system. Instead of the employee just ignoring the ""e-receipt?"" prompt, now the customer has to choose from three buttons: printed, emailed, or printed AND emailed. What a concept! 

But you'd think this is quantum string theory to these people. 80% of the time, I just say it out loud for them: ""Do you want me to print or email your receipt?"" Every single time, they reply ""Yes."" So then I reach over to the pinpad and push the Printed button for them and they just say ""Oh."" That's not what frustrates me.

What's frustrating is the other 20% of the time. If a customer has been rude to me somehow, I'll just let the prompt stay there without asking them verbally. Most of the time, they read the prompt and just ignore it like I did something wrong. They'll just start staring up at the ceiling or twiddling their new staples or something. 

But some customers will read the prompt and get really angry. ""I DON'T WANT NO DAMN EMAILS. WHAT DO I PUSH. I'M NOT GIVING YOU MY EMAIL ADDRESS!"" So I just tell them to push Printed. ""But then you're gonna have my email!"" Yes, because I magically have access to your email address based on your finger print. 

And then there are the customers who will tell me ""Oh, I get enough email! I don't need more spam!"" I hear this at least ten times a day, and they expect me to smile or laugh every time, like the whole ""WELP MUST BE FREE"" bit.
I know a ton of stores do the whole emailed receipt thing now. Why is this so difficult for customers to understand?

I lived in a not so great part of town that only had one 24/7/365 gas station for miles, so needless to say, I frequented that place. I kept on running into the owner there in the middle of the night so eventually I asked him why in the world an owner would work overnights. He told me that he couldn't find anyone willing to work overnight that didn't rob him blind with free smokes, blunts, candy/snack and drinks (beer mostly). I offered my services up and told him a little about myself, the next night I started with a promise to him I would work EVERY night shift for him from then on. He paid me well and with the 16 hours of OT every week, it was a great opportunity for me. Within the first month his loss went down over 80% he claimed, I was proud of that and he compensated me well.

So one fine evening I was really slow, it was probably about 2am or so and during the week there really wasn't much activity from 2-4am. I'm standing outside having a smoke when I notice a very large black guy riding a small girls bicycle in my direction. It had the pink streamers on the handlebars and everything, even a bright pink banana seat. It made me laugh at the mere sight of it, but I figured he would be coming into the store to buy something so I went in and went behind the counter. When he got there, he came in and looked at me and said, ""I'M ALL ABOUT DAT MONEY!"" He was pretty scary looking to younger me, a guy about a foot taller and easily 100 pounds heavier, with about 0% body fat. This guy was pure muscle, you could see the definition in his arms along with some veins considering he was wearing a plain white wife beater. Instantly though, I could tell he was coming down off a crack binge (sweaty as hell when it wasn't that hot out, eyes darting all over, mouth and tongue making erratic movements and kinda foaming a bit), so I figured what the hell, let's have some fun. So I told him, ""So am I man! That's what they pay me for, to watch over the money at night!"" He said, ""NO NO NO, YOU DON'T GET IT MAN. I'M ALL ABOUT DAT MONEY!"" I said, ""Me too man, I just told you that's what I'm paid for. To collect and count the money for the owner!"" This went on for about 2-3 minutes, us going back and forth telling each other how we were all about DAT MONEY. Eventually, he just said, ""AW SHIT, NEVERMIND MAN."" And then he left.

That's when it hit me. That bastard was trying to rob me! So I went out to my car after scanning the parking lot for him (and noticing he was riding off on that cute pink bike) and grabbed my trusty .380 from under the seat. I put it in the small of my back and covered it with my shirt and headed back inside. When I got close to the door I heard, ""HEY! HEY MAN!"" so I turned around and there he was again about 20 feet from me. I hurried inside and behind the counter where I put the gun on a ledge under the counter and kept my hand close to it. He comes in the store and says, ""DID YOU CALL DEM BOYS?!"" So I played dumb and said, ""What boys man? What is wrong with you?"" He said, ""DA PO LICE, DID YOU CALL EM?!"" I just looked at him and said, ""Why the hell would I call the police?"" That's when he said, ""Well I wanted da money and you wouldn't give it up so I figgaed you called dem boys on me."" I just looked at him and said, ""Seriously, you were trying to rob me? I didn't even realize."" The next thing shocked the shit out of me because by now I was trying to deal with the fact that I would probably have to shoot someone that night, and I really didn't want to. ""I'm sorry man, I just need to get like $20 or so, I REALLY NEED IT."" I told him I was sorry that I couldn't help him out with any money, but if he wanted someone to chill with while he came down, I would sit and talk with him. He said ok, as long as I didn't call the cops or shoot him (apparently he noticed me getting my gun). So I left the gun in the store and sat outside with him smoking cigarettes until the urge for more crack wore off. During that time, he kept on apologizing to me telling me he wasn't like that at all when he was sober and he regretted even trying. Although he was shocked that it didn't work. At one point he asked me why I wasn't scared of him when he first came in, according to him he ""could have had a gun."" I told him it was very unlikely that he had a gun because he smokes crack. He looked confused and asked what I meant by that, so I explained to him, ""If you had a gun at some point, you would have traded it for more crack to your dealer instead of using it to rob someone."" Eventually he told me he was feeling better and not fiending for more crack, he hopped on that pink girls bicycle and rode off into the night. I never called the cops or told my boss, and I never saw him again.

Anyway, as I've said before, I work at a pet store. I was covering someone in petcare for their lunch when an older lady and who I assumed to be her very young granddaughter came over to our fish wall. The grandma explained they were in for some comets to go in their pond, so I grabbed my gear and set up to catch ten large comets. 

Now, I'm pretty aggressively childfree, but I have no problem with well-behaved kids. Since the granddaughter was being so polite, I waved her over and told her to pick out the fish. If you've never seen comet tanks in a large retail setting, imagine a twenty gallon tank with hundreds of goldfish inside. It can be a pain in the ass to catch specific fish in a tank so full, but it wasn't busy so I didn't care. She picked some really nice ones with great color and long, gorgeous fins. One in particular was an almost-calico with fins for miles that was one of my favorites. After she had picked the fish, I bagged them up and did my little ""make the kids promise to take care of their fish"" shtick— ""Okay, do you promise to feed your fish so it grows big and strong? Promise to love it and keep it safe forever? Cross your heart, pinky swear?"" etc. It's corny, but these damn kids just eat it up, I tell you. 

 I handed off the fish and sent the two on their merry way. All of a sudden, the little girl comes running back, grandma in tow. 

""What your name?"" she asked me. 

""I'm alpha_orionis,"" I told her. 

She pointed at the pretty calico fish in the bag and said, ""I call this one alpha_owionis.""

A friend of mine worked in a record store.  Really records- this happened before cds!

He was a music education major in about to start his final semester.  A man came in asking for a particular album, and my buddy told him, ""If you like that kind of thing, check this out....""  He showed him other music based on his taste.  This one has the same horn section- this one has the same producer, this one sounds similar.  But, the guy walked out with 10 albums.

A week later, the man returns.  He tells my buddy he owns a small computer company.  Small computers for offices are a pretty new thing.  He explains even if he hires people with computer degrees, they don't know these products.  He has to train everyone, and he's always looking for smart people.  

So, he makes my buddy an offer: he'll make more his first year than a music teacher would make after ten.  And he doesn't have to finish his degree.

So this got my buddy into computer support on the ground level.  He eventually went to work for IBM and he retired with a nice severance a couple of years ago- and went right back and finished his music degree and is an assistant director at his local HS.  

Another bonus about going back to school after 25 years is some of his friends are now college music directors.  He's on a full scholarship for his master's degree since he had been college roommates with a university department head.

She talks for 15 minutes straight, but finally gives me some measurements to get working with.  Would those be rough opening or frame sizes ma'am?  She says, ""Oh, I don't know the difference.""

FML.  She wants to purchase her windows today, without her contractors looking them over, and has no idea how to measure for windows.  While in the process of explaining how to measure for a window, 1:30 rolls around.  I ask her permission to call my co-worker and ride, and ask him to wait.  Then she breaks out this classic line.

""Aw, am I interrupting your wunch?""  Like a little kid, *wunch*.  I just wanted to beat her senseless.

""No ma'am, you're not interrupting my *lunch*, I've been here since five o'clock in the morning, and so has the gentleman who's giving me a ride home today.""

The kicker was that this didn't bother her in the least.  She blew another half-hour of my time bitching non-stop that she ""priced these windows out for less"" on a mysterious website that wasn't my company's, nor the company who makes the windows, didn't have printouts, and wanted me to price match.  Haha, no way in hell sweet cheeks.

Finally 2 PM rolls around, we've finally gotten a rough quote of what she needs, and now she wants to pay.  No.  Just no.  Take this paper to your *contractor* you vapid whore, and make sure these will fit.

What I actually said was, ""Unfortunately I must leave now, but what I'd like to do is have your contractor go over these sizes this afternoon, and tomorrow morning I'll also have another go at the quote to see if we can't do something a little less expensive.""  Of course the ""less expensive"" bit got her, and she toddled off with her quote.

Just needed to get it off my chest.  So looking forward to tomorrow.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_18d15o,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/18d15o/aw_am_i_interrupting_your_wunch/,

I had to deny a promotion last month because I couldn't guarantee a specific date to be back by from my knee surgery, and the promotion was instead given to a girl I was friendly with. We're about the same age, have a similar sense of humor, and our main difference is that I work really hard, and she chats with everybody. She's friendly enough, just kinda lazy. I congratulated her when she got the promotion, which is basically like being a demi-supervisor (effectively, she got keys to the door and register... that's about it).

She has now become a monster.

Because I know how to run all of the systems and do almost every job, no one really tells me what to do, because it's probably already done. She has taken to finding me and telling me to go do things that fall under one of the following: 1) don't need to be done; 2) physically can't be done by me (again, just got back from knee surgery); or 3) are in no way my job, and the person's job that it is is present. And she doesn't ask, oh no, she *demands*. And, to be clear, she has absolutely no authority over me. None.

Let me set up a scenario for you: I was working on a floorset project, and in the middle of it she walks up and says, ""Go clean the break table.""

Me: If I have time after I finish my work, then I'll look at it.

Her: No, I said go clean it *now*!

Me: No.

Her: You know I can write you up!? Don't disrespect me!

Me: You can suggest a write up... and the GM wouldn't approve it, so you can get over that idea right now.

Her: Did you hear me!? I said go clean the break table or you're getting written up!

Me: No. It's not my job, you and three other people are here, and it's ya'll's job. You go do it.

Her: Are you trying to push me around!? That's it, you're getting written up!

Me: Go for it.

At that point she grabbed an armful of the stuff I had just set up and stormed off... super mature. About 30 minutes later she comes back, again, in the middle of me doing my actual job:

Her: That break table is still a mess! Get your ass in there and clean it!

Me: I told you no. Unless you are going to turn me into a puppet, get out of my face. I'm not doing it.

Her: *screaming* Do it now!

Me: No...

Her: You're getting written up again!

Me: Go for it...

After that she came over to harass me one more time, at which point I threatened to call the GM about it (this was at 6am...), and she finally let it be. When I happened to go back into the break room, the table was covered with boxes marked for upstock, which is 13' in the air. Remember when I said *knee surgery*... you expect me to climb a ladder with a box on my shoulder? Pft. So, for her sake, I took all the boxes off of the break table, and, in a very passive-aggressive maneuver, stacked them in front of her preferred computer in the back. Whoops. Break table is clean.

That was yesterday, today a friend and I went shopping, and I bought several Christmas gifts. Unfortunately, she was the only person with keys available to ring me, and after being told they were Christmas gifts and handed a list of the skus, she proceeded to rip open every box and the tissue (I don't mean open normally, I mean shredded cardboard and paper), then jam it all (everything I bought was glass) into a single bag with no padding. Fuck that. I left it sitting right there, took my receipt, walked into the back, and got the exact same things I'd just purchased, put them nicely into a bag with proper padding, then found the ASM and verified the receipts to the items in the bag. I got a text 15 minutes ago: she called the DM and LP and accused me of theft. AFTER a manager verified my purchase because she destroyed the first set.

If you're that intimidated because you got the promotion someone else had to pass on, then those keys are better off in your colon than in your hand. Bitch.

**Update:** There was a meeting held with the DM, the manager who checked me, the GM, and the demi-manager (which I was supposed to attend, but other circumstances prevented it). The DM informed me that I didn't do anything against policy and to be ""more conscientious of how things might look in the future"". According to the manager that checked me, the demi-manager received a write up and was apparently left alone with the DM and GM for about ten minutes, which means there's a pretty good chance she was chewed out the whole time. As far as I know she still has keys, but even if she changes her behavior now, I'm willing to bet they take them away after the holidays.

Saturday, the day before yesterday, was particularly busy; even for a Saturday at a liquor store. I was about 7 and a half hours into a 9 hour shift, and had not yet had time to eat lunch or use the restroom; I had just been too busy. By this time I desperately needed to void my bladder. There's a slight lull in the store, so I take the opportunity and am moving toward our restrooms at the quickest speed I can muster while still maintaining an air of professionalism. A man calls out 

""Excuse me! Miss!""

""I'll be with you in a moment, sir,"" and I walk into the bathroom. Ours is not a single toilet water-closet, we have four stalls and a couple sinks; I couldn't lock the door behind me. I didn't even make it into a stall before the man walks into the bathroom behind me. The woman washing her hands at the sink, a regular of ours, stops moving and just stares at him in the mirror. 

""Miss! I need your help picking a wine out for dinner tonight. We're having chicken.""

""As I told you, sir, I will be with you in a moment."" 

""Ok.""

And he stood there. Expectantly. The woman is still standing there, her hands under the running water, not moving, just staring at him. 

I try to remain calm as I say ""Sir, if you could wait outside, please?""

""What?""

All of a sudden the woman at the sink slams the water off, turns around and says ""Dude, get the fuck out of the ladies room and find someone else to help you!""

At this point it seems to dawn on him that he's crossed a line and he makes a hasty exit. I turn to thank her and she says ""I tried to work retail once, but I couldn't handle assholes like that. How long before you start... med school, wasn't it?"" ""Yes, ma'am. Too long."" ""Yeah, I hear ya. Good luck, sweetie,"" and she walked out.

An angry customer I actually enjoyed helping.",skunkhairjones,450,76,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1foe5n/if_it_could_go_wrong_it_went_wrong_an_angry/,"One of the things we install for customers is flooring. The process is pretty simple: get measured, build quote, pay, carpet is ordered and shipped to the installers, installers schedule install. Done. One of the key components to ensure nothing goes wrong is great follow up and communication with the customers. I was always confident my team did an excellent job of doing just that.

So, a customer had just gotten measured and paid for a pretty large order for a home. He's being stationed here in the D.C. area and needed the carpet installed by a certain day before the movers arrived. We charge for furniture moving so he saved several hundred dollars by having no furniture. Well, between the measure time and the sold time he decided to remove a 4ft wall that divided the room thinking it would have no impact on how the carpet is installed. Unfortunately, it did have a big impact on how the carpet is laid and how much is needed. We had to cancel his original order and for liability and warranty reasons we had to remeasure. Now his install date is pushed back closer to his deadline. 

Carpet is reordered and two days later the carpet mill informs us because of the substantial size they didn't have enough carpet from one single dye-lot. They would have to obtain it from a mill further west. Again, delaying the install date. Only this time it pushed the install date past the date his furniture and rest of his family arrived. Apologizing profusely, I checked daily for the status of his carpet and would keep him updated. He was understandably upset and wasn't sure if he should postpone his movers. He couldn't postpone his family arriving though. It was cool, because he was angry and I guess he had hard time channeling it because he knew it wasn't our fault. He remained calm and understanding the entire time.

Fast forward a week and his carpet is on track to ship as expected. That is until the mid-west got slammed with super blizzards, right where the carpet mill is located. Trucks couldn't get in or out. At this point I really don't know what to do, completely afraid this guy is going to go completely livid. I can't contact anyone at the mill because they shut it down due to weather. I finally give the customer a call and explain the situation. He laughs, like he has just gone insane. He explains to me he had to pay a fee to postpone his movers and isn't going to postpone them again. His family is currently sleeping on air mattresses. He is extremely angry, but tells me he knows it's not mine or my store's fault. Everyone at the store has been helpful as could be and he just has shitty luck. 

It's really these types of customers I go completely out of my way for. I feel bad, they understand that not everything is the store's or the employee's fault. The entire time he hasn't asked for any compensation, because he feels he hasn't been wronged by the store. 

Finally, his carpet is dug out of the snow and is headed to the installers. Typically an install date isn't scheduled until the installers have the carpet, but I tried to pull some strings with our installers to get it done as soon as possible. It was a busy season and the installers couldn't fit him anywhere because of the scope of his job. It would require another customer canceling or voluntarily rescheduling their install date. 

I pleaded to the installer supervisor and explained the situation the customer has already been through with his family and movers. He said he would see what he could do. Three days until the movers arrive I'm already talking with management on offering compensation even though he hasn't asked for any. I get a call from the installers, he had called up a few customers who he had felt were flexible with the install date and actually asked if they would be willing to reschedule to accommodate my customer. 

The stars were aligning. His carpet was scheduled to arrive to the installers that day, the newly opened slot could get him installed the next day, and his movers would arrive on the third. 

After all that happened he praised me and my team for being diligent on his order. He never felt abandoned by the store. 

We ended up discounting his order the fees he paid the movers for postponing in addition to several hundred dollars off of his carpet for the delays. And the install went smoothly, his family only had to endure a 5 days of sleeping on air mattresses. I felt pretty accomplished.

So dancer number one finally decides to approach my till. He shuffles for a few seconds, points at me, then asks ""are you serving?"". I'm not totally sure what people think I stand behind my till for, if it's not for serving, so usually this question is met with a condescending ""yes"".

The pharmacy now closes (and has for a few years) at 10pm, and the store closes at 11pm. On the weekends, the pharmacy closes at 6pm.

This guy wandered in tonight at about 9:30 and headed right for the pharmacy. I figured he was one of the many in need of cold medicine. I go about my business, setting up the new ad flyers and suggestive sell candies, when I hear from the back: ""HELLLLLOOOOOOO!"" and knocking on the window to the pharmacy. Because, clearly, when the lights in there are off and the window gate is down, someone must be in there playing hide and go seek.

It was about 10:30 at night, closing time an eternal half hour away, and just me on cash register while my manager is cleaning the floors. Two teenagers, probably 16 or 17 years old, come in and start walking around. As they head towards the liquors section the manager starts to follow them. He stops one of them and asks if he can be of any help (obviously trying to scare them off). The kid says no and starts to walk away. He leaves empty handed.
Meanwhile, the other kid has grabbed a handle (1.75L) of rum and is heading towards my register. As he turns the corner he breaks into a dead sprint, throws something at me, bursts out the door, and jumps into an idling car that quickly pulls away. As I begin to comprehend what has happened I look at my counter and see that his projectile was actually $30 cash, covering the rum he took and leaving me a nice little tip. 

Since the boys didn’t actually steal anything we decided not to call the cops or tell the owners what had happened and finished off the night as uneventfully as ever.

I love this subreddit, and even though I’ve only been in retail a short time now, I finally have my own story worth sharing after all my lurking.

During the week I work on a university campus from nine to five, and pickup extra shifts at a burger place on the weekends. It’s not a fast food joint; we cook everything to order and use better quality ingredients. The food’s comparable to that place with the specific number of guys. I work the register for extra rent money.

Anyway, after work on the weekdays, I usually stop by the restaurant to grab some delicious employee-discounted dinner. So I stop by, say “hi” to the gang, place my usual order and grab a seat by the TV. One of the cashiers for today is late so it’s just the Shift Manager (SM) working the front. Normally things aren’t busy around now so this isn’t a problem. Then right after I place my order a small rush happens. I think to myself, “Well, that’s not fun for SM but we need the business on weekdays.” and go back to pretending I care about baseball.

“Excuse me!” in that tone of voice that is 100% command.

Now, my first thought on hearing that is that someone’s getting impatient with being third in line, so I turn around to find myself staring into the eyes of one very pissed off woman. A little confused I ask, “Um, is something wrong?”
Her: “Yeah something’s wrong! You’re sitting here on your ass instead of doing your job! There are people her waiting so quit doing nothing on your little break and take my order!”

About now is when I recognize this woman. I’d taken her order before, I made a mistake and she’d stared daggers at me while I got it fixed for her. Suffice it to say I stick out from the rest of the cashiers so she can probably recognize me even if I’m not wearing any part of my uniform. My guess is she remembered me and can hold a grudge.

Me: “Uh, ma’am, I’m not working today. I actually can’t use the register. If you just wait a few minutes SM can take care of you.”

Apparently, she did not like this answer, because she spent the next three minutes berating me for being a lazy fatass (I’m 5’10” and weight 125 lbs, so I found this a perplexing insult) and how the food here was too expensive and she should be treated much better as a customer and she would make sure I was fired for this and on and on you know this song and dance by now.

Meanwhile SM is finishing with a customer while hearing everything she’s spewing and I can just see him getting stone-faced trying to contain his anger. You see, SM is a bro. Not the kind of bro you normally think of, he’s a guy who honestly believes in brotherhood. Around this time, my order pops up in the sell window so he politely asks the next customer to hold on for a second so he can deliver it.

SM walks over and puts the bag on my table, “Here’s your order sir. Thanks for being patient. Is this woman bothering you?”

Me: “Yeah, just a little.”

Her: “WHAT! DON’T YOU JUST-”

SM: “Ma’am, you’ve been harassing our customers and I’m going to ask you to leave. If you continue being disruptive to our patrons or staff I will call the police.""

She looked about ready to start another tirade, but thankfully decided to leave in the huffiest of ways she could.

Me and SM watch her leave and proceed to give the customary nods and fist-bumps of solidarity.

tl;dr: Go to my workplace to get dinner; woman was very angry that I would not ring up her order, despite not being on the clock. Awesome shift manager throws her out. Onion rings taste better with justice.

The fun just doesn't stop, oh boy. After getting fired that night we didn't see from him again, and then during morning shift he appears wearing his uniform (which wasn't even done properly as he was missing his tie and wore sandals) and goes up to our register. He can't login, and starts asking why he can't login.

My co-worker and I just look at him like he's gone crazy. My co-worker whispers we should call Police he may be planning to go postal. I pull Ex-new guy aside and ask him, why on gods green Earth would he come back here after he was fired for stealing from the register. EX-New guy tells me ""Ah, I still had shifts for this week. Dave didn't say anything about those shifts. I'm just assuming I can finish out my week and I'll get a paycheck and maybe they'll give me a second chance"". My co-worker and I start laughing, this is some kind of prank, it has to be. 

Co-worker tells me we should call Dave, our department manager and get rid of him. I agreed with that motion, and so I called up Dave. Dave is not happy with what we said, he thinks we're screwing with him,  ""Boys I tell you what if he's not there, then there will be hell to pay"" dave said. We try to tell Ex-new guy Dave is on his way to our department and he isn't going to be happy to see New guy.

Meanwhile new guy roams off to start folding clothes. Dave arrives and he isn;t happy, ""Where is he?"", he shouts. Mike, my co-worker who can barely contain his laughter says he doesn't know anything and it was all my responsibility. Dave turns his attention to me, ""You said he was here. Where is he?"", I tell Dave that the new guy went off to fold clothes because he couldn't login. He thinks he isn't fired. Dave turns around and there's new guy by the coat dress shirts putting everything out and putting them up in the wrong fucking order.

Dave, walks over to new guy and grabs him by the shoulder. Mike is struggling not laugh, and I'm just shaking my head as I will no doubt get blamed for this. Dave doesn't drag New guy off to his office, no he publicly humiliates the poor guy ""You were FIRED. You stole from the register, I made this perfectly clear you were not to set foot in this store again in exchange for me not pressing charges. Obviously you didn't care because now I'm going to call Police. Come with me to my office NOW!"", all the while new guy is crying and begging him to give him a second chance.  

That's the last we see of him for awhile. Another manager comes over and tells us to go over and clean up the dress shirts. As we're cleaning up the shirts and the mess that guy made (serious how can 1 guy in just 8 minutes ruin an entire rack row of clothes?) we watch as the police enter the store and head to the offices.

1375979990.0,370,self.TalesFromRetail,1jyqml,"""You're showing a real lack of commitment to this company.""",blab70,432,62,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1jyqml/youre_showing_a_real_lack_of_commitment_to_this/,"First time posting, hope I do this correctly.

My first job was working as a sales associate in one of those big nationwide stores that sell almost everything. Now by sales associate, I should really say I was the store bitch. I got hired a few months after my 16th birthday to work the products part of the floor. Over the next year and a half I worked in literally every single department possible. This included:

Clothing, Electronics, Food Alley, Registers, Customer Service, Cart Attendant, Returns, and Back Room (despite the fact I was not 18). I never complained and never had a problem going where I was asked.

Then my yearly review came up for my raise... My maximum potential raise would be 25 cents, not much but still exciting for a new person in the work force. What I didn't realize was that all those times covering shifts, coming in early, NEVER (repeat never calling out), etc would not mean jack when it came to my raise.

Out of a possible 25, I got 4 cents. Yes, 4 cents. The reasoning being that I was often ""all over the place and unable to focus on my task at hand."" The examples they gave me were that when an extra cashier was needed and no one answered the call over the radio, me asking if they needed me to come down followed by an answer of ""yes"" meant I was doing the wrong thing. Go figure.

Despite all these BS I kept working there (later found out the stoner kid at electronics got a 24 cent raises despite the fact he called out all the time and would take breaks 3x as long as required). Then school came around for my senior year and I joined cross country as a means of trying to get into better shape, so I worked less as a result, often only getting 8 hours a week.

Then, a month or so after the stock market crash and the recession began I got called into my HR manager's office. He explained to me that he asked me if I would be willing to work at least 25 hours a week (still in high school, doing sports at the time, and had a girlfriend at the time so I was already stretching it when it came to my availability). I told him no, then this happened.

""Well, I'm sorry to say but we are doing to have to let you go then.""

""What? Why?""

""You aren't willing to work as much as we need you to, it isn't worth putting you on the payroll. Friday (this happened on a monday) will be your last day.""

I took it in stride, left after my shift was over and applied at another place a bunch of my friends worked at and got hired with a higher starting wage within 2 days. I went in on thursday to tell the HR guy as much.

""Hey, no hard feelings. I already found a new job so I'll be okay, thanks again for everything, (he was a nice guy to me before this all). I start my new job tomorrow so I obviously won't be able to work my shift here.""

He looks up at me as if I just took a shit on his desk and called his mother a whore.

""You what!? You're kidding right?""

""No, why would I be?

""XXXXX you're showing a real lack of commitment to this company. This is incredibly unprofessional of you, when someone puts in their two weeks notice they don't-""

I snapped, tired of his bullshit.

""MY two weeks notice!? You're the asshole who fired a high school kid for not working more hours which would only make me end up working here for the rest of my life and you think I'm unprofessional? Fuck you.""

Stunned, he just stared at me, mouth wide open. At this point a crowd had gathered outside his door.

""I think you should leave""

""I think I should, all this bullshit is making me lightheaded.""

I left, and never went back. I just graduated college and started a paid internship in the field I studied, I later found out the HR guy was transferred to a different store and was fired about a year ago.

TL;DR: Worked my ass off, company didn't give a shit and gave me a horrible raise. When economy slowed down, they asked me to work WAY too many hours despite being in high school, let me go as a result. I got a better job and the HR guy freaked when I told him I couldn't work my last shift.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1jyqml,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1jyqml/youre_showing_a_real_lack_of_commitment_to_this/,

#1 **Backgound:** Ok so, one of these stories comes from the 5 years I worked a college IT Help Desk. I put this here instead of TFTS because the majority of what I did involved people and making sure they could access the campus wifi, nothing ""tech heavy."" Anyway, this story sticks out the most because I'd been the student supervisor for 4 years at that point and my sarcasm level had risen every year. I'd dealt with every college stereotype possible but my favorite were the freshman ""Brosephs"" mainly because they were nice guys under it all and fun to mess with.

My help desk comrade and I were just getting settled when in walks the bro, think as stereotypical as you can and you have him perfect.

**BRO:** *Hey bro, can I get wifi?*

**ME:** *Sure, open your laptop for me.*

He opens it toward me and I take it out of sleep mode and almost choke on my tongue. His desktop is a picture of a well known porn star with her legs spread, one hand at ground zero and the other in her mouth. Now my compatriot and I had a tally going of how many times this had happened. Our current total was up to 200. I smile and say...

**ME:** *Hey man, can you change your background pic for me?*

**BRO:** *Why? It's a pic of my car.*

**ME:** with a smirk and in a whisper *No, it's not. It's a porn star's vagina....*

He very quickly turned bright red and changed the picture.

**ME:** *Don't stress it, you're not the first. How about we set you up with a good anti-virus while you're here?*

I still laugh about it because he was very sweet and I'm sure I look like an asshole but really, change your background before you take in your computer.

#2 **Background:** I mentioned before I worked for a library, this takes place there. This is word for word.

I'm working Tech (public computers) at this point and I'm on the floor doing my walk around and helping patrons. Now I'd made a lot of friends in security because they are my main defense should someone decide to get in my face. We also had three rotating Deputies who were all awesome. Both my favorite Deputy and security officer are on duty at the Tech Center, so I'm happy.

It's important to point out that I'd started losing weight and was down about 20lbs. Getting hit on by the public happens, cheesy pick up lines the whole thing. If you're a woman with curves, it happens daily. Thankfully I used to bounce at a bar so I can handle myself. I'm helping a man in a fur coat. He thinks he's a pimp and I cannot stand helping him, because he's like a greasy car salesman and you want to shower when you meet him. I've finished helping him with his email and am about to leave his computer...

We'll call him Pimp in a Fur Coat (PFC)

**PFC:** *Shorty, Shorty, I got a question for you.*

**ME:** *Sure, PFC what's the question* (I'm always polite)

**PFC:** *I been want'en to know, you half black? Cuz you got youself a fine ass that makes me want to put somfin in ya.*

I'm a little stunned because usually PFC is politely creepy.

**ME:** *PFC, that is a very inappropriate comment and I don't appreciate it.!* 

I move to walk away. He then makes his mistake, he touches me on my waist. I'm a pretty easy going person, but people do NOT touch me without my permission and not so intimately, he's going to die.

**PFC:** *Now, shorty I'm jus sayin you is a fine lady and I like'em fat.*  Yeah, he called me fat.

**ME:** I get real close to his face *PFC, I am not half black I'm native american, I do NOT want you to put anything in me and do you see those two men looking at us over there? If you do not remove your hand and leave this building NOW I will press charges for harassment, they will cuff you and take you to the pokey. I don't think your parole officer will look to kindly on harassing a librarian, do you?* 

He got up and left in a hurry. When I got back to the main desk both deputy and security are doubled over in tears.

**Deputy** *I don't know what you said, but a look of sheer terror crossed his face. He looked like you had him by the balls!*

**Security** *Yeah, we were ready to rush over until, deputy here saw a murder look cross your face and we knew it was going to be good!*


Sorry for the wall of text, but I had to share.

""your staff member showed my child the surprise i was buying her, and now her birthday is ruined!"". i glance at her purchase, a massive 50x50x10cm lego box. i'm used to customers being a little slow on retail policies, sure. but, this? surely she's joking. or confused. or drunk. drunk's most likely. i look to her husband: surely he must realise the absurdity of his wife's actions. shopping with the kid present? i expect some embaressed/apologetic eye-roll or something. but, no: he's by her side, glaring at my staff and myself.

""sorry, i've obviously came in half-way through this. tell me if i have this wrong, please. you came shopping for a gift for your daughter?""

""yes. i said that.""

"".. while she and your husband are by your side.""

""i needed his input to decide on a gift, she is his child as well, after all!""

i'm stunned for a moment. it's been weeks since i had such an absurd customer. these people are serious. until now i thought they might have been joking.

""i'm not sure if you realised, but the center has a child's play area past the cafe around the corner. it's supervised, and has space for parents to sit and talk, make mobile calls to others while the shop and such."". i try to hint at it without making myself sound snarkingly obvious, waiting for the coin to drop, that moment of ""oh i'm and idiot customer, sorry"" clarity.

but, nope. nothing. i sigh inward and smile to my staff member, and she knows to back away and let me deal with it. the customers either expect me to lie to their daughter and keep the toy until she leaves, or give them some gift card as ""compensation for the hardship"" they feel entitled to. i look over to the daughter, she looks like a nice enough girl, staring back at me. i hate lying to kids because of their parents, and i force a smile, when i'd rather glare at her parents. ""i'm sorry lass, but this toy has to stay in the store with me. your dad's going to take you outside for a bit, while mum stays with me and tries to fix things.""

the daughter winks at me with a smile, and then quickly frowns and shrugs her shoulders with a small whine. ""ok.. dad, let's go wait for mum.""

coolest. fucking. kid. ever. i can't help but smile back at her as she takes her dad's hand and leads him out.

once they leave, i finish off the mum's sale and wrap it in a bag. she leaves with a huff, and my staff makes a ""up yours"" gesture behind her back as she walks off. satisfied with the outcome, we get back to work.

i know that sometimes it's unavoidable that you'll be ""parenting"" your children while simultaneously required to buy them a surprise gift for future use. but.

if you're shopping with your significant other, how about next time you have them take your child off for a stroll/snack/distraction while you shop? just an idea.

First poster from a lurker, please be kind.

On this day I was working on the cash registers. I'd been there for about three or four hours, and as I'd walked in, there'd been this homeless guy begging out the front of the centre. In my state, begging is illegal, the police are called, you have to move on. They're not usually charged or anything, just forced to move away. This guy is fairly regular - I work and live in the somewhat seedy side of my city, and I'd seen him around before. He'd hold up a small cardboard sign and sit slumped on the cement in the cold. It was sad, but I'd never personally given him money.

So this day he walks into the supermarket. Not unusual, he'd sometimes buy smokes or some noodles with the money he'd begged. Everyone else was serving so he came down to my register. The usual, 'How are you today?' and he asked for cigarettes. I turn back, smokes in hand, when he pulls out of his big jacket bundles of coin. Anyone else on this thread knows what I mean - a small bag, or cardboard, rolled up with a certain amount of money inside. He pulls out about $70 worth of gold coins and asks for more cigarettes. 

At this point I was somewhat shocked, and as I watched him, he pulled out a bright new shiny iPhone 5, clicks it, and calls someone that he's on his way. He turns back to me, pays for it in more gold coins (For us Australian's, that's $1 and $2 coins) and leaves. I decided to follow him out - telling my supervisor I had to let the security guard know something.

I walk out the main doors, and he's sitting there again, looking as dirty and as homeless as possible. I couldn't believe this was the same guy who'd just pulled out a phone newer than my own. I explained the situation to the security guard - that there was someone begging, etc. and he walks out to ask the man to move on. The 'homeless' man does - walks straight into the car park, a few metres away, and gets into a fairly nice car, drives off. Utter disbelief.

The next day the security guard let me know the same guy was back, I alerted my supervisor and she called the cops. Turns out the guy had done jail time for fraud (from begging) and they'd been looking for him for awhile. He'd also stolen cars and broken into houses previously.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1em1ah,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1em1ah/homeless_guy_with_an_iphone/,

It was just a part time gig during college, I worked on weekends mostly.

""Yeah, do you guys sell that Nintendo 3D thing?""

Being a gamer, my ears perk up, we don't carry video games at the store but I kind of move towards the front of the store, just in case.

""I... I don't know what that is?"" said the puzzled owner.

I pop my head out from behind a shelf of stuffed animals, ""It's a handheld video game system.""

""Ah,"" the owner acknowledged, then he said to the lady ""No we don't, I'm sorry, we don't carry any video games or systems.  You could try \*store with a red circular logo* at [directions from the toy store to \*store with a red circular logo*].""

However, halfway through his directions to \*store with a red circular logo*, the lady turns to me and asks ""Do you have one?""

""Yes I do,"" I responded.  It was in fact in my pocket at the time.  (It's fun to get StreetPass tags with the kids who come into the store sometimes.)  But I didn't let her know that.

""Can I buy it from you?"" she inquired with a wide eyed stare.

""Um... I'm not selling i-""

""Hmmmph, it probably has a bunch of *dirty pictures* on it anyway!"" and turns around and leaves the store.

I just stood there dumbfounded, the owner was kind of flabbergasted too, since a.) there were small children present and b.) some lady had just assumed one of his employees was a pervert.

I used to work at an electronics store and this Asian family was buying a laptop for their daughter (she just got into a prestigious high school). I could tell the family wasn't well off financially, and gave everything they could to the daughter. My co-worker was handling the sale, but because the parents couldn't speak English, I was there to translate. 

From the conversation, I could tell buying her this laptop is big purchase for them, we compared prices and I tried to ensure the family got the best laptop for their budget. Then comes the mandatory sales pitch from my co-worker about ""setting up the computer"" and purchasing Microsoft Office. Now this is the biggest rip-off and how we earn money at the store, the set-up fee (which is just filling in your name, etc. when you get a new laptop) is $100, the customer has to pay $150 for MS Office plus a $50 installation fee because we do it for you. 

It's no surprise the parents was shocked at the price, but they thought it was necessary because they don't know much about computers. The daughter insisted on how much she ""needed it"". In Mandarin, I kindly warned them against the purchase and explained why, trying to save them some money since you can easily do the set-up and pirate MS Office or even buy it for cheaper online. The parents were really grateful for the information but... the daughter starts CRYING, like bawling her eyes out. Needless to say, my white co-worker was confused as to why she is crying. She starts wailing about how I told her parents not to buy this for her, the computer won't run without the setup, it's not the Microsoft won't be the same unless she buys it, etc. Her parents are obviously telling her to stop, but she already caused the scene. 

My manager comes out, sorts the situation out. The parents thanked and apologized to me as they left, but the daughter ratted me out to my manager since she can speak English. So the not so secret ending is... My manager was pissed that I lost income for the store, the sales guy was pissed I lost him additional commission. I was fired.

  So I work at a hotel chain, one with a dog looking animal as their logo. Anyways, I've been at the hotel for a little over a year, and at the coffee shop position for a little over 4 months. 
   One day our manager announces that he has decided to move a very disliked individual up to the coffee shop. This individual, let's call her Mandy, is rude, loud, arrogant, and all she talks about is popping adderall, and when she needs her next smoke break. Not only that, she says this loudly in front of guests and their children. Not cool. I go down to tell the managers how obnoxious and rude she is, and then my boss hit me with a stunner. She listened to me for all of about 3 sentences and interrupted me with "" here's the thing cfkid94, I would rather firethe entire team working up there, than fire her, because she is a good friend."" What the hell. I just nodded my head out of shock and went back to the coffee shop. 
   Later that Mandy was talking and i asked her to start working. She told me to fuck off. One of the supervisors hears this, comes over, and tells her he's gonna write her up for that. Mandy also tells the supervisor to fuck off. By the end of the day the supervisor is getting demoted because Mandy complained about getting written up. Long story short, Mandy is the favorite and she gets away with murder.
 

TL/DR :  manager tells me that she would rather fire the entire team, than fire her favorite employee/friend.

I love working Christmas Eve - it is always the best day because it's an early close, people come in to buy something, and everyone is happy with the warm sun and 70s in the air - a Southern Christmas!

We had tablets advertised for $69 that we had been out since Saturday, and the only tablets that were left was the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and one or two Kindle E-Readers (not the Fire). Everyone wanted them, they came and looked, we didn't have any, so they would either say ""Well that sucks, but ok"" or they'd look around the store and find something else to buy. 

Of course, since everyone wants to be by the televisions and cameras (since there was more commission in them) I was on the front line, in the laptop/tablet/tower PC area, getting all the disappointed customers, but everyone complimented my Christmas ensemble (I grew my beard, wore a Santa hat, and a festive hand-sewn sweater from my friend's mom. I looked ah-mazing. Don't laugh). 

Back to 630 PM, I get a couple - the man reeking of booze, his lady wearing half a shirt, showing her tattoo on her pregnant stomach - but hey, it's the deep south, so it's not that big of a deal. They see that every tablet (expect the Samsung 10.1 and the Kindle E-Reader) are sold out. ""You can't sell me this one?"" he said as he pointed to the $69 tablet.

Or, how simple statements can lead to assault charges",Osiris32,445,79,131,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1boqxq/why_am_i_bleeding_or_how_simple_statements_can/,"You may remember [this tale](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1bag6d/yelling_at_the_wrong_guy_or_how_a_bitchy_lady/) that I told a few days ago from my days working at a busy gas station.  Here is another one, thankfully shorter.

'Twas a nice summer day, one of those rare days in Oregon when the temperature is *just right,* the humidity is *just right,* and the breeze is *just right* so that everyone is wearing t-shirts, shorts, and a big smile.  I was having a good day at work that day, as I had been told to be outside pumping gas in the sun and the warm.  Customers were being polite and friendly.  The manager was in a good mood.  Everything was going smoothly.  I should have known.

In pulls a large van and trailer, with Ohio plates.  We're busy but not hyper-busy at this point, but I was always on the lookout for out-of-state plates.  For those of you who don't know, Oregon (along with New Jersey) does not allow self-service gas.  Been that way since the '40s.  But many, many people don't know this.  So I finished up the customer I was with, and jogged over just in time to see the Ohio driver get out of his car and approach the pump to pump his own.

I approached him, a sheepish smile on my face, my hands spread in a sign of apology, and politely informed him that, as an out of state resident, he might be unfamiliar with Oregon laws regarding self service.  I'm also wearing a bright blue/white uniform combo with the company logo and my name in bright red.  It's pretty obvious that I'm a gas attendant employed there and I'm not about to be an ass to him.  However, his reaction was nearly instant, and extremely out of proportion to what I had just said.  He got a nearly-Exorcist-level snarl of rage on his face.

And then punched me.  In the nose.

Now, I'm not sure if he was just a weak individual, or if he had held himself back, but the punch wasn't THAT hard.  Enough to make me take a couple steps back and say ""Owwwww!"" but not enough to drop me or make it hard to see.  I touched my nose.  Blood.  Wow.  I hadn't been punched in the face since I was in junior high.  And this *individual* (definitely not a man) had just suckered me for being polite and friendly.

Now, if you remember for my last story, I was in college majoring in criminal justice while I was working at that station.  Majoring in criminal justice isn't just sitting in classes learning about laws and investigative techniques.  Some of the more...visceral...aspects of law enforcement are taught.  Like unarmed self defense.  And when the guy wound up for a second punch, I reacted with the training I'd been taught.  Left foot forward, right hand grabbing their right wrist, left hand placed below their elbow, pivot clockwise on left foot while lowering right hand and raising left, place assailant's right hand in crook of left arm, grab assailant's right upper arm arm with left hand, lift up left arm.  Boom, standard law enforcement hammer lock.

But now what?  I look over at the nearest employee, who just happens to catch my eye, and see the blood coming down my face and a guy who looked like a short, bespectacled version of [Ned Beatty](http://www.topquarkia.com/Docs/Notebook/Ned_Beatty_cap.jpg) wrapped up like a Taco del Mar Supreme Burrito in front of me.  I didn't even have to say anything, he whipped out his cell phone and called 911.

Two units arrive rather quickly, and take custody of the guy, who really isn't talking, just snarling at me.  I make a statement to the officers, and they go inside to review the security camera footage.  Local paramedics were called, since I was bleeding pretty good.  I refused to be taken to the hospital, though, since I didn't have insurance and an ambulance ride + ER visit = $$$$.  I went to the doctor the next day, who x-rayed my head and said I had several broken nasal bones.  This info was copied and given to the DA.

So Ohio guy got arrested and charged with Assault II, a class B felony.  My manager was nice enough to send me home (with pay) since I looked like, well, like someone had punched me in the face, and that wouldn't be good for business.  Ohio guy WAS from Ohio, apparently doing a massive road trip across the US, and due to lack of sleep (or some other lame excuse) came unglued at me.  He plead out to Assault IV (class A misdemeanor) and spent a week in jail.  I got three days of medical leave.

They were screaming and chasing each other around the store and their mom completely ignored them. In the middle of the store is a short but wide table with another table stacked on it that displays a few handbags and high heels. The smaller of the boys crawls under the table to hide from his brother who is chasing him. This is where I almost lost my marbles.

I tapped on the woman's shoulder and said: ""Excuse me, your child just ran under that table.""

Her: *Exasperated look* ""Yeah I know.""

Me: ""Ma'am, you have to get your child out from under there, if he bumps his head on it while trying to sit up that whole table will come crashing down on him"".

Her: ""Is it that bad of quality that it would fall over? Why are the prices so expensive here anyway, if everything is so cheaply made"".

I was speechless. Her child was still hiding under the table and she made no attempt to get him out. Luckily, my boss doesn't really care if we snap back at rude customers as long as it is within reason. So I took that opportunity.

Me: ""Ma'am, I think you should concern yourself more with your child's safety than our prices"".

1360853952.0,364,self.TalesFromRetail,18ila0,Tales from a Former LP:  Someone is stealing from the company?  Well long as we are getting our money....,Drunken_Black_Belt,472,108,140,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/18ila0/tales_from_a_former_lp_someone_is_stealing_from/,"So as I've stated before, I used to work for *Dudercrombie &amp; Bitch*.  In previous stories I've explained why I can't stand the company, due to their hiring practices. Towards the end of my time there, I was looking for a new job, already over the company.  This set of events however, was the last straw.

So most companies don't allow their employees to purchase or use gift cards.  It helps cut down on fraud and helps the LP keep track of the employee purchases.  Well, not *D*B*.  This was the only company I've heard of, let alone worked for, where not only could employees purchase gift cards, but could purchase them using their employee discount.  So a $100 gift card will cost the average associate $70.  Could be wrong but if I recall the employee discount was around 30%.

Anyways, ever since I had started, my manager would tell me this girl, who was an employee at a store about 30 minutes away, would come in frequently, and purchase $2000 of gift cards from each of the 4 stores, using her discount.  However no one seemed to ever recall her name, or when she was in.  So I never pursued it much.  However one day, I get a call from my Kid's store manager. She informs me that the girl has been in, and has her name, employee number, etc.  So when I get some free time, I jump on one of the store computers, and do a little digging into the girl's purchase history.

In a 7 month period, this girl had purchased well over $90,000 worth of gift cards using her discount.  No, that not a typo.  This part time employee, making not much more than $10,000-$15,000 a year, has spent the same amount in gift cards as a Senator spends on a high class hooker.  

Now, I consider myself an intelligent person.  But even if I was an idiot, I think I'd have noticed something about this just *maybe* didn't add up.  So naturally I call my boss and tell him of my findings.  Now at this point, me and my boss didn't get along.  He was a nice enough guy, but he was Alpha Male as fuck to the point it just went from annoying confidence to full out douchebaggery.   ""Do you even lift, bro"" will more than likely be engraved on this man's tombstone.  Most of our issues stemmed from paperwork. For some reason, *D&amp;B* still used fax machines.... Fax machines.  But it would send the fax to the emails of the regional managers.  So why we couldn't have just scanned it and emailed it, is beyond me.  But once or twice a week, I'd send a fax over to my boss, and weeks later he'd inform me he never received it.  Despite the fact that I always got a confirmation, it must be my fault. Whoa unto he who would dare suggest my that he was wrong about anything.

So I send off all the evidence, cocksure that all of my hard work would be rewarded.  After all, this was a big case.  A little leg work, and any proof that she was actively defrauding the company for personal gain, and I'd have a nice big case on my record.  Right? Well obviously not, otherwise I wouldn't be telling you all this. Idiot.

So several weeks go by,  and sure enough, she comes in again, another $6000 worth of gift cards, and off she goes, tra la la la la.
Dafuq?  So I send my boss a text, asking for an update on the case, and if he wants me to send over the new purchases as well to add it it.  My boss texts me back, saying that he never received anything from me in the first place. After several messages back and forth that basically consisted of ""Yes I did"" and ""No, you didn't""  I took  a screen shot of the email that HE HIMSELF forwarded to me  from his boss saying the case was passed on to Corporate LP.  But nope, I must send it all again, *correctly this time* so he can get it going....  So at this point I'm angrier than Paula Deen when she doesn't get her hourly stick of butter fed to her.  But I send it again, making sure to CC the Regional Manager.  Who of course responds with ""We already have this thank you.""  Derps....

Anyways, about a week later, my boss comes to give me a surprise visit.  We visit the stores, go over the numbers, he quizzes some of the employees on LP knowledge. The usual stuff.  Then when we go to the food court to have a 1on1.  During the course of the talk, he brings up the gift card purchases.  Here is, to the best of my ability, an accurate account of that conversation:

BromanBossman (hereafter referred to as BB):  So we got word back from Corporate on this girl and the gift cards.

Me: Oh yea?

BB: Yea, they said just to let her go.

Me: Oookay. Were they just not able to prove that she was reselling them?  

BB: The company just says to let it go.

Me: Ok but I want to just be aware if it was a problem on my end. If I screwed up I'd rather know about it.

BB: No, the company is getting money, so they don't see an issue.

Me:  Don't see an issue?  This girl has purchased over 10 times her salary in gift cards.  She's obviously selling them. And who knows what else! She's probably stealing from the stores too in order to get more money.  Is her store at least aware they should be watching her?

BB:  Im not sure. But as far as the company is concerned, its a lot of money coming it's way, and they aren't really losing anything since it still gets spent in their stores. So they want us to just let it go.

Me: That's insane.  

BB: It's what the company wants...


Well fuck that.  I naturally called up her home store, first chance I got.  I was informed that they knew about the girl, and were told to just keep an eye on her, as the company didn't see the point in investigating her, when they were getting money.  Such absolute bullshit.  I went on vacation a few weeks after that, and put in my 2 weeks while away.  I'm sorry if this isn't like my normal tales of idiocy, racism, and general retail shittyness, but it's something that needed to be told.

**TL;DR- I aint saying she's a gold digger.... But I'm not gonna finish that line because I'm white and enjoy that song.**

Edit:  Forgot to mention, the girl only had purchased one pair of clothes using her employee numbers. The rest were all gift cards.,'

Double Edit:  Have been informed that I am wrong- Gift cards can be sold.  It isn't fraud per se what she was doing, and any criminal case would be hard to prosecute, unless the acquired funds were being used in an illegal manner.  Otherwise it would just be a civil case.  Sorry folks!

I NEED to share more. This story though was actually awesome, and I wish it had been me who said it.

I work at one of the big corporate pizza places as a shift manager, coming on three years now. I have been training a new shift manager who has become a pretty good friend of mine in the process.

The other day, a customer and his wife came in who are known to lie their asses off the get free pizzas. Their numbers and names are flagged in our system. So they ordered, went home, and again, called to complain. I told this new manager (Tony from now on) the situation, and had him talk to them for practice with crazy customers.

I didn't hear the whole conversation, but this is what he told me when we were writing up the report.

Woman: (after being told she would not be getting free food or credits any more) I want to speak to a manager!
Tony: I am the manager, ma'am.
Woman: Well I hope you don't plan on being there long asshole, because after I'm done with YOUR manager you wont have a job!
Tony: Actually, I plan on being here FOREVER
Woman: Well that'll be a sad fucking life!
Tony: It'll still be better than being a 40 year old woman still trying to scam free pizzas out of [company name]!
And he then hung up on her. 

The store was in shock. The last part was the part I heard. I wish there could have been a slow clap, but we had to get back to work. Still, one of the best moments in my sad job. They still haven't called back.

The other employees were just lazy and awful.  Without fail, someone would not show up to their shift every other night, and we would be short staffed through the dinner rush.  No one ever got fired over it.

One night I got to work and as the day shift people were clocking out, I noticed that no one else had shown up yet.  I called both employees and neither of them answered their phones.  So 5 o clock came and I was alone to start the dinner rush.  I called the store manager and he said it was my job to call other people and try to get them to come in and he wouldn't come in cause it was his day off.  Frustrated and with more people starting to get in line, I call the franchise owner and she gives me the same story, I have to call other people and try to get them to come in.  I try to explain that I can't do that and make sandwiches, check people out, and prep food.  She says to figure it out, and hangs up.  

In hindsight, I wish I told her ""Get someone down here to help me within 30 minutes or I am kicking every customer out, locking the door and leaving.""  But sadly I was a shy high schooler.  

So I am scrambling to make sandwiches as fast as I can with a line out the door.  This was a week after we started toasting sandwiches, so everyone wants their's toasted, which slows things down even more.  Then, as I am making a sandwich for a guy, it slides of the toasting tray and gets all over the floor.  I apologize profusely and start his sandwich over.  When he finally pays, he pays with a $50 for a 6 inch sub and drops ALL of the change in the tip jar.  This happened several more times throughout the night(though no more $50s)  By the time the night was over, I had over $100 in the tip jar and I don't remember a single angry customer.  A normal tip jar night would be $15 to split 3 ways.

After we closed, I made a tray of cookies and ate most of them.  It was a good night.

I'd usually wake up 1-2 hours earlier than I had to and end up giving 3-4 people rides.

One morning I notice an employee I'd just hired, X, biking in in the snow. I asked him how long he'd been biking and found out he'd spent over an hour on his bicycle in sub freezing weather. From then on I added him to my pick-up list. He was a great guy, from a low-income family... but he was going to make it out. At 22 years old X was working full time for me, going to school full time, and on the side he made his own music and videos. This kid was impressively bright and a damned hard worker.

Starting before Christmas we had a 2-week break and I used the time to go back and visit my family. We left the day after Christmas to return home and I got a call from another employee nearly in tears. On Christmas evening X had been out biking, visiting friends and family and something happened, we still don't know what.

They found him the day after Christmas in an alley, dead of hypothermia and with some of his clothing removed. No sign of a struggle, no drugs or alcohol involved on his part.

While I was having Christmas dinner with my family this inspiring 22 year-old was freezing to death in an alley.

It was about 30 minutes before closing and it had been a way-too-long-8.5-hour-shift of dealing with the most blatant ignorance and stupidity humanity has to offer. I was tired, I was hungry and I was in serious need of a shower. I just wanted to go home and crash for the rest of the evening. Then...they walked in the store.

It was a younger, maybe late-20's lady and her 3 kids, 2 girls about 10 and 8 and a boy of maybe 4. As soon as the front door opened, I hear screaming kids, and I think ""oy vey, here we go"". No sooner had they set foot in the store than all 3 hellspawn made a mad dash for the animal room. My area. Their mother had waved them off so she could do her shopping without having to deal with the stress of being a parent. I mean, retail workers are paid to babysit, aren't they?

I'm on high alert now, because children are supposed to be with their parents at all times while in the store. We have signs posted all over the place saying this (not that it ever makes much of a difference) and these kids are going to be more than a handful. They immediately start screaming at each other and are banging on pretty much every pane of glass in the room. I'm not talking tapping the fish tanks, I mean flat-palmed full-windup banging on the glass. Think Darla from Finding Nemo. Now multiply that times 3. Now give each of them the voice of a pissed off Howler Monkey. Yeah, that is these 3 kids.

So I'm chasing these sproglodytes around trying to alleviate the hurricane that followed in their wake. Exasperated cries of ""don't hit the tanks please!"" ""don't put your fingers in the bird cage!"" ""stop yelling at the rabbits!"" echoed from the animal room. Mom is all but invisible while all this is happening, apparently trying to decide if Fido needs a chicken or a pork-based food. Seriously, I feel sorry for that dog.

Finally, I gave up trying to herd all of them and yelled ""You all need to stay with your mother while you're in this store!"". The oldest girl looked at me with a smirk and said ""Well, she said we could come look at the animals"". I replied with ""I don't care what she told you, the rule is that you need to stay with her while you are in this store"". They finally wandered off to cause chaos elsewhere and I breathed a sigh of relief. At least they were out of my department. Problem solved.

Heh. Yeah, right.

Well, the kids found their mother, who promptly told them to go away because she didn't want to deal with them right now. I'm picking up the disaster area they left behind them when suddenly the screaming picks up again. I glance over to the cat area, and what I see makes the rage boil up inside of me. The two girls have pulled a cat scratching post off of the shelves and are playing ring-around-the-rosy with it. You know the kind that have a square carpeted base and a tall post in the middle? Yeah, that kind. They are twirling around this post as fast as they can, yelling and screaming incomprehensible screeches at each other. The youngest boy had swept half a shelf of small animal products off of a bottom shelf and was jumping off of the shelf repeatedly. I sighed audibly and I and a another coworker ran over to the aisle they were currently destroying.

I was done dealing with them. I get paid to help customers and maintain the animal cages, not to babysit a flock of little shitspawns. I'm yelling at this point. ""HEY! Put those back on the shelf! Go stay with your mother! I'm not going to tell you again!""

Just then, the genetic origin of the pestiferous crayon gobblers materialized behind me, deciding now was a good time to check up on her shrieklings. 

Mom: ""Why are you yelling at my kids?!?""

Me: ""They need to stay with you while in the store, and they have...""

Mom: *interrupting* ""MY PARENTING STYLE IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!""

That's it, I'm done. I've tried to be nice, but I've had it. ""Nice Retail Employee Mode"" off. ""I Don't Give A Fuck About You Or Your Money Anymore Mode"" activated.

Me: ""Your parenting style BECOMES my business when your kids are terrorizing the animals and damaging store property. We are not your babysitters, so do your job as a parent and control your kids before they break something or hurt themselves. Now buy your stuff and get out before I call the police to escort you off of store property.""

She stared at me for what seemed like an hour before grabbing the youngest by the arm and huffily storming out of the store. I could hear whiny cries of ""but I want to see the animals again!"" trailing off into the distance. I just stood there and shook my head.

And here's the kicker: she had parked her minivan in a handicap spot without a handicap license. Don't you just love people?

I had seen that the service desk had a line and decided to help out the lone service desk associate. I asked if I could help the next person in line, the customer came up, and I proceeded to listen to her issue. I really don't remember what the issue was, they're all a blur. As she's explaining her needs I figure it was no issue at all and easily fixed. Just as I had started to go in to her order in our system the service desk associate finished up the customer she was working with and told me she'll take over. I politely told her that [associate] would help her and then proceeded to ask for the next customer in line.

""Excuse me,"" she says, ""you weren't done with me!""

""I'm sorry, I apologize if I didn't make it clear that [associate] would finish taking care of you,"" I replied.

""NO! You ignored me so you could help the next customer.""

""Ma'am,"" [associate] says to her, ""I can finish helping you. I heard your problem and I can take care of it for you."" 

Now she starts talking to [associate], ""did you see that? He went and helped her because she's white.""

""OHHHHHH, HELL NO"" I said in my head.

""I have a PhD, and he didn't want to help me so he could help her because she's white.""

Now, in my head I'm calling bullshit, because she doesn't look like a PhD in anything. She looked like the rest of the middle-lower class residents that made up our area. She did carry a canvas bag from some prestigious college. So, maybe it was possible. Regardless, I now had a choice to ignore it or address it. The customers in line had the same look I had on my face. All the while she's still going on and on about how because she was black and she's a PhD blah blah blah. I decided to address it.

""Ma'am, I apologize if I didn't make it clear to you that she was going to finish taking care of you. My focus was to try and assist all the customers as quickly as I could. [Associate] is much quicker at fixing your issue than I am, so she is going to take care of you. And I'm sorry that an extremely educated woman like yourself still sees things in color. If you'd like to talk to my manager about this issue his name is XXXX. My name is YYYY and he's over there in the aisle behind you.""

Needless to say that ended the whole ordeal and I continued to help the next customer in line who gave me a look of ""wow, what was that?""

You know the type, middle school ""popular"" girls, dressed in glitter and Limited Too or Justice or whatever, and hideous, overpriced ugg boots. The worst part about these girls? It's not that they come in packs of at least 5, it's not even that they destroy the store, thought that is a good reason to hate them. No, the worst thing about these bitches, is the fact that they have absolutely no money and yet they come to the mall acting like they own the damn place. 

In the back of my store, we have a shelf that seats a hollow wooden box thing in which about 300 total nail polish containers sit on and inside of. Next to this shelf hangs like 40 belts, underneath the shelf sits like 10 pairs of shoes. Above the belts is our jewelry. 

One day while working, a pack of wild preteen girls come in, and head straight for the back and start looking at the jewelry. And though we have about a zillion bracelets, and they pretty much all look the same, one of the girls decides that she wants to look at a bracelet on the very tippity top of the rows upon rows of bracelets.  And of course it would be out of the question to ask me for help getting it down! No, no that would be ridiculous. Obviously the most logical thing she could do, was to CLIMB up onto the shelf with the nail polish to reach up to get the bracelet. Now our shelves were not made by ancient Egyptians. Our shelves are basically tin foil sheets zip tied to the wall. Not too sturdy. So when I turn around to see her knee up on the shelf and her friend hoisting her other leg up, I politely say ""Miss, I'm sorry but could you please get down from there? The shelves aren't able to hold human weight. May I help you get something down?"" She declines my offer, and steps down. They start to look at the lower rack of bracelets, which satisfies me so I turn around and greet customers. All of a sudden, I hear the sound of a thousand angels being brutally murdered behind me. Or maybe it was the sound of 300 nail polish containers, a shelf, and a wooden block crashing to the ground. This bitch, as soon as I turned around, started to climb up again, RIGHT AFTER I ASK HER IF SHE NEEDS HELP.  Her weight, as I said, was not supported, and the shelf came crashing down, causing neon, glittery, PERMANENT nail polish to splatter everyfuckingwhere. It created a tie dye of colors across the floor, splashing onto the belts, the shoes, everything. And you know what these girls do? They laugh. They hysterically laugh. It's just too funny so funny HAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAH. I'm fuming. But oh, it gets worse. They proceed to tip toe through the nail polish, and leave a track of ugg boot nail polish tracks across the floor that was previously not effected by the fall. And they are still laughing. Payless shoes is next to my store, and at this point my manager had had enough. He goes up to them, breaks up their giggle fest, and says ""You better take those shoes off and haul your asses to payless before I call security on you."" They think this is even funnier, and they strut out of the store.

We ended up having to damage out about 4,000 dollars worth of merchandise. Not only that, but my manager had to drive to the nearest beauty supply store (on the other side of town) and buy a gallon of nail polish remover, which we had to dump on the floor and scrub for 3 hours.

I was something of a nerd, and thought I would try my hand at some retail.  I was assigned to a store, not in the best part of town, where the manager had been shot and killed in a robbery the year before.  

The new manager had dreams of being in the police force, himself. Sadly, he was something like 400 pounds (181Kg) and was unable to pass the physical requirements.  He seemed like a no-nonsense kind of guy, though, and would drive me - his only employee - to reach for perfection.  Dollar counts at the end of the day had to be perfect, closing procedures had to be followed to the 'T'.  Any mistake was met with stern shouts and warnings.  At his suggestion, I spent many an hour working off the clock in order to make my hourly quota.  My numbers looked OK at this infrequently visited store, but only artificially so.

His deep and abiding affection for the police led him to do things like give away a free $30 antenna with each police-bought CB radio.  This was a ""managerfromhell's special."" In other words, he simply carried the given-away antennas on inventory. I wonder if he ever thought about what would happen when the house of cards would fall.

This was not all, unfortunately.  No, the cards were piled much, much higher.  One day, our dollar count was off by almost exactly 20 dollars.  Strange, why 20 dollars...I thought I had done well keeping track? After a while, the manager explained that he was a bit short, and lent himself 20.  So I was to simply add that 20, then 30, then 40 to the end of each day until payday (we carried a certain amount in the till, and deposited the rest...the till amount kept shrinking, except on paper).  

You might think this is quite enough - unfortunately, you would be wrong.  The cards were piled higher still. If he had an interest in a certain item, a new kind of walkie-talkie or computer game or video camera, he would cut open the shrink wrap, pull out the item and use it at home for a couple of weeks.  When he lost interest, he would bring the item back, and carefully tape the shrink wrap (if any) back in to place.  

It didn't take long for me to become really uncomfortable with these activities.  It was simply the wrongness of the entire situation that got to me.  When I would talk to him about it he would say, ""C'mon Stevie - who are they gonna believe...Me, the guy with friends in the police, a guy who has worked for the company for several years, or you!?!""  I started looking for another job, and became somewhat depressed.

**His Undoing**

It is strange how I felt guilty in the end being the unwitting instrument of his destruction.  Each store could look into the inventory of other stores.  In this way, if one store were out of an wanted item, they could see if a nearby store had one.  Sometimes, the salesperson would jump in their car and drive over to pick things up while the customer waited - in order to not lose a sale and that sweet commission.  In the end, a salesperson from the closest store called asking for a pair of walkie-talkies.  I looked in our inventory to confirm, and said ""yes, we have them,"" and we hung up. Then I looked on the shelf - oops, the boxes were empty.  I called the other store.  ""Sorry, managerfromhell still has those at home,"" I blurted out, not considering the consequences.  

The next day, the district manager called to talk to me. ""Does managerfromhell still have that stuff at home?""  ""Yes,"" I said, knowing the game was up.  Within an hour, the DM and a loss prevention specialist I had never seen before were in the store.  They went back to the office while I watched the store.  Finally, managerfromhell emerged.  Choking back tears he said, ""just...don't do....what...I have done.""  And the house of cards finally collapsed.  They said they wouldn't press charges, if he would bring back everything he took home and repay any money he had out - but he was, obviously, fired.  The DM told me later if he had known the extent of it, he wouldn't have offered the deal.

I didn't last long after that.  I got a job as a computer guy in a data center and have never gone back to retail.  My sympathies though, if you get a boss like I did.

Him: ""But you're here, you can just take my order.""

Me: ""Actually I can't because we aren't ready to take customers.  If you come back at noon, you can be the first.""

Him:  ""You should open for *me* now""

Now I'm thinking 'who the eff are you thinking you can barge and expect service.'  I just want him out of my store so I can get ready for other people to come in.

So I don't budge.

Me: I can't do that, I'm sorry.  Nothing is ready yet.

Him:  But I'm hungry *now*.  What are you going to do about that?

Me:  Nothing.  I'm going to ask you to leave now so I can finish opening up and get ready to see you in about an hour.  Thank you!!

He grudgingly spews some obscenities and (luckily) grabs his bike and leaves.

I'm a college student, so I work here during my Christmas break.  Who doesn't want a little extra money over the break?

So let's pretend it was cupcakes (it isn't, it's actually something harder to work with).  I showed up to work at 7:00 to get all of the orders ready for the day (we open at 9:00).  In the Christmas rush we often have people show up early.  If I get all of my work out of the way I will let them in, or if not I will duck behind the counter and pretend I don't exist.

So I'm putting together orders when I hear a knock on the door.  Damn, she saw me, I can't hide.  I tell her through the glass that we are closed, and that our hours are posted (on a large sign on the door).  She says through the glass ""The website said differently,"" so I let her in.  She then has me make a very complicated and large order.  Fuck, fine I'll make her damn order.  I'm starting to wish my coworkers would show up (we take turns coming in early).  Finally finished.

She then pulls out an American Express Gold card.

Me: ""Sorry, we don't accept American Express,"" I say casually.

Ms. American Express: ""You don't! What the hell kind of place is this!  You don't take money!"" She says this with the anger that only someone who thinks they are rich can manage.

What is happening?  It is too early to deal with this nonsense.

Me: ""I apologize, we do accept Discover, Visa, and Master Card.  We also take cash and checks.""

Ms. American Express: ""Do you know what this is?  This card has a hire spending limit than the cost of your car!""

I don't know the spending limit on her card, but I imagine it is high.

The day before my father had given me his credit card to pick up a gift for my mom.  I still had the card in my wallet to my delight.  I reach into my wallet and take out the card.

Me: ""This is an American Express Platinum card.  It isn't accepted here either.  We accept Visa, Discover, Master Card, checks, and cash.  If you don't buy this it will sell later today (the Christmas rush).""

She went to her car and brought back a check.

A mom come walking in with her punk kid. Kid comes straight to the counter and demands a copy of Grand Theft Auto 4. I look at the mom and she nods her head so I start to ring up the game.

Since it's rated M for Mature I inform the mom that ""This game is rated M for Mature due to content such as sex, violence, drugs, language and other things."" And at this point I notice the gold cross necklace and looks like she came out of Sunday church and being the good parent she is, she asks for more details.

Kid is looking kind of nervous at this point so I decide to help out by telling the mom ""This is the only game I know where you can hire a prostitute, do the deed and then kill her to get your money back.""

The look on the mom's face was priceless; pure anger. She turns to her son and says ""Wait till your father gets home"" and starts to drag him out. Kid stares at me with pure hatred and then goes into absolute terror when he sees how pissed his mom is. 

Told my manager when he got in later that day and wished we had security camera to record it so he could watch and laugh himself.

I was a clerk, so I did all the menial tasks and helped out where I could. I eventually learned how to work most of the basic floral jobs like flower arranging, balloon blowing, and printing price tickets. Also, I worked nights mostly, so since floral closed at 7, it was useful to know these things so customers looking for late night flowers or balloons (normally men getting last minute gifts or a ticket for make-up sex) would have some help.

Anyway, this story begins towards the end of my shift, I'm getting everything wrapped up. I always got it done early so I'd have time for the inevitable late-night rushes or anything else that popped up. This group of Hispanic looking gentlemen came to floral looking pretty flustered, and I saw them wandering around so I decided to go ask if they needed any help.

He wanted a wedding bouquet, and with the biggest smile ever he told me he was getting married in about an hour. I told him I had never done anything like that before, but I could try if he wanted me to. He agreed, still very excited. All of his friends were giving him bro hugs. The whole situation was a little heartwarming.

So I mustered all of my meager floral skills and managed to scrape together a pretty decent bouquet, though it was a bit small, in about 15 minutes. We talked about his wedding, and I started to get pretty emotional, being recently engaged myself. (Don't worry guys, I shed only a single man-tear so I retain all rights to my masculinity.)

At this point I made a little price tag for it (I gave him a steep discount, the cashier wouldn't know the difference.) and sent him on his way with a congratulations. I've never seen a customer that grateful in all my retail experience, he didn't expect to find a florist open that late. He called his fiance and told him he found a bouquet and I heard a bunch of lady screams on the other side.

That story has stuck with me for about 4 years now. I don't think I ever saw him again, but I hope he's still as happy with that girl as he was then.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1iffbz,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1iffbz/late_night_flowers/,

Because we worked on commissions and I'm a young, fairly pretty, charmer, I made bank and also attracted a few too many admirers. Sorry about the length, but there's a few stories.

So I was still in training, hired for the gaming department, and for some odd reason everybody on the sale floor called out, so I wasn't even sure of my own department when I was suddenly thrown to the sharks. A middle aged man, around 45-50 years old flags me down and starts inquiring about learning a new language. So walk him over to our software aisle and suggest a brand. He picks up the home edition and I pick up the premium. He leans over to compare the difference and while doing so rubs the back of his hand against my breast. It wasn't a mistakable brush, he full on touched my boob with the back of his hand. I immediately excused my self, dropped the software back on the shelf and bolted to find either a manager or another employee. I made eye contact with a co-worker that I later wind up dating, who seemed concerned, but worked in customer service at the time, right before I get to him so he can hide me, the guy comes up from behind me, grabs my upper arm and says, ""You can't get away that easy."" I shrieked in surprise and that's when a manager meandered over and saved me.

Fast forward about a year, the co-worker from customer service and I are dating. We're stocking shelves across from one another, so we're face to face in different aisles, chatting. The shelves are fairly short, so I can see the top of his head. I see a couple walk towards him, so we quit talking and stock like good employees. The couple comes up to him and the husband says, ""Hi. We've seen you around and my wife and I would like to ask you if you'd want to be in a threesome with us."" Giggling to myself, I tiptoe and look at him. He makes the ""save me"" face, I shake my head, too amused at this situation and wondering how he's going to handle this. He immediately says, ""Well you know what? My girlfriend is in the next aisle over, I'd probably need permission from her."" He hurries over and starts with a ""Darling!"" in a sing song voice with a shit eating grin. I politely said I'm horribly selfish and I'd like to keep him all to myself.

The last story from this store was when I was in the customer service department. I was ringing up a huge line and a gentleman basically lurks in the impulse aisle right behind me. I don't pay to much mind to it because he's probably looking at batteries or something. But people keep asking him if he's on line and he keeps saying no, so it caught my attention. I turn around and ask him if he needs any help with anything. He says no and tries to start a conversation with me. I'm in the middle of ringing up a million people, so I just nod every once in a while and talk to my actual customers. He leaves and a few hours later comes back with his mother. They get on line and they wait for me to open up. She looks me up and down and says to me, ""You're not good enough for my son."" He smiles at me and hurries his mom out of the store scolding her and saying how he never should have brought her to meet his girlfriend. I was very confused.

After quitting the computer store, I started working the front desk at a hotel. I worked the night shift from 15:00 - 22:00 and came across quite a few characters. Besides your regular hookers and pimps, I can't even tell you how many times I've been asked if I want to make some money on the side, and just general crazies who never want to stop talking, I had one very funny encounter with a construction worker. 

""Hey, you're awful pretty for a chinese girl. Would you wanna come up to my room sometime and have a beer?""

""Oh no thank you, I'm too busy stealing american jobs.""

""Are you one of those girls that only date foreigners?""

This happened over the summer as I was working my part time job at a movie theater. I was sitting behind the guest service desk near the front doors, just shooting the shit with my manager, when this old man came storming out into the lobby from the hallway, screaming ""WHERE IS THE MANAGER OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT?"" My manager, a very tiny woman named Mary, spoke up, asking ""what's the problem, sir?""

Entirely ignoring her question, the man continued screaming. ""I WANT THAT MAN ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH ASSAULT! THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!"" Mary persisted, asking again, ""what's wrong, sir?""

""HE REPEATEDLY KICKED THE BACK OF MY SEAT EXTREMELY HARD, AND WHEN I TOLD HIM TO STOP, HE GAVE ME THE FINGER AND CONTINUED KICKING! I WANT THE POLICE CALLED NOW!""

""Okay, was this a kid?""

""NO, IT WAS A FULL GROWN MAN TWICE MY SIZE. IF IT WAS A KID I WOULD HAVE KICKED HIS ASS!""

Mary's eyes widened in shock at this statement, and I broke in to the conversation. ""Okay sir, I'm going to go talk to this guy,"" I said, grabbing a flashlight and a walkie-talkie. The entire time we were walking to the auditorium, Uncle Scrooge continued on and on about how angry he was and how young people these days had no respect for their elders. He entered the dark theater ahead of me and took a seat right next to his wife on the very end of the row. There was no one behind him.

""Sir, where is this guy?""

""Right over there!"" he snarled, pointing at a group of three guys one row back.... and about 15 seats over.

As I approached the men, I noticed that they were regulars, who I saw around three or four times a month. One of the guys immediately spoke up. ""Is this about the old guy?""

""Yeah, he says you were kicking his seat and then flipped him off when he told you to stop.""

""With all due respect,"" regular guy replied, ""that's bullshit. It was dark when we were walking in, and I stumbled walking up the stairs. I fell onto the back of his chair, and before I could even apologize, he started screaming and stormed off.""

""That doesn't really surprise me. You guys have never caused any trouble while you were here, and frankly, this guy just seems like an angry old prick. Just do me this favor: if you need to get up for anything during the movie, use those stairs over there, and not the ones by his seat."" They agreed, and I turned to head back out of the theater.

Well apparently, me exiting without these dudes in handcuffs didn't jive well with Father Time, so he grabbed his wife by the wrist and stormed out of the theater again.

""Sir, are you not going to stay for your movie?""

(the following were this man's exact words. I am exaggerating absolutely nothing he said.) ""NO! I AM NOT SITTING IN THE SAME AUDITORIUM AS THOSE BARBARIANS! I AM A 77 YEAR OLD MAN, AND I DESERVE TO BE TREATED WITH RESPECT! IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO PROTECT MY RIGHTS AS A SENIOR CITIZEN THEN I WILL NOT BE SPENDING MY MONEY HERE! FURTHERMORE, I WILL SEE TO IT THAT *YOU* DO NOT HAVE A JOB HERE ANYMORE!""

I actually had to turn away from him so I didn't laugh in his fucking face.

Upon hearing her employee being ruthlessly screamed at, Mary stepped in again, trying to defuse the situation. ""Sir, would you like me to refund your tickets?""

""NOT UNLESS YOU CAN REFUND MY TICKETS FROM THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE, AS WELL AS THE $56 LEFT ON MY GIFT CARD!""

""Sir, I can't do that. I can only refund your ticket purchase from today--"" Mary was cut off as the angry customer threw his ticket stubs at her face.

""FINE! I DON'T NEED YOUR MONEY! I'LL JUST TAKE PRIDE IN KNOWING THAT I WILL DO ALL IN MY POWER TO SHUT THIS HORRIBLE ESTABLISHMENT DOWN!"" (I honestly wish I was making this shit up)

Her mouth was actually hanging open in disbelief at this guy. I wish I had gotten a picture because it was the most hilarious thing I'd ever seen. (And kinda cute too, if we're being entirely honest here)

He stomped out the door, and Mary and I both burst out laughing. It was the most absurd situation we'd ever witnessed. That is, until I noticed he wasn't gone yet. ""Oh shit, now he's yelling at customers out in front of the box office.""

Mary told me to get on the phone and get ready to call the police while she went out and told him to leave. When she opened the door, I heard something about how we are a horrible company only trying to cheat them out of their money, and that there's nobody running the projectors and our movies weren't even going to play. ""Sir, you need to leave. Now."" Mary wasn't playing nice anymore.

""YOU SEE? THESE ARE THE TYPE OF PEOPLE RUNNING THIS ESTABLISHMENT!""

That was the last straw for Mary. ""Get out of my theater now, or we will call the police. I will not ask you again."" I stood just inside the door, deliberately pressing one button at a time on the phone, slowly typing out the number of the local police station while staring this man in the face.

""FINE! BUT THIS IS THE LAST TIME I EVER GIVE YOU MY BUSINESS!""

""Good,"" she replied coldly. ""We don't want you here.""

Fuming and too furious for words, he grabbed his wife's arm and dragged her out the front door. A few customers clapped, while most just looked confused. ""And fuck you too,"" I said as he drove away.

As usual while working shopfloor, I am pretty vigilant of whats going on around me. We are accustom to thieves and quite a few are caught, but that's not my story for today. 

Whenever there is a commotion, I always go check it out, just to make sure everything is fine and dandy. It was pretty late, about half hour before closing time, and there were very few people in the store. I was the only one on the aisle at this point, but every so often a customer would wander down. This time, these customers were a father and his small son.

The small son started crying, for no reason I could see. Its fairly common for children to cry, so I thought nothing of it. I couldn't help but overhear the conversation the dad had with his son.

At worst, we have people that just don't want to talk, but hardly ever any people that get mad at us. 


So after working about 5 hours this past Sunday it was time for my break. I bought some chicken from the deli and stood in line when a guy came up behind me in one of our electric carts. He had his stuff in the basket of the scooter and it looked like he was having a little bit of trouble getting his stuff up on to the belt. So I went and grabbed some of his things and put it on the belt for him. He said thank you and asked, ""So what's up?"" 

I just said, ""Nothing much, just going on break""

He then looked at the cashier and said, ""Let me pay for his things"". (The total was about $6.50). 

I honestly just stood there for a second because I had no idea how to react because this has never happened before. Part of me thought he was joking so I wasn't sure what to do. But no, he was serious, bought my things, and started talking to the person bagging (the bagger also works at a bar and the guy recognized him from the bar) about how he can't wait for ladies night. Then he said have a good day an left.


It honestly made my day, and I hope to god I thanked him because I honestly am not sure (I might have just stood there like an idiot) but the bagger said I did so yea.

Bossing like a pro, good busy club night with ""Big Dubstep Act"". Loving the music, loving the outrageous drinks prices getting us all them lovely GreenQueens.

Big act just comes off stage, we have 2 more small DJs before close in 2 hours. Cue Rush at the bar. Imagine the Simba fleeing scene from antelopes(?) in Lion King to get an idea of the rush we now have on. 

Staff are ready, we bust a nut and all seems well, I'm serving along side them. Loving being with my staff.

All of a sudden I get approached by SmallLass. Really. She's tiny, 4""10 and barely the size of my leg. (I'm 6""6 22 stone, she and another girl once got in a leg of my trousers each and pretended to be Tweedledum and Tweedledee). And her eyes are the red of  someone on the verge of breaking into tears.


Get the lowdown: Customer has insisted she's got the order wrong twice (not likely) and has started shouting at her. I send her to the back with a cigarette (I keep a pack on the bar for moments like this) and a free vodka and coke to calm down. 

Not on my watch. LOCK AND LOAD I'M GOING IN HOT MOTHERFUCKERS.

I go down to the person she points out. Enter DickFace the bitch (female). Notice her Pupils are doing a great impression of flying saucers, someone's been enjoying some ecstasy. But we can't do shit without ""proof"" they're carrying or dealing.

Moi: ""No, you ordered 4 Vodka Diet Cokes and 5 JagerBombs. I got you to confirm this, and you've already upset SmallLass, either pay for these or go away. If you do not remember your order I am to assume you are too drunk to keep drinking."" I STRIKE YOU DOWN WITH LOGIC YOU HARRIDAN OF THE NIGHT.

At this moment DFs BF makes a cameo - ""C'mon DF, lets just go"". Beta piece of shit, she clearly wears the strap on in this relationship.

Fuck that shit. It's everywhere, she runs off thinking she's won.

I radio security channel 3. The one for the top guys, the reactors. The units who spend their night being hauled to incident after incident. I inform them a certain Orange Hooded DF has been spotted by a member of staff selling drugs in the toilet. I know these lads are licensed to search.

Simon the Lebanese Powerlifter comes over to get a more detailed description. I give him one. He points her out over the crowd, I confirm. 

Now, I didn't see the rest, but I got some good info from Simon and the CCTV. She put up one hell of a fight on the way to the First Aid/Security room. Screaming that they couldn't just search her. We Can, by entering you give us this power (standard club procedure). Simon eventually searched her bag to find another 12 Ecstasy tablets, 3 joints, and a small bag of unidentified white powder.

Holy shit, I know people enjoy the odd pill, but she was packing enough to be charged with possession with intent to deal.

She had all her gear confiscated as Police had a response time of 1 hour (classy northern towns on a Saturday). She was banned form the premises for life, and had her pic added to the wall of Infamy. 

I got the print out and gave it to SmallLass. Finally see a smile return to her face.

I no longer work in retail/food service/minimum-wage hell, but I did for about ~8 years and I have some stories y'all might appreciate. This story hails from my time at a bakery/sandwich store, where I was a sandwich jockey, key holder, and closing duties extraordinaire.

**Background:**

We donate the leftover bread to charity every night when we close, at 6pm. This tale takes place at about 5:30 on a random weekday afternoon. For the story, I will be ""Me,"" and the crazy lady will be ""CL."" 


*door opens, CL enters the store*

CL: I'm here to pick up the donation for [local church].

Me: Okay, well we have about half an hour left before we close, but you're welcome to wait here, and I can grab you a cup of coffee and a pastry if you like! It's on me (yes, we are allowed to give this stuff away at our discretion). 

CL: No, that's alright, I'll just come back at 6. *Pause.* That's a beautiful tattoo you have on your chest, what does it say?

**Note:** I used to have the phrase ""and my mind is not for rent to any god or government"" tattooed on my chest. It was bastardized Rush lyrics. Stupid, I know. It is now covered with a badass pterodactyl. Now, back to the story:

Me: Thank you! It says, ""and my mind is not for rent to any god or government.""

CL: *Eyes narrow* So you don't believe in God?!?

Me: Well it's actually lyrics from a song, but no, I don't. 

(I say this in the sweetest way possible)

CL: So, you think we ""evolved"" (Yes, she used air quotes) from monkeys? Then why are there still monkeys? *Snort-laugh*

Me: Well no, but I know that we evolved from a common ancestor which we share with monkeys. That's what I learned in school. 

(At this point I am really trying to end this conversation, not be le brave or anything)

CL turns on her heal and walks toward the door. Just as she opens it, she turns her head and drops this:

CL: Ya know, you really shouldn't believe everything you read.

Me: Right back at'cha!

The lady never returns for the bread that she was picking up *for charity* because she didn't like my stupid tattoo. Yeah lady, real Christ-like.


Addendum:

I told my boss about it later because I wanted to give him a heads up about a potential complaint, and this is how it went down:

Bossman: So this was a charity person?

Me: Yup. From [local church].

Bossman: Wait, so she didn't *buy* anything?

Me: No.

Bossman: Aw, well fuck her then!


I realize this sounds like an /r/atheism wet dream, but I assure you it happened in my real life, and my comeback was really that quick. I'm not usually so good at thinking on my feet--especially when it comes to problem customers--so it was a good day for me.

I sell cell phones and cell phone accessories. If you are signing a 2 year contract, you have 14 days to return the phone before the contract officially starts. If you want to return the phone, you need to have the box, everything that came with the phone, and, most importantly, the phone must be in “new and re sellable condition”. Easy enough, right? Well, not for one guy.

This guy comes in with a Galaxy S 3 that he purchased in a town hours away from my store. Which is kind of weird. Why not return it in the town where you probably actually live? He wanted to return it because he “wanted to wait for the new one.” Uh, ok. He hands me the receipt and it’s torn in half so that the bottom of it is missing. There are also holes in it. Like he put it in a hamster cage or something. So I look up the original receipt in the computer. He bought it 12 days ago. Keep that in mind. 12. Days. Ago. I go to the back room to grab the receipt off the printer and tell the story to my boss. My boss gets a confused look on his face.

Boss: Did he ask for me?

Me: No. Was he supposed to?

Boss: Yeah. He tried to return the phone at another store. The phone had been beat to hell. The District Manager even said not to take it back.

Me: Fuck. This is gonna be fun.

I head back out and inspect the phone. Sure enough, beat to hell. Scratches all over the battery cover and chunks were taken out of the metal lining that curves around the front. It honestly looked like he threw it down a flight of stairs. My phone is over a year old and is in better condition than the GS3. There were no scratches on the screen though. I took a deep breath and dove in head first.

Me: Unfortunately I’m not going to be able to return this for you.

Customer: [blank stare] Why not?

Me: Because of the condition. It’s got scratches all over the back and there are chunks taken out of the metal part. (I then point at the damaged areas)

He then snatches the phone out of my hand like a child who’s about to cry, “I’m taking *MY* football and going home!”

Customer: Naaaawww, they’re not so bad.

Me: Yeah, they’re pretty bad. The phone has to be in new and re sellable condition for returns.

Customer: Why? It’s before 14 days.

Me: It is before 14 days, but it looks like you’ve had this thing for months.

Customer: Phones get dropped. I work in the [redacted] Service Center. I know that things drop.

Me: Why didn’t you get a case? That would have prevented the damage.

Customer: They didn’t have the one I wanted. It needed to have a kick stand on it. I had the screen protector on it. There’s no scratches on the screen so it’s ok. It's not all messed up.

Me: Regardless of that, the phone is not in mint condition, to put it in comic book terms. (He doesn’t get what I’m saying so I try to dumb it down.)

He then picks up the tattered remnants of his receipt, looks at is through the hamster  gnaw marks for about 2 seconds and exclaims smugly, “It doesn’t say that on here.” Ok smartass. Time for some schoolin’ and baby I ain’t foolin’. 

I take the receipt from him, turn it over and read aloud the line about new and re sellable condtion.

He scoffs. Scoffs like a rich white lady when told that she can’t park her BMW in a fire lane.

Me: If the phone came from the warehouse looking like this I would not sell it to a customer. *I* wouldn’t even want this phone. (That pissed him off. He started looking at me as if I just said, “You know,  Hitler had some good ideas, but just went a little too far.”)

Customer: That’s a shitty way of weaseling out of a return. (He actually said weaseling. That’s the first time in my life that I had ever heard anyone seriously use that term. I was expecting him to call me a jive turkey next.)

Me: It’s actually not. You hold responsibility for keeping the phone in good shape. Right?

Customer: Whatever. Let me talk to your manager.

Me: The one you were supposed to ask for? Sure. Hang on. (His expression turned from anger to slight shock.)

I grab the phone and go to the back office. I hand the phone to my boss. He inspects it and gives me a WTF look

Me: I know.

The boss calls the DM and tells him the scoop. He hangs up and sighs.

Boss: Go ahead and do the return.

Me: WHAT!?!?

Boss: Hahahhaha! Just kidding. Don’t do it. If he wants to escalade (yes, he actually said escalade. As in the car) it then he can call the DM. Another store manager already looked at the phone and said it was in horrible shape, so we ain’t taking it either.

Me: That works for me.

I head back out to floor and tell the customer what the DM said. Have you ever seen any Hulk Hogan wrestling match? You know when Hulk starts getting beat down and the crowd is cheering for him? With every blow Hulk regains more and more strength until finally he Parkinsons out the pain, locks eyes with his opponent and Hulkamania runs wild? You know about that, right? Well, that’s what I thought the customer was going to do to me. I was about to get the big boot to the chest and then have a leg dropped across my neck. But instead of that I got a bunch of mumbled curses.

Me: You can call our DM if you want. He was the one that ultimately made the call on this after the other store denied your return.

Customer: Can you call him? 

Me: We.. . just… did. I told you what he said.

Customer: Gimme his number. (How about please?)
I wrote down the DM’s number as the customer packed his hamster trodden receipt and stair case ruined phone away. I hand him the card with the number on it, and he, of course, snatched it out of my hand.

We have these huge windows in the front of the store where we can see the parking lot. After the customer left, he sat in his van for about 5 minutes. Not doing anything. Just sitting there. A thousand yard staring into the store. I could see him. He could see me. He finally started up his van. He put it in gear and laid on the gas. The van smashed through the front of the store, sending  shrapnel of glass and wood into innocent shoppers. I leapt though the air and grabbed a small child mere moments before a giant shard of glass decapitated him. I landed and handed the child back to his grateful mother. She started to tearfully thank me, but I hand no time for gratitude. I had a job to do. I spun around and pulled my twin .45s from their holsters and rained lead death into the cab of the now bloody van.  His body exploded in blood and carnage as the van finally came to a stop near the blank media section of the store. I cautiously walked over the broken bodies of people who just “wanted to look around”. I approached the driver side door and found that the assailant was still alive. Barely, but still alive. He tried saying something but choked on his blood. He spit it out and hoarsely whispered, “Do my return.” I turned to the camera, took the cigar out of my mouth, and said, “All sales final.”

It was either that or he just drove away without incident.

I work at a coffee shop you'd never guess the name of, hawking quadruple-shot extra-dry French vanilla soy cappuccinos and other brazenly overpriced espresso-based beverages. My particular store has a drive-through, and that is where this story takes place.

It is a beautiful spring afternoon, which I get to enjoy for ten seconds at a time whenever I open the window to hand out drinks. Business is steady; we're not in a rush, but there's a few cars in line. Cue She-Devil on the speaker, ordering a skinny-- wait, I should probably anonymize drink names too. She orders a *svelte latte macchiato with extra extra caramel sauce.* (Please note that if you ever order a drink *svelte* and then ask for extra extra caramel sauce or, god help you, whipped cream, your barista is silently judging you.)

Shortly thereafter she arrives at the window. Her appearance is irrelevant, but for the sake of narrative accuracy, please imagine a [skeksis.](http://i.imgur.com/XTAE9y2.jpg) The skeksis rolls down the window of her minivan and extends toward me a gnarled claw, clutching a bank card in its ghastly talons. I swipe the bank card. The bank card is declined. Oh, dear.

As a show of good faith, I swipe the bank card again, even though this never works. At this point I insert myself into her phone conversation to bring the matter to her attention, my face and tone apologetic. I know it's embarrassing to have a card declined, and I feel bad whenever I have to tell someone. Usually, though, they don't just snap at me- ""You just have to ring it as **debit!**"" An exaggerated eyeroll, and she's back to the phone. Now, our registers don't have an option for debit (even though I doubt that would make a difference.) Every card that isn't a store card gets run through as credit. I inform her of this (once more integrating myself with her dialogue) and she expresses her disappointment in a calm, rational manner, after which we share a good-natured chuckle and she drives off to her kid's soccer practice.

No, actually, she gets all snippy with me, because clearly this is all my fault. I wait until she has to pause for breath, and then begin with, ""If you don't have another way to pay, I can-"" but I don't get a chance to finish that thought, because she interjects with a sharp ""*Just forget it!*"" and then pulls speedily away, I imagine, plowing over an elderly couple on the crosswalk.

The funny thing is, if she'd managed to contain her seething vitriol for just a couple of seconds, I'd have finished saying ""...I can comp your drink for you today."" We're allowed to do that occasionally, because it makes for happy returning customers. She'd have gone on her way with a gratis drink, presumably to go ask her bank about her faulty card. As it is, she left angry and drinkless, and her *svelte* macchiato was given a dignified burial at sink.

**tl;dr:** Hag's card is declined, she's too busy being in a huff to let me offer her a drink for free. Then, puppies happened.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,1367400392.0,,,True,t3_1dgjzs,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1dgjzs/instant_drivethrough_karma_with_extra_caramel/,

Basically, my job was to take care of our customers who, for whatever reason, need some assistance. Usually it's old people, people in wheelchairs, unaccompanied minors, or big young families.

This one day in particular, I'd had a really rough day. I'd taken abuse for nearly an hour straight from the most horrible family while trying to help them from the moment they stepped into the airport up until the moment they left the country. I took it all in my stride, because I understood at the end of their month-long holiday with three kids below the age of five, they'd be fairly stressed out and wanting to go home. I tried not to let it show, but what that dad was saying was really getting to me. It was near the end of my 12 hour shift, and I'd had a shitty, shitty day, starting from the moment I arrived at work, at 4:30am.

Anyway, this family finally fucks off out of my country, and I have my last task for the day. There's an old English man just arrived from Australia, and he's so old and decrepit that he'd like me to push his wheelchair and help him collect his bags. No problem. He was the loveliest old man, and we got to talking about his grandkids, who he'd just been visiting in Australia, and how he was now coming to New Zealand to visit his brother, who he'd not seen in years. I really enjoyed his company for the half hour or so it took to get him through customs and immigration, and finally handed him off to his older brother when we came to the Arrivals area. I wished him a nice holiday, and told him to request me by name when it came time for him to go back home to England. I'd walked maybe 40 meters when I felt a hand on my shoulder, and turned around to see the old man's older brother. He took my hand and put $5 in it, and said to me ""Son, I just wanted to say thank you from the bottom of my heart. My brother just told me that you're the most courteous and lovely young man he's ever had the pleasure of dealing with. I was really worried that he'd have trouble with taking care of his baggage and immigration, but he said that you took care of everything, every single step of the way, without any complaints. I know it's not much, I can't really afford to give you much more, but you have my sincere thanks"".

I took the money without looking at it, and said it was really no problem, I was just doing my job and he was really easy to talk to, the whole thing was honestly not a big deal at all, and said thanks, bye. I started to feel tears well up, and dashed to the nearest bathroom, where I broke down in tears, because of the heartfelt appreciation and love I saw in that man's eyes. I've never been touched like that before.

The lunch rush is over in a popular fast-food restaurant and some post-lunch stragglers are crawling in. A 20-30 year old man comes up and orders his meal. Burger combo and 6 nuggets. He's a nice customer, friendly enough to start a conversation. I pack his meal, he pays and I send him on his merry way to eat in the restaurant.

10-15 minutes later more customers roll through and stand a fair way away from the counter, quietly gazing upon the menu boards in unison. 

Someone starts walking up to the counter, finally. Oh it's nice guy.

'My nuggets are cold.""

Umm okay, that's probably because that's what food does. ""Sorry about that, I'll replace them for you."" 
I go to take the cold nuggets but realize he's still holding on to the box with no intention of handing it over. ""I can replace them for you, it's no trouble."" 

""No just give me some new ones.""

Whatever, if it will make you go away. I'm not going to get all frustrated over some freaking nuggets. Especially if he's going to cause a scene. I get him the new ones and he goes back to his spot.

Hold on, this guy still is standing up out of his booth and calling out to me from a good few meters away. 

""Hey my chips are cold too!"" Alright dickwheel I see how it is.

Me: ""Well, yes, they must have been sitting there for over 10 minutes.""

Guy: ""They're COLD. They were COLD when I got them!""

Me: ""I highly doubt that. Again, they have been sitting there for a while.""

Guy: ""But I was eating my burger!""

There was a momentary pause between us as I processed what he just said. As he kept berating me for new fries I peered at the other customers who were now exchanging looks.

""THIS IS STUPID!!"" He shouts, and storms out of the restaurant. Glad to say I haven't seen him since.

The store I work in has a great atmosphere. Awesome bosses, great employees, it’s not a bad gig for someone in college to work easy hours at a relaxed pace. For the most part, all employees are really laid back. We work in an affluent area, and are surrounded by other large chain stores. Nearly everyone in the store kind of has the same personality and outlook, it makes for great fun , nearly everyone… except bob.

Who’s bob?

Think the twenty-something suburban thug. He’s never gotten out of the pocket of mommy and daddy, but lives his life like a hardened criminal. He’s never (to anyone in the store’s knowledge) committed any serious crimes, and the store doesn’t hire felons. So, he’s become something of a running joke for the store. Bob is a little slow, no matter where he works there will be complaints. Generally he’s just asked to do “back-up” work. This way he doesn’t get in the way, and he can’t possibly mess anything up. But despite being off put, and weird, Bob has never done anything majorly wrong… until recently.

There are three registers in the store. There are of course, no cameras in the entire establishment. Maybe that’s just the policy of corporate, maybe it’s because they’re too lazy to update our already inferior equipment, who knows? Bob has just finished working one of the tills in the front, and is told to take a lunch break. Our lunch breaks are thirty minutes, so it was a little strange when Bob came back almost 45 minutes after he left for lunch. Maybe he just lost track of time? 

Another two hours pass and the store closes. It’s this time, that the manager notices a major discrepancy.  Somehow the till in the back (which receives the least amount of business) is six thousand dollars short. No one can explain why this is. Of course, we can’t leave until the matter is sorted, so corporate is called, and the police as well. Everyone who has worked this day has to remain in the building.

Some of us are beyond suspicion. I generally work front register, and have no access to the back register, though even with that, I’m still asked the routine questions. Eventually we’re asked to go home for the evening, and the police and managers help sort out the problem. There’s never any more than a few hundred dollars in any register, so the store couldn’t have been robbed. When going through the logs of the registers it is possible to see who was signed on, and what transactions they made. The manager’s finally see Bob’s name come up, and he had rang out six-thousand dollars in gift cards. Best buy, wal-mart, game stop, anything you could think of with electronics. He was of course, arrested, and while we might not have camera’s, the other stores were kind enough to lend the police their footage of Bob lumbering around the store. He had spent all of the money in 45 minutes. I’m not even sure I could if I was told to. 

Just another exciting day in retail.

This one involving one of my biggest facepalm moments in the history of my job.


It all started when a normal-as-normal-can-be couple walked into the animal room wanting a few goldfish for a tank they had recently set up. No, the tank wasn't cycled or stable, yes, goldfish aren't a great choice for an aquarium, but they wanted some fish today, so some cheap feeder comets may end up getting spared from a piranha-induced death if they survive the new tank syndrome. As I'm catching their fish, they were admiring the saltwater tanks we had set up at the time. The guy asked if it was difficult to set up a saltwater tank, so I gave them my normal 5-minute monologue that I've titled ""How not to fuck up your first marine tank"" (I've kept numerous marine tanks before, plus I am a marine biology major, so I know what I'm talking about here).

Afterward, they decided that a marine tank would be too much work/money for them to deal with now (and they really had no clue how aquariums work anyway), so they paid for their goldfish and left. All is well in the pet store universe.

Or so I thought.

An hour later, I hear a page over the intercom. ""legomaniac89, line 1 please. It's urgent!"" Urgent. Great. I get to the phone expecting a family member on the line with some bad news or something. Nope. It's the guy from earlier, in a total panic. The conversation went something like this:

Me: ""Hi, how can I help you?""

C: ""I bought those goldfish from you earlier, and they're already all dead or dying!""

Me: ""O...k..."" I then ran him through all the normal what'd-you-do-wrong questions, and all seems fine

I would like to point out, that even though I would like to, I don't blame the customer for my PTSD; in hind-sight it was totally my fault.

So. I work for an electronics company that also offers training on products that we sell; you come in at a scheduled time, sit down with a trainer and they'll either teach you something from a set curriculum, or will show you specifically what you want to learn.

A few years ago, we ran a promotion over Christmas to attempt to increase the number of people that took advantage of this training program. In order to attempt to do this, if you bought a particular product, we would offer one free training session kind of like a taster. The conditions were you would either need to sign up for it during the actual purchase, or thirty days immediately after said purchase.

The stage is set. Enter the players:

Me: 'Hi, what can I do for you?'  
Customer: 'Hi! I purchased a device last week for my daughter as a Christmas present, and I just found out I can sign her up for a free training session on how to use it.'  
M: 'Absolutely! I'll just need to take some information.'  

I get the recipient's name and other information.

M: 'Great. The last thing I need is her email address, so she can use it to set up her session'  
C: 'recipient@someemail.com'  
M: 'All right, she's good to go. She'll receive an email in a few minutes explaining how to get started.'  
C: 'Wait. What do you mean she'll get an email?'  
M: 'She'll receive an email from us explaining how to set up the session.'  
C: 'NOOO! This was a surprise Christmas present! You have to stop the email from being sent!'  

I know that it is impossible, because after I submitted it, it goes straight out, but being fairly new, I ran to the back and spoke to a Manager that confirmed it. I went back out with the worst sinking stomach feeling I've ever had.

M: 'I am so sorry, but it has already been sent out.'  
C: 'I can't believe this. YOU JUST RUINED CHRISTMAS!'  

She turned around and left, leaving a line of customers staring at me. Over the next few days, I kept replaying it over in my head, convincing myself it was her own fault for not telling me it was a surprise. Even though that is true, I should have been smarter, and assumed or at least asked.

A month later I get back. My mom tells me of all thet shifts I apperantly missed. One of the managers kept schedualling me despite all the RTO and the fact that I had not been there in weeks. I can't really be upset, I didn't get in trouble or anything, I just find it hilarious that she called my house 5 times a week asking why I wasn't showing up for my shifts ""He is still in Japan, and will be until the end of the month!""

Some of my co-workers told me stories of her walking around rustrated that I wasn't there. ""He's not coming in, he is in Japan."" ""No, he will show up, he always shows up for his shifts, he is a good worker."" ""Not when he is on the other side of the ocean...""

I work at a horse racing track in the northwest.Usually in doing normal vending or commissary tasks, but this particular day I was helping people move their art to their cars from the art show. Fine, no big deal.

What did bother me was one particular customer who was an absolute bitch about how we helped her load her two, $10,000, very heavy sculptures. We got a call at 6:45, and grabbed our flatbeds and made our way up to the second floor and started looking for a lady standing next to a sculpture. 

We find her easily, as she was the only one in the exhibit and politely explained to her that were going to take the sculpture down the employee elevator, off the loading ramp, then walk it around to up front, where she's parked. She then tried to explain to us how it was our job to carry it across the busy second floor and carry it down the escalator, across the pavilion, and then put it in her car. Now this is a sculpture that's two piece put together that I would estimate weighed about 300 pounds each. That may have been doable if the entire second floor was empty, but not with all the people. I caught my friends eye, and knew he had the exact same thought process as me. We were absolutely not doing that, especially not alone. I then tried to explain to her that it simply would not be safe for the art, us, and the other customers to do it her way. She got all huffy-puffy with us at that point. ""Why didn't they send 2 grown men to do this!"" This line made me extremely, extremely angry for some reason. Nevertheless, I kept my happy customer service voice on, trying to explain how our way was much, much easier and safer, and that we would be more than capable of doing it in one trip our way. She wouldn't have it. 

She blew a gasket. ""I STILL DON'T GET WHY YOU TWO LITTLE BOYS WONT JUST DO IT MY WAY! THE CUSTOMER SHOULD ALWAYS COME FIRST, ESPECIALLY WHEN I SPENT THIS MUCH MONEY! LET ME SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER!"" At this point, I pulled out my radio (walkie-talkie whatever you wanna call it). We'll call my manager Danny for these purposes.
 ""killerq13 to Danny""
""This is Danny""
""Ya, this lady is screaming at us because we won't carry the two parts of the sculpture down the main stairs and the escalator. She's demanding you at the moment.""
""Put her on.""
*pause while I had her the radio*
""What seems to be the problem ma'am?""


He then said exactly what I had said about the safety and she seemed to calm down and accept it wasn't our fault. While she was talking to us again, my manager came up and everything got sorted out. We ended up going down the employee elevator, down the loading ramp, and around to the front, with both pieces being taken at the same time. Perfect. Then we load the pieces into her SUV TO HER EXACT SPECIFICATIONS, had her sign out the art, and prayed she never came back. We went back inside and clocked out, talking about what a bitch she was. We walk around the corner, and what do we see? The same lady, screaming at the front desk people, then turning to scream at us when she saw us. Turned out, the sculpture had broken when she went over our speed bump at 25 and she wanted us to refund her 10,000 for that sculpture. Tough shit lady, you signed it out, were no longer responsible. This felt so right after she made a huge fuss out of nothing but a reluctantness to follow her stupid idea.

Let me just preface this story by saying I am white, and I am also a bit of a germaphobe.  But who among us isn't? All of us who had to work registers day in and day out know that there is no way to know where your customers hands have been, and you are constantly touching their dirty (sometimes sweaty) money, sometimes you touch their hands as well when handing it off.  

This story starts out as your basic day, I am working at a different store in my district to help out when someone called in sick.  And like any other day, I am helping customers and working on one of the registers checking people out.  My policy has always been that whenever people hand me cash to pay for things, when i hand it back I try to drop the money in their hands from a short distance, so I don't come in contact with them.  It sounds terrible, but like I said, I don't like to touch ANYBODY I don't know.

So then comes in this guy, an African American gentleman with his whole family, they come up to pay and hand me their money, and I hand them back their change in the same manner I always do, by lightly dropping it in their hands as to avoid any sort of germ to germ transfer.  Then this guys just looks at me, grabs my arm and pulls me towards him over the counter, and rubs his arm all over mine.  All this while saying ""It's not gonna rub off, honey.""

All I could say is wow.  I could not believe what had just happened.  The man and his family left the store and I just turned to my co-worker, mouth wide open, flabbergasted.  For one I could not believe that someone would do that.  And for two this man basically called me racist, so racist that I would even refuse to touch someone with a different skin color than mine.  I was hurt and I was confused.  After that I tried not to work that store again, just to try to avoid this man who had assumed I was this terrible hateful racist.

TL;DR: African American man grabs my arm to demonstrate his skin color won't rub off on me after I had him back his change in a way that avoided any germ riddled hands.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1f9j17,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1f9j17/its_not_gonna_rub_off_honey/,

All she had ordered was a cheeseburger, so her order was up pretty quickly. She takes her food and goes to sit down...for all of 10 seconds. She then comes stomping up to the counter, and slams her burger down on the counter, fuming and red in the face. The exchange went like this:

Employee: I'm sorry, I can make you a new burger if you want.

I worked for a bookstore for a few years as one of the managers and had come across my share of bat-shit insane customers, but this one was just so crazy I had to laugh at her. It was a nice sunny day when I'm standing at the information desk, organizing books to go back on the shelves when a lady stormed up to me and practically threw a piece of paper at me and just started yelling ""I want my money back, you idiots!"" Seeing that she was just going to be the most polite person I've ever helped I asked her what was wrong in my nicest, friendliest voice. 

She picked up the paper that she had thrown at me that was laying on the counter and told me to read it. I looked at it and it was a bank statement with things blacked out all over the place with one thing highlighted. Now I want to mention that names of places were her card was used were blacked out with a marker but the amounts, her full address and checking account number were not blacked out. I looked at the highlighted line and the following conversation followed:

**Me:** Yes ma'm, it shows that you charged $358 here on August 3 (or whatever date it was), what seems to be the problem?

**Her:** This was a fraudulent charge! My son came in and used my card to charge that and I want my money back!

**Me:** Okay, so your son came in and purchased the items? Does he still have them?

**Her:** Yes, of course he does! I found them all in his room!

**Me:** Okay, well just bring the items back and we can do a refund.

**Her:** No, they were purchased without my consent, so he gets to keep them and I get my money back.

**Me:** Uh, wat? No, that's not how it works. You can bring the items back and return them and get the money back, or you can take it up with your credit card company.

**Her:** Good! That's what I was going to do in the first place but I thought I could come here and try and reason with you since your staff has always seemed intelligent, I guess I was mistaken!

**Me:** Okay, well before you leave, I just wanted to let you know that we have a camera there (pointing above me at the pillar where you can clearly see a camera) and if you do submit this to your credit card company as fraud, we have you on camera admitting that your son bought them, you have knowledge of that and you are refusing to return them. The credit card company will most likely find your claim to be fraud and enforce severe penalties upon you. 

She then turns her big ass around and scoffs as she storms out of the store. She came in several times after that and wouldn't you know that we never got a letter from the credit card company saying that she was disputing the charge. The best part is, that our camera is one of those two second delay cameras without sound. So you could see her talking to me, but couldn't hear what she was saying and you only saw every other second.

Ok, so bear with me, I had to cut out some of the details, to keep within limit.

So our story begins years ago, when I was contracted to design a custom template for a guy's website. $750 total, to cover the design I made, and the guy the client hired on to code. (Yes, I was a moron about pricing back then.) 

The Client, we'll call him TJ, threw a fit about the price, but eventually agreed to it. The project ended up taking three weeks of solid work to finish, but ended up turning out really nice. The site's monthly profit actually **went up by 650%** after the new design was launched. No, I'm not kidding, that's how much of an improvement I did. 

TJ, however, throws a massive fit, demanding extra free work done, and that we WILL do it because he's paying us so much. As I'm in the middle of trying to calm him down, and to explain that he got a VERY good deal on the project, he suddenly does a 180 personality change. He's suddenly extremely polite and nice, and says he completely understands. I'm a bit weirded out, but didn't think much of it. 

Well, that evening, the guy who I paid to code, calls me up, freaking out. His PayPal card was declined as he was trying to pay for his dinner that night. Considering we'd just gotten paid by TJ, to our Paypal accounts....this was odd. Both of us checked Paypal, and found out TJ had reversed the payments. 

Coder, in a fit of rage, promptly logs in to TJ's website, and strips down all the files, and leaves up a note on the website of “TJ tried to scam his designer and the coder, and this is what he got”. Not a  classy move, but within two minutes, TJ was calling me up, screaming with rage. He made all sorts of insane rants, that we overcharged him, that we scammed him, now we have to give him the entire design for free, and that if we didn't, we'd suffer. 

I explain, politely, that the terms of the project that TJ agreed to clearly explain that in the case of a payment reversal/non-payment, the files will be removed, until receipt of the payment. He rants a bit more about how this is “illegal extortion”, but finally gives back the money. Coder puts back the files, problem solved.

Right. 

I guess coder felt like this wasn't good enough. I had no idea, but apparently TJ had done this sort of thing multiple times to some of Coder's buddies, and Coder had enough of TJ's shenanigans. He went onto a extremely popular forum for TJ's industry, and posted the entire story of how TJ had just attempted to screw us over. Being as one of the main hubs that EVERYONE visited, word got out. Fast. I heard about the post within half an hour, and by the time I went to go check, TJ and coder were having it out on the forums, screaming at each other. 

I promptly got a call from someone purporting to be TJ's lawyer (later found out it was his friend), telling me they're going to be suing me for slander, extortion, etc. I tell Coder to cut it out, and I get the forum thread locked down.

TJ Ims me and throw a huge amount of threats my way....he's gonna track me down and beat me up, he's gonna cut me, he'll find my family....I end up blocking him because I'm not gonna listen to that. After blocking him....radio silence. I thought perhaps, magically, this would all blow over.  

A few weeks later, I get a message from TJ on an alt IM account. He's apologizing, and asks how I'm doing. I said fine, and he asked if my kids were nearby, as they typically are. Hm, weird, but I said yeah, of course, one's even sitting in my lap. TJ is all “kids are wonderful like that. So, I need to know if you'll make a design for my new site...” and gives me a link. At this point my kid was squirming, so I got up, put her down so she could leave, and went back to see what he was talking about. I click on the link, and immediately, hardcore porn floods the screen. I'm horrified, and look at TJ's im, where he's laughing and saying how he bets that’s gonna be one traumatic thing for my kids to try and forget. I'm furious, and block him. At this point, I had the feeling he was gonna be causing problems.

This occurred a few more times over the next few months. I'd get messages from fake people, wanting to know quotes, asking me to look at their site and see what I can do...and it'd be some sort of hardcore or illegal porn. 

The final straw came when he went onto that same forum that Coder posted about him on. TJ went  and made a post about me, with all sorts of insane claims. Apparently I was a foreign Communist spy sent to infiltrate their industry, and that with every project, I stole my client's bank account numbers, SSNs, and their CC numbers. 

I'd had it, and I unblocked TJ long enough to tell him that if he made ONE more move to harass me, I would contact the police. I was done with it, and I'd drag him through courts if I had to. TJ flipped out, claimed this is all MY fault. I cut him off, say I'm serious, and I'm done. I'm blocking TJ again, and if I hear ONE WORD, I'm going to the police.

That was the last I heard of him for a while, a year in fact. 

I later ran into his ex-partner, from the website we did for them. He was furious, asking if I'd heard from TJ. Turns out, he and TJ had sold the website after it became hugely popular, and the partner realized afterwards that something seemed a bit funny. He contacted the buyer, and asked to see the records TJ had sent them after the sale. He was shocked to discover TJ had falsified their financial records after the profits skyrocketed. He's siphoned off something like $10,000 of his partner's money, and kept it for himself.

That wasn't all though, as he was discussing this with the buyer, he noticed in the site's activity feed, someone withdrawing small amounts. (this website is where you earn money by doing small tasks)  He made an offhand comment on how that person must be doing very well, and the new owner was like “yeah, come to think of it....they're been withdrawing every day...”. New owner checks the account, and HOLY MACKEREL, they have a $5,000 pending balance! That's literally impossible to pull off....especially considering that the account was created **the day before the site sold**. Upon further digging, new owner discovers a few accounts, all created the day before the sale, with thousands in their balance. 

And all with payment details that belong to TJ.

Yep, he'd made fake accounts so that he could steal money from the buyer, slowly over time. He would've ended up making off with something like $27,000, if he'd not been caught. So yeah, ex-partner and new owner were furious, and trying to find TJ. I just said I'm sorry, can't help you there, and went back about my business. 

Tthe next week, I woke up to a huge amount of emails and messages. Upon checking, every single one of them was from a client/friend of mine in the industry, ranting about the same thing.

TJ.

He'd had a second business whose business model was paying people to run advertisements he was being paid for. But, he'd closed everything down, and told everyone  they're not being paid. This is something now to the tune of $60k. Several of my clients had already contacted lawyers, and were in the process of setting up lawsuits.

Another year passes, and I meet a new client, and we end up becoming friends. We chatted a few times about some of the crazier people we've dealt with, and he suddenly blurts “Well, nothing tops this one guy, TJ.”

TJ apparently tried to scam a couple of people with the payment reversal trick. One of which was my new client. Neither would have any of it, got their money back, and told him to scram.  So TJ tracked down their addresses, and called the police in BOTH towns at about 2-3 am. 

He informed the police that the person he was calling about was waving about a shotgun, and holding their family hostage, threatening to shoot them if they moved.

You can imagine the response that happened to that.

First guy was woken up at 3 am by the police bashing down his door and dragging him outside and laying him on the pavement. He was surrounded by about five cars, all full of screaming policemen with guns trained on him.

Second guy wasn't actually home, he was on a trip, but his family WAS, so they were woken up in the middle of the night by policemen bashing down the door and getting them out.

Everything got straightened out of course, and then both guys pressed charges against TJ for what he had done.

The icing on the cake was that TJ contacted my client afterwards and ranted at him, and mentioned how this was his favorite way to teach people a lesson....but that “the only one who couldn't have that done to her was that &amp;*@$ narelie”. Because I'd been smart and it was difficult to track down my address.

New client then proceeded to show me some interesting links in an online arrest record.

In the year since I last told TJ that if he didn't cut it out, I'd call the police on him, his life had hit the downhill slope and gone to heck. 

The first incident started out with him calling the police and claiming he'd been robbed of his TV and Xbox...only to have been found out that he was lying, he traded them for drugs. 

Afterwards, he quickly got in trouble multiple times for drugs, assault, and then domestic violence. 

His businesses all folded, and with the lawsuits looming, he moved to try and escape having to pay back the money he owed. Didn't work, from what I hear, they still managed to track him down.

However, he isn't done yet. He's shown back up recently, attempting to schmooze some of the industry vets into backing him with a new startup....saying he's changed.

Probably gonna be really difficult for him to do that, considering I just discovered that the arrest database now has a new entry for him as of last month: Child Abduction. (Kid's safe, as far as I can gather)

This story contains no snobbery, comeuppance of a horrible customer, antics of a mentally deficient co-worker, exploitation by a horrid boss, ridiculous store policies, or any of the other usual fair of my or the rest of TFR's stories.  It contains a single, earth-shattering Kaboom.

Like many other gas stations, ours included a propane refilling station.  Ours was located off to the side of the parking lot, kind of in between the pumps and the car wash.  We were all trained on how to use it, not terribly hard but something that needs to be done correctly to keep from getting sprayed with liquid propane.  It was also one of the very few ways we could get commission, $0.25 per tank filled.  Doesn't sound like much, but during a nice weekend you could easily get $8-10 worth.

On this particular day, I was outside playing dispensary technician instead of inside being in charge.  Meh, sometimes that happens, and it was nice to get outside and run around a bit.  A lady pulls up next to the propane refill, gets out her tank, and looks at us expectantly.  One of the other guys calls out to her that he'd be with her in just a sec, so I forget about it and continue with doing what I'm supposed to be doing, pouring dead dinosaurs into metal containers.  So I don't see my guy run over and start the process.  I can only assume he did things the way he's supposed to, because what transpires wasn't his fault.

The next thing I know, I'm hearing a horrifically loud **KA-BLAM** from the propane station.  I jumped, the guy in the car I was filling up jumped, pretty sure everyone for a 1/2 mile radius jumped.  The sound was like a big-bore rifle going off right next to you.  I actually felt it in my stomach.  I whipped around to see a rapidly dissipating white cloud, and my co-worker and the customer laying on the ground.  Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh man, Oh God.  [Oh man Oh God.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9KyBdPeKHg)

I rushed over, fearing that I was about to see dead or dying people.  Instead, my co-worker is trying to sit up, with a trickle of blood coming out of his ear.  I gently place my hand on his chest and tell him to lay back down, don't move.  He can't hear me, but at least gets the idea and doesn't try to get back up.  I check on the lady customer, and she's in a similar state, unable to hear but seemingly fine from what I can see.  Regardless, I pull out my phone and call 911.  I told them we just had a propane tank rupture, and there are two people with possible injuries.  Given how many firetrucks arrived, I probably should have told them it was a 5-gallon tank, not the 500-gallon monster.

As it was, FIRETRUCKS, FIRETRUCKS EVERYWHERE.  Several ambulances, too.  The station is closed down, and the two who were next to the tank get the once over by medics.  Actually they got a twice over, but given what had just happened, and the minor miracle that neither of them had been struck by anything other than the ground, it made sense to check and re-check.  During this time the general manager, the assistant manager who lived near by and was off for the day, and the owner had all been called and told to come down.  We didn't know yet what had happened, and wanted to make sure they were on scene in case legal stuff came up.

After the initial chaos died down to something more akin to Black Friday in the late evening, the fire investigator showed us what happened.  He picked up the end of the hose from the refill station and there, still screwed onto the end, was the valve from the 5-gallon tank, along with a chunk about the size of a coaster from the tank itself.  Wow.  The investigator said that apparently the weld had failed, though how or why, he couldn't say right then.

However, one question remained.  Where was the tank?  It had gone between, vanished, pulled a Jimmy Hoffa, demonstrated it's ninja capabilities, been taken by the Lord in the propane tank rapture (The Rupture?).  It couldn't be found anywhere near by.  We were pretty certain that it hadn't disintegrated, because we would have found shrapnel and such.  It was just...gone.  Weird.

Both my co-worker and the customer were taken to the hospital for evaluation, and to get their eardrums fixed.  A couple hours after all this nonsense occurred, and we were back to semi-normal, albeit shaken up.  I've seen those little green backpacking propane tanks get ruptured by idiots with guns before, but never experienced a big tank going off.  That's a new one.

Fast forward about a week.  One of the other co-workers who was in attendance to this event lived near by, and walked to work.  He walked through the door with a ""look what I found!"" expression on his face, carrying a propane tank with a big hole in the top.  Damn dude, where did you find that?  Apparently when the top blew off, it had kicked the tank across our parking lot, over a street, through the parking lot of the McDonalds adjacent to us, over a fence, and into a drainage ditch about 75 yards away.  He'd found it when he was walking to work, dropped his phone into the ditch while trying to mess with music, and had gone after it.

I wish I'd had the wherewithal to take a picture of the hole, because it was pretty impressive.  The edges all bent outward, and looked pretty ragged.  While the tank looked pretty new, there were several dents that I assumed were from the tank banging into things as it made it's first and unsuccessful attempt at space travel.  We gave the tank to the GM, and I think she ended up taking it home as a souvenir.

For anyone who didn't read the original story Fluffy and Oh Hell No are named so for the Gabriel Iglasias levels of fatness.


Oh Hell no also smells and sweats profusely. Fluffy is just a happy go lucky guy.


Oh Hell No and Fluffy came in today and ask for a Manager. It's me and the newbie part-timer (Kareena) from the first 
story so, once again, I'm up to the plate.


Oh Hell No clearly doesn't like me and goes to sit on our courtesy bench and leaves Fluffy to do the talking.


We have a shoe sale occurring where if you buy 2 you get the lesser valued shoe half priced. Fluffy and Oh Hell No bought 2 pairs of shoes during the sale but weren't given the sale price. Fluffy, politely, wants to know why.


I look at the receipts and instantly see the issue. They didn't purchase them on the same ticket. To get the sale price they have to be rung out on the same translation, even if you do split payment. 


Kareena rang them up and she confirms that they cued at the register singularly and she didn't know they were together.


In her defense there are 9 MASSIVE 5 foot tall banners advertising and explaining the sale that we're having. It isn't unreasonable for Kareena to have assumed they were aware of the sale and still only wanted 1 pair of shoes each since they didn't explicitly state they were together.


Fluffy understand when I explain what happened, agrees that they did manage to miss the 9 giant signs but I like Fluffy, he is polite, friendly and not a douchebag plus, at the end of the day, he and his brother did buy 2 pairs of shoes during our buy 1 get one half sale.


I go to speak to my boss, ask if I can offer Fluffy a price adjustment (something we never, ever do) in store credit and figure I'll take the stern talking to because it seems worth it to keep the customer happy.


Fluffy is pleased with the compromise, was going to buy some shoes for his Mum and Aunt anyway to take advantage of the sale. We sell high end nurses shoes, even with the store credit and sale price he'll be dropping another $100 - 150 in the store today.


Oh Hell No who had been keeping out of it, now, rudely, demands to speak to my boss.



I'm going to be pissed as Hell if I get yelled at for going out of my way to help Fluffy out because His Incredible Stenchness doesn't think its good enough but, at a dutiful peon, I go and get my Boss.



My Boss hasn't even made it 2 steps out of her office before Oh Hell No starts berating her about the Store Policy I had cited a few days ago when he wanted me to put his shoes on for him.


He doesn't like it and demands that it change, yelling that its discriminatory and, biased against the disabled and threatens to write a letter to his senator.


The more he yells, the redder Oh Hell No gets and the more he sweats and the worse he stinks.


Fluffy looked embarrassed and about to step in but my Boss beat him to the punch.


""The health of the **truely** disabled means far more to me that your baseless threats. My employees are not correctly trained to provide that level of care firstly and secondly"" ..... she pointed at the sweat that was literally dripping down in legs and collecting in his socks ..... ""we do not have the proper facilities to handle **biohazard**, nor do any of the laws of our state require us to be compliant with either of these issues."" 



My Boss then turned on her heel and marched back into her office, slamming the door behind her.


Fluffy, who had been selecting some shoes, started laughing and taunting his brother: ""You got told!"" etc until Oh Hell No waddled his way out of the store.


I then helped Fluffy pick out some shoes for his female relatives and sent him on his way.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,1367975751.0,,,True,t3_1dvnne,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1dvnne/my_boss_makes_an_enemy_update_to_the_tale_of_oh/,

I'm going to assume there were thousands of cries of ""Yes! Please yes, we can't live without another one of your stories!"" because I'm going to tell it anyway.

We have all dealt with the coupon customers and I have even provided one story already about my dealings with them, but this one took place at a convenience mart.  

I was nearing the end of my shift and was simply thankful that as the backup cashier that day I had only been called away a handful of times to assist so I was actually ahead of schedule in putting merch away.  Like any good day, it was just waiting to be ruined.  I got paged to come assist at the registers with ~15 minutes left.  The following exchange took place whilst ringing up the 2nd woman in my line, ""Cynthia"".

Me: ""Okay ma'am, your total is $46.27.""

Cynthia: ""Oh, I have these coupons.""

She then proceeds to dig through her clear plastic coupon keeper and pull out a mish-mash of crumpled papers and hand them to me.

Me: ""These are all for your purchase?""

Cynthia: ""The ones I want are in there somewhere.""

Me: ""Ma'am, you'll have to separate them out and figure out which ones you want to use.  If you would like I can hold your purchase, but I have other customers to help.""

Cynthia: ""No, it's your job, you do it.""

{Sigh} Fine, I'm pissed, but whatever.  By the time I'm done with her I'll be going home and I can seethe about it in peace.  I sort through the coupons and find one relating to her purchase.  I scan it through and give her her new total.

Cynthia: ""There are more in there.""

Me: ""Ma'am, I didn't see any more, if you can find it I would be more than happy to use them.""

Cynthia: ""Fine!"" {Under her breath and the part I remember most vividly} ""Fucking useless people."" Then, producing a coupon in a manner that would suggest she was summoning the powers of Grayskull; ""Here, I told you there was another one!""

The coupon is for paper towel. There was no paper towel in her items.  You can now and confusion to my list of emotions.

Me: ""Ma'am, this coupon is for paper towel. Did you mean to grab some? I'm not seeing any here...""

Cynthia: ""No, I didn't."" {Speaking now as one would to a small child} ""This is for &lt;Brand Name&gt;, and I have &lt;Brand Name&gt; in my cart. Get it now?""

Me: {Beginning to lose my patience} ""No, this is for paper towel. See how it says paper towel on it?""

Cynthia: ""It works for all their products, Boredinwisc, {having read my nametag} just run it through.""

Now here's the thing with our system, if it was in our system and we scanned it, but nothing applied, it would reject the coupon.  In the interest of brevity I won't type out the conversation in which I explained that and then (unsuccessfully) ran the coupon.

Me: ""See, as I tried to tell you, it won't work.""

Cynthia: ""You are an idiot! It always works! Just punch it in!""

Me: {Patience now long gone} ""Ma'am, it doesn't *always* work. As you can see, it *isn't* working. I will not punch it in.  Your total is &lt;whatever the hell it was&gt; will that be cash or credit?""

Cynthia: {Now beyond belligerent} ""Screw you! Just punch in the fucking coupon so I can pay and go! This is bullshit!""

Me: {Putting on the over sweet tones that I just *know* gets under everyone's skin} ""Ma'am, I have told you that the coupon doesn't work.  I will not punch it in.  I will however ask you to stop swearing or you will be asked to leave.""

Cynthia: ""You know what you smarmy prick?! I make more in an hour than you make all day! Fuck you and your store!""

Me: ""Than why are you arguing over fifty cents you stupid cow?!""

You know that cliche scene where the wrong people walk into a party and the record scratches and silence follows? Yeah, picture that. I know I just lost my job.

She storms out and I went in back to explain what happened to my manager and punch out.  I got taken off the schedule for the next day and told to cool off.  I know she ended up calling in and demanding my head, but nothing ever came of it.  I don't know if it was my managers being ""cool"" or what the deal was, but I think they may have just been too lazy to want to have to hire and train someone new.

I know this is a bit anti-climactic, so let me spin a new ending for those of you that have stuck with me this far.

Continuing from ""cow"":

Me: ...Further more, get the fuck out of my store!

Cynthia: ""You can't talk to me like that! I want to see your manager!""

Manager: ""You're talking to him. Boredinwisc, watching you deal with this bitch I now know that *you should* be the new store manager.""

Owner: ""I'll do you one better manager, I'm handing over the business to boredinwisc. You're the owner now, kid!""

He then tosses me the keys which I snatch out of the air.

Me: ""Yeah, bitch! Now get the fuck out!""

She runs screaming from the store as confetti drops, customers begin clapping and Foo Fighters emerge from the back for an impromptu performance of ""My Hero"".  I am then lifted up by my co-workers ""Rudy""-style and carried back to my new office.

If this doesn't fit here, feel free to downvote, delete, move, etc....

My dad was on a business trip in a large city about an hour away from were my sister and I live. I had already planned to fly out to visit him and my step-mom as is, so the plan was that I would drive up to the city he was at, stay the night, and we would fly out together in the morning. Now our flights were on different airliners, but we would have arrived only minutes apart from each other. They were morning flights, but nothing too early. To save money it was decided in advance that my sister would drop me off at the hotel, which would also give her a chance to spend time with him and for him to spend time with my niece/his granddaughter.

So I stayed the night at the hotel, got up in the morning and we loaded the luggage into the rental car my dad had and checked out. Before the flight, however, he had some last minute things he had to do at the office. Now it wasn't like he was a work-a-holic or anything - he was the Vice President of a fairly large company and was working on a contract worth tens of millions of dollars. Something came up and they needed my dad at the office right away before he left.

Well, we both ended up missing our flights because of it. No biggie, his company pays for his travel and he could easily absorb the fee associated with transferring my ticket to a new flight.

So we get to the airport, he gets his new ticket from his airliner and we go to my airliner to get my ticket. Turns out the next flight wasn't until around 8 PM, which would have me landing around midnight. I jokingly mention to my dad that my step-mom is going to love coming to pick me up that late. The agent, very matter of factly, said ""Your mom must love you, because if you were my kid I would make you find your own ride because you couldn't plan ahead enough to make your first flight."" He then turns to my dad and continues ""And I sure as hell wouldn't be paying for my son's mistake either, he would pay for the ticket not me.""

My dad and I turned and looked at each other before I looked back at the agent, who was frowning at me. I replied ""I hope you realize that my dad caused me to miss the flight because he was my ride, and that he missed his flight as well, and that I am not some kid either - I'm 27 and this is a vacation that I'm already paying for"".

The agent didn't say anything - he just went ""hmph"" and looked down, clacked at the keyboard, printed the ticket, handed it to me and simply said ""Here is your ticket."" I was pretty ticked off but I let it go as I felt the man wasn't even worth it.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1bsmog,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1bsmog/assumptions_makes_you_the_butt_not_me/,

Lady (getting quite angry now): This is bullshit, when I go to store X and Y, they do everything for me, I don't have to set up anything, I'm the customer, YOU should be doing the work for me, I shouldn't be doing the work for you.

Me: 'Sorry, but theres nothing I can do about it. Head Office is in charge of the loyalty program'

Lady: 'But its your job to give them feedback about things like this. I'm the customer, you should value me, rather than make me do work!'

She pays for her shit and leaves, but not before giving us a dirty look on the way out.

I've been working a 15 hour shift because I had to fill in for the three people that called out sick. I was already there and the managers didn't want to call anyone else in, and, since I know all the departments, it was easier just making me stay. The day was going by fine, slow, but fine. I did the truck, processed clothing and other merchandise, and then hit the sales floor to provide customer service/Backup Cashier.

Now... We'll call this lady.. S for short. I have never - never in my life been treated this way, but this.... this was something different.

I was working in men's department. We're 2 minutes from closing (means about 30-45 because people won't leave, a big line ect). S walks up to me.

S: HEY! HEY YOU!   

Me: Yes? 

S: I need this shirt, but I don't like the stripes. You NEED to find me a new one.

Me: Okay, we're closing soo- 

S: I didn't ask.

M: Okay, let me see if I can find one shirt that'll suit you in our H racks.

S: I already looked, get me one from the stockroom, now.

M: Anything specific?

S: I need a red, Long sleeve X3L shirt

M: Sure, give me one moment to check our stockroom

(Sometimes we can do this - not at closing though, but I got the hint of her attitude, and decided to go. Being there in the morning I know what we had, but I was just trying to make her satisfied so nothing bad would happen)

I walk outside, and S is opening the stockroom door (Big nono) trying to get inside. 

Me: I'm looking for the shirt

S: I NEED TO FIND IT YOU'RE TOO SLOW (Screaming)

&gt;Call over radio ""I need a manager to call security in the stockroom please""

S: YOU CANT DO THIS IM THE FUCKING CUSTOMER YOU FUCKING LITTLE SHIT

Security arrives (Keep in mind, it's late and there's nothing else to do, we're next to a cafe place so we actually got the police rather than mall security, it's where on-duty go for break or late dinner)

P: ""Whats the problem, mam?""

S: THIS LITTLE SHIT TOOK AWAY MY SHIRT, TAKE HIM NOW HE'S BEING AN ASSHOLE TO A CUSTOMER.

&gt;Tells the actual story

At this point, S goes bat-shit, knowing she wouldn't get her way. More screaming and cursing, and it's about 10:45 at this point..well after closing. As she starts knocking over shit, police try to handle her down but shes a problem to move...so what did we do...?

Handcuffed her to the flatbed. Rolled her fat ass outside and into the police car. It was one of the most frustrating nights that paid off so well at the end of it all.

Been pretty good otherwise, few more stories but.. another day.

(Sweet, sweet justice)",FranzJosephWannabe,412,63,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1huznz/we_just_want_to_give_you_the_best_possible/,"So, I thought I'd share another tale from my time working at a pool store several years ago! Be forewarned, this is a serious wall of text coming.

As anyone who has worked in retail knows, you will always have at least a few quirky ""regulars"" who come in to your store. Sometimes it's a good kind of quirky, like ""She bakes cookies a lot and so brings us some when she comes in."" Sometimes, however, it's a bad kind of quirky. This one customer we used to have was the bad kind of quirky.

This customer (not his real name, but we'll call him Mr. Rogers, because I always thought he looked like he could be Mr. Rogers' evil twin brother) had a nasty habit of coming in to the store about 5 min. before we close. This would happen every time he came. Now, when doing a water test back then, it would take a couple of minutes. we didn't have those fancy colorimeters that use lasers to measure the chemicals. We were doing old-fashioned titration and using other reagents to measure everything. Normally it didn't take too long, but it definitely took longer after we had already cleaned everything up for the night. Not to mention, it can be a messy process, meaning we'd have to clean everything again before we close up.

He would come in, get his water tested, ask a million unnecessary or unanswerable questions (Mr. Rogers: ""Does the Turbo-shock come in a 100 lb. bucket?"" Me: ""No, sorry, it just comes in 25 lb."" Mr. Rogers: ""Why??"" Me: "".....""), and tap impatiently waiting for everything, making me feel like I was defusing a bomb. Most of the time, we got him out either right as we were closing or a couple of minutes after, but seeing his car pull up at 4:55 was enough to turn an ok day into a full-on panic attack.

So, one day, I was at a high-school soccer game, when who do I happen to see but Mr. Rogers. He was sitting a couple of rows ahead of me and didn't notice that I was there. His granddaughter apparently was on the Jr. High team, and he was there to see her. I debated whether or not to say anything to him, but I decided against it since I doubted he even remembered who I was. And then, completely by accident, I overheard him talking to one of his friends.

Mr. Rogers told his friend what he thought was ""the secret to getting good service"" at any place. He claimed that by coming in at the last minute, right before they closed, he was guaranteed swift attention to his needs. Mr. Rogers elaborated that the intense desire to go home was enough of a motivator to ensure this attention to detail. ""After all,"" he said, ""why should they get rewarded if I don't get the best possible service?"" He even went so far as to use OUR BUSINESS as one of his many examples of places he knows ""for a fact"" that this technique works.

I thought about confronting him right then and there, but I managed to restrain myself. By the time the 90 minutes were up in the match, I had already formulated the basis of a plan....

The next day I went to my manager, the sweet older lady from my last post, and told her about what I had overheard. She was furious. She wanted to refuse him service, shred his file, and tell him to pull his crap somewhere else. But I told her I had an idea of a way to get back at him a little bit, and she agreed.

The next time Mr. Rogers came into the store (of course, at 5 til closing), we made sure to treat him like a king. We gave his water sample every test under the sun. Ph, Alkalinity, Calcium, Free Chlorine, Total Chlorine, Copper, Iron, Phosphates, Total Dissolved Solids, and many, many more. No test was too obscure for Mr. Rogers. When he asked why we were doing so many tests, we told him that we wanted to make sure that everything was perfect. We wanted no stone left unturned! ""But, my water is clear,"" protested Mr. Rogers. ""No, no, we just want it to stay that way! After all, we would be remiss if your perfect water turned green overnight!"" So, we continued to do tests, all the while his foot was tapping, tapping, tapping to the same beat as the clock on the wall. We found tiny fluctuations in chemicals that were normally too small to make a fuss over and blew them up into minor catastrophes that had to be dealt with immediately. We advised him on the best way to mix his chlorine shock to optimize its effectiveness. We discussed the merits and pitfalls of potentially switching to a saltwater system. Then we talked about Baquacil and how he could switch to that as well if he was having issues with the Chlorine (""But I'm not! It looks great!""). We took him on a mini-tour of some of our newer stock, explaining in excruciating detail how it all works. 

Finally, when I started talking about the new robotic vacuum cleaners that were starting to come out for residential use, he made it very clear that he had had enough. By now it was well past closing time. We had locked the front door and turned off the front set of lights some time ago. He was trapped, and he knew it. He looked at me and my manager and asked, ""why are you doing this? Why are you taking so long? And why are you talking to me about things I don't care about???"" My manager looked him in the eye, and with no hint of a smile or any sort of care in her voice, she said, ""We just want to give you the best possible service.""

It took a second, but then he got it. Someone had let his secret slip. His foot stopped tapping, and the only thing that he could say was ""Oh."" So, we decided the torture was over. We let him go after that. And while he did continue to come to our store (and get excellent service, I might add), he no longer came 5 minutes to closing.

It was one of the only times I've ever felt such sweet justice in my retail career! I will always treasure that moment.

When I was 23 I was working as a barista, and later a shift supervisor at a large coffee chain that we'll call CosmosMoney.

Anyhoo, my store was a rarity at the time as it was a 24-hour location. 
Being a night-owl I worked the graveyard shift. At the time my girlfriend and I had been together for about 8 years in a toxic relationship. 

Working a graveyard shift I met alot of different people, people that became friends and in some ways, family. I had students studying, and people who just went out and wanted somewhere cool to hang out. I became the smart-ass frappucinno slinger who would goof around, and go outside and have a cigarette with the customers and generally do what I could to make them have a good experience.

So after working there for about a year I had formed strong bonds with quite a few customers. One in particular. She was a sarcastic, smart-ass woman who was also one of the nicest and sweetest people that I had ever met. We talked and joked and generally got along quite well. 

A couple of months later the idiot girlfriend and I got married, much to the chagrin of many people that I knew. 
That ended about 3 months later due to us just starting to hate each other. I honestly have no idea why we decided to get married, maybe we thought that it would help repair some of the issues that we had, but alas, it didn't. 

So after i decided that I was done with it all, I starting hanging out with my customer more and more. She helped me out of a really dark place when the world literally fell down on me with multiple shitty issues hitting me at once.

10 years later I am proud and honored to still be with her, and we have 2 psychotic little boys.

Now, I knew if I had stayed I would have been fired this month. But, yesterday, my ""awesome"" manager decides to tell me that technically I was supposed to be fired already. Who, in their right mind, says something like that? I know that this store is going to go to hell when I leave. I was the only person here who did all the paperwork correctly, cleaned, and opened and closed correctly.

Hello TFR! I have lurked for a while and have decided to post my first story. DISCLAIMER: The location in this story is not ""retail"" per se. It is my local County Fair. However, I still do many things retail employees do like give directions to a certain place and interact with the general public. If anyone knows a better subreddit, please let me know, but due to lack of a TalesFromJuniorLivestock, I shall post here. More info to follow.

A bit of context: I am a Junior Livestock Exhibitor/Officer of the age of 14. This means that I raise an animal to sell at the local county fair. But before the auction, the animals(A pig, in my case) ""live"" at the fair for a week for showing and such. I'll happily provide more info should anyone want any. During the pre-auction week, called ""market week,"" we have to be in the barn for specified shifts that we don't choose(Hey, another Retail similarity) to take care of the animals and to *sigh* interact with the public. Usually this means answering a few questions about ourselves and/or our animals, and we get the semi-frequent question that should really be asked at Information. And then we get the occasional asswipe, like this lady.

Here's the story: I just finished the feeding portion of my duties, and I am walking back to my 4-H group's respective Tack Area with a stack of 10 feed pans. Enter Asswipe(A). A decides that whatever I'm doing is not important and proceeds to tell me this:
**A**: Asswipe **M**: Me **AS**: Asswipe's Son

A: Excuse me, I have a question.   
M: Sure, what is it?   
A: My son wants a pig, are these for sale?   
M: They are, but only at the Auction. *Proceed to find an auction info brochure and explain purchasing information.*   
A: Oh, but he wants one now.   
AS: I want THIS ONE! THIS ONE! *Points furiously at my pig.*   
M: Well, that's my pig but-   
A: Good, then I can buy it now. *Takes $200 out of wallet and flips at me, landing on the feed pans into God knows what.*   
AS: Is that my pig now?   
A: Yep. Go ahead and get in the pen and pet it. (Read: violate EVERY FUCKING SIGN in the barn as well as put your life at risk and worry me immensely.)   
So AS gets into the pen and starts feeding MY pig some piece of crap burrito and then starts hitting it to make it sit up. At this point I'm just thinking ""Oh HELL no. NOT HAPPENING."" Well my pig has finally decided to get pissed off and is attacking the kid. I have to physically pick the kid up and put him outside the pen. All the while, Asswipe has flagged down a member of Barn Crew and is trying to get my pig removed from the fairgrounds immediately as she has ""Purchased"" it and wants it in her car ""By the end of the hour."" Then she notices me picking up her son and this LOVELY conversation ensues:   
A: YOU ASSAULTED MY SON! I AM GOING TO HAVE YOU ARRESTED!   
M: Ma'am, I just saved your son from a trip to the hospital, and this is how you are going to treat me?   
A: Fine, let's just forget I ever tried to buy this pig. AS, we're buying this one instead.   
M(Clearly past the point of no return): Ma'am, you need to get the FUCK out of my barn. NOW. Or you will leave me no choice but to call security.   
A: WELL DO IT THEN! I'LL TELL THEM HOW YOU ASSAULTED ME AND MY SON AND ARE NOT LETTING ME TAKE *MY* PIG HOME!    
By this time, security has taken notice and starts walking over. I tell them that this lady has harassed me, the animals, the barn crew, and that her son has violated state law by getting into the pen and touching my pig. Lady tries to sell her story of me assaulting her and security won't have it. As they are walking out I utter a gem brought to me by this subreddit: ""Thank you, come again!"" When she retorts ""I'll never be back HERE,"" I respond with another gem: ""Please make that a promise."" I kept the $200 she threw at me. Got a nice new iPod. 

And that's my story. Perhaps(If the mods will kindly allow it) I shall do a few more, affectionately named Tales from Junior Livestock, similar to /u/Drunken_Black_Belt's Tales from LP. The livestock season starts up again soon, and the next fair is in June.(Yay...) So I'll have more tales in a short amount of time. If you have a better subreddit, please do tell me.

Video game sales are unique- people don't need video games like they need clothing, food and so on- but often they seem like not getting the new Madden or Call of Duty is the end of the world.  Here are some of the most memorable experiences I had.

**Panic Dad!!**

I was working during Christmas season at the busiest store in the district, and one of the top 50 volume stores in the country.  Needless to say, it was busy as hell the entire time.  I normally answered the phone since I could run a register and work the phone better than the other employees in the store.  On December 23, a parent called, and I could hear the panic in his voice.  He obviously had a list that he had neglected, and he was going to be in trouble if he couldn't find everything.  He listed off about twelve different items, and we had 11 of them- and the one we were missing was across the street.  I told him that if he gave us two hours, I could go get the item from the other store and we'd have it ready for him.  This was going to be a $800 sale, so I was willing to do a little extra.  I went to the other store, got the item, rang everything up and suspended the transaction for later, to save time.  A couple hours later, a man walked in, and I could tell by the look in his face that it was Panic Dad.  I called him over to my register, exchanged pleasantries, and had his total ready before he knew it.  He had tears in his eyes- apparently I had saved Christmas.  His total was about $837 after tax.  He handed me 10 $100 dollar bills and told me to keep the change, and asked for our customer service and district manager's numbers, so he could tell them how thankful he was.

**There's a car on top of yours**

Same store, a couple of months later.  I'm the third keyholder (assistant to assistant manager, basically) and I'm working with the assistant store manager.  We're decently busy, but it started raining, so we were slowing down.  All of a sudden, we heard multiple loud crashes outside.  A few customers ran to the door to see what happened- a car had sped through the wet parking lot, hit a median and flipped onto two other cars.  I could see that one was a VW Beetle, and I knew the person who drove it- they worked next door.  I was thankful that it wasn't my car, until one of our regular customers said- ""Hey theycallmejeremy, you drive a white Malibu, right?""... yep, my car was under theirs.  I went outside, and helped the teenagers who were in the car on top of mine get out and get safely down.  After the police came and got everyone's info, I went inside to call a tow truck to get my car, and the kid who was driving actually asked me if we had any Call of Duty 3 in stock...

OK, those were memorable, but not really the horror stories that you may be looking for.  Here we go...

**Hell yes, I'll pay more!**

At this store, we had to try and sell a discount card for used merchandise.  It was $5, and got you 10% off used games for a year.  It was a good deal, especially when items for the XBox 360 and PS3 started at 54.99 used.  A customer came in, and bought a bunch of used games for his Playstation 2.  This conversation took place.

Me- ""Your total is $192.20.  Do you have one of our discount cards?""

Customer- ""No thanks.""

Me- ""It'll actually be free today, and it'll knock more than $10 off your total.""

Customer- ""I said no thanks!""

As I'm ringing him up, another customer goes to our other register, and hands someone his discount card and game, and is told what his total before and after was.

Customer- ""Why does he get his stuff on sale and not me?""

Me- ""He has our discount card, sir.  It's $5 and gives you 10 perc...""

Customer- ""I SAID I DON'T WANT THE FUCKING CARD, JUST GIVE ME THE DISCOUNT!""

I ended up just adding a card to his purchase, saving him $12.  He leaves in a huff.

**MY DAD'S A COP!!!**

We sold both new and used games, and we were pretty good at checking the condition of items coming in.  Return policy was actually pretty good- if you bought a used item.  New items could only be refunded if they were sealed.  Used items could be refunded for whatever reason within 7 days.  That gave customers a chance to test a game to make sure they liked it, and was often the best selling point for used items.

Anyways, a teenaged kid came in with the game Two Worlds the day after it came out, and wanted a refund.  I saw it was opened, and explained our return policy.  He wasn't happy, and complained about how bad the game was.  I told him what the trade in value was, and said that was the best we could do.  He starts screaming- ""You stole my money!  Refund this now- My dad's a cop!""  I started laughing.  After knocking down some of our displays, he left the store.  Two hours later, he comes back with his dad, who is indeed a city police officer, in uniform.  His dad walks up to me, and asks- 

Cop- ""Did you steal sixty dollars from my kid?""

Me- ""No sir, I think he's upset because of the game he purchased.""

Cop- ""He told me he came in and tried trading in a game we bought for him Wednesday, and he left the game and his money on the counter, and you took it and kicked him out""

At this point, I laughed- I couldn't believe he was serious.  The cop wasn't laughing though, so I realized the kid just told a lie to his dad.  I showed the police officer the CCTV footage from earlier in the day, and when he saw his son knocking over displays and walking out of the store with the game in his hand, his dad just hung his head and sighed.  Nothing like video proof that your kid is a world-class brat, huh?

**Slap heard across the world**

The last story I'll go with today is the one I tell people the most.

I was behind the counter after the XBox 360 came out, and we were sold out like everyone else.  We had presold our allotment, and although we had some systems in the back, they were already paid for and just awaiting pickup.  I had just rung up a customer that prepaid, and brought his out from the back.  A guy that was about 5'10'' and 150 lbs (I'm 6'3'' and 300 lbs) walked up to me after I gave the first customer his system, and started going off.

Crazy-""I called yesterday and y'all said you was sold out of 360s!""

Me-""We are sold out- we just have those that were preordered.  We should have more by the end of January.""

Crazy- ""Oh hell no!  If you have it, you have to sell it to me!  You can't be discriminating!""

Note that both me and the customer were white, and other than being a little short and skinny, there was nothing to discriminate.

Me-""Sir, we can only give the systems to people who paid for them already""

Crazy-""Naw, son, now that ain't gonna work for me""

He starts walking towards the back like he's going to barge into our storeroom and grab one.  My employee at the end of the cash wrap starts to put her hands up, and the guy shoves her into a Playstation 1 clearance rack.  Another customer gets between them and tries to help her up, and the crazy guy pushes him away.  At this point, I start walking over and put my hand on his shoulder, and ask him to leave.  He wheels around and gives me a full-on slap in the face.  I look at our store manager, whose chin just hit the floor, and toss my store keys to him- I was pretty sure I was about to get fired.  I told him to call the police, and I grab the guy in a headlock and take him down to the ground until the cops get there.  A few minutes later, his wife and teenaged son come in from their shopping somewhere else, and see me holding him down.  The wife starts screaming and clawing at me, and the son jumps on my back- like I said, I'm a big guy, so I wasn't fazed.  The cops came, and all three of them got to spend some quality family time in jail.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,1372110388.0,,,True,t3_1gzp7q,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1gzp7q/stories_from_video_game_hell/,

Besides other former jobs I've had (Lan gaming center, *McDougals*, and other various retail stores) I worked in a Petrol station about a mile away from my house for 2 and a half years.

Although there were some douchebuckets who would come in and make life hell, very little that I recall was TFR worthy (Other than the father of a small child throwing a creme egg at our service counter...because...um, he was bored, I guess).

On one particular evening, we had a carpet sales/storage warehouse near our station go up in flames but far enough away not to threaten us, say about 200 yards. It was a fairly small operation, at that. However, we had 3 fire engines, fire chief etc turn up to deal with it as we were in a heavily populated area with plenty of housing.

We had a deli/coffee counter that opened until 6pm, which being an evening supervisor I would normally clean at the start of my shifts (I would work 6-11 4 nights a week while a student). This all went down at about 8pm. Deli was long closed and everything sealed up ready for disposal when I got done tidying our store room.

The firemen and police in attendance sent someone round to inquire if they could get sandwiches and coffees made up, and knowing my boss like I do (He had a brother in the Police service and an in-law in the Fire Brigade, quite possibly on location), I made about 40 sandwiches  out of the days bread I hadn't quite got round to disposing of - still fresh, same day produce, but generally just chucked out. Threw in a few dozen coffees too. No homeless shelters or anything similar to donate to, and put the prices through as store use (free) after leaving my boss a voicemail. So even though we had no deli workers and we had closed the deli, so I jumped on and spent over an hour sorting them all out. I'd not worked the deli in over a year at that point but it's nothing too difficult.

Anyways, to cut a long story short, the next day my boss phoned me at home and told me he was glad I went ahead and sorted them for free instead of charging. Further, he'd had a visit from the local fire chief thanking our store and myself, and they'd left me a 12 pack of beer and an offer of a ride in a fire engine to say thank you for helping them out (Hell, who cares if I was 20. I went for it!).

Made my week, and my boss dropped me a small bonus in my next pay day (I think it was only 10 quid, I wasn't complaining as at the time I generally only earned about 120 a week).

I live in Detroit, if that gives you any indication of the type of people I'm dealing with. I have a million of these stories.

At least 6 out of 10 people I have seen come into my store that have stolen have had neck tattoos. Anyways, that was just a fun fact.

I was working in the front store of a pharmacy, putting away an order from the truck. A lady walks in wearing a pink sweatsuit. She looked like ground beef wrapped in chewed gum. I recognized her from a MoneyGram she received a couple days prior. For those not familiar with MoneyGram, it is similar to Western Union and it involves wiring money to other people.

I start to hear this clicking sound. I walk over to the cosmetics section that has our perfume behind a locked case and I see this lady standing by the case. I ask her if she needs help, she doesn't.

Time passes, she leaves, I notice that our case is messed up and there are a bunch of eyeliner pencils shoved in it. This lady was using eyeliner pencils to try and grab perfume from the case. She succeeded getting at least two bottles. Some of the pencils would break off, so we had a bunch of broken eyeliner pencils and a fucked up display case. How did I not notice this?

It then occurs to me that she had done a MoneyGram the day before. MoneyGram prints a receipt with your information on it that we keep. Address and all. 

Cops get the information, we press charges. The bitch comes in again to get cigarettes and is surprised  when I kick her out.

A few months later, I'm working in a different neighborhood and she walks in. What the fuck? I bet she was surprised to see me again.

I have posted three stories so far and I have not received a single negative comment. Do you know how rare that is? To find a subreddit where people are nice and civil to each other and where a little sarcasm is not looked down upon as “smartassery”. For that I thank you most humbly.

And secondly I would like to dedicate this story to u/encore_une_fois as the biggest “thank you for the gold” I am able to give. I want you to remember, that when people are horrible, they usually get what they deserve. Even if it might not seem like it at first.

Thirdly: I realize that there were slightly more votes for the anthropological report on Powder Puffs, but it was time I told this story. So the Powder Puffs will have to wait, but I promise you'll get to meet them soon.

**So here it goes: Christina and The Steak**

On my very first barshift, back in 2008, my shift manager pulled me aside and told me of Christina and The Steak. They were well known at the bar for causing trouble, and I was to be on the lookout for them.  “But how will I know what they look like” was my, in my opinion, pretty dignified question. My shift manager merely laughed, “You’ll know” he said and went back to doing whatever it is shift managers do. I didn’t give it much more thought; I figured if they were violent I could just kick them out, simple right? Wrong!

A month or so would pass before I got to meet these two delightful characters. No delightful is not the word I’m looking for, I think colourful suits them better, yes, colourful. Christina was in an orange top, quite deep in the, eh, neck region. And blue pants that made her ass look about as wide as a barn. The steak wore a navy blue shirt with a fire breathing dragon curled around his sizeable beergut. Yes colourful is most certainly the word. They were both in their mid-forties and had that kind of look like life has been a bit rough. You know, the sagging cheeks, the eyes that never stay focused on one thing but seem to skid across the room constantly scanning for danger or opportunity, the lumbering walk that looks like a bitch (female dog you guys) about to give birth to the puppies she’s been carrying for too long.

My shift manager was right. I knew. The moment I saw them walk through the door. I knew. How did I know? Mainly because of him. The Steak was, I learned at that moment, not just a nickname. It was so much more. He was The Steak, there could be no doubt. He was big and tough and meaty, he even looked like he was a bit “under-cooked” if you catch my drift. He was the embodiment of a steak. If a steak and a human mated, this would be the result, of that I had no doubt.

Christina was cheery, The Steak, not so much. They sat down at the bar and he ordered a beer, she perused the drinks menu. Unsatisfied with the general selection she asked if I would make her something sweet. And then she winked. I thought I’d imagined it, or that it was involuntary, but I now know, it was most definitely voluntary and I most certainly did not imagine it. However I chose to ignore it, misjudgment on my part I’m sorry to say. I made some drink, I can’t even remember which, but then again the sickly sweet drinks have never been my cup of tea. 

She praised the drink, I thanked her and moved on to a customer and his “G’n’T, squeeze of lemon, darling”. I went through the motions: Glass, Ice, “Which Gin would you like?” (Sneak a peek at him, loose wrists, styled hair, skintight clothes, eyeliner. He’ll have Bombay) “Bombay, darling”, Jigger, Gin, Tonic, Knife, Lemon, Squeeze, Straw, “There you are. That’ll be 50 if you’d be so kind”, Card, Terminal, Register, “DING”, Receipt, Pen, Signature, “Thank you darling”. 

Short break: Read the above paragraph again, but this time with your most stereotypical gay man accent when you read his lines, it’s okay, we won’t judge you, much. It just adds so much more flesh to the character right? Okay, back to the bar.

Once done with **G’n’T, squeeze of lemon, darling** I cleaned up, wiped down the bar and then did the patient bartender spiel. (Your bartender does this too. It’s an act you put on, you stand around doing your best to not look bored when there are no customers, but in your mind you are either rehearsing the lyrics to “We Didn’t Start the Fire”, trying to remember what you had for breakfast or, if you are a dutiful employee, practicing different drinks in your head.)

 So there I was, silently in my head going: Harry Truman, Doris Day, Red China, Johnny Ray, South Pacific, Walter Winchell, Joe DiMa “This drink is reeeeeally good”. Her screeching voice cut me of halfway through the first verse. I look over and see her greedily suck the last drops through the straw. It makes that sound that you can in no way reproduce in writing, yet we all know it well. The sound of air and liquid being drawn through a slim tube on to a waiting tongue. The sound of slurpees and kids birthdays. The sound of movie theatres and unrelenting anger.

She pulls out the straw and licks the last drops off of it. Her much-to-red lipstick is smeared on her teeth. She pushes her glass across the bar and asks “will you make me something like this, sweet, but with a bit of a bite to it” and there it is again. That wink. This time I’m sure. She winked at me. But I’m not the only one who saw, The Steak did too. He shoots me this look, I’ve never seen it’s like. It was a sigh mixed with anger and regret, and just a touch of resignation. All this in one look. I was a bit blown away honestly, but I collected myself and made some random drink. Sweet with a bite, just like she asked.

Again she praised the drink, and gulped it down quicker than a 6 year old when told he can’t have that cookie. This time she asked for “something sweet and sexy”. How is a drink sexy? I know some drinks have sexy names, like sex on the beach or one night stand, but how does a drink taste sexy? I asked if there was anything on the menu she thought looked good, she shook her head, “no they look so simple and boring, I like what you do better” Wink. You know what lady? Screw you and your sexy drinks, and screw your wink to!

I made her the simplest drink I could think of. A screwdriver! Glass, Ice, Jigger, Vodka, Orange juice, (and then the twist, I added another ingredient, it colours so violently so I only used a drop, there was no way she could taste it) Blue Curacao, straw, stir, serve. Which colour does blue and yellow make? Green! How many drinks can you come up with that are green? Me, I’m a bartender, I can think of a few. But this woman, this Christina, I’ll bet you my favorite shaker she had never seen a green drink before. 

She went nuts! Bonkers! Mad! Completely frigging deranged! Over a drink, you guys. The most basic of drinks, the one I teach new bartenders first to explain the basics of drink making (or mixology if you insist). A screwdriver with a bit of colour mixed in and she was off her head. It was the best drink she had EVER had and I was just amazing and beautiful and talented andandand. I think she creamed her pants right on the spot, but no matter for this is where the story takes a slight turn.

The Steak, long overlooked and forgotten in the ecstasy his wife was living through her superb green screwdriver, got up. He didn’t say a word, he just got to his feet, drained his beer bottle, leaned slightly over the bar and **CRASH!** He brought the bottle  down, holding it by the neck, on the edge of the bartop and it smashed, leaving him a nice little stab weapon.

Still not saying a word, in the now completely silent bar, he looked at me, looked at his wife, lifted the bottle neck with the jagged edges glinting in the dim lights, he grunted at me in a manner I can only assume was to convey “you get what I’m hinting at?”. I nodded, just at short curt nod of acquiescence. That was enough, he sat back down, pushed the bottle neck across the bar to me and motioned for another beer. I was not happy with the situation, but at least the immediate danger was averted, or so I thought. I was wrong.

In my mind I quickly calculated how long till closing, half an hour. 30 minutes, I could manage that, no need to make any more out of the situation right? Again, I was wrong. This must go down in history as The Night Neomety was Wrong. The steak and I had made a silent agreement, none more would come of this, we had marked up the borders of our respective countries. Mine was Barghanistan, his Guestran. We shared a border but I would not invade his capitol, Christran, Tehstina (okay Guestran was bad enough, I can’t come up with a good pun on Tehran and Christina, sorry)his capitol, Christina and he would not drop a beer bottle shaped atom bomb on me. The peace treaty had been drawn up, all that was left was to sign it and we could enjoy peace in our time. 

Historians and people with a bit of knowledge of World War II will see the danger ahead, because when Neville Chamberlain said ""Peace in our time"", what did eventually come to pass? Well not peace, that’s for sure, and the same happened here. There was a Yoko Ono among us, a nagging little bitch who would not give peace a chance. A lipstick smeared teethed, orange shirted, blue pantsed, ass as wide as the Rio Grande little devil who decided this was her time to shine.

Goddamned maximum of 10000 characters! The last part will have to be in the comments, I'm really sorry about that, I didn't mean for it to get this long.

I won't say where because of the circumstances involving my departure (and a friendly request by our mods), but it was a little slice of caffeinated hell.

My boss was the franchise owner and a complete control freak. You know the kind; they'll do in 4 hours what you could do in 1 simply because they don't trust you to read the instructions right side-up. That was my boss. She was... a real treasure.

We always butted heads, but what we always had the most difficulty with was being late. I fashion myself a punctual person, but there were those occasions when time was just not on my side, nor was traffic.

My shift began at 1:30pm. I arrived and clocked in at 1:31pm. I'd thought I was in the clear because I'd been pretty timely about my arrival despite horrific traffic and construction on all of the major routes to the establishment. It was no sooner than the thought soothing my mind that it was snatched away by my boss' shrill, characteristically disappointed voice;

""You're late.""

""Oh,"" I pretended to play dumb as if the computer screen hadn't given me an unfair 60 second judgment, ""was I? Sorry... Traffic from--""

Before I can even explain myself her neck whips to the side at a precise right angle and her hair soon followed her. I knew I would be hearing about this more later on, but tried not to let it dampen my shift. I was working with a great coworker, who'd been looking at me as if I were a gazelle tossed into a pit of lions. This wasn't too far from accurate. Still, I was there, and I'd soon be inundating every orifice of my body with some caffeinated concoction.

I make a drink for myself and before I can so much as smell it, my boss calls me back and demands to talk to me about my ""tardy problem"". I've got all the excitement of a sloth huffing ether at this point.

""You were late today"" she explains.

""By a minute,"" I begin, ""I'm sorry.""

I wasn't really sorry, but lying to appease her molten crazy was easier than being spewed with details of her life that have broken and twisted her to the point she became this very psychotic. Treat bosses like Occam's Razor- the simple approach.

""If you're a minute late, you're 2 hours late"" she insists. My eyes widen reflexively and then retract, so as not to look too put-off by such a comment. I began to wonder how I got involved with this thing- this carcass of hopes and dreams, now masquerading as a supervisor.

""I'm sorry."" I really wasn't sorry. I don't think I'd been less sorry in my life. I was less sorry for my actions than the man who shot Bin Laden. However, when dealing with molten crazy, ""sorry"" is more of a ""let me leave now"" cue than it is grounds for an apology.

She let me go, but not without stripping me of my enthusiasm. I knew, walking out of that room, what I would do.

My next shift, a whopping 3 days from the ""tardy problem"" incident, I phoned my boss ahead of time and told her that I'd be a minute late. She reluctantly agreed to offer lenience and I turned my phone off.

I arrived 2 hours late for my shift. My 5 hour shift had become a 3 hour shift, and when I walked in, my boss was furious. She was red in the face and looking at me like I'd shattered some sacred artifact of hers that belongs to a cult worshipping Tom Cruise, Ted Bundy and Russell Brand. She brought me in back and told me in simple language that made me pretty grateful;

""Shape up, or ship out."" I'd figured that the angrier she got, the less she said. I began to wonder if she just told all of her fired employees ""Go"" and nothing more.

""Well,"" I began with an indifferent look over my face, ""you told me a minute late is the same as 2 hours."" An uncomfortable paraphrase, but I no longer cared for the job and losing it would trouble me for no longer than it took for my feet to leave the doormat.

""If that's going to be your attitude,"" by my calculations, she'd been getting less angry! ""you can just leave now."" 

My calculations were mistaken.

I was canned and I knew it. I left my apron (the sure sign of retail bliss) and all of my woes behind me as she told me not to come back and that she would mail my last check to me.

I've been back to that store a whopping twice. Since then, the coworkers I knew are all gone (by several rotations now, I take it), the brand has gone loopy with the beverages it makes and the boss is miserable as ever, if not more so.

As it turns out, Retail Lads and Lasses, 1 Minute does NOT equal 2 Hours.

We coordinated installations between customer's, installers, and took care of explaining different aspects of our process to our customers.

I had a manager, who was awesome with customers. We shall call him WGAF (Who Gives A Fuck). I get a call from an irrate customer. Right off the bat this guy is freaking out on me, which was normal, because once you work with customer's on their houses it's mostly downhill.

I cannot get a word in edgewise with this douchebag on the phone. He is just screaming, because the contractor that was suppose to install his door was not able to, because it had not arrived from the factory yet. It came in on that day, and the installer was booked up.

This guy was not hearing it. He was saying that he did not care if the contractor worked until 3:00 am, it would be done that night. I informed him that it created an unsafe working environment to have a contractor working on his house after dark, plus the contractor already put in 12 hours doing several things he did not have to do for other customers.

After a few minutes WGAF comes into the office and he can hear this guy from the phone yelling at me. 

WGAF: (sighs loudly) Transfer him to me please.

Me: Please hold while I connect you with WGAF one of our managers.

WGAF: This if WGAF how can I help you?

This guy lays into him and WGAF's eyes just go red. He pulls away from the phone and looks at it, then places it on the desk. We can hear this guy yelling for 5 minutes straight. It is almost vibrating on the counter.

WGAF: (reclines in his seat) So, what do you think about HP laptops Dalemore?

Me: (staring intently at the phone) I am not a fan of their computers, but they make decent printers and scanners.

WGAF: I was thinking about getting one today, do you have a different recommendation?

This went on for about 5 minutes, when suddenly we hear the douchebag on the other side of the phone start yelling hello. WGAF holds his finger up to me and picks up his phone.

WGAF: Are you done yet?

Douchebag: Excuse me?

WGAF: Are you finished with whatever you were saying?

The customer is babbling at this point and yelling louder, so the phone goes back on the desk and we continue our conversation for about another minute. then the shouts of hello come back over the phone.

WGAF: Are you done yet?

Douchebag: This is an outra...

WGAF: So? When you yell at my associates, it makes me want to hang up and not help you at all.

Douchebag: I took vacation for my door to be installed. (blah blah blah)

WGAF: That gives you some kind of right to treat us like we are slaves or dogs?

Douchebag: Well, I uh...

WGAF: Your door will remain here and your contractor will contact you tomorrow. (WGAF hangs up)

Me: You're my hero... (my mouth hanging open and tears almost in my eyes...)

WGAF: Shut up... (he gets up and starts walking out) By the way, don't ever do what I just did.

Me: gotcha...

But this particular customer may take the grand asshole prize. 

This lady, we'll call her Carol Taintlicker (CT), had been a customer of ours for a long time but tended to spend very little while taking up a lot of our time in the process.

So one day CT's company finally decides it's time to relocate to a larger office space, and wants to reuse her existing cubicles but reconfigure them to fit the new office. So the idea was we would use as much as we could from what she already had, and then order any additional parts from the manufacturer. Our design service was free at the time. 

So I get stuck with this project, and many hours were spent counting all the parts and pieces CT currently had (very tedious) measuring the new office, and using our software to design a new set up while trying to use as much of her current furniture as possible. Everytime I thought we had settled on layout, she'd change her mind and have me make them a different size.  Changing the size is not an easy quick thing, especially when you're trying to make use of specific panel and worksurface sizes. At one point CT even decided that they wanted to move the existing cubicles to an entirely different area and purchase new ones for the area I had been designing, so back to drawing board once again.

One day she comes into my office and I think its because she's ready to finalize the project... she sits down and tells me that they accidentally spent too much of their budget on this specialty carpeting for the new office and that ate up most of her furniture budget. So the new plan is she found some cubicles on ebay and she's just going to buy those  and have me reconfigure them to fit the space. I was furious, but kept my cool and told her that if she wanted me to do that, I would be charging per hour for my time. CT got a huge attitude and said **""Oh, so what you're saying is, you offer free design service, but only if I'm buying the furniture from you?""** I was dumbfounded, shocked, and couldn't believe she wasn't joking. In my most wtf-is-wrong-with-you-dumbass voice, I replied ""uh, yeah"". She muttered something about taking her 'business' elsewhere (what business, exactly?) and stormed off. She called my boss sometime later about it and he told her off and said she was lucky we didn't charge for her wasting my time already, and that we no longer wished to do business with her.

In my first month at the restaurant, we had a new district manager and I quickly realised that we were not going to be friends. He gave me a written warning (only 3 of those in one year and you are out) for being late by 5 minutes due to a traffic jam. They are usually reserved for no-shows or stealing drinks/food to take home without permission, so I was kind of annoyed about the warning. 

A week later he gave me my second warning for messing up an order for a table (which I apologised for to the table, and they were fine with it). As everybody knows, accidents happen, but this didn't matter to him. Following this he gave me a disciplinary hearing and I was fired. I fought the matter with head office and got my job back.

Last week, after 18 months of employment, I found out that the same manager who fired me, for being late once and getting somebody steak and chips instead of fish and chips, has been fired for stealing about £10,000 over the course of a year.

Background: I worked at a fast food franchise in high school that dealt primarily with pizza but had some locations that offered pasta dishes. Our particular location did not. (Also of note was that my manager was young, I looked old as a 6'5"" male and she typically had me deal with my own customer issues which was terrible/awesome)   The problem of people wanting items that we didn't serve was fairly typical, but this one woman took the cake:

It was right around the end of dinner rush and most everyone was putting the dining room in order and getting back up to snuff on our prepped food and that left me as the only one working the front counter.  It was at this point that a middle aged woman (Let's go with Karen, she looked like a Karen) came in with her two elementary school aged children (not important, but true nonetheless).

Me: ""Hi, welcome to {Redacted}, how may I help you?""

Karen: [Huffily] ""Can you give me a minute?""

Me: [Putting on my best fake smile and chipper voice] ""Sure, take your time and let me know when you are ready.""

I then went back to cleaning the counters and putting paper mats on our trays.  After ~3 minutes I hear:

Karen: ""Excuse me!""

Me: ""Yes, are you ready to order?

Karen: ""Yes, I will take a large order of spaghetti and two orders of...""

Me: ""Ma'am, I'm going to cut you off there, we unfortunately don't serve pasta at this location.  However we do have fresh pizza that just came out of the oven or I could point you in the direction of two other locations fairly near here that *do* serve pasta.""

Karen: [Pointing at the menu while looking at me] ""I know for a fact you serve pasta, just take me order and get me my food.""

Me: [Polite but annoyed as this is not the first time] ""I apologize ma'am, but as I said, we don't serve pasta at this location.  Is there something else...""

Karen: ""Of course you do! Are you telling me you are out of pasta?!""

Me: ""Ma'am, we are not out of pasta, we never have pasta. We don't make pasta. We have no pasta.  Once again, I can direct you to...""

Karen: ""Is there a manager around?!""

I looked down the counter to our managers ""area"" (there was a little blocked from view area at the end of our counter with a desk) where my Store Manager was sitting.  She just shook her head and kept working.

Me: ""At the moment I am the manager on duty."" (once again, I wasn't but this was a fairly common lie I was told to spout, not sure how okay it was for the company, but whatever, I was 16 and looked 30 and couldn't have cared less) ""Is there something I can do for you?""

Karen: ""Yes, you can get me my spaghetti!"" (Should have seen that coming)

Me: (Exasperation setting in) ""I apologize ma'am, but we don't have any pasta.  I can give you directions to a location that does.  Beyond that I'm not sure what you want me to do.""

At this point she gets a gleam in her eye and decides to unveil her as yet un-played ""ace in the hole"".

Karen: ""Excuse me."" She said, withdrawing an Entertainment Book coupon ""I have this coupon for a buy 1 get 1 free on pasta and you have to honor it.""

Ah, now we get to the root of the problem, I wish I could say this was uncommon.

Me: ""Okay, I understand your confusion, but if you look at the back you will see the participating locations and we're not one of them.""

Karen: ""Yes you are, I say right here!""

Me: [Looking at coupon] No, see that location is about 2 miles away inside the mall.

Karen: ""You're lying! I think you're just lazy and don't want to make it for me!""

Me: [Fed up and done with this as we now have cars lined up in drive-thru I should be helping expedite] ""Ma'am, are you suggesting I took the pasta off the menu when I saw you pull up?""

Karen: ""Are you telling me you can't make me any spaghetti?!""

Me: [Finally!] ""Yes, ma'am. We have have no pasta. None. Zero. I cannot make it appear.  Is there anything else I can do for you?""

Karen: ""You lazy, rude, idiot! I'm never coming back here! You lost yourself a customer!""

Me: ""Have a nice day.""

After coming in, looking around, leaving, coming back, leaving, buying a shirt, returning the shirt, and buying a new shirt, they began asking about our men's fragrances. Here is how the conversation went:

Lady: So, which one of the colognes is your favorite?

Me: Personally, I really like the *first cologne*. It's meant to be a more formal scent, though. If you're looking for something more casual, you might want to try the *second cologne*.

Lady (to man): Do you want some new cologne? Come here!

Was just another normal night in the casino, processing people's credit cards and checks to withdraw cash. Either way, I had this one young guy come up to my window to get cash off his card. I start the process, swipe his card and start putting his information in the system. 

Him: ""You have really nice hands"" 

Now I've gotten this compliment before, usually people telling me I have the hands to play piano since I have long, thin fingers. So I didn't think anything when he said it. I just replied with my usual ""Thanks"". 

Him: ""You're really cute by the way"" 
""Umm... Thanks?"" Now it was starting to get a bit uncomfortable. 

""Are you gay?""
""No I'm not, I have a girlfriend.""

""Oh man. I would love to just get in bed and cuddle with you.""

This caught me off guard completely and I didn't know how to respond to it. I just kinda looked at him and said something like ""uuhhhmm...."" 

Him: ""Was that a little too much?"" 
""Yeah, just a bit""

So I continue finishing up the transaction. 

""Can I ask you a personal question?""

After that last comment, I couldn't think of anything worse he could say. ""Sure, I guess"". Big mistake. 

Him: ""So..... How big is it?"" he smiles and looks downwards at my crotch. 

I was completely dumbfounded. ""Sorry, I can't tell you that"" 

""Cmon, just tell me. How big is it?""
""No sorry, I'm not gonna answer that.""
""Cmon, please.""
""I don't think my girlfriend would appreciate me answering that""
""Trust me, she won't mind! ""
""No that's alright.""

I work at a car wash and it is next to a Walmart, so it tends to get pretty busy, especially in the winter time.  I really do enjoy my job, not because of the pay, but I like to be around my coworkers and my bosses.  We usually have 2 pre-washers washing the car, but since it wasn't very busy during the time, I was the only worker there, which was fine by me.  When cars come in, they have to follow the instructions such as ""Car in Neutral"" and ""Foot Off the Brake"" so they would not break our equipment.  After washing it, we would send them through the actual wash.

STORY:

On the 22nd, it was not a productive and busy day for the car wash, but here and there, cars will come through.  Anyways, when I'm done pre-washing the cars, some customers are appreciative of my work and would tip me.  Normal tips would range from $1-$5, but it's not a common thing.  If there are 2 workers at a time, then tips would be split at the end of the day, but since I was alone, I've kept all of the tips that day.

It was almost closing time and I was cleaning up the automatic wash inside when all of the sudden, I hear the bell (which means that a car is coming).  At the time, I was unpleasent with it because I would have to clean up the soap and the dirt again.  I let the car through and inside of the car was an older women ranging in her 70's-80's.  I gave her the instructions and then proceeded to wash her car.  After that, I was about to send her through when suddenly, she starts to talk to me.

Lady: ""Before you send me through, I just want to say thank you for washing my car.  I really appreciate it!""

Me:  ""No problem m'am!  You have a pretty nice car and I don't want to let that ride around the city dirty!""

Lady:  ""Here, let me give you a tip.""

*She then proceeds to take out a $100 bill and hands it to me*

Me:  ""No no no no no no, I think you meant to give me $1, this is $100""

Lady:  ""No, I meant to give to the $100, I rarely do this for some people, but I hardly see people actually enjoying their job and having a positive attitude.  I've came here a couple of times, but you might not remember me, but I remember that you always had that smile on your face and stuck with the positivity.  Think of it as my gift to you.  Have a wonderful Christmas!""



After that, I was totally speechless and I sent her off saying back 'Merry Christmas'.  I could not believe that someone gave me so much of a tip.  It happens rarely that people enjoy my enthusiasm and the fact that I enjoy my job.

So here's my advice - ""Be positive and do good things, and you'll soon recieve a great outcome.""",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_16aejh,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/16aejh/just_discovered_this_subreddit_and_want_to_share/,

I've worked here for quite a while, so I'm used to seeing the average grumpy/entitled/stuck up customer, and I'm usually more than happy to try to help them out however I can. One customer in particular has a reputation of being the neediest, most snobby customer that we know of. We'll call her Helen.

Helen was known at my store for taking advantage of every little relaxed bit of our store's policy. She's return what 2 feet of random moulding that she didn't use, bring back pvc pipe that had been cut down to only a few feet and expect the full price back (and she usually got it), sometimes even have an employee to almost literally follow her around and shop for her because ""she felt weak tonight, and she can't lift anything."" So enough of the bio, a story about her. There will probably be more about her later :)

I was working on the lot, which means I'm in charge of floating around the store getting whatever random tasks that needed to be done, done. I also am in charge of loading customers vehicles, and getting carts. One night Helen comes to our store, I see her black Hummer pull into the parking lot, and I immediately walk the other way hoping that I wouldn't have to deal with her that night.

Maybe an hour later, I assume after arguing with the returns desk about something miniscule, I get a call that ""a customer needs help loading 12 bags of the $1 topsoil."" Now, I'm thinking to myself ""please don't let it be Helen, please don't let it be Helen...""

I walk out to the pallet of topsoil and notice that there are *maayybbee* 14 bags on the pallet left. I check around back, and sure enough, that's our last bag of topsoil. I come back to the pallet to see one of my co-workers loading some bags into a black Hummer. ""Son of a..."" So I walk up and ask how many we're loading. ""12"" he says concisely. So I start to help him out.

We get down to the last 4 or 5 bags and I start to load one of them when all of a sudden Helen, who had been inspecting us the whole time, burst out ""I DON'T WANT THAT BAG OF SOIL, THAT'S GOT DIRT ALL OVER IT!""

me:""Well mam, they're all going to be a bit dirty, it's bags of dirt.""

H: ""I don't care, get me another bag""

me:""I'm sorry mam, but this is our last pallet and those other two bags have holes in them""

H: ""Do something about it, and take that other one out. It's got dirt on it too!"" She said, pointing at a bag my friend had just loaded. 


At this point, Helen finally turned around for a minute to pull out her phone. My coworker and I looked at each other and both silently agreed to load the remaining ""dirty bags"" into her car, hoping she wouldn't notice. 

Sure enough, she was none the wiser. We closed her back door and she moved toward her car door, no ""thank you"" or anything. I don't know what I expected, honestly. Before she left she did have the nerve to say, ""you know I'm gonna put in a complaint, this store always treats me like crap, everybody's got an attitude it seems!""

She promptly sped off into the night, and me and my coworker looked at each other and said ""Man I really hope she never comes back.""

New definition of Evil.  ,Set_the_Mighty,411,78,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1az8uw/corporate_just_changed_the_pricing_policy_new/,"So when I first started fixing lawn and garden equipment and vacuums for this company the diagnostic fee was $29.99 and the labor rates varied between product types.  After a bunch of years they changed to labor to $40 and instituted a flat labor rate of $64.99 but also instituted some tune up specials for mowers.  

Today they hit us with the news that the diagnostic fee will be $45 and the labor rate will be (wait for it...)  $110.  Holy fucking fucksticks.  Most of the product I work on cost *less* than $110 when it was new.  

Most customers are asked to pre-approve $110 (it was $80 prior to the $64.99 flat rate) because that leaves a good margin for parts costs and allowed us to fix product that had been pre-approved with out having to call and ask for approval.  

The company is out of its mind if it thinks customers are going to fork over $110 in labor costs.  Most customers are crazy to even fork over $45 just for a diagnosis which takes me all of 10 minutes on average.  Combine this with lack of reading comprehension on part of our customers and store employees and we will see customers sending product in only to decline the repair after I call em with an astronomically high repair cost.  The company will bleed even more customers.  

In case you think this is just an innocent increase in the cost of business, there is the added element of a pending outsourcing of my work to another company that was stupid enough to get in bed with my company.  So this change doesn't really effect my company but it sure does fuck the new guys who have an absurdly comical contract with some crazy work requirements to meet.  

Net result:  about 1k of my coworkers and I (nation wide) lose their jobs.

New company takes over the work load with an understanding that productivity and costs will be X but finds that they were lied to in the first place and now this change will reduce their productivity even more.

My company then fines its new repair company for breaching the contract and simultaneously forces customers to buy new product because it set the cost of fixing old product so high that it isn't worth doing.

""I am a Front Desk Agent""

I have advanced degrees in Accounting, Public Relations, Marketing, Business, Computer Science, Civil Engineering, and Swahili. I can also read minds.

Of course I have the reservation that you booked six years ago even though you don't have the confirmation number and you think it was made under a name that starts with ""S"".

It is completely my fault that the blizzard shut down the airport and you have to sleep in a warm king-size bed while 5000 of your co-travelers are sleeping in benches at the airport. I am sorry.


It is not a problem for me to give you seven connecting, non-smoking, poolside suites with two king beds in each, four roll-a-ways, 3 cribs, and yes, I can install a wet bar. I know it is my fault that we do not have a helicopter landing pad.

I am a Front Desk Agent. I am expected to speak all languages fluently. It is obvious to me that when you booked your reservation for Friday on the weekend we're sold out that you really meant Saturday. My company has entrusted me with all financial information and decisions, and yes, I am lying to you when I say we have no more rooms available. It is not a problem for me to quickly construct several more guest rooms. THIS time I will not forget the helicopter landing pad. And it is my fault that everyone wanted to stay here. I should have known you were coming in, even though you had no reservation. After all, you stay at our brand of hotel all the time, 300 nights a year, and this is only the first time you've ever been to our city.

I am a front desk agent. I am quite capable of checking three people in, two people out, taking five reservations, answering fifteen incoming calls, delivering six bath towels to room 625, plunging the toilet in room 101, and restocking the supply of pool towels, all at the same time. Yes, I will be glad to call the van driver and tell him to drive over all the cars stuck in traffic because you've been waiting at the airport for 15 minutes and you've got jet lag.

I am a front desk agent, an operator, a bellhop, houseman, guest service representative, housekeeper, sales coordinator, information specialist, entertainment critic, restauranteur, stock broker, referee, janitor, computer technician, plumber, ice-breaker, postman, babysitter, dispatcher, laundry cleaner, lifeguard, electrician, ambassador, personal fitness trainer, fax expert, human jukebox, domestic abuse counselor, and verbal punching bag. Yes, I know room 112 is not answering their phone. And of course I have their travel itinerary so I know exactly where they went when they left here 9 hours ago, and what their cell phone number is.

I always know where to find the best vegetarian-kosher-Mongolian-barbecue restaurants. I know exactly what to see and do in this city in fifteen minutes without spending any money and without getting caught in traffic. I take personal blame for airline food, traffic jams, rental car flat tires, and the nation's economy.

I realize that you meant to book your reservation here. People often confuse us with the Galaxy Delight Motel, Antarctica. Of course I can ""fit you in"" and yes, you may have the special $1 rate because you are affiliated with the Hoboken Accounting and Bagel Club.

I am expected to smile, empathize, sympathize, console, condole, upsell, downsell (and know when to do which), perform, sing, dance, fix the printer, and tell your friends that you're here. And I know exactly where 613 Possum Trot Lane is in the Way Out There subdivision that they just built last week.

Or 'the only time I had revenge on a bad customer',tactile_cacti,389,56,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1i2d7g/its_just_a_seat_and_some_handlebars_or_the_only/,"Hold onto your butts, kiddies! This is gonna be a long ride!

So I was working one of those big bike stores. You know, with tons of bike stuff, and a full service counter? I was an assembler and a jr mechanic at times (I was never good as the two older guys who worked there). Well, it was nearing the end of the day and the two older guys had left a bit early because they had finished all the big projects that day. I was left with some easy stuff (wheel changes, trip computer installation, and a few final builds to have out on the floor.

A guy comes in (Forshadowing!) and asks how much it would be to put on a seat and a handlebar on his bike. We, of course had our prices on a giant board, but most people don't look anyways, so I told him it would be around $20. He didn't seem very happy, but said that was ok. He says he will go get the bike out of his car.

What he brought in was a bike in a box. As in completely unassembled.

Me ""sir, this bike is in a box...""

Old Cranky Bastard (OCB) "" and?""

Me 'Sir, this is more than putting a seat and handlebars on a bike...""

OCB "" well, the wheels, but I was expecting you to do that for free"" (just the wheels would be a $5 service charge in itself...)

Me ""Well, sir, as you can see on our price board, a full assembly is $120...""

OCB ""WHAT?! That is NOT the price you quoted me!"" (What is this, an insurance company?!)

Me ""Sir, you told be it was just a seat and a handlebar. For a full assembly, we have to connect everything, make sure it all is in working order, and perform our safety check""

OCB ""I don't want any of that shit. Just put it fucking together.""

Me ""I am sorry, but I will have to charge you $120 for that. I can't bend the rules with the saftey checks""

OCB ""WHERE IS YOUR MANAGER?!""

Me ""he is at the front desk""

Now, this manager was a nice guy, not really a pushover or anything, but would tend to side with the customers on most things. He was pretty good at finding a compromise, however. 

A few miniuets later, the manager walks back and says ""why are you trying to charge 120 for a seat and handlebars?"" It's important to note that he sounded more confused as to why I was doing this than angry. I just pointed to the bike. In an old Peugeot box. Manager walks right back to the customer (who had stayed in the front). I don't go up there because I don't want to deal with this guy.

After a few minuets of yelling and grumbling, manager and the guy comes back. Manager says to assemble Thea bike, and we will give him a $20 discount to make the price 100. Now, I am not really happy that we had to cater to this guy, but I don't sign the checks. Doesn't really matter too much to me how much we make off of him. He still looks pissed however.

So, I get to work on this ancient Peugeot bike. I am super happy the screws and everything were in a little bag, because they were all older types we don't really carry (This is important). Anyways, after working on this bike for around 40 minuets, the guy storms back in and asks if we are finished yet. 

Of course we aren't! 

He then starts screaming at us to take it all apart, he found a different store that would do it all for 15 dollars. Then comes screaming, allegations of ripping him off, telling us that we are just wage monkeys (he actually said that haha).

My manager is pissed at this point and just wants him out. So he tells me to rip it apart and shoves it back in the box.

Which is exactly what I did. I took this thing apart in the most heinous way possible, shoving everything into the box. They guy had gone back out to his car to wait on us to take it apart. I was pissed at this dude for wasting my time. Manager was pissed for the lost time and money. Other employee was pissed because they guy was an assjack.

So, every fifth screw I took off disappeared into the garbage. Whoops. Looks like he will have to pay extra for specialty screws. I started to feel a little bad about it. Until I took the box out to his car. He told me I wouldn't amount to much and I just just serve burgers or something. He. Actually. Told. Me. That.

The icing on the cake was a phone call we got e next day from said other store. Apparently, he was saying that *we* would do it for less than them and they were flabbergasted. 

Guess what he had told them? 

That he had just wanted a seat and handlebars put on.

I talked about the time investment and how much there was to do in the game, concluding that price wise, it was a smart investment due to how long their grandson would play it.

I work at a pet store, in case you haven't seen my other posts. This just happened today, so it's fresh in my mind.

Background: one customer of mine (we'll call her Gerbil Lady/GL) is exceptionally difficult to work with. About a month ago, this lady came in wanting to buy a couple gerbils, and I could tell right off the bat that she had no business keeping an animal, much less raising kids (she has 2). I followed this lady around the store for a full **90 minutes** explaining her to what she needed for a gerbil, and the exact cost of it all, while she recorded every single detail I said in her little notebook. I must have repeated everything I said 15 times before she finally bought the absolute bare minimum supplies she needed for these things. She whined and complained the entire time about how she didn't have the money for these things and only wanted to buy what was absolutely necessary, then almost threw a fit when her total was 5 cents more than what I had calculated for her. Now, when she comes to the store, she does nothing but complain about how bad those gerbils smell (i.e. she's not cleaning their cage). This lady was a few fries short of a Happy Meal, to say the least. Now then, fast forward to today.

GL comes in again, this time wanting a guinea pig. Again, she wants only the bare minimum and wants to keep the pig in a small glass aquarium. Again, I followed her around for about 30 minutes, thoroughly explaining that g-pigs CANNOT live in a small, enclosed, glass box, and showed her all of the larger wire cages that would be perfect for a g-pig. She decided we were too expensive, so she left for another store. I found my manager at this point and explained to him exactly why I would not sell another animal to this woman, and he seemed to side with me on it.

Now, I am no animal rights activist. I realize I most likely sell countless animals each day that are forced to live in sub-optimal conditions, but I always do everything I can to inform my customers of what the animal needs to not just survive, but thrive. But when it comes to people like this lady that don't have a bloody clue how to care for an animal, and downright refuses to listen to any advice I give, I'll straight up refuse to sell them anything.

Later on, she comes back for the pig, all excited because she found a 10 gallon aquarium at another store for .50 cents cheaper than ours (nevermind the fact she probably burned $5 of gas going back and forth to the other store). When she tells me this, I tell her there's no way I'm going to subject a guinea pig to a life, however short it will be, in a tiny glass box that it won't even be able to turn around in. At this point, she flips out.

GL: So you're saying you won't sell me the guinea pig?

Me: I'm saying that there's no way a guinea pig will survive in a tank that small.

GL: Well I've kept 3 guinea pigs before, so I'm an expert on them. I know it will be fine.

Me: I've worked here for 7 years, I've kept *hundreds* of pigs in that time. I don't care what the other store told you, I'm telling you it won't work.

GL: So you won't sell me the guinea pig then. I want to see a manager.

So I go and get my manager, reminding him of everything I told him earlier. He and GL talk for a few minutes at the front of the store, then he brings her back to the animal room and tells me to box up the pig. I couldn't believe it. I gave him the box and walked away until she paid for the pig and left. Afterward, my manager came back to talk to me.

Me: I don't know what she said to you to make you sell that pig to her, but WHEN, not if, when she comes back to complain about that pig dying, I'm going to say ""I told you so"" and point her your way. I've said all I'm going to say about it.

So needless to say, I was pissed. I'm still pissed. Not even so much because I know that guinea pig was sentenced to a short, cruel life, but because my manager KNEW exactly what he was doing, and even agreed with me that we wouldn't sell the pig to her, and then he did it anyway.

I guess making a few extra $$ is more important than making sure an animal is sent to a decent home. 

So again, sorry for the long rant, but I needed to vent.

My boss hired a guy we'll call Mike four months ago. He was always kind of weird, but it never bothered anyone. About two months ago, he started showing up late or calling off pretty frequently, maybe once a week. Every time I asked him about it, he'd just shrug and say ""It's not big deal"".

Two weeks ago, I was in the cooler stocking when I see through the glass a lady getting visibly upset with Mike. I step out, ask what's happening. Apparently the lady had called in a pizza order while I was in the cooler and Mike had forgotten to make it. I apologized to her and offered her a free pizza but she stormed out. I asked Mike about it. He shrugged and said ""It's not a big deal.""

The next day, his drawer was off three hundred dollars. ""It's not a big deal"".

Tried to sell burnt-black breadsticks. ""It's not a big deal"".

This past week has been hell on everyone at the gas station. One of the girls tore her ACL and will be off for a month, my boss was scheduled to have surgery, one of our closers got step throat, and two of the first shifters were going on vacation. Boss was sick of Mike's bullshit and tried to fire him on Monday. He apparently started crying, and begged for his job. He said he was ""in a bad groove"" and that he can do better. The boss said he had until Friday to prove that he still wanted his job and that he'd have to come in when she called him since we were so short handed.

He came in on time Monday and worked a double. We were all optimistic that he'd been serious about changing. But then...

Tues: calls in five minutes before his shift, says he's at a benefit and will be late. Shows up four hours later.

Wed: fifteen minutes late; no call. Asks coworker to work Thurs for him, which they can't. 

Thurs: calls in two hours before shift, says he rolled his ankle. Assisant manager tells him without a doctor note he has to come in as there is no one else to work. He refuses and hangs up the phone.

Fri: ankle hurts too much to come in. Pictures surface on facebook of him taking his girlfriend to dinner Thursday night.

Sat: Comes in on time limping hard. Limp goes away when he thinks assistant manager is gone, but she's really in the office watching cameras.

Sun: Five minutes after his shift starts, quits via phone.

From 3-7pm I was completely alone in the gas station until a replacement came in. 4-5pm is one of the busiest times on Sundays. I had to make 5 pizzas in half an hour while ringing up costumers. And he had the GALL to show up around close to buy lottery tickets. Wtf.

TL;DR: you can't fix stupid

EDIT: The 300 dollars wasn't physically missing. When the manager went through his paperwork the next day, she found it. What most likely happened is he miscounted his safe drops or entered them into the computer wrong. It happens every now and then, but it's usually only ~$20.

Normally traffic is slow enough that there is only one barista on at a time; however, our owner tried an experiment a while back. Two employees would be on at the same time in the morning, so one would be available to deliver to the businesses around us whose employees are our best customers. That's when I was hired.


Unfortunately, that's when she was too. 


Don't get me wrong, she was a genuinely nice person with a big heart. But she made working with her a living nightmare. I've never collected all this stuff in one place before, but here goes.


---
She was in her thirties, and had been an assistant manager at the last coffee shop she worked at. She complained about our policies and compared the way we did things at our (laid-back, low-volume) coffee shop to the way her last (corporate, high-volume) coffee shop had from Day One. Constantly. She had ideas of how to fix our problems before she knew what our problems were.


---
She talked non-stop, and was high-energy the entire time. I was a bright, happy college girl and I couldn't keep up with her. After a while she just seemed manic. And she had no boundaries. 


She was not from the Midwest, and felt that our cultural reticence in discussing personal matters was a widespread character flaw. By day three of working with her I knew about her husband's porn addiction and her extreme displeasure. I knew about her difficult periods and medical issues. (""I once passed a clot of blood as big as my fist!"") 


Whenever I expressed a boundary (""I'm really sorry, but I can't give you advice there, I think that should be between you and your husband."") she either barreled right past it (""No, really, what would you do? Take away the internet?"") or spent the next half hour trying to psychoanalyze *why* I had that boundary, like so:


She once told a story that involved descriptions of being spanked as a child; my family has a long history of abuse and I was uncomfortable with the topic. So, not wanting to get into any sort of ""is spanking abuse or not"" debate, but not wanting to hear it, either, I just flat-out told her ""I'm actually really uncomforable with this topic. Can we please talk about something else?"" She spent the next half hour telling me it was okay if I wanted to talk to her! She was a great listener! Why was I uncomfortable with spanking? She didn't think spanking a bad thing! (Maybe not for you. For my family, it was. Leave it the fuck alone. I thought you said you were a good listener.) Why didn't I want to talk about it? Her last manager told her she had a great big heart and was a natural leader! I should feel free to talk to her about anything! 


Kill me.


---
That was another thing. This co-worker's self-image was one of a good listener, a clear communicator, and a ""natural leader"" -- because her boss at the last coffeeshop she worked at had told her so. Maybe it was true there. Her high energy and outgoing conversation may have been perfect for the high-volume, quick interactions at the last place she worked. But it was so out of place where we worked it wasn't even funny. She made customers uncomfortable by getting too personal, too fast. (Her husband's porn addiction. Her father's dying words. Her Pagan religious beliefs. The untimely deaths in a car crash of a friend's children.) She didn't listen when it was hinted, suggested, or said flat-out that she was making people uncomfortable. She was everyone's best friend. Immediately. So she was no one's best friend.


---
The final straw for me, when I stopped defending her in my head and just switched to ""you have to work with her, you don't have to like her"", was when two different incidents happened on the same day.


Incident one: 


We have been working together for eight months, every  M-F morning. We initial all kinds of things in our day-to-day routine: food we make, bathrooms we clean, duty sheets we check off. She was busy with a customer, so I asked if she wanted me to initial the food she'd just finished and put it in the display case. She said it would be great. So, I initial ""WTF"" (initials changed for anonymity) and put the food up. 


She finishes with the customer, and comes back to the food prep area. ""Oh, I forgot to tell you!"" she says. ""My initials are double-you, tee, eff."" 


""I know,"" I smiled. ""Wilhimina Theresa Faust.""


She recoiled. ""How do you know that?!""


""Um, we put our initials on everything? And you told me your middle name a couple of times.""


""Wow, you're so observant, I just know your first name. Wouldn't know your middle or last if it bit me!"" she laughs.


I look around at my initials all over the store. I think about all the conversations we've had, one about the meaning of our names. I think about how when I introduce myself, I use my full name. Every time.


Incident two:


Our coffeeshop gives a percent-of-profit donation to a charity that supports local cancer patients. So sometimes when people notice the sign that says that, cancer comes up as a topic. We're close enough to the hospital that every once in a great while, someone comes in from there, notices our sign, and gets really emotional: maybe someone's in the hospital fighting cancer, maybe someone just died. It's a hard thing to handle: I aim for gentle smiles, handing them a napkin, asking if there's anything else they need. Sometimes gentle commiseration -- ""It's so hard, I'm sorry, my father died when I was young, I know, it's so hard. Can I get you a glass of water? Would you like to sit down?""


So. The topic of cancer comes up sometimes. I knew that my co-worker had three people in her family die of cancer, because she talked about them, at every possible opportunity, every time a customer mentioned the word ""cancer"": three rather distant relatives. I could have told you their names.


We'd had several conversations about cancer, after an emotional customer had left. She'd talked about her three rather distant relatives, and how hard her mom had taken their deaths. I'd talked about my father, a little bit, especially when we first started working and I was trying to open up to her a little to match our communication better. I'd also talked about my grandparents, all of whom had died in the last few years as well, three of cancer. The point is, my father's death, and the deaths of my grandparents, had come up. Multiple times. I kept it kind of light and moved on quickly, but it had come up.


So this day, this same day when I realized she didn't remember my full name, which I use daily, after eight months working together, a customer comes in, notices our cancer charity sign, says a family member is in the hospital and she's really grateful we do this. 


""Yes, it's so important, I had [three distant family members] die of cancer and etc etc"" my co-worker says. I smile, I nod, I make the customer's latte.


After the customer leaves, my co-worker says: ""It's so difficult. I miss them so much.""


I smile a little at her. Maybe I'm just being too harsh on her, like usual. ""I know,"" I said. ""I miss my dad too. Even after all this time.""


""What?"" she says. ""Your father is dead? I didn't know that! Oh, but [her three distant relatives], it was so hard on my mother.""


OH. MY GOD.


And that was the day I stopped trying to get along with my co-worker and started focusing on getting through the day instead.

This will make more sense to those that are familiar with the Harry Potter series. Even if you've just read the books, the foster family Harry stays with throughout the series that abused him, keep them in mind. Think of these people as them, only not reprehensible abusers, and more gluttonous and oblivious to moral and social standing. They had thick English accents, but hailed from South Africa.

One average Saturday, I'm working the floor and attending registers when needed. In comes this large fellow with greying blonde hair, and his 2 children. Child 1(C1) seemed to be about 13-14 and large for his age, physical description is irrelevant here. Child 2(C2) appeared to be around 9-10.

C1 was immature definitely, but more restrained than his younger brother.

The father approaches us on the floor, I believe to our GM at first. They stated something along the lines of ""we are interested in that new xbox system that just came out."" He was helped, given good customer service, information about the products he was looking for, etc.

While this was going on, C1 and C2 were bickering, being snotty, and whining about being in a ""poor area."" These kids were poorly-raised, unrestrained, and on a path to being a detriment to society. I still hope that something whips them into shape, or they get some sense knocked into them. I still wonder what they're like now.

I eventually was helping the father out, as I was huge into Xbox360 when it came out and was suited to helping make a better sale. I tell him about all the ""hot"" games, tell him his kids would have a better experience if they bought X and Y accessories(controllers, charge packs, extra headset, etc). The entire time he stood with his eyes 3/4 of the way open and spoke with an accent I've only heard in BBC shows set in the late 1800s, that ""g'faw whatever"" kind of tone.

I couldn't care less about their attitude, as they were set to buy more than half a grand at that point.

It was clear he was elitist, and money was irrelevant to him. That was our ""ok fuck this fellow, let's bleed him dry"" cue. C1 and C2 were bickering that they wanted certain games, and the father's response was pretty much to have them bring everything up and he'll buy it, no effort of parenting, just giving them what they wanted.

This was a huge deal in terms of sales for us, so I made sure I took everything we helped them pick out, and I made sure to check them out personally. I tell the father about our membership that could cut the price down for him. I was a bit sleazy in this regard, making it sound like I was doing him a favor because he was special to us, and he bought it. This guy was a gullible snob.

I've stated in a previous post that our membership costs $25 for a year, and gives an automatic 10% discount until it expires. Spending $250 at a purchase usually meant free membership + 10% for a year. If you spent more than $250, this mathematically you got the membership + discount for free **and** got some extra taken off your purchase.

You could not get discounts off systems, xbox360 in this situation specifically. Even despite the xbox console, this guy was buying his bratty kids an xbox, 3 controllers, extra charge packs, headsets, an HDMI cable, and a mountain of games. His total was close to a grand. The effort to get him to spend this took less than 15 min, he was simply throwing money around to appease his undisciplined and spoiled kids.

I easily get him to sign up as I make it seem like he is an esteemed customer and were humbled by his patronage. In a sense we were, he raised our sales for the day nicely.

I sign him up for the membership, which took quite a bit off his order, and we bagged his massive order and they left the store, bratty kids still acting snobbish.

Not too much later, they're back in the store, kids looking like they're fuming.

C1 and C2 are bickering, and their father is ineffectually trying to calm them down. He is trying to quell an argument between the 2 brats. Basically the argument elaborated that the xbox was to be shared between the 2 of them, however, C2 thought he should have his own xbox and tv. This spoiled argument lasted a few minutes, the most notable sentence that is burned in my mind to this day. Imagine the most snotty, entitled, English accent: ""But da-Ddy, I want my OWN ex-box!"" I can't begin to describe how bratty that came out as.

Morally, I was disgusted, but as far as my store was concerned, whatever.

We ended up close to duplicating the order this man just purchased. He dropped money like it was nothing. He caved in to his whiny and spoiled kids and further reinforced those negative aspects. In the end this guy dropped well over a grand, and gave both of his kids each an xbox360, and compliments of accessories and piles of games. 

We made out like bandits that day, but we were all simultaneously disgusted with their behavior.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_16ezgl,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/16ezgl/but_daddy_i_want_my_own_exbox/,

Hello everyone. I've been lurking for a while and I figured I would share some of my experiences in the wonderful world of retail.

A word of warning: ACHTUNG!

And a now few more: If you are in a hurry, your mom has asked you twice already to mow the lawn, or you are on the toilet thinking ""just one more post and then I'll get back to work"", I urge you to save this for later, it is quite long.

Oh and also if you are at any point offended by incorrect use of gay, lesbian, bi, transgender, straight, lgbt or anything else for that matter, I apologize in advance. I am pretty liberal when it comes to the use of these words, that does not mean I don't know how other people feel about this.

Now then, let's get to it! I work at a gay bar. The only gay bar in fact in a 70 km radius, that's 43.5 miles for the Americans and 37.8 nautical miles for the sailors.

This is a pretty small bar, I'd say you could fit about 60 people in there, but there would be some sore toes and bruised elbows in the morning. Because the bar is so small and it's a long way to the next gay bar, it was decided that we would host big parties every month at a separate location.

In 2008 I started working at the bar. I started out as a lowly bartender, I then begun to bartend at the parties, soon I became a shift manager both at the bar and parties, then on to further fame as a manager of the bar and in the end I moved on to being in charge of planning and hosting the parties. 

It was a swift climb through the ranks and I would be lying if I said I didn't leave some sore souls in my wake. However I was never in it for the power, I just worked hard and people recognized that.

Now that my life story is done, I would like to tell you about some of the people that come to the bar. Some regulars, and just some general types of people.

The Regulars:

note: I call our regulars by their standard orders. I am terrible with names and faces, so describing someone to a coworker can be difficult. Thus simply stating ""you know, coke in a glass with lime was in here earlier asking for you"" is much easier.

**Pilsner and a Glass:** This is a 60 year old, slightly overweight guy trolling for young meat. And when I say young, I mean young! He will sniff out any guy who's hardly told ma and pa about his new found love of sausage yet, and viciously attack with offers of drinks and a ride home.

There are plenty of these kind of guys around, but what makes this specimen interesting is, he never scores. I have worked at that bar for five years. I have seen even the most hopeless cases get lucky once in a while, but Pilsner and a glass? Never!

You would think he would try for something else sometime, but no, he is determined. Poor sod.

**Double Scotch and Coke:** This guy never gets anything else, never! We have a few of those people, those who will get the same thing every time. Good on them, they know what they like. But this guy, he messes with one of my pet peeves. 

You see I can't stand it when people call Jack Daniels scotch. Why? Because it's wrong, that's why! You know why it's called a scotch? BECAUSE IT'S FROM SCOTLAND! Where is Jack Daniels from? Tennessee! Is Tennessee in Scotland? NO! So don't call it a scotch!

But this guy INSISTS on saying ""a double scotch and coke"". And every time I ask him ""Jack Daniels?"" and he reples ""yes"".
I have tried to explain, kindly, jokingly, even slightly annoyed, but it doesn't work. 

So one day, when he wasn't looking, I made his drink with actual scotch and he actually did a spit-take! I have never seen anyone else do that, ever. But he did it and he looked at me with disbelief and tears in his eyes and choked out ""This coke's gone bad!"". Sigh... 

That was a couple of regulars, I have many more if you would like to hear about them.

Now for the types. I would very much like to tell you about a specific type of people. **The straight guys**, or the lads. 

The straight guys are a group of 3-6 guys out on the town. They're at the sports bar around the corner and have already had a few rounds. As they are sitting there talking up their egos by counting just how many girls they've banged this past week, one of them speaks up 

**Lad#1:** ""You know what we should do? You fucking know what we should do? You know that fag place around the corner? yeah? We should go there and scare some queers!""

**Lad#2:** ""Fuck yeah! Let's bash some stinking fags!""

**Lad#3:** ""Let's do this!""

So they drink up and, egging each other on, almost run out of the sports bar. They walk briskly towards the corner, but the minute they round it, they slow down. They begin to think, individually, that maybe this isn't such a good idea. But they can't let their mates know, so they keep on walking.

In the end they make it to the door, and one of them pushes out his chest and goes for the handle. They walk in, looking around shyly. 

They have entered a gay bar, this is unknown territory and must be surveyed carefully. ""Oh god I hope no one sees me in here"" thinks one, another ""Oh god I hope no one hits on me"" and maybe the third lad thinks to himself ""That guy's kinda cute"".

When they have entered the bar there are, in my experience, three possible outcomes:

**1:** They are aggressive and antagonizing, may even end up throwing a punch before they are kicked out.

**2:** They are aggressive and antagonizing, until one of them spots the big bowl of free condoms. They each grab a handful and leave quickly, looking both ways to see no one saw them.

**3:** My personal favorite. They are a bit uncomfortable, but one of them declares ""This seems like a nice place"" and buys a round for his mates. They usually sit at the bar and you get a good talk. They may even come back once in a while just because they like the atmosphere.

There are a million types; The bears, the powder puffs, the faghags, the straight girls, the baby dykes, the alternatives, the fazes and so many more.

This week I retired from retail. 

I’m going to share with you the craziest story of my time in retail jail. Until this week I was not allowed to discuss this with anyone outside of the people who already knew about it.  This took place in 2004. This story is going to be one of the longer things you have ever read on Reddit. Sorry. 

A middle-aged, smallish man with white hair comes into my store. He lurks a bit but finally picks me out of the small handful of sales staff. He is a salesman’s wet dream. ""I'm short on time and I need to spend a lot of money. I'm going to tell you what I want and you're going to get it for me."" 

He had me gather items from all corners of the store. I was grinning so hard my face hurt, as was my manager. ""Get me this!! Throw these in there!!!"" He danced behind me, laughing, dancing, totally enthralled.  My manager was calling district people and giving other associates high-fives, all the while completely unaware that this man was a certified nut-job. I will get to that later. 

We gathered up over $20,000 dollars worth of merchandise in a period of about an hour. Yes, TWENTY-THOUSAND DOLLARS. After the first hour, I got my first indication that something was amiss. He asked me to collect $500 dollars worth of CDs. ""What type?"" I asked. He got agitated and threatened to walk-out. I promptly drove the buggy to the music department and started raking in CDs to appease him.  This big fish was not getting loose. ""This enough???"" I shouted over my shoulder. It seemed to appease him for a moment, but I realized our time was getting sort so I made my way to the check-out lane.  

At this point I had an entire support staff at my fingers, including two managers and several cashiers.  While they were scanning, I was trying my best to keep his attention, doing my little monkey song-and-dance to keep him from crashing. It was a delicate time but we finally got to the point where I take payment. I thought I was in the clear, but little did I know the story was just beginning.  At this point I get my second clue that something was amiss. He decides to pay with an AMEX card, but he is fidgety...and refuses to show ID. I assume the card is stolen. I look at my managers and they assume the worst. We take a break and huddle in the back.

""If we check his ID and its good, we're in the clear. So long as he has an ID that matches, we're good."" Says manager 1. Manager 2 is more apprehensive. He says we bail. This obviously reeks of something. Undeterred, I tell them that ""I'm going to land this one for the store."" I'm blinded by greed.

I go back out and almost literally throw myself at Mr. So-and-so's feet. ""Sir! Oh Sir I've done all I can do-- but we MUST have ID... it isn't MY policy... Lord no! I like you and I know you're just tired but...but..."" I beg. He finally relents.  I hold my breath for a moment and... Miraculously the ID matches the name on the card! Huzzah! I laugh and apologize about ten times while I swipe the card.

It gets declined. Every. Single. Time. 

The man is moving away from the register at this point. I flip. I say, ""Sir, I know this is a BIG mistake. I'm calling AMEX RIGHT NOW and we're getting this sorted out!! Before he knows it I have put a bottle of water in his hand, a seat underneath his ass, and I'm calling the AMEX number on the back of his card.

""What seems to be the problem, sir?"" they ask.  I clean up the story a bit and tell them that our customer, Mr. So-and-so, would like to make a purchase. Things are fine until they ask to speak with him.  He is slurring his speech and genuinely sounds drunk at this point. This has become a horrible idea.  I'm starting to get sick to my stomach when Mr. So-and-so hands me the phone. They want to talk to ME. 

Long story short they say that there is a problem with the card, but they assure me Mr. So-and-so's credit is GOOD. I'm to do a *manual* copy of the transaction, and I'm assured it will go through. Mr. So-and-so has regained some of his earlier giddyness. ""Let's do this!"" he exclaims. 

At this point, we are TERRIFIED. A manual card transaction, at over $20,000 dollars, will completely ruin our entire store if it doesn't go through. We will have to explain to the district manager why we let a bumbling, psychotic, possibly drunk &amp; high person walk out of our store with $20,000 dollars worth of merchandise.  We realize that we will all lose our jobs if this goes sour. I'm checked-out at this point. I want to be anywhere but here. I am ready to call the whole thing off when Manager 1 gets greedy. 

""Tell him we can only do $10,000 dollars on the card."" He says.  ""We will mitigate our losses. If we win, we make budget for the week.  If we lose, we can at least say that we tried to play it smart.""  *This is anything but smart.*  They are begging me to go back out and talk to the guy.  He won't speak to anyone but me, and he's almost out of water. I relent.

""SSSIIIR..."" I throw myself at his feet again.  I detail exactly why we were suspicious, what the AMEX people said, and why we were apprehensive... and beg. He doesn't blink an eye. ""OK!"" He says.

WHAT? This can't be happening... But it is. 

There is one caveat to his agreement.  We aren't taking away $10,000 dollars.  We're dividing the transaction in two, and we're putting **another five grand** on the second transaction, and putting it onto another card. Why? I have no idea. The craziest part is this -- *he doesn't care where what we use to add the $5000 dollars.* 

Now, for the sake of not writing about A DOZEN other paragraphs I will say this: We did it.  It was dirty, it was filthy, it stank to high heaven, but we did it.  We ran $10,000 dollars on one card and $15,000 on another. Where did we pull $5000 dollars from? Services. We offered to send someone out to set ALL THIS STUFF UP for him, and it came to $5000 dollars. 

Now, here's the craziest part. This is where this story goes from weird to **absolutely insane.** He didn't have a home, he was traveling... So **he asked us if we could do the setup in a HOTEL ROOM.**

WE AGREED.  We agreed and the only stipulation was that it had to be performed THAT DAY. TWO HOURS LATER. 

At this point I will pause, and I will swear to you this story is 100% true. I have people (too many) that can corroborate this series of events. I still get ridden over this story to this day, and this was YEARS ago. Why me? **Because I'm the guy that he wanted to set it all up. and I agreed.**

Again, so I don't type another DOZEN PARAGRAPHS I will skip forward. I go out, in MY car. My stipulation was that I take someone with me -- My second in command. He is not having any of this but I practically force him into the car with me. On the way he has somewhat of a freak-out and I tell him to just wait in the car. We get to the hotel and THANK GOD his room is on the lower level. I park DIRECTLY in-front of the door and I tell Sam (not his real name) that IF HE SHUTS THE DOOR to the hotel room or IF I AM GONE MORE THAN ONE HOUR, he is to CALL MY MANAGER. Then CALL THE COPS. 

I knock on the door. I can see Sam's face and he is near tears, biting his fingernails. The guy comes to the door. He smiles, seems much calmer than earlier... but he CLOSES THE DOOR BEHIND US! At this point I notice something very strange... He  has *cases* of water, and I mean *cases* of water, stacked as high as I am, 6 feet, throughout the room. Then, this happens:

""retailjail, can I ask you a question and you not get upset?""

""Well, Mr. So-and-so, I have to say that this is all really weird, and I think maybe we've made a mistake.""

""No. There are no mistakes. Me meeting you today was not a mistake. That's the reason I bought all that crap from you today. Because, honestly and truly, there are no mistakes, and I know that you will help me. Do you believe in God? Are you a Christian, retailjail?""

Holy shit. Here it is.  This guy is going to KILL ME! Without speaking I turn for the door and open it. Sam sees me and I see him, and later he said that my face was pale as a sheet. I was terrified. 

Mr. So-and-so realizes that I'm genuinely terrified. ""retailjail, I think I've scared you. Now I'm sorry -- Please, you can stand there, but just hear me out -- I promise I won't hurt you.""

I'm frozen in place. I can't move, even if I wanted to. Bear in mind I'm 6'5 and weigh about 230 pounds. I'm terrified. 

""Over there, on the TV -- I want you to look --""

On top of the TV, I shit you not, there is a stack of hundred-dollar bills about as high as a soda can. Granted I couldn't see them all, but the implication was there. I had no reason to doubt him because, well, this guy was absolutely NUTS! Why wouldn't he have a stack of hundred-dollar bills as high as a soda can sitting on his TV?

""I want you to take that and give it to The Church."" He says calmly. ""Any church. Any church that believes in God. Take some for yourself, too. That's why I brought you here. This is the only way I can do it. You gotta take that money and GIVE IT TO THE CHURCH!""

Bam. Something clicked in me, the flight instinct kicked in. Before I knew it I was in the car, just driving. I was laughing, too. Sam was freaking OUT. he kept asking questions and I kept laughing. I made it a few miles and stopped the car. We just sat there for a few moments, not talking, just looking at each other. I was still laughing a bit. 

""That guy was F*ucking nuts."" I said. 

**Epilogue** Mr. So-and-so was an escaped mental patient. His wife had cheated on him and he had gone CRAZY the day before. In a short amount of time, he had cleaned out his bank account and headed down South. We found this out because, once I got back to the store, I had a message to call THE POLICE in PHILLY. He had been reported missing and they were looking for him. They had a watch on his accounts, and when we ran his AMEX it flagged him. They took their sweet time calling us, and when they finally did I was already at the hotel. I was told that about 5 minutes after Sam and I left the hotel, our local PD had arrived and taken him into protective custody. 

As if this story wasn’t weird enough, this: We got a courtesy call from the man’s lawyer the next day. He wanted us to know that **none of the merchandise was being returned** and that he **was very sorry for the trouble.** Our district manager called me and basically told me not to ever discuss what happened and assured me that everything was legal and taken care of. 

TL;DR – Crazy rich man comes into our store and blows $25,000 dollars on stuff. Turns out he’s crazy. I probably came very close to being murdered and turned into a lamp shade. He doesn’t return a thing and apologizes by way of his lawyer.

Here's one of my more interesting ones.

Yesterday, I was getting the store ready for closing (straightening up and adding phone accessories, turning lights off, closing blinds), and a customer came walking in at five minutes to close, wanting to buy a new phone, which commonly takes fifteen to twenty minutes, from getting the phone and SIM card to the payment.

He said that he needed the phone to be fully activated before his supper reservations, which were in five minutes at six o'clock. I said that it takes between fifteen to twenty minutes for the phone to be fully set up and paid for, and that we were also about to close and our computers were shutting down. He then asked if I could just set the phone up, and he could come back the next day to sign the contract papers and pay for it. I replied that we cannot do this, because it goes against company security and I'm not going to allow someone to leave the store with a brand new phone without paying.

He was absolutely FURIOUS. He said that the other man he spoke to earlier approved this(I'm the only male that has been working in this store for the last three years. It's only a four person staff) and then he demanded I get my manager for him(she wasn't there, she was 80 km away at the other store she manages in the next town over).

So he eventually left, and I closed up without any issues and called my manager and let her know what happened in case he came in the next day. The next day, five minutes before we opened, he was at the front door, waiting for us to open. Once I went to the front and unlocked it, he stomped right in, and spoke to my manager about my service last night. He changed the rules to make it sound like I offered to break the rules for him, but he refused because he wouldn't ""feel right"" about doing that. Fortunately, my manager didn't believe his story, because apparently he had tried the same trick before.

TL;DR:
Customer demands phone five min before closing, wants me to break company rules, comes back in next day and tries to get me in trouble with manager, along with blaming an imaginary coworker.

As I've mentioned elsewhere, the gas station I worked at had a car wash as well.  But few stories came out of that place, because it was almost simple enough that even the dumbest of customers couldn't screw it up.  Dirty car goes in one end, spray it with various things, clean car comes out the other end.  The interaction with the customers was very limited, so there wasn't much of a chance for yelling.  Pretty sweet gig in retail terms, if you didn't mind being wet all day and smelling like the underside of a soap dish.

But notice I said ""almost.""

The wash itself was a series of arching in a long tunnel, through which ran an endless loop chain that would catch a car's tire and push it forward through the pre-programmed sprayers.  The prepper was the first guy, he stood at the front, guided the cars into the correct position, took their payment or proof of payment, then sprayed down the car with a pressure hose and started the conveyor.  And always, ALWAYS, the prepper would tell the customer to take the car out of gear and keep their foot off the brake.  Not exactly hard instructions.  They were also posted on both sides of the tunnel entrance, hanging from the tunnel roof, and on a sign next to the ""Come on in!"" sign at the beginning.

But apparently, Mr Imtooimportanttoread McStupidpants couldn't quite get that concept through his head one day.  That day I was a dryer, I stood at the other end with two supposedly clean towels and wiped the water/chemicals off the car when it came out from under the blowers.  So I didn't see or hear exactly what was said between our prepper and our errant driver, but I know that the prepper, who'd been doing this job for three years 5 days a week, never strayed from his script.

Well, the verbal reminder and warnings in bright colors didn't seem to stop this guy from leaving his car in drive instead of neutral.  Because as soon as the prepper got out of the way, this guy's car shot down the tunnel at much higher than the 0.75mph they normally went.

And before you ask, no, the tunnel wasn't empty.  There was \*gasp\* *another vehicle there.*  Ooooo, foreshadowing!!

This other car was quite a bit larger than Sir MentallyIncompetent's.  A rather large and jacked up 4x4 pickup, in fact.  With a hitch receiver sticking out the rear end, much like the spear of a Roman Legionnaire.  That rather stout square tube of metal was aimed right at the heart of our anti-hero's car, and before you could do your best Vladimir Kulich ""PUT YOUR FOOT ON IT, AND STAND,"" the receiver buried itself up to the hilt smack in the middle of the poor car's hood.  And then, like any good warrior, it twisted the blade as the car continued forward, gouging a furrow through the metal 2"" wide and at least a foot long.

Oh, and did I mention that our now-victim car was a Corvette from about 2002?  I didn't?  I apologize, that detail seems kind of important now, doesn't it?

The force of the impact moved the truck just enough so that it was out the end of the tunnel, with the Corvette right in the middle of the blowers.  The other dryer ran over and hit the emergency stop while I stood in mute amazement and amusement.  Dude just screwed up his 'Vette, yo, that's funny.

Out jumps Lord High Marshall Douchebag and immediately lays into the two of us, instantly claiming that the car wash forced him into the truck (which isn't possible) and that the station was going to pay for the damages (which we weren't).  I tried to explain that there isn't any possible way that could happen (it would be like slowly pulling a rope and having the other end jump up and whack you in the face) but he wasn't going to have anything to do with facts.  After all, he's the customer!!  Or some such nonsense.

The driver of the truck steps out, in a rather slow and sedate manner befitting his good ol' boy persona.  He perused the damages, saw that nothing had really been done to his truck other than some scraped paint on the receiver, and declared that he was going to call his insurance carrier.  Rear Admiral Asshole says the same, whipping out his phone and taking lots of pictures first.  Ok, big deal, at least they seem to be treating it like adults.  The car wash is going to be shut down for a while anyway, as was policy whenever they was an accident down there.  I went back to the drying room and sat down to read.  Which was enjoyable, until a cop's face poked around the doorframe and asked to speak with me.

So someone decided that law enforcement needed to be involved.  Wonderful.  The cop asks me if it was possible for the car wash to push the car forward like Prince Moron of Peebles was stating.  I said no, it wasn't possible, and showed the officer how our mechanism worked.  Meanwhile we're still hearing ranting and raving about how this was all our fault.

Finally the officer has enough.  He tells the guy off for wasting police time, that there wasn't any way for the car wash to do what he claimed it could do.  Besides, the cops ran their cars through our wash, they all knew how it worked anyway, and that his attitude needed some serious adjusting.  The officer was going to write the report, and then send everyone on their way.  The truck driver stood there, nodding slowly and saying ""yes, sir"" occasionally, like this was all routine and nothing to get worked up over.  The Vapid 'Vette Vermin, however, was spluttering like a pot of chili trying to boil over.  The truck driver left placidly, but not before I went up and apologized for the other guy's arrogant and assholeish behavior.  He told me not to worry, his truck was fine, and that some people just needed to flip out at things.  I liked him.

The Corvette Cockbag then drove his beloved car a few feet away from the car wash, partially blocking the parking lot for the gas station, mind you, and called for a tow truck.  Really?  For a hole in your hood?  Wow, dude.  Finally the tow arrives, and with a finally threat of legal action for damages, he leaves.  Good riddance.

Of course, the next day, guess who shows up demanding to speak with the owner with various litigious paperwork in hand?  No, not Pauly Shore.  But after the owner pulled up the video that pretty clearly showed the car moving much faster than the chain, and saying that there was no way they were going to pay for the damages incurred by the user's stupidity, he gave up in exasperation.  Never did see the guy again, however I understand that his lawyer called the station owner several times, but the owner was adamant that we wouldn't be paying out and that he'd have to be taken to court first.

I know I mentioned that we dealt with drunk drivers quite a bit.  Such is the peril of working at a gas station that's near a major freeway.  I HATE people who drive intoxicated.  There is no excuse, ever.  It's extremely dangerous, and I lost a good friend in high school to a drunk driver who missed a turn and plowed into him as he walked home from school.  If you drive drunk, I have zero respect for you, stop reading right now, and think about your life decisions before you kill someone.  Seriously.

It was late a night, getting close to closing time.  The only people left working were myself, the cashier, and another attendant.  We'd done pretty much everything needed to close the place down, and were just waiting for the big hand to hit the 12 so we could close down the pumps, turn off the outside lights, do final sweeping/mopping inside, and go home.  In to the station rolls a guy on a motorcycle, a very nice Harley.

Now, when I say he looked like Santa, I'm not just being vague in that he was a fat guy with a big white beard.  No, I mean that he was the spitting image of [Edmund Gwenn](http://franklyhankblog.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/34-by-djabonillojr-2008.jpg) in *Miracle on 34th Street.*  I did at least three double takes at him, because he really DID look like Santa Claus, Hell's Angels Edition.  Full leathers, vest with patches, no helmet.  And he was drunk.  Not sloppy drunk, but definitely three sheets to the wind.

We had developed a bit of a routine when we dealt with DUII drivers.  We usually ended up with one or two a week that we would call in to the local cops, so we all knew what to do.  Run the credit card backwards, so that the person had to go inside.  Set the pump nozzle on the slowest setting.  Have one person watching the driver while another ran around the corner of the store and called it in.  This usually bought enough time for the cops to show up and bust them as they left.  It worked rather well, actually.

So biker Kris fumbles with his wallet while attempting to remain in an upright and locked position, while I'm giving the ""this dude is drunk"" look to the other attendant.  I run the card, backwards, which comes up with the error.  I apologize, and tell him that he'll have to run the card inside.  I brace myself for the usual angry drunk response, but instead the dude laughs.  Big, dumb grin.  Takes his card back, apologizes for his card not working, and makes a manful attempt at a straight line for the doors of the store.

The cashier gives me the signal that the pump is ready to go, so I begin filling his bike (not supposed to do that, but frankly, I didn't want this guy trying to use a gas nozzle while standing over a hot bike engine).  I have it set on slow, and the other attendant is looking around the corner at me while talking to dispatch.  He gives me the thumbs up.  Boo-yah.

So St Nick comes back out of the store, with a large bag in his hand, and the same grin on his face.  I may not like the guy for riding drunk, but at least he's a happy drunk.  He comes up to me, and hands me the receipt from inside showing that he's paid.  Cool, bro.  On ya go.  Except that he doesn't immediately leave.  He digs into the bag, and pulls out a handful of ice cream sandwiches from our cooler.  ""Here you go, dude, it's a nice night, have some ice cream!  Where's the other guy, he deserves some, too!""

So the other attendant, who's wandered back by this time, hesitantly takes his own ice cream sandwich, and the three of us sit there eating in silence.  It was very surreal.  St Nick the Rider then throws the wrapper in the garbage, laughs once more, and revs up his bike.  We step back, and look across the street to see one of our local cops in the parking lot, engine running but lights off.  I surreptitiously give him the ""THIS GUY"" signal as he rolls out of the station, wobbles a bit turning the corner on to the street, and takes off.  The cop lights up and pulls out.

*But then away from the station, he flew like a flash!*  
*Ran through a red light, and then made a dash*  
*up the on-ramp to the freeway to go*  
*where cop cars would be a little too slow*  
*when what to my wondering eyes should appear*  
*but several more units, with a K-9 in rear.*

They quickly disappeared out of sight, tearing along after the wayward Father Christmas in Leathers.  I turned to my co-worker, and made a remark about wanting him to yell back something about Merry Christmas, and we both had a laugh.

About 45 minutes later, just as we had finished up cleaning and were heading out the door, up pulls one of the cops.  He rolls his window down, and says he wants to tell us something.  Apparently, ol' Tomte had led the officers on quite the chase, running nearly 10 miles before finally giving up.  This was quite dangerous, because even late evening traffic on that stretch of road can be thick.  When they finally got him into custody, he blew a 0.19 BAC.  Someone had REALLY been into the Christmas spirits.

Sorry I haven't posted this week. Trying to cull a few more great stories from my time as an LP agent.  Anyways, today I decided to tell a more somber tale about a shoplifter I met once.  Now shoplifters steal for a variety of reasons.  The thrill, it's their job, or its just the only source of income they have.  This is the story of someone who didn't have a choice but to steal. It gets a bit heavy at the end, fair warning.

Well, one day, at *GDNickels*, I'm working with the always tenacious Stacy. Stacy focuses in on this girl shopping the home department.  The girl was skinny, I mean, super skinny. She looked like she had just gotten out of a concentration camp, then went shopping at PINK and doused herself in make up to try to hide how emacciated she was. So naturally we will call her Anne Frank.

AF is fidgety.  Eyes darting around, constantly being spooked if anyone comes near her. Just really sketchy behavior.  AF selects three bed sets, around $100 each, and brings them up to the register.  Stacy and I are watching this, trying to figure out what the deal is. She's up to no good, but what?  AF buys two of the bed sets, and some towels, and says something to the cashier who keeps the third, unpurchased bed set, behind the counter.  Well shit, we thought, looks like she's just weird, not up to anything sketchy.  Or so we thought.

Stacy decided to keep following her on camera.  AF decides to go to lingerie, and selects several bras.  She's looking at the size, styles everything.  So she's doing everything a normal person would do.  But something just doesn't seem right.  Then things seem really wrong when she takes the bras and places them into her bag. 

*Gotcha*.

AF then grabs some matching panties, throws them in her bag, and starts to walk around again.  Stacy heads downstairs to do some floor surveillance.  Once she has eyes on AF, I head downstairs to meet up with her.  As I arrive downstairs, I see AF back at the register, doing a return of some of the bras, and using the store credit to purchase the last bed set she had left there before. 

Now the cashier who was working was a nice guy. Decent worker, nothing extraordinary for a college aged retail worker.  His issue was his whole life revolved one thing and one thing only: Vagina.
If it had two legs, a hole between it's legs, and was at least a *solid* 4/10, he was DTF.  So naturally, despite the fact that AF looked like Snookie turned into Gollum, our cashier ""Luke"", was smiling and not paying attention at all. Anyways, Luke returns the bras, gives AF the bedset and the remaining money on a store card.  Now normally for shoplifters, you have to wait for them to leave the store with the stolen merchandise to prove intent to steal, and make a stop. However with false returns, as long as you saw them select the merchandise, and then do a false return, you can make a stop as soon as the transaction is complete.  So Stacy and I had a dilemma on our hands.  We have enough to make the stop now.  But she still has stolen items in her bag.  So should we grab her now, and risk those items being thrown out?  Or should we wait till she exits and charge her with everything?

Sometimes its better to err on the side of caution. We waited till she exited the store and approached her.  She immediately tries to run. I get in front of her, she starts scratching and screaming.  We take her down, cuffs go on, and Stacy does a quick pat down.  Eventually we help her up, and escort her up to the office.

Stacy starts processing her, while I review the tapes and cue everything up.  Stacy calls me from the processing room, and tell me to get in their quick.  AF's purse is on the desk with all the contents sitting next to it.  Inside of the purse are several needles, a syringe, and little baggie full of this substance. It looks weird, and half used, but the smell is unmistakable.  

Meth.

Now for those of you in other parts of the country, it may come as a shock to know that Meth is virtually non existant up here.  Im talking less than 1% of our drug cases in my state are meth related. So it was a bit of a shock to see, but we figured this girl was a junkie of some kind.  We search her again to make sure there aren't any more surprises on her. The whole time she's crying, saying it's Joshua's fault, and she didn't have a choice. We are questioning her about how she had the money for two bed sets, but why steal for the third.  Suddenly her demeanor changed.  She perked up, and you could see something strange in her eyes.  She says she has the money for the one set, and she'll just pay for it and she will go.

Well now that doesn't seem right.  Something about us thinking only one set was stolen made her get excited... time to look at some tape.

We go back, and see what really happened.  AF walked in long before we started watching her.  Luckily the cameras were pointed where we needed them to be for this.  AF came in empty handed,  swept about 20 pairs of ties into a plastic bag, then went up to Luke and returned them with no receipt for store credit.  This is a no no.  Any return without receipt over $100 was supposed to gain managers approval. After reviewing the tape, and pulling up Luke's transactions on our computer, we saw what happened. Luke, in an attempt to help out a busty girl, did several returns without receipts, making sure that each return stayed under $100 so he didn't have to call a manager.  Dumbass.

This is getting long winded and I'll begin to wrap it up, but it gets a bit heavy now.  I start to do AF's paperwork, and look at her drivers license.  She was about 2 years younger in the photo. She was pretty. Very pretty.  Beautifual eyes, cute nose, gorgeous smile.  Now she was a shell of her former self.  Body slowly being drained by this addiction.  Cuts and holes in her face, eyes sunken and deadened.  Teeth chipped or even falling out.  Disheveled is the best compliment you could give her...  I ask her her story, and if she's willing to talk.  Stacy tended to be the agressive one of us, so I usually got them to co operate by being nice.  It definitely worked this time.  

AF was born in Miami.  Good family, liked to party, but from what she said, a good girl.  Then she met this guy, he seemed cool, and he introduced her to Meth.  She was instantly hooked, and quickly become broke trying to get her next fix.  This guy, ""Joshua"" was her b/f. And he was a dealer.  He told her that Meth was huge and cheap up here, and that he was going to move up here and expand his network.  But he wanted her to go up first to live with his friend, and scout it out for him.  He lied, flat out lied to her. Meth is so difficult to score around here, and that makes it more expensive than normal.  She didn't know that till she got up here.  She was told she'd have to work for the friend, to make up for the cost of bringing her up here, and feeding her addiction.  So she did what she was told.  Clean the house. Drive them around. Steal this and that.  And of course, being pimped out to all of Joshua's ""friends and associates up here.""  

I remember her crying, wailing about how fucked up her life is, how she hates it.  How she was dying for Joshua to come back.  ""Once he's up here, we'll be together. It'll be ok. I won't have to suck anyone elses dick.  I'll have everything I need, I'll never need another fix. I just want Joshua.""

Nothing would convince her that she had been duped.  She didn't want help, she just wanted Joshua.  She couldn't see this guy had used her and basically sold her into a life of slavery.  Whether it was some kind of delusional sick love, the drugs, or both, I'll never know. The cops came, did what they needed to do, and we told them the situation.  In the end she was charged with about $700 or so in theft and false returns.  One of the cops was a female cop we knew, and she said she would talk to her at the station.  Try and get her name to social workers and detectives who handle this type of thing.  As the cops were handcuffing her, Stacy was putting AF's things back into her purse.  AF screams ""MAKE SURE MY NECKLACE IS IN THERE! JOSHUA GAVE IT TO ME! I CAN'T LOSE IT HE'LL BE SO ANGRY!! PLEASE.""  Stacy held up this cheap looking silver chrome plated necklace. It looked like it cost less than $100.  But to her it was the greatest gift she'd ever gotten.  We placed it in her purse, and told her good luck.  Stacy and I kinda just sat in silence for  a few minutes, reflecting how good we had it, and what we had just seen.  Then we decided to call Luke up and have a good chewing out of the dumbass to cheer ourselves up.

I worked as a commissioned sales manager in a popular shoe store catering to the midde-age demographic (primarily women). My store was located in a VERY wealthy area. The vast majority of our customers were very gracious and easy to work with, or at least appreciative of our help. However, there was always the entitled, insane bitch who came through.

This happened during the Christmas season. In shoes, since we work commission, instead of someone being planted on the floor to help customers and someone being planted at the register to ring, we all go every step of the way with our customers to provide them with full service. This means our sales are typically very involved and we follow through as best we can with the checkout process.

It was shortly before closing. There were three of us on - myself, a low level manager, my direct supervisor, the assistant store manager, and a part time sales associate. I was processing a lengthy return for a customer, the associate was ringing a lady out at the register next to me, and my boss was helping an elderly, disabled man try shoes on. He was not physically able, so she was putting the shoes on his feet, lacing them, etc. So, not in a position to take on another sale because of how involved her current one was.

As I'm working on this return, I see a woman approach the counter with several shoes in her hand. She crosses her arms, makes obvious glances at her watch, and taps her foot - basically trying everything she can to signal to me that she's annoyed. There's not a whole lot I can do because I'm at the register, but I say hello to her so that she'll know I recognize that she's waiting. She just glares at me.

About two minutes after she's standing there (my return was on three different receipts, one from the internet and two in store, etc. and my associate's customer kept changing her mind about what she wanted to purchase), the woman decides she can't take it anymore.

Woman (yelling): IS ANYONE IN THIS STORE GOING TO HELP ME OR DO I HAVE TO STAND HERE ALL THE DAMN NIGHT?!!?!

Now, she really hasn't been waiting that long, so we are all shocked by her outburst, as are our customers (who are all very patient and kind). I mean, damn, we have a non-able bodied person in the store, I'm so sorry that it takes time to ensure that person gets full service! I look at my boss, who looks at the man and he signals for her to go help the other lady. My boss takes the shoes from the lady as I try to salvage the situation.

Me: I'm sorry, ma'am, but we're all assisting customers at this time. It's going to be a couple min-

Woman: I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR TWENTY MINUTES ALREADY!

Obviously a blatant lie...

Me: I'm really sorry about that, but we need to finish out with the people who have been here before you got here.

The woman sighs audibly, like a teenager who was just told by her parents that she needs to be home by curfew. I swear to god, I could not believe I was staring at a woman in at least her 40s. But that's reality. She looks like she's about to say something else, but...

Something happened that, to this day, makes me smile to myself - my associate's customer, at the other register, didn't feel the woman's outburst was appropriate, so she had one of her own. This is going to sound SO /r/thathappened, but I swear to god, I witnessed it with my own eyes and will never forget it...

Awesome lady: Are you serious right now? I mean, JESUS, look at yourself! You are acting like a two year old! We have ALL been waiting here much, much longer than you, and they are helping us out as fast as they can. YOU ARE SO RUDE. SO RUDE!!!! SO RUDE!!!

And she continued to yell at the woman about how rude she was until the woman turned red in the face and briskly walked out of the store.

My boss returned with the shoes, and I said to her, still in shock, ""We won't be needing those, she's left...""

Then I said to the woman, ""Thanks for saying what we can't."" She told me no problem and that she ""can't believe the balls on some people.""

I owned a store that sold chocolates and candy. Mainly in gift baskets, but we also had a wall of bins where people could take bulk candy.  The phrase ""like a kid in a candy store"" is not just a metaphor. Candy stores bring out the worst in kids, and whatever self-control a kid may have, they leave it at the door. So a large part of our job was keeping one eye on the kids while we were helping their moms pick out a gift. Because these moms, who were a little laissez-faire to begin with, seemed to think it was the staff's job to watch their children in exchange for them spending ten bucks with us.  I cannot tell you how many kids we had to stop from reaching all the way in to one of the bins with their dirty snotty hands and grabbing a fistful of chocolate. (Tip: If you're ever in a bulk candy store, don't buy anything less than 3 feet from the floor. We can't catch them all.)

One regular customer had a kid who was a nightmare. In addition to being so weird he creeped us out, he was constantly up to his armpits in the bins. One day, when his mom wasn't looking, I took a picture, and put it up on the wall with a big blue dot hiding his freakishly large head. We wrote on it: Please watch your children and always use the scoops!

A week later, the same woman comes back, sees the picture, and says ""Tsk, it's horrible how some mothers just let their kids run amok.""

One day, I went to print something from the computer. With this computer, when I would go to print something, a little window would pop up with the recently viewed photos to let you select what photos you would like to print. To my horror, pornographic pictures popped up. And not just the ""normal"" ones, either. I'm talking *everything* from the normal asians and whatnot to hentai to pregnant women to chicks with dicks, the whole kit and kaboodle. To make this even more horrific, I was very pregnant at the time with my first kid and we had a transgender girl working there (used to be male), which really upped the ew factor as these were both topics that were searched for. I had to search through THOUSANDS, **literally thousands** of porn cookies looking at time stamps to figure out who this was. This was in the manager's office upstairs, so of course it would have to be a manager. The time stamp on the cookies from that day was during one manager's shift so I was planning on speaking with that shift manager asap. Upon further investigation, however, since there were some days that manager wasn't working during some of the porn browsing, I had to go through video footage to match time frames with who was upstairs. It turns out that while helping put away a truck order, the employee would take a load of supplies upstairs, use the computer for 10 or so min, go back downstairs to get another load of supplies, take it back upstairs and be gone for another 10-15 min, and so on. He denied it was him when the DM and myself sat down with him, but I knew for a fact it was him, and he was fired. From then on, we starting locking the upstairs office and only managers were allowed to be up there unless an employee was accompanied by a manager.
     **tl;dr**: Caught an employee looking up extremely disturbing porn on our work computer that's supposed to be for management only. He was fired and I was never the same. (Edited to explain the racist-sounding part about the asian porn. I was trying to convey the broad spectrum that was covered and I think American men tend to view Asian porn fairly frequently.)",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,1358291839.0,,,True,t3_16mvbv,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/16mvbv/why_we_started_locking_the_door_to_the_managers/,

This thrift store was an awesome place to work but it was located in a bad neighborhood. Since we also handed out free clothes and furniture to people who applied for it, this ensured a steady stream of genuinely appreciative people who were thrilled to get their freebies. Unfortunately we also had lots of - for lack of a better word - weirdo customers. Borderline institutional cases, hoarders whose houses would be declared unlivable if the authorities ever found out and quirky artist types were just some of the members of this sideshow. Of course there were plenty of normal people but we're not here to talk about those who can maintain basic personal hygiene and would never be mistaken for somebody with Tourrette Syndrome...

My favorite win was one morning when I came into the store as a customer. The morning rush regulars had picked over the freshly stocked shelves and were in line at the checkout. I found a few goodies as well so I waited in line with everyone else. Our store was unique because nothing at the store was priced. We sold clothes, glassware, books and misc items by the pound while electronics and furniture had flat rate pricing. This sometimes caused some confusion when a customer thought what we considered a large table lamp was really a small table lamp. Since our prices were dirt cheap to begin with - under $10 for most electronics and furniture - the difference was rarely more than a dollar or two.

In line ahead of me was a gentleman who had his 8 year old son with him. The dad was known for being a douchebag to other customers but he had never messed with me. He had a cart full of electronics - CD players, a cheap receiver, turntable and speakers which wouldn't cost more than $20. Since the employees didn't know the difference between a Tivo and a piece of stereo gear, the customers told the cashier what an item was so they could ring it up. As you can probably guess there were customers who would take advantage of this. It always pissed me off that they would rip off our store since this was a charity organization. We were like Goodwill but without most of the corporate overhead, million dollar stores and we used our profits for homeless shelters, food pantries and similar projects in our area.

The guy in front of me rattled off his purchases and told the cashier to ring up a VCR but the item was a CD player. A CD player costs $7 at the store but a VCR was only $2. Without thinking I politely noted that the item was actually a CD player and she rang it up as such. Unfortunately he picked that day to lock horns with me. He got in my face and sneered ""Who the FUCK are YOU"" followed by an short obscenity laden rant about my ""interference"". This didn't faze me a bit and I asked him to refrain from using such language in the store since there were children within earshot.  

I asked if he would like to speak to my manager and then glanced at the cashier. The regular store manager had the day off so the assistant manager - who was working register that day - was MOD. She figured out what was about to happen and nodded the go-ahead. The douchebag took the bait and requested to see the manager (although in far less civilized language). To top it off, an old woman - who I later discovered was his mom - chimed in that I was the one who was swearing and that I had started the dispute. They both smiled the smug look bullies use to intimidate their victims. The store was now dead silent as everyone within earshot was watching this unfold. I once again asked if he wanted to speak to my manager and he said ""who the FUCK is your manager?"" The cashier/MOD tossed her hair back to get his attention, looked him dead in the eyes, smiled and said ""I am"".

The aforementioned silence was quickly broken by an anonymous laugh-snort followed by assorted guffaws and snickers.

Said douchebag wasn't seen in the store for months afterward. I later found out they were banned from the store for a month but stayed away even longer. Why? His mom wouldn't shop there because of what we did to her son.

tl;dr If you're going to try and rip off the store, don't try it on the MOD. Also - don't bring your mom and your son along to watch the fail.

It was the due date for floorset, so the visual team had to scramble like scared mice to get it done, and for whatever reason, they scheduled a useless girl to help. I sent my acting GM this text verbatim: “For the love of non-ascetics everywhere never schedule [her] for floorset ever ever again. Her presence results in mass capacial hemorrhaging.” We got there at 6am, I sent that text at noon… that should give you an idea of how the day was going before “the incident”. What incident? Oh, let me tell you.

A customer came in to do a return on several bedding items, and she had paid almost $300 in cash. The cashier told her we could return $100 in cash, but the rest would have to be a send check. Ms. Ma’am was not having any of that, so the cashier grabbed me to explain the policy. Here is the conversation (verbatim, actually, because the cashier recorded it for some reason):

Me: Ma’am, we cannot return more than $100 in cash for a few reasons: first because it’s a safety hazard to have too much cash in the drawer; second because it’s policy; third because it’s very early in the day and we may not even have enough cash for that; and fourth because if I give you cash, we will have no change for anyone else who needs to make a purchase. Would you like to get $100 in cash now and get a send check? The other option is to get the remainder in store credit.

Her: *utterly incredulous* This is the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard! I want back what I paid right now! In cash! **This** is what’s wrong with America, everyone thinks everyone should be charging everything and then I get screwed over. What if I just returned it to three different cashiers in three sections!? Huh, you gonna stop me!? I’ll do it!

Me: (*in my head* Wanna know what’s wrong with America? You, bitch. You are what’s wrong with America. You are so self-entitled that you think we should all bend to you not following normative behavior. Sure, let me go ahead and break policy and screw over the store for the rest of the day because you can’t use a debit card nor can you wait 3 days to get your fucking check. But sure, electronic banking and a basic policy—which is fairly lenient—are the fucking problem with America!)

*out loud* Ma’am, if you are that desperate to have your cash right this minute, I can do this return on three registers, but I have to tell you that that will flag you in our system as a suspicious person and it may bar you from being able to do returns in the future, not to mention that I may not have enough cash in the register, meaning you’ll have to wait for someone to run to the bank to get change, and it may screw us over for the rest of the day. But if you need it **right** this second, I guess we can risk it **just for you**. (Yes, I was being a little condescending, but it’s been a really shitty day [not just because of the floorset crap (which by the bye, I couldn’t get done while I was helping Ms. Ma’am)]).

Her: Then do that.

-.- Fuck you, fine.

So I do the return in three transactions, using one register in each section with the cashier following me around to “learn” (let’s be real, she just didn’t want to do actual work), and as we’re finishing up, she says, “Was that so hard!?” Oh fuck you. We’re done here.

Me: Ma’am, I broke policy for you, and for that, you may not ever be able to do a return here again and we may be screwed for the rest of the day, but I did it, **for you**, because you couldn’t be flexible. If you want to be snitty about it, you can leave.

Oh her face. Priceless.

Her: How dare you talk to me that way!?

Me: Want me to get the manager? *calls for acting GM*

My acting GM comes out (the ASM from the fraud story) and asks what’s up. I told her to tell him. So she explains the whole thing to him and ends it with, “And this—**little girl**—was just rude to me! She told me to just leave!”

GM: So what you’re saying is that after bending over backwards to help you out, even though it broke policy, you were rude to her, and she told you to leave? What’s the problem?

Her: I can’t believe you are taking her side!

GM: Look, she helped you in a way no one else here would even know how to do. She went out of her way as she’s not even cashiering today. Because of this, she’s going to have to stay late today, and she’s had a worse day today than I’ve ever had in my life, but here she is, helping you, and all you can say about her is that she told you to leave after you were rude. You know, you don’t have to shop here. In fact, you might want to start shopping catalog if you can’t treat my employees with respect.

Oh her face. I wish there were pictures. On the recording there is just this silence. It’s beautiful.

Her: Are you—are you banning me from the store?

GM: Not if you apologize.

Her: To **her**!?

GM: Yes. Those are your options.

Her: *mumbles almost inaudibly* Sorry.

Me: At this point, I don’t even care. Now you know the policy. In the future, either get a prepaid debit card so we can do an instant return (which, incidentally, is a hell of a lot safer than carrying that much cash) or wait for the send check.

Her: **This** is what’s wrong with America! Children being rude to their elders! You can’t even accept an apology!

Me: **You** are what’s wrong with America! You! I broke policy for **you** because **you** think **you** are special for being different. Take a long look in the mirror on your way out! *storm off to the back*

Now as you can imagine, I’m expecting a thorough talking to about this behavior by the GM, and in such anticipation, I walked into the office and just sat down, waiting. I was as shocked as anyone that he defended me to the extent he did (he’s pretty good about backing up my decisions, but this was a little extreme and I know I’m not thinking perfectly), and I was expecting at the least to be scolded. Instead he had taken the cashier’s phone and played through the recording and laughed. For those wondering, this is what was said after I left:

Her: Can you believe she just said that!?

Cashier: She’s right… that’s what I was thinking.

GM: *to cashier, from connotation* You be quiet. *presumably to customer* Do you not realize that you created this problem? Honestly?

*Silence. Long, long silence.*

Her: *very softly* I didn’t really think about it like that. Please tell her I’m sorry. Sincerely.

GM: I will.

That’s where it stops. I’m a little in shock at the whole of it, but it’s kind of funny in hindsight. So kids, what’s wrong with America? Them bitches, **that’s** what’s wrong with America!

As an added bonus: I typed this entire story on the office computer and emailed it to myself, because the cashier doesn't have multimedia messaging. D: My GM let me transcribe this on the clock.

Please feel free to share your own tales!

I worked for Hot Topic in the 90's, and if any of you recall the old store design, the entire front of the stores were glass windows, with recesses inside on the left and the right for display clothing. Those recesses were usually a tight fit for a full size ladder, so some gymnastics were usually performed if you were a guy to have a fully opened ladder. I usually just leaned it against the wall and reached into it (if my DM wasn't around, as it gave him heart attacks). Also important to note is that the cash register station (called the cash wrap) stood in the center of the store and had counters that were 3 1/2 to 4 foot high.

The holiday season was upon us and I had just hired about 10 new people. One of these guys, we'll call him Steve because that's his name, was working with me on an afternoon when we were pretty busy. A customer was returning something so I was in the cash wrap for the moment, and a customer needed the last of an item that was on display in the front window.

""Hey Steve,"" says I, ""can you grab the ladder from the back and get down that (whatever it was) for the customer?""  Steve beamed happily and *flew* to the back room post haste for the ladder, for Steve was a *go-getter*, an up-and-comer, a man who was going to show me that he was worthy of staying on full time!

I see Steve burst out of the back room, ladder in hand, and go about the business of finishing the return. I don't know what exactly caused me to turn around- I'd like to think that I developed Spidey sense that day- but I did. And I was witnessing the final moments of Steve's acceptance of the Darwin Award for Best Death in a Retail Establishment for 1998.

You see, Steve had just realized that the ladder would not fully extend to a locked position in the window recess. Steve had *now* concluded that the best maneuver possible would be to rest the ladder against a solid object of some kind in order to lean over and pluck the item out of the recess instead; this, as I stated earlier, was my favored method as well.  But Steve had apparently slept through physics class in high school that semester, because instead of leaning the ladder against the firm, solid structure of the *wall*, he had instead chosen to test the tensile strength of the *display window*.  Yes, you read that correctly: Steve leaned a metal ladder against a 12 foot window pane and *started to climb*.

There are those cinematic moments in movies, wherein the protagonist is about to engage in some climactic event and the scene slows down to a crawl. I've always thought they were rather overdramatic and silly, but had never actually encountered such a moment in 'real life'. But lo, here it was for me: watching Steve's left foot brace itself to bear his weight on the first step of the ladder, his pudgy, stocky fingers tightening their grip on either side of the rails. His bald head glistened in the 450-watt display lights; a drop was just about to slide down his neck. I could *feel* time slipping through my mental grasp like a physical thing and for a moment a sense of utter despair flooded my senses. And I must be honest with you- the despair was not for fear of poor Steve's health and wellbeing. The thought that first crossed my mind was: Jesus, I hired this dipshit.

And then, like a rubberband stretched to its breaking point and then released, time stretched, heaved, then *snapped* back into place, and I could feel the pain in my wrist as it and my arm bore my weight in a bound *over* the cash wrap, legs swinging over and kicking useless trinkets (only one dollar, a great stocking stuffer!) to the floor, barely registering the ""O"" look on the return customer's face. And that screaming, that incessant screaming that filled the air, will someone please fucking STOP THAT SC- oh, that would be *me* screaming, no *shrieking* ""STEVE STEVE STEVE"" over and over again like a war cry.

He was on the second step and the window was bowing out with his weight, as if to show respect to the holiday shoppers passing by, when I reached out and *clawed* him off the ladder. He fell backwards, all 200 stupid, senseless pounds of him, on top of me, and god, I wish I could say I blacked out and had a moment's respite from this ridiculous dramaturgy, but no. I was still fully conscious and fully *furious*, and when Steve finally rolled off of me and assisted me to my feet, all I could manage to sputter out were syllables that somewhat resembled ""window,"" ""ladder,"" and ""fucking idiot"" before they were garbled by the hate and loathing overflowing me. I knew then what the Emperor meant when he said ""let the hate flow through you.""  

The ending of this tale is much more mundane than the climax I'm sorry to say. I moved the ladder to a much safer position, procured the item for the customer, and then I went to the back room and I cried for humanity, because I had seen the future, and it was Steve.

I didn’t doubt them (yet) as we were ever mindful for the fraud, and this could easily be an indication they had been victimized.

*The fraudster will buy two sets of tickets- one in his name, and the other in the credit card holders name to allow the transaction to go through.*

The store closes at 8pm. I work in the play area for the children and we close down at least 30-45 minutes before the store closes, so parents can get their children out. My shift was over at 7:15 and my coworker and I had to clear out a lot of children before I left since we are only allowed to have 10-12 children per person and we had 18. 

Now I notice a line in front of the door to get in. And I see two gentlemen online with their children. One guy has on a blue shirt and I see him as the first person on line since he was in the front and the guy behind him has on a brown jacket. We finally get down to 10 children and I ask my coworker what does she want to do since I'm leaving. She tells me to take two more children and that's it for the night. So I inform the guy in the front that I can take his two children and that's it. The guy behind him is pissed and insists that he was first on line and I tell him that no he wasn't. He was second and the man in front of him was first. The same guy is still arguing with me and now the other parents are looking confused as to what's going on. This is exactly how this scenario went. 

I take a few of the free ice cream coupons and go from behind the counter so all the parents can see and hear me and I say 
""I apologize for the inconvenience but we are closed for the evening due to being over capacity and we can not take in anymore children since I'm leaving and my coworker can not have over a certain amount of children. But what I can do is offer your children free ice cream to make up for not being able to come into the ballpit. Again I do apologize for the inconvenience."" 

Most parents and their kids are ok with this since I did offer free ice cream cones (who doesn't want that?). So as I am passing them out to the parents so they can leave, the same man who was arguing with me approaches me again demanding that I let his child in. At this point I'm getting tired of this damn man , so I say to him 
""Sir I'm sorry but that man was first. But I can offer your child free ice cream instead."" I try to hand him the coupon and he pushes my hand away with his fingers, keeps them on my arm and says ""No. I want my child to play in there."" 

Now I'm looking at this man with his hand on my arm in disbelief that he just put his hands on me. All politeness is gone at this point. I look him in the eye and say angrily 

""Sir you need to take your hands off of me right now."" (I was seriously about two seconds from slapping him) 

He moves his hand and says that he's going to report me to my manager and I tell him ""Go ahead and I will tell her and security that you touched me."" 

He huffs off with his son at that point.

In the 6 years that I've been working in retail, I've never had a customer actually put their hands on me. Overreaction? I don't think so. I don't care how pissed off you are at me. Go speak to my manager, report me, I don't care but never touch me. I'm extremely sensitive about it. Thankfully I only have about 6 more shifts until I can quit.

We have a tech bench behind the front counter so that the sales guys (me) can do quick stuff like memory upgrades without taking up space in the back and leaving the floor unattended. Makes sense, right? And we've got a bunch of open outlets back there.

And signs that ***""Please don't pass this line.""*** in the gaps around the counter. 

This woman comes in, demanding we let her charge her phone. She's got a charger with her, and she's demanding that we let her use one of the outlets behind the counter to charge her phone. 

If she wasn't rude to start with, I probably would've plugged it in, and told her to come back in half an hour. But she was awful, so the answer was a simple, courteous, ""No ma'am, I can't let you use those outlets."" If I needed a reason - it's because I'd have to sit up there and babysit it and her. 

She huffs and puffs and flips her shit. ""I'M NEVER SHOPPING HERE AGAIN! YOU CALL THAT CUSTOMER SERVICE! Y'ALL GONNA BURN IN HELL FOR THIS!""

""You have a nice day ma'am.""

She comes back 20 minutes later, walks up to the counter, and starts to apologize. ""Listen, I'm a good christian, and I'm 65 and I knew I don't want to not get into Heaven because I yelled at some kid working in a computer store. I came back to apologize and fix my position in Christ's eyes.""

""Alright ma'am. You have a good day.""

And out she walked, all high and mighty.

I'm not there any more but this is one of my favourite retail stories. I have so freaking many after 8 years selling stuff. I'd been in retail for 6 years or so at the time this happened. I had learned to be nice to every customer, treat them with respect, and provide customer service to the Nth degree. I made SPIFFs, if not commission, so every person I pleased meant more likelihood to buy, and a chance at a better pay for me.

So this elderly man comes in one day with a thick Czech accent and asks me if  I'm a photographer. Guy looks really nice, super dapper in a matching greenish tweed suit, wearing one of those olden timey pauper hats. (Like what Tiny Tim wore.)

I happen to be one. Not a great one but still, I take pictures, I've even gotten paid to do it. I tell him yes, because I figure he wants to ask about my camera, or how to get his granddaughter a photography job.

""Khan you take piktur ove my teeth?""

Now, remember, he had a thick accent. So I wasn't sure I was hearing him right, or maybe that he was **really** new to English. So I said, ""Your teeth? Like a portrait of you smiling?"" I crack a great big smile and point to it to get the point across.

""No, no. I neet piktur ove my teeth, my teesth!""

He then proceeds to take out a tiny envelope and tap it into his palm and out rolls two small, human teeth. They're a little yellowed. My immediate thought is, of course, *WHAT THE FUCK?!* But I decide to let him explain before I run like the wind for the nearest door with a lock.

Turns out he was pretty new to the country, just a few years or so. He had had some bad dental issues, so he found a dentist and got some caps installed. Well that was just two weeks before this, if I heard through the accent correctly. The dentist had given him a list of okay foods and not okay foods and they had broken off and fallen out in the middle of a meal he was eating. And the food was on the okay list.

So he was mad. He wanted photographic evidence that the things were broken, and hadn't just come attached. He showed me where the rough edge was that should have been smooth.

Whatever, is this weird? Yes. But I'll take the picture anyway. We had a light table to make it easier to look through negatives. That way we could show a customer the frame they were requesting a reprint of and they couldn't dispute it later saying we did the wrong one.

I put the teeth there, snap off a few pics, and run them through the printer. He thanks me profusely, multiple times, and then leaves.

A week or so later he comes back to the store and thanks me again, says he has an appointment to get it fixed. Turns out he's one of these, ""I don't really have anybody else to talk to, and you were nice,"" elderly people. We actually had a pretty interesting conversation. He had a ridiculously advanced degree in mechanical engineering and had specialized in laser arrays and high-end experimentation back in the Republic. He came here and taught for a bit, but only some of his credentials were good in Canada, the position went away and he was living off a pension. Her found out I went to school for journalism during one of these talks.

Another week goes by and he comes in every couple days, says hello, asks how I'm doing, inquires about some random photo thing (I'm sure he was preparing things especially to come talk to me about) and then would leave. I was fine with it cause he was being harmless.

He came in another time with a letter to a hospital administrator about a doctor who flat out told him the chest pains he was having were nothing. He was taken to the hospital later that day when he had a mild hear attack. The letter was a complaint and a demand for the doctor to be fired or he would take the story to the media and sure for malpractice. He asked if I wouldn't mind editing it for him so it sounded good in English. He didn't want to be dismissed as some dumb foreigner.

One night, he comes in, and asks if he can buy me a coffee from the food court. This is crossing the line a bit. For one thing, I'm a straight male, and had mentioned my girlfriend a few times. For another, I was 22 or 23 at this point and this dude was/is in his late 70s - if I'm being generous.

I said, ""I'm really sorry but my shift isn't long enough for a break today, I can't leave my coworker here by herself.""

My coworker, without looking up to see this customer (and she hadn't interacted with him till this point so she didn't know about the lonely Czech guy) says, ""Oh don't worry, I can hold down the fort for a few minutes.""

Czech guy looks so happy, I don't have it in my heart to say no. He asks if I don't mind waiting a few minutes, he has to run to the LCBO (you can only buy booze from government-run shops in Canada; in Ontario it's the LCBO and The Beer Store) before it closes.

So I wait, and the phone rings a few minutes later. It's Czech guy saying I could go to the food court and he'd have our coffees by the time I got there. I don't want to be rude so I set an alarm for 10 minutes on my phone and change the alarm sound to a phone ring.

I go, and we have coffee. We talk about lasers and science and journalism for a bit. Turns out his now-deceased wife was a journalist and he has immense respect for the profession. During this conversation he's asking personal questions and I keep dodging them.

My alarm goes off, I pretend to answer a phone call and tell him I have to get back to my coworker cause something's wrong with the printer. Before he lets me go he tells me to wait.

""Here, take this,"" he says, and hands me one of the LCBO bags he has with him. Inside is a nice cherry Danish dessert wine. I don't drink, but he can't know that. ""It is a thank you. You are one of the only people who has ever been nice to this old crazy foreign man. Everything went well at the hospital when I gave them my letter because I did not speak. Every time I speak it is like people have cotton in their ears. Nobody wants to talk to an old man. Less people want to talk to a foreign old man. Thank you for not being rude to me, I now have a much better opinion of people your age.""

After that his visits happened less frequently, and I felt a little bad for trying to get away from him so desperately.

This seemed to be the most requested story, or group of stories rather, so I figured a nice big wall of text will hopefully satisfy you all. I apologize if there are mistakes or its not up to snuff. I worked 18 hours last yesterday, only to sleep 3 hours and come back to work for an overnight double. So without further delay,

**Sweaty Jeans Guy and His Band of (Asshole) Thieves: A Christmas Tale**

Have you ever hated someone? Like TRULY despised them, every fiber of their being, and truly thought the world would be a better place without them?  Now have you ever felt that way about someone you had never met?  Well I have.  There was a group of thieves I learned about while training at *Berbercrambie &amp; Ditch* ( awful I know but best I could come up with. Open for other parody names if anyone can come up with them). The girl who was training me, ""Lela"" had been after this group since she started.  There were three main culprits. Now I debated about using real names because fuck them, but decided to not anger the great mods of r/talesfromretail.  So we shall call them Lexi, Lebron, and Fat Tony.

Anyways this group apparently started becoming an issue when Lela started working for B&amp;D.  Lexi was a heroin addict.  In and out of jail and rehab.  We eventually learned that she had been a major thief in the past, but had stopped some months ago when she gave birth to a baby, while still on heroin.  The father of said baby, was Lebron. Lebron was a talk athletic guy, and was the ring leader of the group.  He would often play look out and run interference if you tried to stop Lexi from leaving the store. This included distractions, or for one poor mall guard in the past, getting sucker punched in the back of the head.  The third member was Fat Tony, he often worked alone, but was traveled with the group, would keep in contact with them, and would hit stores at the same time as Lexi, so as to make sure one of them wasn't be watched.  The group was brazen for the most part. Lexi would come in every day for weeks on end, hitting the same stores over and over.  She would conceal the merchandise, and wait by the exits for the all clear, sometimes for minutes on end.  She was smart, in that she acted obvious, drawing out newer LP agents into thinking she wasn't paying attention.  But when she spotted you, that was it.  She would drop the bag, and laugh in your face as you watched her walk out the store.  She would come back the next day, and even if she knew you were watching, she'd fill up the bag, hoping for a chance to get away, otherwise she'd drop it and just walk out, as if nothing happened.  It was very infuriating. If you did catch her, you had to worry about Lebron sucker punching you, as he has done before.  Now they kind of laid low after the baby was born, and then started coming back, with Lebron watching the baby.  Eventually we figured out they were recruiting people from the bus stop to play look out for them. They were insanely difficult to catch, and it was months of cat and mouse.  They were banned from all the malls in the area due to previous incidents, but mall security being what it is, they were able to come and go as they wanted.

Anyways enough background:  So one day Fat Tony walks into our ""Follister"" brand store.  He is looking at colognes, and I'm new, so I start following him, already having been briefed about him.  My co worker Lela proceeds to our B&amp;D store to look for Lexi.  Eventually Fat Tony gets a phone call and peaces out before making a move. One of the managers pulled me aside and said ""That's Sweaty Jeans Guy!"". To which I suavely replied ""What?"".  Flaring nostrils and sultry eyes and all. Somehow, this manager was able to look past my charmed confusion, and explained:

One Day, Fat Tony aka Sweaty Jeans Guy, came into Follister and selected 6 pairs of jeans, and immediatly went into the fitting room, going under the door so as to avoid having an associate open it for him.  An associate saw all this, alerted a manager, and the manager started knocking on the door, asking if he needed help, if he wanted 6 shirts to match the 6 jeans he brought in there.  Silence.  Fat Tony didn't say a word. But this manager was a scrappy little girl and wasn't going to let him pretend like he wasn't in there.  She's not a T Rex. Her  eye sight isn't attracted to only movement! And she'd be damned if she'd let him treat her this way!   So our scrappy young lass bravely clamored against the door, pestering FT with customer service.  Eventually he comes out and asks her opinion on the jeans he's trying on.  He's stammering, and sweating profusely.  She tries to act like a good associate, while letting him know to knock it the fuck off. Eventually he puts his regular pants back on, and leaves, with the jeans still in the fitting room. The manager said that the pair he tried on was so soaked with perspiration, that that they marked it as defective, and sent it back.
 
Gross. Also, LOL.

**Here is where it all wraps up kiddies**:

So for the first two months I was working for *B&amp;D*, these guys were our main catch.  My first month in, I recruited my old co worker Stacy, from *GDNickels*, and the three of us were finished training right before Christmas. So the company allowed us to work together at Lela's malls for the holidays and after the new year we would go to our own malls. So we were enjoying our time, getting some good grabs during the busy holiday season, but nothing BIG.  Anyways, Christmas Eve morning, we meet up bright and early. As we are sipping our coffee inside a store across from the main *B&amp;D* store, we see Fat Tony fast walking straight into the store.  He grabs 3 heavy parkas off the rack, around $200 each, and walks into the fitting room. Lela, Stacy, and I can't believe our luck. No way it can be this easy. Merry FUCKING Christmas!  So I wait outside, Lela and Stacy hang around, and when Fat Tony steps out, they verify the fitting room is empty, and signal to me.  As Fat Tony is about to step out of that cologne fueled mist that is the ""air"" inside a *B&amp;D* store, I step in front of him.  He stops in his tracks, and almost immediately starts sweating profusely.  I honestly don't know what was brighter; the glint from his sweaty bald head, or the glint of my teeth as I grinned my best shit eating grin in his face.  I'd like to say I had a great holiday inspired one liner like "" Santa's been watching, and you've been naughty."" or the classic *Die Hard* line ""Now I Got a Machine Gun. Ho Ho Ho.""  But nothing seemed appropriate. So I just said ""Hi Tony"".  He started to stammer and try get away, but we just formed a wall around him and brought him back to the office to process him.  Contacted the PD and Mall Security.  We frisked him and took his phone.  The cops came in shortly after they were called and we started to ask him where Lexi and Lebron were.  He said he didn't know who they were, and he was just stealing for himself.  We explained to the cops who they were, and Mall Security was only all to familiar with who they were dealing with, and put out an APB for the two other scumbags in the mall.  

Here's where I got my Christmas gift:  Fat Tony's phone starts ringing.  Why it's Lexi texting him. Saying Mall Security is everywhere and they all need to leave. Where is he. Should they lay low. Whats going on?  We ask the cops if we can text her saying our store is clear and nab them when they come to steal.  The cops say they can't do that, as it's entrapment, but there is nothing to stop us from doing that as we have detained him and possess his phone.  So we just send the text *B&amp;D* to Lexi.  And Lela goes out to wait with Mall Security in a concealed spot we used sometimes.  We start going through Fat Tony's phone, and its a treasure trove of ORC data.  Lists of items requested.  Pics of his car ( which was immediately looked for by the cops). Messages between him and the Fencers about items he's stolen over the last few weeks.  We have him dead to rights. ( Only down side was there were a few nudes of FT posing on his bed in a seductive manner. *Cringe*  Then we hear the cop's walkie going off. Lexi spotted mall security and took off while Lebron is trying to fight them. So one cop goes to assist.  We ended up bagging all three whether through theft or assault and trespassing charges.  Lexi and Lebron both had illegal methadone pills on them, and had the baby with them so were charged with risk of injury to a minor as well. It was the best Christmas Eve Retails Morning a boy could ask for. 

And then the proudest moment of my life, as they brought Fat Tony out to the squad car, I finally found the perfect one liner:  ""Merry Christmas, you filthy animal. And a Happy New Year.""

Not in a Garfield kind of way. No, it’s because on Mondays apparently everyone and their mother decides that this is the day they’re picking up their medication from my pharmacy. We’re talking over 300 prescriptions in the span of about 5 hours. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, since it makes the time go by faster. However it gets grueling after awhile, especially when people begin to wear you down with their nonsense.

Well today was no different. I got off my break at around 5pm, which is the start of what I have dubbed the “afterwork pill brigade” - the long, long line of people going through our one drive-thru window on their way home from work. Well, right after I put my lab coat back on, it started and did not stop for 3 hours. 

Personally, I think drive-thru pharmacy is stupid. If things run smoothly, it’s great because I can get your info, snag your drugs, and get you on your way in less than 5 minutes. However, if one of the many things go wrong, it takes a long time to fix (if we even can), and we get in trouble if a person stays at the window for too long. And here is where my story starts.

About one hour into nonstop customers at drive-thru, a woman pulls up asking for her meds (now referred to as grumpy woman, or GW). Things start out normal. She’s a little crass at first, but this isn’t surprising. I get her name/birthday/address and type it into the computer. Bing! She has one ready in the waiting bin. The conversation goes like this:

Me: Ok Mrs. GW, you have one ready. Let me go ge-

GW: Wait, there should be two! That one and another, but I don’t remember the name.

Me: Ok do you remember what doctor prescribed it?

GW: It was Dr. Blah! She said she sent it yesterday.

It’s seriously annoying how often doctors don’t call in prescriptions when they tell their patients they did.

Me: Well I don’t see it, and I can’t contact your doctor since I don’t have any of her info. Would you like to just buy your one right now and call her tomorrow?

GW: No! I’m going to call her right now!

Me: Ok, but ma’am, you can’t stay at the window. There are people behind you, so you’ll need to either come inside or pull around to the back of the line.

GW: I’m not coming inside!

Me: Then please pull around.

She drives off a huff, and I help the next couple people in line. Well she pulls up again, but this time she’s on her cell phone. She thrusts the phone in my face and says,

GW: Here’s the doctor! Talk to her!

Me: Uhh sure. Hi this is Uptown, how can I help you?

MD: *annoyed* Ok so just refill Mrs. GW medication.

Me: But we don’t have an original prescription for it.

MD: Fine. Give her thirty of the 10 milligr-

Me: Actually, hang on, but I’m sorry. I cannot take prescriptions, only my pharmacist can.

MD: Fine, then hand the phone to the pharmacist.

Me: Again, I apologize, but you need to call the pharmacy line to give prescriptions over the phone.

GW overhears me saying this, and says,

GW: What?! Why can’t you just give my phone to the pharmacist?! I’ve done that before!

Me: Ma’am, I’ll get in serious trouble if I do that. *hand phone over to GW* Please just have your doctor call the pharmacy line. 

GW: Well fine, but I’m not leaving until it’s filled!

Me: Then you’ll have to either come inside or pull around since there are people behind you.

GW: UGH *drives away*

So, I’m not sure what’s about to happen. I do hear the phone ring, and I just continue helping the next people in line. But after a couple cars, GW pulls up again.

GW: Well is it ready yet?!

I go check, and sure enough, it is. Guess the guys filling saw how much crap I was getting that they did it quick

Me: Yep! *I was actually cheerful since I was happy to get rid of her* So that’ll be $50.

GW: WHAT?! Why is it so expensive?! 

Me: Well your first script is only $6, but the one you just filled is $44, and there is no cheaper generic.

GW: UGH! Fine, then just give me *similar, cheaper drug*

Me: Ma’am, we need a prescription for that. You’ll need to have your doctor call that in.

GW: I AM NOT CALLING MY DOCTOR BACK!

Me: Then, I apologize, but we can’t fill it. Do you still want the medication?

GW: NO IT’S TOO EXPENSIVE! JUST GIVE ME THE GENERIC!

Me: Ma’am I told you, there is no generic. This is the price. I don’t know what you want me to do.

GW: WELL I’M NOT LEAVING UNTIL ITS CHEAPER.

Me: *defeated* Ok one moment, let me get my pharmacist.

So I go up to the pharmacist who’s neck deep in work and explain what’s going on. I tell him that Mrs. GW refuses to leave until we give her a cheaper option. Yes, I told her that’s the price. Yes I told her there’s no generic. Yes I told her we need a new prescription for the other drug, and she refuses to call her doctor again.

So my pharmacist says, “Ok let me talk to her.” He pops up to the window and says, “Ma’am this is the price of the medication. There is no generic, and we need a new prescription if you want the other one. You can either buy it or not”

GW: *super cheerful* Ok! I’ll just buy the medication then. Thank you so much.

FUCK YOU!!! What the fuck was that?! You just gave me so much bullshit, were a huge dick to me, and now you’re totally fine with everything?! What. The. FUCK

And the worst part was after all this happened, all my colleagues said I should have just been assertive with her. Basically tell her that this is price and you can buy it or not. 

No, that’s not how that works. If I’m assertive, then the customer thinks I’m rude. If the customer thinks the tech is rude, she’ll complain to corporate. If corporate hears this then my pharmacist get in trouble. If the pharmacist gets in trouble, I get in even worse trouble.

My supervisor put my fellow trainees to the task of cleaning up a dirty theater while I got to sell tickets. There were two of us behind the box office when the phone rang. My co-worker was busy and told me to answer it. This woman started verbally abusing me, first asking me when the next showing of *The Hobbit Part 2* was playing and if she could request a special non 3-D viewing of a movie. She asked to speak to my supervisor so I gave the phone over to him, which he promptly handed back, saying that she was asking for me. Specifically. She then went on to yell and holler about how I should *never* put the phone down and that there was a good reason I wasn't a manager.

We usually have some special going on. Our most popular is ""buy 250 business cards, get 250 free"". 

I got an email saying that someone submitted an online order for business cards to be picked up later. The order ticket says 200 cards. So I print 200 cards and run them through the cutter. 

She comes in a few hours later to pick them up. She's already worked up because I didn't give get a call when they were ready because she was hoping I'd have them done in an hour (wasn't going to happen even if I knew that).

Her: the cards look nice. This is 500 cards?

Her: I know, but you guys have a 250, get 250 free deal. I thought you would know I needed 500.

Me: but you only ordered 200... not 250 or 500.

Her: *sighs, clearly irritated* nevermind, this'll do.

I then tell her the total. 

Her: do you have any coupons...? Or discounts? Because I'd like this to be cheaper. Especially since I wanted this done in an hour. (Wut?)

I'm annoyed at this point because the store is busy and I have a line of annoyed customers behind her. 

I'm also annoyed because when you do an online order, it tells you the exact price to expect when you pay in store. It shouldn't be a surprise. I just curtly tell her, have her pay, (hmphing the whole time), before sending her on her way.

I was taking as much antibiotics as I could, but still had wicked coughing fits that could be set off by simple things like laughing and walking quickly. I also was ridiculously exhausted and cold despite donning multiple layers and being in the land of sunshine and surfers, and thus shaking most of the time. My coughing had bruised my face, so it looked like I was on the receiving end of an abusive relationship, and to top it all off, someone had stolen my purse the week before this happened.

So I walk into the land of red and khakis to find some more Nyquil, which I had been dosing myself with to help quiet the cough. I also grab more concealer and foundation to cover up as much of the bruising as possible. But as I get to the front of the line, I discover what is either a new store-wide or state-wide policy: Customers must swipe their state ID or drivers license to purchase cough syrup. At this point, I am visibly shivering and look like shit. The cashier was an older gentleman, probably in his late 50s or early 60s.

Cashier: Can you swipe your drivers license?

Me: I... I don't drive. And my purse was stolen last week. HOLD ON, I have my passport.

I began to dig around in my bag, and he reached over and stopped me.

Some days are good, some days are bad. I mostly enjoy it, as I love books and I enjoy selling books. The staff discount and the ability to borrow books without paying for them helps too.

Anyway, I had a young couple come in the other day (I say young, but they were likely around my age - late 20s, early 30s). A bit worn around the edges, but happy. Reminded me of the kind of people I used to work with on construction sites or in kitchens.

They were looking for children's books. I asked ""How old?"" They beamed at me. ""3 days. She's still in the hospital."" 

I suggested Robert Munsch. If you don't know Robert Munsch, he is (in my opinion) the best children's author out there. I ended up selling them 3 books. 

The man and I talked for a bit, and before he left he shook my hand and said that he had never been a reader. He had never finished a book, cover to cover.

 But dammit, he was gonna read to his daughter every night.

Like all items, you could call in ahead, we'd check if we had the item, and we'd put it on hold for 2 days for you.


My coworker did this for one customer. He came in later that day with his wife and I helped him out. I checked the tire size to be sure it was right before we sold it to him. It turns out it was a 16"" and he needed a 17"". I went back to check if we had the right size, but we didn't.


I apologized for the inconvenience, but let him know we could order it for him and have it here within 2 days. He went from zero to crazy person in no time. He asked angrily, ""Where does that leave me? Where does that leave me? No where, that's where. I'm never coming here again."" And he stormed out. I was confused, and shrugged it off to a guy being generally crazy. I went to put the tire back, and glanced over as his wife was walking out.


About three seconds later he came STORMING back in. His wife apparently told him I was laughing (I was not). He got in my face and started yelling. ""You think that's funny?! You think it's funny?!"" Then he shoved me. I took a step back to keep my footing, but tripped over a stack of boxes behind me and fell over, tire on me.


The coworker that originally put the tire on hold came out, hearing me fall, and saw what was going on. He actually enjoyed dealing with angry customers (for whatever reason) and physically forced him out of the store. All while the guy was screaming things about me being a ""faggot"" and a ""punk."" (I'm not gay and was in ROTC at the time, so my appearance was pretty professional.)


My coworker got the guy's license plate, and I had the guy's name because we put the tire on hold under his name. Called the cops and the less-than-enthusiastic officer asked me if I wanted to press charges. Absolutely; commit battery on me at my work where I'd be fired for retaliating and I'll do whatever I can to return the favor. Especially since I was trying to *help* him.

It's a struggle because I work 30-40 hours a week on top of my classes. ANYWAY.



We were completely out of change, we had no coins and customers were getting pissed with all the small change we had to give them. So I was at the counter and telling the other person on shift with me that he needed to go across the street and try get coins, when the woman I was serving suddenly said ""Is this non verbal communication service you're providing?""


I had already greeted her and asked her if she needed help with anything/wanted anything extra. She was waiting for me to tell her to put her pin number in the machine, when it doesn't even tell me on my screen because it's up to her to do it herself. I apologised and explained it to her, and she started telling me how I should be thankful to have this job and that I needed to provide better customer service. I tend to backchat to my rude customers, but this woman had just shocked me so much I just stood there in silence repeatedly apologising (even though I had no reason to!) The customers behind her were snickering too, at her I'm presuming. this is something I've noticed a lot, that when I get yelled at on the checkout, I'm quite young looking, probably about the 16-17 age bracket. Nobody EVER asks me if I'm okay, or comments on the behaviour they've just seen.


The guy on shift with me saw I was upset, so he told me to take a break, so I leant at the side against the other cash register (which was closed) wiping the tears out of my eyes, when this man suddenly said to me ""Are you just going to stand there all day doing nothing or are you going to serve me?""


I know it's stupid but I was getting quite upset and I had to go to the bathroom to calm myself and try keep myself from crying. When I came back out, it was just my luck. We were being held up. Two guys, covered in black head to toe and had two knives. I think if I was behind the counter I probably would have freaked out more than I did, all that really happened to me was that the second guy pointed the knife at me while the other guy emptied the cash registers, as they both obnoxiously shouted abuse and threats at us not to press our alarm. Obviously I was pressing mine like there was no tomorrow.


So that's been my worst day so far, I've been at it two years now because I started when I first began college at 18.

She worked at a national chain on the island and every year during the Pro Bowl players would come in with large groups of family and friends. One night right before closing time a certain offensive lineman for an NFC West team came in with a group of more than 15 people. They stayed for a couple of hours past close and ran up a tab of well over 3k(this is probably why they let them stay so late, that and the fact that dude is the biggest person you've ever seen). At the end of the meal the check was brought to the table with the standard 18% gratuity added. My gf was just waiting for them to leave and doing other things around her station so she could jet the minute they were gone. They all get up and leave and she makes her way to the check...


Not only had they subtracted the added gratuity but they had also chosen to leave her 5.00. On 3k+. FIVE DOLLARS. My ex was so upset that she immediately started to cry and by the time she calmed down they were all already gone. Now I'm definitely not saying that the NFL player in the group was the one who made the decision to short change her but due to his perennially being ""franchise"" tagged by his team I did know that he was making 12-14 million dollars a year. Every year. What a classy bunch.

This story does have a happy ending however. The next day Bryant Young came in(his name is ok, since he's awesome I'm assuming?) with his family, much smaller group. She recognized him since I made her watch Niners games with me and told him that she was a big fan because he seemed so nice on the field(yes, my gf is that kind of person). He asked her if she'd met any other players and she told him what had happened the night before. He expressed his dismay and told her not to judge all players off of that. They chatted some more and she told him I was from the Bay Area and was a huge niners fan. He had her call me at work and then got on the phone and talked to me for a couple of minutes. At the end of the meal he tipped her out 500 bucks. Great dude BY.

The first 2 years, I worked in the jewelry department.  Then the store was open from 4am to 11pm.  We cam in early, got our departments straight, the doors opened and havoc began.  We used the ticket system.  The tickets were those that people use for a drawing.  They are pairs of tickets with the same number on them.  Well, neither year did that work out very well, as the person who was handing out the tickets, gave us the reverse of the tickets that we were to call out.  

IOW, she would give tickets 1-10 and we would call out tickets 10-1.  We didn't know what order she was giving them out in.

Anyway, about 3 months prior to this year's Black Friday, our manager is quietly being investigated for who knows what.  The investigation takes about a couple of months, and we never see that manager again.

A few weeks ago we were introduced to our new manager.  Well, besides this guy being friendly to everyone in sight and upbeat all the time, he actually thinks about the customers and employees at the same time.

This year we, following Wally World's lead, had doorbuster specials at 6am - 4pm on Thanksgiving.  Then we closed the store and opened back up at 8pm with more doorbuster specials.  Our store closed again at 3am.  We opened once again at 5am with doorbuster specials until 11am.  

Each time we had people lined up outside waiting for the new doorbuster specails.  The new manager went outside to talk to the customers around 15-20 minutes before the store re-opened.  He went out and handed out the tickets for the electronics, as we have a very limited amount of them, as we always do.  Then he gave a caveat to the customers that if they have a problem with anything whatsoever, they are not to get angry at the worker's for the worker's don't get paid enough to deal with a customer's anger.  The customer's were to find the manager and the assistant manager if there were any problems.

Then he came in and told us that if any customer started to get angry about the price, instead of calling the MoD and holding up the line, if it was just a few dollars difference please override it.  

And if a customer started cursing at us, we were to call the MoD and the customer would be escorted out.

Then the manager stood at the door and greeted everyone as they came in, he helped customers out to their cars with the heavy things, he responded to every call the associates had, unless he was with a customer and then one of the assistant managers would do so.  This guy even went outside and helped clean up the trash that was left there when the customers came inside.

I am glad to see that there are decent managers in the world.  I am sorry to be leaving the store, but I have a better money making opportunity at a local pharmacy.  But if I ever need to look for work again, if the new manager is still there, I would go back in a heartbeat.

We were coming off a hiring freeze and desperate for people, and would hire anyone. I was in my office looking over applications, and found a few I wanted to call back. one in particular was very impressive. I gave them a date and time for an interview and that was that. 

That following day we had the interviews, we were hiring ANYONE, so long as you looked decent and acted decent you were probably getting the job. A couple in particular stood out. The first guy came in wearing an expensive suit, and a gave me a firm handshake, he was friendly to our secretary, and just an all around great guy. He nailed the interview, and i hired him on the spot.

The rest of the interviews went well, hired 5 more people and was waiting for my last interview. The last guy didn't show up till 20minutes after, not only was he LATE, but, he was wearing a dirty T-shirt and torn jeans, had a unkempt beard and smelled terrible. I normally would have rejected him on the spot, but, we were desperate for people and I wanted to see where this would go.

he nailed the interview, absolutely nailed it. he looked like a bum, but, his personality said he was a real straight shooter. I was impressed, I against my better judgement gave him the job. I put him as cart pusher, much to his dismay. I just couldn't justify placing him anywhere else, I had my doubts and cart pushers didn't require you to have much going for you.

he passes his drug test, and we schedule orientation for the following day. he's 2 hours late to orientation and not in uniform. I truly regretted hiring him now, HR was furious with me, but, i convinced her to give him a shot. I pray this guy does well because this would reflect badly upon me, but, what can I say? I felt this guy could be a damn good worker once he cleans up his act, or maybe I was just foolish and too inexperienced. 

Flash forward a week,and everyone is done with training. Remember the sharp dressed guy? he's stuck in my department, I.E. electronics. Everyday I'm with him, I just want to strangle him because he's so damn arrogant. He talks down to everyone, including the customer. He thinks because he once worked a ""real job"" and has a fancy degree from a big university that justifies talking down to everyone. Everyday i get complaints from employees about his behavior, about him refusing to do something or talking down to a customer.

While Sharp Dressed man is obnoxious, unkempt Beard man is apparently doing an excellent job. Now Cart Pushing isn't a difficult job per se, and Cart pushers don't have a ton of interaction with customers, but, they are required to help customers and just be friendly. But, even though Cart Pushing isn't the most demanding job in the store, it's still important and so when i hear he's done a fine job as a Pusher and extremely friendly and helpful towards customers, well, that makes me pretty happy.

Eventually we get rid of Sharp Dressed Man. Nobody liked him, he wasn't a good salesmen, he wasn't a good employee and his arrogance was just too much for anyone.

""You better, because that is your coupon,"" the woman retorts.


I check with my manager over the walkie who confirms that the coupon isn't valid.


""I'm sorry but my manager says we're unable to take the coupon."" (We try to take the coupons away so they can't use them at a different register. At this point, I had filed it with my other coupons.)


The woman becomes enraged. ""YOU NEED TO GIVE ME THAT COUPON BACK! THAT COUPON IS VALID! WHY WON'T YOU TAKE IT?!""


At this point, I have a line of about 4 women behind her and I'm starting to lose my patience.


""We can't take that coupon because it's fake. We haven't given out $10 in over a year and they have no plans of giving them out anytime soon. That's why."" 


She then calmly asks for the coupon back.


So, I took it out of my coupon bag, drew a big black line through the barcode so it couldn't be used, then handed it back to her with a smile on my face.


That really made her mad. She demanded my name which I gladly have to her. I even wrote it on the coupon then I encouraged her to contact our store management if she had any issues with my not taking her fake coupon.


The women in line started chuckling. The irate couponer glared at me and then stormed out of the store. I haven't seen her since!",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1jjsku,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1jjsku/sweet_vengence_with_the_crazy_coupon_lady/,

I work at a movie theater where we not only sell popcorn and soda, but coffee and ice cream (because we're fancy like that). The coffee and ice cream bar is a separate section of the vending stand, known as the Cafe, and has 16 different ice creams on display in a giant freezer for people to pick and choose from, like Ben &amp; Jerry's or Baskin Robbins. For each shift, there's one person trained on the Cafe (which happens to be me on this particular Saturday night) and the Manager.

It's normal for a family to come up and get a bunch of ice cream together, or a single customer to want a cup of coffee. Tonight, there was a Middle-Eastern-looking or Indian-looking man (couldn't tell, tbh) that came up. The conversation went as such:

Man: ""Okay, what are your cones?""

Me: ""We have waffle, sugar, and wafer cones.""

Man: ""Okay. What is smallest cone?""

Me: ""That would either be the sugar or the wafer cone, they hold roughly the same amount of ice cream.""

Man: ""Okay, I want that one."" -points to wafer cone-

Me: ""All righty, what kind of ice cream would you like?""

Man: ""Superman. One scoop Superman, my son likes that kind.""

I nod and get his order for him, and bring him over to the register. I ring up his total.

Man: ""Oh, oh, wait. I need another one. For my other son. Same thing.""

I go and get another one of the same thing. Again, I return to the register, pass him his two cones, repeat his order back to him, and ring up his total.

Man: ""I'm so sorry, I'm not done yet.""

Me: ""Okay, what else would like?""

Man: ""I need... 15 of these."" -points to the cones in his hand-

I pause. This is unusual. Somebody does not just order 15 ice cream cones randomly.

Me: ""You want 15 ice cream cones?""

Man: ""Yes.""

Me: ""All the same thing?""

Man: ""Uh, no, no."" -he walks back over to the freezer, looking inside- ""I want 1 Moose Tracks, 2 chocolate, 1 mint...""

About ten minutes have passed, and there's a line growing behind him. I call for my manager to help me, but she's busy helping the rest of the vending stand, so she sends a fellow coworker over. She doesn't know Cafe, all she has to do to help me is scoop 15 cones of ice cream. We bring more cones from the back to complete the order, and the man grabs a tray to carry all the cones in. He sets his original two down, and pass the ones we make to him. Finally, he has his total of 17 cones, almost each one a different flavor, ring up his total, and swipe his credit card no problem. He walks away with his tray of 15 cones and seems content with his purchase.

A few minutes later, he returns and says that he needs 5 more. At this point, nothing surprises me, so I make them and ring up the 5. Right after I swipe his card, though, he says that he doesn't need them anymore. I call my manager over for a refund, and he walks away empty-handed.

Right before we close, a woman and her son approach. She looks similar to the man (dark features), so I figure that he might have been a part of a big family. She says that she wants two wafer cones with Superman ice cream - what the man had originally wanted before purchasing the 15 cones. As I'm doing so, I hear the little boy that is with her say:

Boy: ""Mommy, why are we getting more ice cream if daddy just threw all of it away?""

Woman: ""Sshhhh...""

I don't say anything, but it's really perplexing. Why would someone spend $40+ on ice cream, only to throw it away? I then try and rationalize that it might be a different family or something, and it's just coincidence that the little boy said that. I think this until I swipe the credit card, which happens to be the same thing as the man's.

I give them their ice cream, and they walk away happy. Not two minutes later, the man returns with a different little boy, saying that his son of dropped his cone. I reply that I need the cone to spoil it out in our inventory, and so the little boy runs to get it. The man is impatient now, and decides to just purchase another one - a wafer cone, this time with Moose Tracks.

So, all in all, it was just really weird, as it doesn't happen often, and I'm not sure what exactly was going on. I have plenty more stories, but this one sticks out as one of the weirdest.

**TL;DR: Single customer wants 2 ice cream cones, then orders 15 more. Walks away, comes back and says he needs 5 more, changes his mind, is refunded, walks away empty-handed. His wife and son come up, with the son saying, ""Mommy, why are we getting more ice cream if daddy just threw all of it away?"" order 1 ice cream cone with his credit card, walk away. Man returns again, saying a different son dropped his ice cream, decides to purchase another one... All in all spending at least $40 on ice cream.**",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1c83iy,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1c83iy/15_icecream_cone_man/,

Standard Saturday Starbucks run. Order drink, stand in line for drink, get behind the person ordering three triple drinks with weird mix. Pretty standard but I was in no rush....

Barista: Here is your first one maam, others are coming right along. 

Lady: Thankkkkkkks.... Ummm do you have any of those holder thingies??

Now I will clarify where this lady is standing. She is at the end of the coffee bar, literally arms length from the cup trays she is looking for. Fair enough she wasn't pay attention...

Barista: Oh they are right there (points them out as she continues to make the other drinks)

Lady: Thankkkkkkkkssss.... Do you have any of those sleeves.

Now I take notice, the cup sleeves are directly infront of her, less than two feet away... I can't believe she asked but now I am paying attention to this.

Barista puts her second drink on the counter: They are right there pointing directly infront of the lady....

Lady: Thankkkkkkkkss (yah she did that every time) Do you have any of those green stick things?

I snorted, literally made an audible snort. The green sticks that plug the hole are directly behind the cup sleeves she was already staring at. She shoots me back a glare but then we both realize that there is a line of people behind me watching this too. They are all equally amused. 

Barista with a smile: ""They are right here....."" slowly pointing with her free hand as she delivers the 3rd cup

Lady looks back realizing that she just asked 3 of the dumbest question right in a row: ""Oh I am trainable.. thanks""  She steps slightly to the side as I step up to get my drink. Now the Barista knows what I am gonna say but she is giving me that ""DONT YOU DARE!"" look as I smirk..

Me: Do you.... (lady walking away) have any straws??? 

Straws being right next to my elbow as I ask. Two ladies and the guy behind me both laugh out loud and Barista give me the same look ""How did I know you were gonna ask that....."" 

We still get a kick out of the straws every so often.

It was my first ""real"" job ever, with real responsibilities. The job description included packing and delivering huge shipments and regular salesman.

A few weeks after I started, this man, a former driving instructor in his 60s or so came in. Keep in mind; the store is incredibly large, and on Saturdays it is especially busy and crowded, because that's when the hobbyists usually come. Of course, like in most retail, they usually come about 20 minutes before the store closes, and it often takes 15-30 minutes to help a single customer due to the store's size. Due to all of this, mistakes happen, and when they do, customers are more than welcome to come back and receive compensation.

Anyway, this man came in and needed 3 meters (ca. 9 ft) of [Platon Xtra](http://www.isola.no/assets/Products/Platon%20Xtra/_resampled/LightBox-PackshotNYXtra-rull.jpg) (exterior foundation). Platon Xtra is incredibly expensive, about 600 dollars for 10 meters I believe. He tells me to cut it at exactly 3 meters. And so I do.

A few days later, he comes back into the store and starts yelling at everyone he meets. Apparently, I had cut it 2 cm (about 0.8 of an inch) short of what he needed. He starts screaming shit like I'm incompetent, blind, every shitty word in the book basically. I can't remember everything he said exactly, but think of a bad name or word and he probably said it. Since he had hired a contractor to do the work for him, he had lost several hundreds of dollars since the contractor had already tried to use the Platon. He demands that the manager comes out to handle this.

The manager comes out and he tells him to come back with the material so we can double check.

And so he does. An hour later or so he comes back with the Platon, and so we measure it up. And whaddayaknow, it's 3 meters and 2 millimeters in length. Apparently it was the contractor who f*cked up.

Besides the regular stores, the company also provided a service where you could order your groceries which would then be delivered at home for you.

This is relevant because one day an elderly lady came to my register. All was fine and I just checked everything out, she paid for it and we exchanged some pleasant remarks. However, after she was done she asked me to make sure her groceries would be delivered at her home. I was obviously confused at first, as this was the first time someone asked me such a thing.

It quickly became apparent though that she saw a van bearing the logo of our shop stop at the nursing home across the street from her, and she had decided she wanted that service as well. As I explained that the delivery service was separate from our shop and that she would have to visit the website or call (I was at least pretty sure that was how you could contact them) she kept insisting that we could just load it in a waiting van and send it to her home.

A couple of minutes of her trying to convince me that there was a never before seen van waiting at the back and me arguing back at her that I had never seen one from up close during the year I'd worked there I called a manager over who explained what I had been saying. Luckily it was pretty calm and nobody was left waiting for her at the time and eventually she left with her groceries, though I suspect she still believed we were for some reason hiding the delivery service from her.

I currently work in a mid-sized American retailer, and I wanted to tell you guys about my former assistant store manager.  

My manager, let's call him Don, was about one of the most stupid people I have ever met.  Although he was really nice to me, he was also a pathological liar.  Don was fairly new to his position and nothing he did was ever right.  If there was something to mess up, he would screw it up beyond repair.  For example, he broke one of the expensive dress shirt fixtures that is essential to my department that hasn't been replaced to this day.  He was also lazy, he would disappear for hours into a room adjacent to one of the fitting rooms (this is important later).  For these reasons, the store manager had it out to get him fired or transferred even though he was brand new.

One day a customer called the store extremely upset, she claimed that she had seen an employee creeping under the fitting room door while she tried on a bra.  She felt extremely violated and was considering legal options.  This was all kept extremely hush-hush; luckily, I was the one that had originally taken her call.  I originally tried to explain this away.  I thought that Don was so dumb, he was probably checking to see if the fitting room was empty.  Despite his many faults, he was a pretty nice guy that I didn't mind working with.  

Don was originally from another state and had moved to take the job.  Much to my store manager's relief, a job opened up in his home state and he transferred back.  Nothing ever came of the woman in the fitting room trying on bras.  

Fast forward a year,  I find out that Don was arrested for hiding in the ceiling and peering down on fitting rooms.  A mother and her daughter were in a fitting room and she happened to look up and see a man staring down at them.  He immediately ran away when they spotted him.  The report that I read said that when the mother and daughter asked to speak with a manager, he was the only one on duty.  He tried to explain it away by saying that there were several other men working in the store at the time.  They said, ""Unless he looks like you, and stole your name-tag, you were the pervert staring at us.""  Needless to say, he was immediately fired.  

After I heard the story of his arrest, I remembered that he used to always disappear into a side room for hours.  I believe he creeped on fitting rooms where I work too because the side room was directly adjacent to fitting rooms.  I couldn't believe I could ever be so wrong about somebody; I always thought he was just dumb and lazy but generally nice.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1k1sgx,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1k1sgx/my_pervert_of_an_exboss/,

Todays Story is set in the Students Union Night Club. I worked here as a Bar Supervisor. The Gist of the job is to make sure drinks and tills are stocked, deal with asshole customers, and make my colleagues life (below and above the chain of command) as easy as possible. I take it seriously, which is why I got supervisor.

Enter Freshers Week. Freshers Week is the busiest week of the year, 14 days, 12 Events, its our money maker. We do this right we get bigger and better acts to book for the rest of the year. 

Gets to last night of Freshers week, all staff have worked at least 8 events, I've worked all of them. Cos of that lovely money and actually giving a damn about my job.

Onto the MEAT of the story:

Loving the job, shifting Kegs, filling tills with change, emptying tills of Notes (taking out £1000 in a FISTFULL is SO satisfying), banter with colleagues.

#Thisiswhyilovemyjob

The queue (scrum of people) for the bar is 4 deep, its 1AM. By the Power of Greyskull I will get these people served and happy :D

I see a problem developing. in the mass infront of the bar there are 2 guys arguing very loudly at each other, friends have hands on shoulders. Looks like it could get UGLY. Don't want this getting closer to the bar, don't want my staff in the way of potential puncheyfists in action. 

Get by BIG ASS VOICE ON. (6""6 tall I can single people out easy).

Me: ""Hey Guys"" - Get their attention over the bajillion decibels of Skrillex being pumped out.

Me: ""You need to stop that argument or you wont be served."" - Get the nods. Crisis averted. Friends try to steer them apart.

2 minutes, 12 customers, and 30 drinks later (can be accurate due to review on CCTV and Till flow logs) they reach the front. They're back next to each other. They're back arguing. Friend have been served and have rejoined the pulsating mass of limbs, tits and tongues on the dancefloor.

Me: ""Hey guys, please stop this argument, you're not getting served unless you stop it Right NOW"" (Try to use that stern Fatherly tone I never had).

Hand gets put in my face. Right. Plan B. Moi.EngageBeast(FULLFURY); function called.

""OI, YOU TWO, GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM MY BAR NOW. NEITHER OF YOU ARE GETTING SERVED AT THIS BAR AGAIN (one of 2 bars in club). IN 5 SECONDS I WILL CALL SECURITY. THEN YOUR NIGHTS ARE OVER""  - This gets their attention

At this point I will label the customers White Guy (WG) and Black Guy (BG).

WG: ""Sorry man, i'll go"" - seems surprised but slinks off into the night.

BG: ""You cant talk to me like dat bruv!"" (I actually wish he wasn't conforming to the stereotype, but he was)

Me: ""I can, I have, now i'll count to 3 before I call security"" - Take out that sexy black radio, thumb over button.

""1"" - nothing. Normal.

""2"" - Glaring begins.

""3"" - Goes to open his mouth. By now 9/10 people scurry off before their night gets permanently ended.

""Moi to Security . . . "" - He realises I aint messing. My staffs safety is no.1. I don't want this guy at the bar.

BG: ""Whateva fuckhead"" He leaves. I give security a description, my boss is on Security channel too, so both bars are now on alert for these asshats.

Half an hour later WG approaches the bar, its quiet now. Staff do not serve him. So proud of them backing me on this one. I walk over to him.

WG: ""Hey man, im sorry for that earlier, can I get a pint please?"" - Bless him, he's said sorry. I don't really want to ruin his night.

Me: ""Don't worry man, just don't want things ugly at the bar."" - Get him his £1 pint he apologises again and wanders off into the night. #MightNotBeATotalDick.

BG approaches the bar.

BG: ""why you serving him?"" - He's got another scowl on his face, his shoulders are back, his back is straight. He is trying to do the alpha male dominate thing. Works better when I don't have a foot in height (6""6) and am not twice your bodyweight (22 stone).

Me: ""He said sorry, if you do, i'll serve you too."" 

BG: ""you're just not serving me cos im black! you a fucking racist man!"" - Race Card = alarm bells.

Me: ""I'm not a racist, he said sor . . ."" ""RACIST"".

The next 2 minutes are like something from the Austin Powers films. When Dr Evils son tries to say something and Dr Evil shuts him off with a ""Shh"". Except instead of a ""Shh"" it's another ""RACIST"".

After 2 minutes of Logic and basic politeness dying in the mix of 1000 spilled drinks this gets to its logical conclusion.

BG: ""Ah need a manager man, Go get him. Now. Im suing this place"" - This is England AssHat, not the states.

Me: ""I can't leave the bar without another supervisor here, the managers office is by the entrance, go there and describe me and you can give a complaint.""

BG: ""Whas you name?"" - Yeah, because 6""6, 22 Stone, Bald, Eyebrowless (Notice to smokers, do NOT try and light up on a gas hob).

Me: ""Fester."" - Current nickname due to appearance, including them hollow dead eyes after no sleep for a while.

BG: ""Im off to the manager now, Youre so Fired DICKHEAD!""

So he marches off. I know I could be in some trouble, I wasn't diplomatic. Probably a written apology and some beer tokens.

10 minutes later I get radioed to the office. BG is stood outside, flips me off  and I go in.

Manager not very happy. Busiest night of the year and he's dealing with this shit.

Manager: ""Fester, I don't have time for this today . . ."" Then we hear it from outside.

""RACIST""

Boss and I bundle out to see what the commotion is. It's WG being escorted out for having a bit too much feely time on the dancefloor. BG is pissed off and trying to get through him through Simon the Lebanese Powerlifter (I once armwrestled him and it was like trying to push a mountain).

WG is evicted, BG is about to get his apology. 

Whats this, BG is an asshole? BG walks out and starts the old argument from the bar with WG again. Boss grabs a phone call. Returns with the biggest shit eating grin on his face.

""Coppers are on the way over for a quick premesis check"" - Local initiative for Police to do a couple of walkthroughs of a club on busy nights, presence etc.

WG and BG still at it hammer and tongs, they've taken it outside. Out of our Jurisdiction.

Cops turn up just as BG throws a loopy hook at WG. 

Hell Fucking Yes. 

2 Burly Police grab BG and cuff him immediately. Then for good measure they Cuff WG too. Back of Van. Both are hauled off.

Boss  looks at me. ""guess you don't have a complaint anymore"".

Submitted for your approval:

Today, I felt like spaghetti.  Not physically, but dammit, I wants me some noodles and marinara.  So I hove myself off my nice comfy couch and away from reruns of Dirty Jobs, and headed to the local store.  Tis a rather large edifice department and grocery store, similar to Walmart but higher class and locally based.  As I stood in the spice aisle, pondering whether or not I should get some basil for this evening's repast, I noticed a curious scent.  Definitely not the kind of smell you associate with the spice aisle, this was obviously THAT kind of herb.

I turn and see a young man, who is obviously HIGH.  No, I don't mean that he's pretty stoned, I mean he is HHHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH.  He's past the point of thinking he's growing deer antlers.  He's so high his component molecules are randomly blipping in and out of existence.  He's so baked Betty Crocker could use him as a spokesmodel.  He's so blazed I didn't want to approach him without bunker and SCBA gear.  Snoop Dogg himself would tell him to tone it down a few notches.  [10]^^10

I hope I'm painting an adequate picture here.  The dude was really high.

I realize that my 5-minute trip to the store was about to go a little longer, because there was no WAY that I wasn't going to follow this guy around (at a discreet distance) and see what kind of entertainment he could provide.  Also, I wanted to make sure he didn't try to climb the shelves or something dangerous.  He was just high enough to try that.  (Seriously, I'm from Portland, I've NEVER seen someone that far gone before).

And oh, what a time this young man was having!  The look on his face I can only describe as sheer joyous wonder.  The same look I assume Neil Armstrong had when he first stepped off the LEM landing pad and made his famous speech.  (In fact, this guy was so stoned he may have been there with Neil).  Anyway, I wander along behind him as he makes his own voyage of discovery through the wild lands of the Spice Aisle-lands, the steep sides of the Paper Towel Valley, and the deep jungles of Men's Apparel.  Here our hero stopped to ponder the ancient mysteries of a red-and-white striped tie, which apparently held as much interest for him as the Rosetta Stone did for Jean-François Champollion.  What secrets did it's nylon fibers hold?  Unfortunately for our intrepid explorer, a more pressing matter suddenly came to his mind:  MUNCHIES.

Retracing his rather wandering steps, he found himself in the cracker/cookie aisle, and it was like watching a kid in a candy store.  He gently brushed his hands over boxes of Triscuits and Goldfish, stared lovingly at the bags of Milanos, even held his breath in excitement upon finding a treasure trove of Bugles.  BUT WAIT!!  The Motherlode!!  Manna from heaven!  Ambrosia!  The Nectar of the Gods!  CRUSTABLES!!  One sweep of his no-doubt-nerveless arms, and a veritable bounty of those delicious snacks were now his.

But, that is not enough.  Nay, Crustables need a side dish.  Away again he wandered, this time heading into the produce area (by this time I'm bright red in the face from trying to hold back laughter) on a mission to find the perfect mate for his self-contained PB&amp;J sammiches.  Like a fine gem collector he perused the tables of fresh veggies, until he stopped and reached for a single, solitary source of vitamin B5.

An avocado.

A smile crept across his face, showing that he was pleased with this bumper crop of nutrition.  With only the mildest of wobbles he now headed for the checkout stands.  Again I followed 10 yards behind, though I'm pretty sure I could have stood right in front of him in a clown suit, waving a giant sunflower and singing ""Happy Days are Here Again"" and he wouldn't have noticed me.  He was now on a mission.

Being that it was later in the afternoon, the store is, of course, rather busy.  12 lanes are open, and each one has three or four people in line.  That kind of crowd and noise was daunting and confusing to our brave shopping warrior.  He stood back from the lines, his body language simply saying, ""Aww, man...""  But hope was rekindled, when he spied out of one very bleery eye the U-Scan area, which was surprisingly crowd free!

But here in lies the final challenge.  Working the U-Scan.  I took my purchases (I had decided to forgo the basil and just use oregano, I know, I'm not very adventurous) to pay my fare and watch the inevitable Charlie Foxtrot that would occur.  And occur it did.  The machine was as foreign to him as an EKG would be to an aboriginal native of the deep Amazon jungle.  Thankfully, the kind and helpful customer service attendant working there realized the young man's predicament, and went to assist.  She instantly realized what the situation was, and slowed down her speech so that he could understand what was going on.  I'm pretty sure he didn't anyway, but he did manage to put all his valuable victuals into a sack, hand a wad of cash to the attendant, mumble out something extremely unintelligible but was probably a variation on ""thank you,"" and headed towards the exit.  I bagged my fixins, stopped next to the attendant to share a laugh, and then headed for the parking lot and my car.

The last I saw of him, he was headed off on yet another adventure, this one to points unknown and distances unthought.  My only conciliation was the fact that he was headed AWAY from the busy highway, and towards the much lower-traffic roads of the residential area behind the store.  I sat down in my car, and started laughing so hard I was crying.  Now, it's time to make some dinner.

What could have been $40 for her, I turned it into $4. And I smiled widely as I told her she would be getting $4.

[My last story, with links to the other ones, because today is lazy day](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1dimpf/beep_beep_coming_through_or_that_doesnt_seem/)

First off, I'm going to apologize for not posting for a while.  The last 18 days have been EXTREMELY busy for me.  Four corporate events for a truly massive company, an off-Broadway production of Flashdance, a charity event for an AIDS foundation, a children's theater production of A Year with Frog and Toad, a performance by the Vancouver BC Ballet, and tomorrow I'm doing a symposium hosted by two US Representatives and the Dalai Lama.  The money's good, but my back and feet are screaming at me.  But I'm complaining, when I should be telling a story.  Forgive this old man, hand me the bottle, and I'll spin ya a yarn.

The end of November is a big social/cultural event here in Oregon.  No, not Thanksgiving, that's the week before.  I'm talking about The Civil War.  The U of O/OSU football game that's been played almost every year since 1894.  On game day just about everyone is either wearing green and gold or orange and black.  Huge parties are held in bars, homes, senior centers, churches, restaurants, or any place with a flat surface and a projector; and the city of Eugene (or Corvallis, this year it's in Eugene) turns into a massive charlie foxtrot of drunks, excited fans, lost drivers, and the occasional burning UW mascot.  People come from all over the place to be here for it, which is where the subjects of our story step into the scene.

As traffic crawled along the interstate, cars flying their respective team flags, business at the station was about one half-step below fully psychotic.  The parking lot was full of people, the pumps were lined up 10-12 deep, and I had a line of at least a dozen in the store.  My customer service smile was firmly locked in ""holy shit this is a nightmare did you find everything you were looking for"" mode, and I was ringing people up as fast as I could go.  LOTS of beer was being sold, which is no big surprise.  In walk five guys (no, not the burger place, that was across the street) who look to be in their mid 20s, and are excitedly talking about the prospects for the game.  The go back to the cooler, grab a couple cases of Bud Light, and stand in line, still happily chatting away about what was going to happen.  This was the pre-Chip Kelly days, so the outcome wasn't nearly as certain.  They approached the counter, and plonked down their beer and some snackable materials.

""Morning guys.  Find everything you need?  Looking forward to the game?""

Smiles, smiles, yeah, got it all, totally stoked to see what Masoli can do, blah blah blah.

""Can I see everyone's ID, please?""

This is where things took a sharp turn into Notsofunville.  Four of the guys dug for their wallets, producing British Columbia drivers licenses.  No biggie, I've dealt with them before.  However, the fifth guy suddenly stops smiling, crosses his arms, and frowns in a most menacing manner.  One of his friends notices and tells him to pull out his ID.

""I'm 28 and from Canada, I don't have to show this guy my ID.""

Before his friend can gather his jaw up off the floor, I interject.

""Sir, Oregon state law says I have to ID anyone who looks under the age of 25, no matter what their country of origin.""

""I just told you, I'm 28.""

""I understand, but telling me isn't proof, I need to see ID or I can't sell to you guys.""

At that point, his friends all gave him a glare that would have shriveled Darth Vader where he stood, but AC (for Angry Canadian) has just set his stubbornness transmission into low gear.

""I'm not showing you my ID.""

""Then I'm afraid I can't sell you guys the beer,"" as I take the cases and move them farther back on the counter out of reach.

At this point, AC keeps arguing with me, but he he uncrosses his arms and curls his thumb through the opening of his front pants pocket.  A pocket which I had noticed earlier had a pocket knife clipped to it.  The hair on the back of my neck struggled to rise to attention.  When I again reiterated that I couldn't sell the beer without seeing ID, his hand gripped the handle of the knife, and gently tugged at it.

Remember, I'm a criminal justice major.  That kind of behavior made my brain go **RED FLAG, RED FLAG!!  WARNING, WARNING, DANGER WILL ROBINSON, DANGER!!**  I instantly slipped into a combat stance, placed my right hand on my own knife, my left on the edge of the counter, and removed all pretense at customer service by bellowing at the guy in a much lower and louder tone, ""TAKE YOUR HAND OFF THE WEAPON RIGHT NOW.""

Now, you may ask, ""Osiris, he didn't actually pull the knife out, or say anything threatening.  Why the incredibly strong reaction?""  Good question.  About two weeks earlier, while I was on a vacation, the store had been robbed at knife point.  The kid who had been covering for me had been cut pretty badly, and had refused to come back to work after the incident.  I was extremely sensitive about the subject.  To the point where I had stopped carrying my dinky little Swiss Army knife and started carrying my Kershaw SpeedSafe Blur, an assisted-opening lock blade with a tanto cut and half serrated.  [She looks like this.](http://www.oldschoolknifeworks.com/media/catalog/product/cache/5/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/f/i/file_1_4.png)  I did not pull it out, but I was ready in case the other guy did.

However, the other four Canadians at this point realized that their incredibly stupid friend was about to get them in some serious trouble.  One of them grabbed him by the shoulders and physically hauled him outside to the car, while the other three apologized profusely.  I was still running about a 50/50 mix of blood and adrenaline, but managed to somehow manipulate my facial features back into something resembling a smile.  I told them that I wasn't going to sell to them, but if they still wanted beer, there was a grocery store up the street.  I also recommended they keep *that guy* in the car.  They apologized again and left.  Meanwhile the rest of the customers in the store, about 10 or so, stood in mute shock for a few seconds, as I took a couple deep breaths.  The one young guy in the back of the store pipes up, ""Dude, that was awesome.  Everyone has their IDs, right?""  Cue the broken-tension laughter of 10 customers and one nervous cashier.  I got a couple of comments of ""good for you"" from the older patrons, and the young dude gave me a high five.  I then got someone to cover for me and went outside to chain smoke half a dozen cigarettes.

One evening a heavily intoxicated man comes swaying into the store at around 2am. He seemed friendly enough, though I did have to tell him to put on shoes.

Another day, another story. From here on out, I will release one or two stories are week until Christmas, where I will tell some of my favorite Christmas tales, from the LP World.  Anyways, here is today's adventure.

**The Time I Arrested Pre-Teen Ne-yo**

One day, sitting at GDNickels, I am working the cameras, when I see a young boy and girl (around age 12 or so), in our Junior's department. The girl quickly runs through the store, and into the bathroom.  I continue to watch the boy, who is doing something with a shirt in the corner, but I can't tell what.  Stacy heads out to the rest room to see what the girl is doing.  A few minutes later she comes back, and says the girl is washing purple Ink off her hands, or at least attempting to.

Well now it all makes sense. The two geniuses had popped a security tag full of ink while trying to remove it.  Eventually the girl comes back, and they decide to abandon the shirt and move to the rack next to it to ""look"" at clothes.  Stacy and I decide that we should give these kids a break, so Stacy heads out to the Juniors department, and not 3 feet from the kids, grabs the ink covered shirt off the rack, and hands it too an associate and said ""Hey Becky, here's a shirt someone messed up.  Can you just send it back to the warehouse to be processed as damaged.  Hopefully we won't have to send anymore back.""  The two kids, the whole time, are staring dead at her, can hear every word. They then watch as Stacy goes to the door of our office, WHICH IS IN THE JUNIORS DEPARTMENT, and goes back inside.  

So we figure they will get the hint, and just leave with their lucky break.

Well obviously I wouldn't be tell you this story if that was what happened.  I don't know what their thought process was, but they decide to just start trying to get more of the tags off of some of the clothes, and place them into their shopping bags.  Me and Stacy are flabbergasted.  How could anyone be so brazen and/or stupid?  So we wait for them to try and leave the store, and make the stop.  They come back to the office with us.  We ask them where there parents are.  They say they are orphans.  We tell them to let us know because we can't let them go if their parents aren't here.  So that's when the boy, who we will call Ne-yo, says ""Well she's my cousin.""  

Me: Your cousin. And you're BOTH, orphans?

Neyo hesitates before going ""Yeeeesssss?"" as if he was waiting for me to tell him he got an answer correct.

Me and Stacy just look at each other and begin our paperwork. The girl is crying, and Ne-yo is trying to comfort her, by singing song by Ne-yo to her.  I ask him to please not sing, and he tells me its the songs of his people, and calms her down.  Ok.  Once again, we were waiting on the cops for over an hour. So Ne-yo suddenly decides to start asking us questions about our family, our hobbies, what our job is (despite being in our office), and finally our beliefs.  I tell him we really can't talk to him about any of that, and ask him to just sit quietly.  His response was ""But Jesus is with everyone, so we should be able to talk about him! You love Jesus don't you?""  I tell him I'm not Christian, and I swear this kid looked like I just told him I can breathe underwater.  I don't think it ever crossed his mind that anyone WOULDN'T be Christian.  

Ne-yo: Well you know if you don't believe in Jesus, you'll go straight to hell. People who don't believe in Jesus are bad people.

Me: Kid, this isn't a discussion I am going to be having with you. And also, didn't you just steal? Isn't that one of the top 10 No No's? So maybe just sit there, quietly please.

Ne-yo glared at me with the same hatred you see a Vegan giving someone eating delicious, dripping, bacon cheeseburger.  ""I HAVE JESUS ON MY SIDE YOU DON'T! MY MOM WILL BE ANGRY THAT YOU TALKED TO ME LIKE THAT""

ME: Thought you said you were an orphan?

Ne-yo then decided his hole may be deep enough, and to stop digging. So he went back to singing to his cousin, who and telling her to just pray so the bad man won't hurt them.  His cousin began to plead with him just to call ""Auntie"", his mother I'm assuming, and he just kept singing.  Me and Stacy were getting pretty annoyed but we couldn't just leave the room.  Eventually Ne-yo starts asking to use the rest room.  I tell him we aren't allowed to do that.  He says he needs to go. I tell him by law I can't escort him to the rest room, and he'd have to wait for the police.  We sat like this for the next 15 minutes, him asking me every couple minutes if he can use the rest room.  

Eventually, Ne-yo decides to stand up, and say if we don't let him use the rest room he's going to pee on our walls.  Thankfully, the cops were just about here, so I told him to just wait. we explained to the officer what was going on.  He asks the kids their names, dates of birth all that. He then asks where the kids parents are and how to get in contact with them.  Ne-yo just looked at him and said ""Do YOU believe in Jesus?"" .  The cop looked at me, and just shook his head.  Eventually he brought them to the station to wait for someone to report them missing.  Only thing I heard about them after that was that it took till almost midnight for someone to report them missing and turn up for them.  And that Ne-yo was asking questions the whole damn time, annoying the cops there.

Me: Mam, there are thousands of songs that play on the radio, and tons of different stations.  If you can provide an artist name, or the name of the song... I can help.  

(Wait, i should point out that this was... around 1999.  We didn't have internet in phones, or in store yet.  So I couldn't look up lyrics.  We had a computer system that could look up artist, album, or song titles.)

Tween's Mom:  Well if we knew that, we wouldn't need your help.  Maybe you just need to hear it again.  Go ahead darling.

Tween:  nuh nuh hun nuh nuh like... buh buh buh and then like... Oooohhhh check it girl gotta booty uh something, duh duh duh...

Me: I am really sorry, I just don't know that song.

Tween's Mom: Huh.  Interesting.  I guess we can take our business elsewhere then.

Me: Have a great day!

Emo had just reared it's ugly head.  20 or so, tragically hip, what we would now call ""hipster"" comes in.

Emo: Uhm, whats this?  (He puts down a Dashboard Confessional CD in front of me on the register.)

Me:  That looks like a Dashboard Confessional CD sir.

Emo: This CD was in the Rock, Pop, Soul section, and it should be in the ""punk section"".

Me: Oh, well, we dont have a punk section, we mix anything remotely alternative in with Rock.

Emo: But its not Rock.  

Me: No, I get that, but ultimately, our corporate office decides what music is categorized under, and we dont really have a say in it.  We just you know, put it away, sell it. 

Emo: This is absurd.  What is your district managers name and phone number?  This is a punk band, and there should be a section for it.  

Me: Sure, here you go.  Did you want to buy this?

Emo: No!  I just want to fix this broken establishment.

Me: Ok, have a nice day.

Emo: *LOOK OF SCORN*

__________________________________________________________

(I got fired for this one... but rehired the next day, because they needed me and I am a boss ass worker who got shit done.)

It was the ""after Christmas rush""... when people are bringing in their many gift cards.  The store would get SUPER packed, and it was company policy to never have more than two people working at a time.  (I know.  I KNOW.)  

So this lady comes in, and she is maybe 30 something.  She had gotten a giftcard for $200 or something ridiculous like that.  So she comes up, and she wants to know where EVERYTHING is.  But not just told, shown.  

Conversation:

Lady: Ok, where is J-Lo?

Me: (with a line of customers, as my associate had.)  Right under Rock, Pop Soul, J.  Its that third row right there.

Lady: Oh ok, I couldnt see it can you show me?

Me: Sure, let me finish with this customer, Ill be right over.

So, I show her, and then she wants me to take her to the next artist, and the next.  Finally after about 6 CDs, she goes

Lady: Oh, can you hold these for me, they are getting sort of heavy.

Me: We could store them at the register...

Lady: You cant just hold them?  I would like to keep them with me.

Me: Ok, yeah, sure.

So finally we are getting up to like 12-15 CDs.  (Part of why they are heavy or hard to hold is because we had them in that bulky protective casing.)  AAAaaannnnnddd I lose it.

Lady: Ok, show me where Snoop Dog's greatest hits would be.

Me: Mam, there are literally 30 people in this store, and only myself and one other employee, whom right now has a line of... what... is that maybe 12 people?  I am not a personal shopper.  I am not a shopping cart, I am a cashier, and I need to go do what I am paid to do, which is ring up customers, not hold your items and whisk you around the store.  Here you go.

I dumped her stuff into her arms and went up front.  She called the store manager and ratted me out, he fired me, then rehired me because... really I hadn't done much wrong, she still made the purchase, so I didnt lose the company any money, and I was a good worker.  I just lost it.  If you could call that ""losing it"".

Public Pool!

The city Park and Rec department I worked for around 2005 had several community centers, and a public pool, which is where I spent most of my shifts, taking tickets for free swim, lap swim, or signing people up for programs.  It was a desk job, in a little office building they had to walk through to get to the pool.

I really only have two good stories for this one.
_____________________________________________________
30something year old approaches me at the front desk.  

30: Yeah, there is a man in the womens locker room.

me: Oh no, what?  Ok, I will go look.

I go look... there are a few ladies, and one Mom with her son... he might be 2 years old.

Me: Mam, I didnt see any men in there, can you tell me what he looks like, or do you see him out by the pool?

30: No, you saw him.  It's the boy.  The little boy.

Me: Oh, I thought you said a man, Im sorry.

30: Yeah, a man.  A human being with a penis, and not a vagina, and not supposed to be in the womans locker room.  He looked at me while I was changing, and I feel violated.  I want this reported.

Me: I can take note of it mam, but our policy states that children of any sex under the age of 6 are allowed to accompany a parent into the changing rooms for supervision reasons.

30: You are kidding me.  This is a disgusting world.  I dont understand how I can be VIOLATED in such a way, and it is just dismissed for policy.

Me: I am truly sorry you feel violated.  How about in the future, you change in one of the stalls?

30: Oh, so because a MAN stares at me while I change, I should have to go somewhere else?  I am the one who has to change?  Do you know what kind of draconian society this is?

Me: Mam, I am really sorry, I can give you the name and number to my supervisor if you have any further problems, but I can not kick a toddler and his mother out of the changing room.

30: Ok, put your name on there too so I can tell your supervisor how rude and unhelpful you were.

Me: No problem.

(My supervisor, in truth, was a mammoth bitch, and said I should have gone ""above and beyond"" in helping this upset woman.  I dont personally know what more I could have done.)

___________________________________________________

 I never met this woman, but she called into the office, and I answered.

Me: Hi this is The City Public Pool, MariSunday speaking, how can I help you?

Her: Yes.  I signed up for the adult swim class that started the month before last, and I got my period for several of the lessons and was unable to make it to the classes.

Me: ...Ok.  And... what can I help you with today?

Her: Well, I was unable to make the classes due to my period.

Me: Yes.  I understand, I am very sorry to hear that.  Is there something specifically I can help you with today?

Her:  Well, I will be needing my money back.

Me: Ah.  Ok, well because you missed the deadline for refunds of any kind (30 days) and the class is already pretty much over (I think she had one more lesson left) we can't do a refund at this time.

Her: What do you mean.  This is illegal.

Me: Well mam, our policy is that all refunds for classes have to be paid back before the class is half over, which in this case would have been about two weeks ago.

Her: But I missed two classes.  Because of my period.

Me: I understand, but I can not refund the class to you, you still went to 6 or so of the classes and only missed two.

Her: Refund me for those then.

Me: I am unable to do a partial refund, and as I said, the time has already passed, we can no longer do refunds.

Her: YOU ARE A WOMAN!  WHY DONT YOU UNDERSTAND YOU BITCH?  YOU FUCKING BITCH!  GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY, THIS IS ILLEGAL, I COULDNT TAKE THE CLASSES FOR MEDICAL REASONS!

Me: Im sorry mam, if you missed the classes for medical reasons, you can provide a letter from your doctor and I am sure I can get one of my supervisors to refund the course despite the time lapse.

Her: No!  I have no Doctors note you bitch, and you know that!

Me: Mam, there is no need for name calling, I am trying to help you.

Her: No you arent, you want me to suffer.

Me: Mam, I am going to transfer you directly to my superiors extention.  She might not answer, she is in a different office than me but her name is _____  _______ and she should be able to help you further at this time.

Her: Good, perhaps I can talk to someone competent.

End of story is, my supervisor ended up saying no also, and so this woman called and harassed me for several weeks, pretty much just making the same demand over and over again.  In fact, when someone else ended up answering the call, they would immediately transfer her to me, because I was the only one who wouldn't ""flip out"" on her when she started the bashing.

At one point, on one of my days off, I guess she brought in a clearly fake ""doctors note"" and had a meltdown in the office when they said they had to confirm it with the doctors office first.  When I later calculated how much her refund for two of the ten or so classes, it came to around $20.

I see the shit you have to deal with on a regular basis and I commend you for your (almost) never-ending patience. Plus, as I'm sure you know, crazy customers can ruin the day of a fellow shopper, too.

One day, before meeting up with friends for lunch, I stopped by a nearby thrift store, just to browse a little and kill some time. While I was there, I ended up stumbling upon an item I had been looking for for a *long* time (can't remember what it was now, just goes to show how unimportant it was in the grand scheme of things, but I *really* wanted it at the time). Stoked, I headed over to the cash registers, where only two cashiers were on duty. 

I got in line right behind a large woman who had plopped an enormous pile of clothing and housewares on the counter. Never breaking the smile on her face, the cashier scanned and bagged every last item and rung up the total, which I remember was just under $85. Remember, this was a thrift shop, so 85 bucks worth of merchandise is a LOT of stuff.  It took a while, but the other cashier had a much longer line, so I figured the wait time would be about the same either way. I was sadly mistaken.

The lady paid with her debit card and was just about to gather her things and leave... when suddenly, her equally enormous friend came charging over, waving her arms and yelling ""Wait, wait, I have a coupon!"". Nearly pushing me over, she approached the cash and handed over a coupon to the cashier that said something like 'Spend 100 dollars or more, get 50% off'. Pretty sweet discount, I know. The thing is, the lady who had just purchased all of that stuff now wanted the cashier to hold up the line so she could run and grab another $15 worth so she could use the coupon — which was not only really unfair to the other customers who had been waiting patiently, but actually *not possible*, since the transaction had already been completed. I know that in most retail stores you can return items and get your money back, but this store had an exchange-only policy and the cash registers were not programmed to process that kind of return, especially not immediately after the purchase had taken place. It would require a manager's help at the very least.

The cashier kept trying to calmly explain that it wasn't possible to reverse the transaction, but these two ladies were not having any of it. One kept insisting that it was only $15 more and that it would only take a few minutes to pick something out, while the other barked at her about being ripped off (at a second-hand store...) — both completely ignoring the cashier's explanation that the problem wasn't that she didn't *want* to do it, but that the cash register system simply wasn't capable of undoing the purchase. After about ten minutes of going in circles, she called the one and only manager on duty over to help deal with the problem. She looked at me and the others behind me apologetically and told us ""This is probably going to take a while, so you may want to switch over to the other cash."" I felt awful for her — she had been so nice about the whole thing and the two women were both acting so outraged and entitled (I think I even heard one of them accuse her of being racist, an accusation that sickens me when it has no merit). 

A few minutes after I went to the other line, there was another problem with *that* cash register, too (I think it was a small issue that could be fixed using a manager's code, but the manager was busy dealing with the two angry women and couldn't come over and help). I waited for another ten minutes with no sign of it being my turn anytime soon, when I realized I was going on 20 minutes late for lunch. Sadly, I had to put my item back and leave the store empty-handed. I went back for it another day and it was gone. 

All because of a couple of old hens and their *fucking* coupons.

I used to work at a grocery store in high school, it was in a bad town so I have MANY stories (which I'll share eventually). I did such a good job that I got my brother hired, he continued to work there after I left for college. He was surprisingly composed when telling me the details. 

Some attention-starved 14 year old told her dad that a passing customer had made an advance on her. The father jumped him and viciously pounded him even after he hit the floor. My brother was working in the bakery when he heard the commotion. By the time he got to the scene the father had left the store. 

He said the man was still gasping when he arrived. He wheezed for a few moments and that was that. Luckily, the store manager tossed the blood-speckled items instead of making the workers do it (after the cops had their time at the scene). 

Here's the kicker: the 14 year-old LIED about the sexual comment for attention. I blame her and the not the murderer. 
EDIT: This wasn't a dramatic scene in fight club. He only hit him five times in quick succession, clearly wasn't trying to kill him. You'd be surprised at how easily something like that can happen.

Today we spent a good three hours in a car driving back from a wedding, and told many a tale of our retail exploits and experiences to while away the time.  Two of them I figured should be repeated here.

----
Fit the First

Lori's main responsibility has been U-Scan.  And, just like any other bit of technology, many people cannot begin to fathom how they work or follow the extremely simple directions on the touch screen.  One such lady was having a bit of a tizzy fit because an item was not ringing up with the sale price (the sale, of course, had ended the week prior).  Lori calmly tried to explain this to the woman, but of course having a wage slave disagree with her was something that offended her in the extreme.  Her shrill reply was ""Well you're just stupid and a liar!""

(*Aside:* Never insult my sister's intelligence.  For one thing, Article II Section III of the Code of Big Brothers specifically states that only ***I*** have the power to do that, and violation of that section gives me authority to expose your internal organs to daylight.  Secondly, she's smarter than you.  I don't care who you are, she's smarter than you.)

Lori's customer service smile fell away, and she adopted the bored monotone of someone who's dealt with far too many nasty customers.  ""Ma'am, impugning my integrity and my intelligence is not a way to encourage me to go above and beyond in my customer service, nor even engender me to do anything above my baseline job requirements.""

Cue a shocked look from the shrill lady and applause from the other customers.  The lady, of course, complained, but Lori is well liked and she was ""reprimanded"" for it.

----

Fit the Second

Another U-scan incident.  However, this one I was present for.  Not just present, but able to activate the Code of Big Brothers in public.

The date was late September of 2008.  I had returned just a week earlier from a summer of fighting wildfires for the federal government, and stopped in to Lori's store to pick up some snackish stuff on my way to visit my parents.  I also plan on bugging Lori a bit, because that's what big brothers do.  We have to, it's in The Code.  So, Mountain Dew in hand I wander over to U-scan to pay and maybe make fun of her hair or something.

When I approach, I see that she's dealing with an irate customer.  Cool, I get to watch her do her thing!  I stand back, cross my arms, and listen as the guy prattles on about something something something not the right price blah blah blah rabble rabble *just do it right you vapid cunt!*

Whoa dude.

Now, as I said, I'd just returned from firefighting.  In the four months I was out there, I had dropped almost 50 pounds and gained a fairly significant tan.  While not up to Ryan Reynolds' body standards, I was still very trim and fit.  And also very, very angry.  I grabbed this....human effluence....and spun him around so he was nose to nose with me.

Well, not really.  He was maybe 5'6"" and I'm 6'2"".  So it was more like nose to middle-of-my-chest.  I leaned over so my eyes were level with his, and no more than 6"" away, and in a very quiet, very growly voice, said simply, ""*WHAT* did you just say to my little sister?""

He instantly went from the bright-red of a raging douche-nozzle customer to the pale white of a man afraid for his life.  His eyes were so wide I was surprised his eyelids didn't start clapping behind his head.  He backed up, but could only move about two feet before running his legs into the U-scan machine.  I stared him down for a few more seconds to get the point across that any further comments like that would be met with retaliation hearkening to the wrath of an angry god.  He promptly dropped whatever thingy he wanted to purchase and ran from the store.

I looked up to see my sister with her hands on her face and tears on her cheeks.  ""Fucker made my sister cry.  He's a dead man,"" I thought, and turned to chase after him, until I realized that the hands and tears were because Lori was laughing hysterically.  She was, in fact, doing the retarded seal laugh, you know, when you make almost no sound except a strange bark when you inhale, while clapping your hands together like an exhibit at Sea World.

Around this time the other customers were beginning to laugh as well.  My anger subsided and I chuckled myself.  It's not often that you get to scare white into a guy's hair like that.  Supposedly he's never been seen again.

She then proceeded to tie up one of our phone lines for 25 minutes calling her dad, discussing the weather, saying how nice people are here, etc. At one point she said, ""No were living in a tent out in a field, it's chilly but we stay warm. No, there's a place nearby that has running water, so we can take washcloth baths, and they don't mind if we use their phone,"" at which point I thought, ""wait, wut?""

After 25 minutes of listening to her talk to her dad about how nice her dirty hippie life is living in a tent, hijacking our phone lines, and using the free water next door to where her tent is, she got off the phone and asked to use our bathroom, where I believe she spent 10 minutes taking a washcloth bath.

There was this lady acting very suspicious, so all our employees try to keep an eye on her. As she heads towards our fitting rooms we go over to prevent her from taking her cart in and she has this HUGE bulge in the crouch area of her pants. When we walked up to her we notice that she has a pair of shoes on like 2 sizes too small and from our store. We asked her to take off her shoes with much resistance she does and they were marked as a pair we had on display. By now she is trying to pull that it's because she's foreign... while the managers handling her were Hispanic and the other Russian and another European. We look into her cart and she has a pair of scissors with a bunch of tags lying in the bottom of the cart. She claimed it wasn't her... right?

So she got annoyed and tried to go to the register to buy one item, still with this bulge in her pants. Our cashier was acting like there was computer issues taking as long as he could to ring her out because apparently a customer called the police. Once the police came the woman was like I need to go to the bathroom. So one of our female employees follow her into our restroom and look at the floor in the stall she went in and saw the woman ditching a bunch of items she had in her pants.

Ok, so I've been at this restaurant for a while now. The place is a small family owned restaurant and it's owned by some friends of mine. I have many more stories, but I'm on my phone so today it's just a short one. This is your typical sit down place, but the servers don't handle any of the money. We have a cashier for that, and even though I normally serve, sometimes cashiering is a break from the norm. 

So I'm standing at the register and I hear this strange, weird music. I assume it's Pandora (what we use at work) so I skip the song. The thing is, I keep hearing it. It's loud and tinny sounding. I finally figure it out-its coming from a table. This guy and his wife have pulled out their phone and proceeded to play their own music, louder than the music I'm playing. So after a minute, and several other customers asking me kindly to please say something to them, I went over there. I asked them if they could please turn it down. The wife gives me this look (the I'm inconveniencing her look) and tells me she doesn't like the music we're playing. I told her we could turn our music down, but that others in the restaurant were asking me to have her turn it down. She told me she hadn't heard anyone complain about it and proceeded to turn away from me. This is where I'm glad this place is family owned. The owners are nice, but they don't put up with shit like this. So, I smiled, and told her she and her husband weren't the only people in the building, and that they could turn it off or take their food to go.

I was still in high school, I believe the summer before my Senior year.  I had a job at McDonald's...  The only McDonald's, at the time, for a rather large tourist area in the Midwest.

It was common for 'kids', such as myself, in that area at that time to flagrantly flaunt various child labor laws and work shifts that were way, way too long during the summer.  Given that bodies were needed everywhere to serve the tourists, most employers didn't care, either, and would simply pay the fines if they were 'found out'.  Most cases, it was entirely consensual 'exploitation' on the part of the minor (myself, 17 years old) and the employer.

I was scheduled to work the night shift that day, from 4PM to Midnight.  I was called in at 11AM, and I went in eagerly.  I was saving up for a car and a computer, and what 17 year old didn't want to make overtime pay when they had nothing else to do, anyway?  Plus, at first, I was told I'd get to take off before close.

I worked my ass off, that day.  I started in drive thru, ended up as QPC (this was back when McDonald's microwaved everything and kept a huge bin full of food for instant service) in the grill, on counter order, migrated to grounds cleaning (tidying the seating/washroom/playland), back to counter, etc.  I was all over the store, and having, in all honesty, a really good day of it.  Sure, it was busy, but at that time our crew was fantastic, the management all pitched in, and we had fun.

I vaguely remember serving a lone child at some point on the tills... probably around 1PM.  That wasn't uncommon; parent hands the kid money, he gets to be a 'big boy' and order his own happy meal, which is what this kid did.  I got him his food, wished him a good day, and proceeded on serving the endless line of people behind him.

Around 6PM I managed to break off the counter and get the lobby tided up; no small task, and it probably took me 30 minutes just to get 2 of our 3 indoor sections done.  I skipped the side one (for now, I didn't want to face the bathrooms after quite yet), and made my way into playland.

This was an old-school outdoor playland that many McDonald's had.  Plastic playset with swings and such, the stuff you'd climb around on and have so much static electricity built up you could see arcs as you touched a ground point... and it hurt like hell.  We also had the plastic tables, and the 'standards' for McDonald's at that time, a plastic and metal [Mayor McCheese](http://imgur.com/Bh0el) you coluld climb up, then climb around in.

I had just started cleaning out there, but it was quite busy and I got called back in to help out on registers again.  Again, vaguely, I remember a kid sitting alone, at one of the tables.

9PM comes around, and we're still taking a beating.  
""SilentDis, can you stay a while longer?""  
""Of course, nice manager lady, I'll take your overtime!""  
""You're already on overtime?""  
""I have been since I started today."" (week rolled over that day)  
""Well... screw it, stay, your paycheck is going to be huge.""

I closed that night.  All the way to midnight.  At the end of it all, we started the cleanup while customers were still in-store finishing their meals, while the 2 managers kept the doors locked and just let people out.  When the dust finally settled, and we were finally empty, they told everyone to grab something to eat, something to drink, and get the hell out to the play area for a much, much needed break.  Smoke 'em if ya got 'em.

Exhausted, hungry, wrecked, but feeling good about it, our entire crew made their way out to the now (finally) empty playland.  We all sat down heavily, and sighed huge sighs of relief that the customers were gone, but we all knew we had at least an hour, if not 2, of closing clean up to deal with.  Yeah, I was already part of the cleanup detail as well.

As we sat there, trying to calm down after the insanity we'd just been through (one of the busiest entire days the store had ever had up to that point), one of my co-workers happened to look up.

""Why is there a child sleeping in Mayor McCheese?"" he asked, in the semi-innocent tone of exhaustion and puzzlement.

We all kind of stopped, and followed his gaze.  Sure enough, a small boy, around 7 or 8, was curled up in the fetal position inside the little jail cell.  He looked peaceful enough, but... where's mom or dad?

We all kind of looked at each other, and all jumped up at the same time.  Manager 1 instantly headed inside to survey the bathrooms, Manager 2 went out the backdoor to check the back parking lot, while the rest of us checked out the windows and behind the bars of Playland to see if someone was around.  Nothing... not even a vehicle we couldn't account for (all the vehicles in lot belonged to the employees).

Well... what the ever-loving fuck are we supposed to do now?

Managers 1 and 2 returned and roused the child, and made sure he was, physically, at least, okay.

""I'm hungry.""  No problem on that front, we're a restaurant.  Got him a burger, chicken nuggets, a soda, and a Big Mac.  His eyes went wide and he began inhaling the food.  Not eating.  Oh... that's not good.  No one eats 30 minute old McDonald's food like that unless you really are starving.

The managers were good.  One peppered the child with questions, gently, while we, for the most part, got on with closing duties, and quite a lot of worry for the tyke.  Manager 2 called the police.

About 20 minutes later, the police show up.  Kid came with mommy, didn't know how long he'd been there, didn't know where mommy went, was there a *long* time, didn't know mommy's first name, or a phone number to get in touch with her.  Oh fucking shit.  Most of us were in tears for this poor little... well, at this point, orphan.

We were all asked about the kid, and I gave my exceptionally vague recollections of serving him and seeing him again, and the times.  I made sure the officer understood that I could - and hoped like hell I was - very, very wrong about all that.  He agreed with the sentiment... but told me I probably wasn't at this point.

It's now nearly 1:30 AM.  I've finally got the inside restaurant done (including bathrooms), and had moved on to finally picking up the playland.  One of my managers joins me, having finished her paperwork for the day.  We worked mostly in silence, except for a few ""I hope he's gonna be okay,"" type comments, referring to the boy.  The police were still hanging around inside the restaurant with him, slowly, and politely asking him questions.  I don't think even they knew what to do at that point... Plus, hey, free coffee.

Out of nowhere, a car comes tearing down the small frontage road, screeching tires, damn near catching air as they hit our ramp into our parking lot.  Tearing around the building, back onto the frontage road, then back into the lot again, to finally come to a halt at the door.  A woman jumped out, and started wrenching at the side door (that was locked), then pounding on it.  We couldn't be seen because of how dark it was in playland.

The cops saw it, we saw it.  The manager made his way to unlock the door and let crazy lady in.  The cops were already on their way over to the door, too.  Kid looks up, and identifies 'mom'... but really didn't seem too enthused to see her, either.  Like he's been through this before.

I stayed the hell out of the situation, I didn't want to hear anymore, and told my boss I'd rather just take off at this point.  She let me go, that she'd punch me out with an extra 15 minutes **on top of** the the 14h30m I'd already worked that day (I trusted her, and she did keep her word on it), and just took off from the side gate of playland.

I got into work the next day, and it was 'business as usual'.  I asked what happened, and found out mom and the police officers had a wonderful little conversation that lasted around an hour, the highlights of which were:

* She'd dropped off her kid around 1PM with $5 for lunch.
* She'd then headed over to the casino ""for just a little while"".
* Was coming right back for him, obviously.
* Not like she abandoned him or anything... after all, she's here now, right?

More than that, I'm not sure of.  I know CPS (Child Protection Services) was involved in the situation.  Also herd something about gambling cessation treatment for mom.  I only hope some good came out of that for the kid's sake.

**TL;DR:** Welcome to McDonald's, where you can abandon your child for ~12 hours while you play slots.  May we take your child, please?",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_zw93f,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/zw93f/mcchildcare/,
1363572412.0,311,self.TalesFromRetail,1ai0a7,"The Corporate Jet Wench, Part 1",thadius856,375,64,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1ai0a7/the_corporate_jet_wench_part_1/,"I was just reading a story about a retail employee that got tipped for the first time. It brought back memories of my first good tip, so here goes. In college, I worked at a private jet services company for about 6 months. It's not quite retail in the traditional sense, but it is really the same thing. We did everything. And the tips were horrible. $1 here, maybe $2 there. On a $35,000 service bill. Rich people don't get rich by giving it away.

The job was similar to retail. Move customer's luggage from A to B. Walk the catering to the aircraft (we order, receive and store it; they serve it). Load coffee pots (we brew it on the ground; they serve it). Refill ice machines (we make the ice cubes; they serve it). Valet customer's cars. Get anything the pilots ask for. None of it was really all that bad...

...except for lavatory duty. That was a nightmare.

To understand why, you need a background in how they work on airplanes. On small jets, they have a tank of approximately 5 gallons of ""blue juice"", a mixture of water and caustic chemicals that eat organic material quickly. When you flush on an aircraft, it drains the bowl into the bottom of that tank of blue juice, then rinses the bowl with blue juice from top of the same tank. That's why it's heavily colored and scented - on long flights, that juice might circulate through 10 or 20 times, depending on how large the aircraft is.

When the plane lanes, near minimum wage joes have to pull a wheeled, 1000# cart out to under the aircraft by hand, open a service panel, dump the tank into a lavatory cart, and finally pump fresh juice back into the aircraft to top off the tank. It's important that this is done shortly after landing, especially in the summer. The longer it sits in the tank, the smellier it gets. It gets stinky exponentially faster when it's hot outside (magnified by the heat of the tarmac).

If all goes smoothly, it's smelly and gross, but nothing that disposible gloves and a face shield can't protect against. If it goes wrong, it goes catastrophically wrong. Three things can happen:

* 1. You can fail to get the twist-lock connector on the dump port all the way. It will leak used juice all over you and the tarmac*. If it gets on your skin, you need to get it off immediately. If left on your hands for 10 minutes, they'll stain blue for a week. If left on your hands for 1 hour, the top layer of your skin will peel right off. If left on longer... I don't want to know what happens. To get it off the concrete, you have to use a Hazmat Cleanup kit to soak it up (neutralizing kitty litter), then pour on a mixture of bleach and hot water.
* 2. If the last person to dump the lavatory at the last airport didn't close the dump valve all the way, the blue juice will slowly drip out the dump port. It's no big deal for it to drip all over the runway, but once the aircraft gets to high altitudes, it starts to freeze where it drips out. It's very common to open the panel to access the dump port and have a 20# block of blue ice hit your boots.
* 3. Passengers on chartered or corporate jets love to throw non-organic items down the lavatory. Feminine products, diapers, plastic bags, etc. We've seen it all. Usually it clogs the system, refuses to drain or refill, and requires a maintenance crew to take it apart. The aircraft is grounded for several hours while this happens, and our crew was $125 per hour during the day (it took two technicians over an hour each).

Fast forward to Thanksgiving Eve*, 2006. I'm in a particularly bad mood because I've been working full time, attending university more than full time, and paying all the bills for the house. Money's tight and I can neither afford to buy one of those boxed nor take my fiancee out to a restaurant, and we don't have the time to cook it up ourselves. Hungry Man dinners, here we come. It's about 5pm, I'm at work, and our last scheduled corporate jet has just landed. They drop the passengers and request a ""quick turn"", which translates to, ""Please service my aircraft as quickly as possible. I live two states away and I want to be home before midnight!"" Mind you, these guys work for a national chain that owns the aircraft -- they just fly it. The captain just flies it and the co-pilot does everything else in the cabin during cruise.

I'm stuck on lavatory duty for that aircraft. I pull my heavy little cart over, hook up, and pull the dump valve. Nothing. Check the release cable, check the cart, check the fluid levels. Everything's fine. Try to dump again. Nothing. Meanwhile, the rest of my crew has dumped the trash bags, unloaded uneaten catering, emptied coffee tanks, emptied ice bins, refueled, charged for services, and are all done.  Twenty minutes of fussing with this stupid lavatory dump valve and I have to tell the aircrew it won't dump.

""Sorry, guys, the aircraft has to be taken down for maintenance. You're stuck here for now.""

The kicker is the maintenance crews went home at 3pm for the holiday. They're $200/hr on call, and the charter company won't authorize that kind of money. They're to be put into a hotel until the day after Thanksgiving. And they're destraught that they won't get to see their families.

Knowing this was probably a plugged toilet, I couldn't stand to see them be away from their families over something so silly. If I can't see mine, at least they should get to see their. Sometimes you can get lucky fishing for the obstruction ""over the top"". So I grabbed two black trash bags, pulled them over my arm up to my armpit and bunjee corded them above my bicep. I plunged my fingertips down the toilet, then my whole hand, and the next thing I knew I was up to my elbow. I managed to find the obstruction, grabbed it as hard as I could, and sat down and backwards to help pull my arm out. POP! Infant-size diaper in my hand, caustic fluid up to my bicep, and terrible smells everywhere.

I ended up in the employee restroom, down to my trousers, scrubbing my whole arm just in case I'd come in contact with anything. I felt good that at least somebody was getting home for the holiday. I came back out to see them off and they were some of the most thankful poeple you'd ever meet. As I went to shake the captain's hand, he held it longer than a handshake normally lasts, gripped extra tight, and winked at me. I got the hint. When he let go my hand went straight to my pocket.

I marshalled the aircraft out to the runway, waved back as they taxied away, took off my reflector vest and put down my light cones, and dug into my pocket. Out came four $20 bills and I almost cried right there on the tarmac. Written across the top in marker, it read, ""Thank you for the most amazing"" and at the bottom, ""act of kindness we've ever seen."" The next one read at the top ""Please accept our most sincere thanks"" and at the bottom, ""and DO NOT POOL THIS TIP!"".

I'm happy to say that the next day I made it down to KFC and managed to talk them into selling my a turkey dinner that somebody had ordered but failed to pick up. The total, $80 plus tax. Somehow, it seemed fitting.

I work at a supermarket chain as a courtesy clerk. This is my first job and I am only a part time worker as I go to high school. At the time that this story took place, I had been working for around 2-3 months. I am also deaf and wear cochlear implants.  

This happened a few months ago but my memory is vivid enough so it feels like it just happened yesterday. It was a Sunday morning and the store wasn't very crowded. Since no groceries needed to be bagged and the carts were done, I was doing the go-backs.   
    
I walked into an empty aisle to put back some flour. As I am putting the flour away, I suddenly hear an extremely loud sound. I nearly jump out of my skin since the store was pretty quiet except for the music playing in the background. I look and an extremely agitated woman marches up to me.  
    
Woman: [screaming] Hello! Didn't you hear me? I've been trying over and over to get your attention!   
[I'm pretty sure this was bullshit because although I am deaf, I can hear well enough with my cochlear implants. Also, the store was quiet and not busy so if she really were telling the truth, I would have certainly heard her.]  
Me: I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. What can I-  
Woman: [cutting me off, in a disgusted tone] What are you, hard of hearing or something?   
[I'm shocked at this point. It felt like she had punched me in the stomach. This isn't the first time an adult has yelled at me for not hearing them (but that's a long story to be saved for another time) but  this woman said it like it was some horrible thing or a disease or something. I do not offend easily but I was incredibly upset at this point and was near tears at this point.]   
Me: [nods] Yes, I'm deaf.    
Woman: [comprehension dawns over her] OH! Well... that certainly explains it. [she is visibly embarrassed at this point.] I was going to ask you where- Oh, I found it. Never mind. [she grabs her item off the shelf and scampers away]    
I just sort of stand there and blink for a few moments, trying to understand what had just happened. I continue doing the go-backs and I see the lady again in a different aisle.

I have loads of these stories so if you want me to I can post more of them. I shall call this one The Chauvinistic Ceasar Salad.

I'm working on a tuesday evening during holiday season which meant that most citizens of that city are either out of town or home with their families. We probably had two or three customers in the restaurant so needless to say, there was not much else to do than cleaning the seats and the kitchen.

In walks a couple in their 50's probably and seems like a pair of nice people, no attitude, no smirking, just smiles and genuinely seems friendly.

**Me:** Welcome to Fast-Food-Chain, what would you like to order?

**Mr.Salad:** I'll have a grilled chicken ceasar salad, please.

**Mrs.Salad:** Yeah, I think I'll have that too.

**Me:** Thank you, what would you like to drink?

The conversation proceeds with the regular back-n-forth and I proceed with bringing them the accessories, sause, crutons etc. At this point my colleague in the kitchen tells me that we only have one chicken ready, the other is still thawing and will take 4 (four) minuters before it's ready. I tell the couple this and they say it's no problem. Whenever someone says that waiting is ""no problem"" I always told them ""don't worry, I will bring it too you"" and sometimes give them free coffee (we were allowed to by the franchise management). The 4 (four) minutes pass and I bring the couple their salad.

At this point I remove this order from memory because it is completed. After probably 15-20 minutes I'm talking to another customer and Mrs.Salad comes up to the register. When I finish with the customer I turn to her who now has one customer behind her, and I ask her if there is anything else she would like to order. I shit you not, this is the conversation I had with her. She was completely calm and simply explaining the situation the whole time, never reacting angrily.

**Mrs.Salad:** No, thank you, I just wanted to tell you that I think this is discriminating.

**Me:** *slightly confused* I don't understand, what do you mean?

**Mrs.Salad:** I think it is discriminating against women that my husband gets his food before I do.

**Me:** *even more confused* we... I... it's... I assure you that was not my intention and I'm sorry if you felt that way, it is...

**Mrs.Salad:** *interrupts* nonono, this is not your fault, it is always the bosses and management who is to blame when something like this happens.

**Me:** Well, my manager is not in right now so I think I will have to take the blame on this one.

**Mrs.Salad:** No, this is not your fault, it's your bosses, but I just wanted to tell you that I think this is discriminating.

She then left with her husband waiting at the exit. The customer who had been standing behind her all the time was so dumb-founded he almost forgot where he were and what he wanted to order. I'm used to having these customers but he probably wasn't, can't blame him, it's probably his boss that is discriminating.

Yippee!  I apologize if I make any errors, I'm writing this on my phone. looking back, it's really long, so you can just skip to the bottom for the summary bit. Unless you are interested in our coffee and cream processes. 

Anyway, I work at a fast food place. I've worked there 6 months, I've been promoted multiple times, and like to think I'm a hard worker. I'll do just about anything to make a customer happy (as long as they're not rude to me), and will go over and above to make their day better.  

This story happened while working drive thru. In the mornings, we obviously are constantly making lots of hot, fresh coffee. People come through the drive through, and will sometimes just order that. No problem. As well, we have an automated machine that fills our cups with cream/sugar. Given the size of the drink, it will fill more cream/sugar (so, a single single in a large cup will physically have more cream and sugar than in a small cup)

You can probably get an idea of where this might be going

Sometimes, customers will order a triple triple, or quarter quarter. This means, in a large, their cup is nearly 2/3 full of cream and sugar. I seriously kid you not. It's a pain for me, because I know I'll need to fill that cream machine again soon...  When a customer orders that, I sometimes feel like asking, 'Would you like any coffee with your cream today?'  I don't really judge, though, because I'm not a coffee fan, and would need to water it down that much as well. 

On to the actual story!

Customer comes through drive through, and I can hear him over my headset ordering a triple triple. There's a big order in front of his, and I'm just serving it, so when he comes to my window, I'm just making his coffee. He is therefore watching me make his coffee. 

So, I put in the obscene amount of cream and sugar, and pour the coffee in. Now, there's a fill line on our cups for a number of reasons. One, there once was a lawsuit against my company because a woman scalded herself and got bad burns. Secondly, (I hope), so us employees don't burn ourself pouring it to the very top

So, I hand the coffee out to the customer, big smile on my face, and say have a great day!

Customer: Excuse me!  This isn't filled up all the way!
Me: Oh!  I'm sorry about that!  I thought I filled it up to the line, my bad

Pour a new cup (can't take anything back from a customer), and fill it right to the top

Customer: Did you put triple cream in this?  It tastes like it's way more!

I then explain the cup sizing, and even pour some into clear cups for comparison

Customer: Well, I didn't know that!  I'd like one with only two shots of cream then!

Me: Okay then!  So, that's 3 sugars, and 2 cream?

Customer: Yes (grumbling to his wife about incompetent workers)

As I'm now repouring his 3rd cup of coffee, he is literally leaning through the window to watch me. My manager's wondering why this order is taking so long, so I swing by her and tell her it's a crazy customer...

I now hand it out again...

Customer: Thank God!  You'd think you people would know how to do coffee!

Me: I apologize about the inconvenience this has caused you sir. On the back of your receipt, there is a customer service survey you can take. For reference, my name is telters (I'm actually wearing my employee of the month pin), and we would be happy to hear your comments

Customer: I would like to speak with a manager

At this point, this order has taken about 8 minutes. Our goal is 5

Manager: Hi, what can I do for you?

Customer: I demand a free coupon!  This employee doesn't know how to make coffee, and I'm going to be late now!

Manager: Actually, telters is one of our best employees. I'm sorry, but he's already made your coffee three times. Goodbye *closes window*

This isn't Kohl's where the only thing associates do is push Kohl's credit cards. We deal primarily with wealthy people who will pay any amount to look good.

Anyway, I was working a long shift but was feeling pretty good. I had just helped a recent college grad upgrade his wardrobe for a new job, taking over an hour to put together some nice business outfits. He was immensely grateful and mentioned that I earned my commission and more. I chuckled and said that I don't earn commission which he said was dumb and that any job that requires so much attention to detail and whatnot should pay better. I thanked him for being a nice dude and wished him luck with his new job.

Then comes in BitchKunt (probably not her real name but whatever). I usually work the men's side of the store which is good because I can deal with entitled rich guys much better than I deal with bitchy suburban moms (half because I'm much more familiar with men's clothes and half because bitchy suburban moms drive me bonkers). 

Anyway, I was stocking shelves in the women's side when BitchKunt approaches me.

**BK**: Do you have this sweater in any different colors?

**Me**: Sorry ma'am, that particular sweater only comes in yellow and purple. We have some nice, very similar sweaters that come in other colors though. Would you like me to get you some?

**BK**: No, I want this sweater in aquamarine.

**Me**: Um...Yeah, sorry, we don't have any in that color.

**BK**: Well aren't you at least going to check the back?

**Me**: I unloaded the last shipment and I'm quite certain we don't have any in the back. Also, all we usually have in the back is out of season or out of style clothes. All colors/sizes are always kept on the floor.

**BK**: You're not very good at your job, are you? This isn't how you get a good commission.

**Me**: *Sigh* One second, I'll check the back.

So I pop into the storage room and check where we would keep sweaters. No aquamarine sweaters. I come back out to BK.

2 Weeks ago we had a woman enter our store with her daughter. I was in the back on a call, so my coworker was helping her. I finished up the call and went out front to assist.

Up until ""The Incident"", she seemed pleasant enough - talking and chatting with us. Since there were a few people behind her, I started ringing up her transaction while my coworker finished with her transfer and then moved on to help the next customer.

I gave her her total, and here's where things went downhill. She was instantly pissed. I mean, Jeckyll and Hyde. She asked for ""the bill"". I said to her that I could give her her copy as soon as the transaction was processed (Thinking she wanted her receipt). She says ""So I don't get to *see* what I'm paying for before I buy it?!"" Keep in mind, I had already went over the charges before hand. Looking back, I should have realized what she was getting at.

You see, because we're independently owned, at our store we have a $15 service fee that's added onto every transaction. This is set by the owner, and we have no say whatsoever about this. Given that she has been in our store before (Ill get to this), she most likely knew about it, which is why, after explaining the charges, she was suddenly so angry about them. Hindsight.

So anyway, I tell her that I can't print off a ""bill"" until I process it, but I can read off the items for her. Her total was somewhere in the $350 range, so I proceed to list off her items. As soon as I get to the fee, it becomes deadly. She's furious. I explain, and my coworker too while she's helping other people, that it's a service fee charged to everyone. Its set by the owner, so we have to add it on. Blah blah. 

She then asks for the manager, to which I replied that I was she. Even more furious. She then asks for the owner. I tell her that they don't work out of the store but that I could have them call her. She asks for their number, but I explain that it's a personal number, and that rather than give it out to a customer, I can, again, have them call her. 

She takes her things and proceeds to go to the front of the store to complain to her husband and daughter who were waiting there about this. She leaves, but it doesn't end there.

10 Min later I get a call from our coworker at our other location, saying that this woman had called, yelling and angry, looking for the owner. Our coworker explained, again, that she could pass on the message. She then ranted to her about all the horrible ways we had treated her. At one point, our coworker asked her if she could help with her problem, and the lady replied, ""*Problem?* My **problem**?!"" Very angry.

After we had our talk about this and fluffed it off we sent a message to the owner (Who was out of the country for a week). after looking at past transactions we realized that *she had been in here before!* About a year ago, while I was away, she came in and complained to the owner about all of us. None of us could recall who she was, so after doing some research in our system, concluded that it must have been a former employee who incurred her wrath. So obviously, this is not the first time she has been in raising hell.

A week ago, I received a letter from the owner, asking me to reply to an email sent by this lady, basically listing all the fictional ways she had been wronged in our store the week before: From ignoring her and her family, to rolling eyes, to rude comments...none of which happened. As I said, until the transaction ended, she was pleasant enough. I replied and stated the facts and basically told the owner that I honestly believe, based on this and past events, that she has a vendetta against us, and she was just trying to cause a fuss. No word back yet.

*....But ohhhhhh Im so angry!* She basically lied in a gigantic letter about us, and said that I should be made to apologize and be removed from my position. I know the owner knows us, and it probably won't go anywhere, but it still infuriates me to no end to think that this woman has that much time on her hands to do that. I know pissing me off is probably exactly what she was after, but I can't help it. Any ideas to shrug off the bad mojo?

First time poster, yadda yadda. Today I'd like to tell you about the time I thwarted an attempted robbery. By doing absolutely nothing. **WARNING: WALL OF TEXT INCOMING.**


As a broke university student, I took up working at a card/useless gift store at our local mall. I worked almost exclusively on the weekends, but there were exactly two Wednesday nights I worked in my whole year of employment there.


Before the first Wednesday night, we'd been getting security alerts. Apparently, these three guys had somehow gotten a copy of the key to our registers, and for whatever reason, ALL of the registers in the stores in our province used the same key. (Brilliant, I know.) So they'd been hitting up stores a few hours away from us, and moving progressively closer.


Now, luckily these weren't violent robberies. We had a policy that made us walk customers over to merchandise, instead of pointing or giving directions. So one guy would ask about a product, the cashier would leave the cash, the other two would open the drawers, take the money, and they would all run. 


The first Wednesday night I worked, we received an alert that they'd recently tried this plan in the next town over. I was working by myself, so manager instructed me to stay behind the cash the entire night, no matter what. Now, I was thinking there was no WAY these guys would try it again. They literally got chased out of the store in the next town over, so clearly we were onto them. We had their descriptions. But obviously better safe than sorry, I followed my manager's instructions. 


And… nothing happened. It was super boring.


Cue Wednesday #2. Same instructions. I was also given the cell phone number of a mall security guard who knew the situation. Out of curiosity, I started watching for people matching the robbers' descriptions, of which there were very few. 


Then about halfway through my shift, in comes this single guy, who matches the description. Not wanting to jump to conclusions, I smile and greet him. He smiles back, goes around my counter and looks at something next to me. 


I turn my head; there are two other guys, also matching the description, standing right outside my store.


My heart sinks and then immediately jumps into my throat. *HOLY SHIT, SERIOUSLY? THESE GUYS ARE TRYING TO ROB ME.* I stay calm, keep smiling.


The first guy asks me, pleasantly, where ~insert specific brand name product~ is. It just so happens to be across the store, far away from the cash. So I break our usual policy, and very politely (still smiling!) direct him to it. The ONLY thing running through my mind at this point is *NOPE. NOT LEAVING. I'M NOT LEAVING THIS CASH. I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE. I'M NOT LEAVING…*


First guy starts walking hesitantly over where I directed. ""Over here?"" he asks.


""Yep! Right there on the back wall."" *NOPE, I'M NOT GOING TO SHOW YOU WHERE IT IS, I'M GOING TO STAY RIGHT HERE.*


First guy, still walking slowly: ""Okay, what about ~another random specific brand name product~?""


""Oh, that's actually on the same wall, just a little to your left!"" *NOT LEAVING, NOT LEAVING, NOT LEAVING…*


First guy reaches the back wall, then the other two guys come into the store, and go over to him. At this point, I grab my phone, and dial the number I was given. I look up, the three guys are having a little conference, and looking at me. 


*BEEP! I'm sorry. The number you have dialed is not in service.*


I curse the phone, hang up, and dial (very carefully) again.


*BEEP! I'm sorry. The number you have dialed is not in service.*


I try a third time, to no avail. By this point, I look up, and the guys are gone. 


*Well, great. Now what?*


My heart is still pounding, which I feel silly about, because nothing really happened, but I'm searching around for the regular mall security number, and I can't freaking find it. So I end up calling the girl at the jewelry stand outside my store, waving at her, and asking if she has the mall security number. FINALLY get through to security, and about 3 mins later, Mr. Should-have-answered-his-cellphone comes RUNNING up (apparently he was in the process of getting his phone fixed when I called).


""Which way'd they go?!?!""


Me: ""Well, that way, but it was like ten minutes ago...""


He takes off anyway. He comes back shortly, obviously having found nothing, and has to take a statement from me. (It's awful trying to be an eyewitness, btw. I could hardly remember anything. *Did they have facial hair?* I think so... *Was he wearing a hat?* Yes! *What kind?* Uh...)


Anyway, I call my manager, who can't believe they'd actually tried it again. After repeatedly asking if I'm okay, I stay to finish the rest of my shift by myself.


About 30 mins later, a customer wants a product that we keep in our back room. I hesitate a bit to go get it, and the woman chuckles and says, ""Don't worry, I won't let anyone steal anything."" *If you only knew...*


The rest of the night went fine. I never worked another Wednesday night. We never got another security alert. I sure showed them.

Today was especially a living fucking hell, thanks to:

- High level store management is hugely incompetent
- 3 ""Extreme"" Couponers

Background: Currently I am the cashier manager at an indepedent Canadian grocery store chain (we are technically owned by a big chain, but not managed, i don't get it). I have been working there longer than anyone else (6 years). I booked off this week, and next week to work on finishing my masters thesis (computer science), which is due on the ~20th~. 

Today: At 8:30am, i get a panicked phone call from one of the newer employees, telling me that the other cashier manager (he actually had a legit family emergency, i slept through his calls during the night, which i found out later), hasn't shown up at all, and she isn't answering her phone. Fuck. So the tills are locked, and we open at 9am, the acting store manager at the time also apparently has no fucking idea how to open the safe (fucking useless), she wants me to tell her the combination / how to open it over the phone, i refuse (i would get fired if someone found out). 

So I drag my ass to work, unlock the tills/safe (we open at 9, its about 9:15 am by now, and people are not happy that nobody can checkout their purchases). We are also apparently quite short handed, since it was basically me/two newer employees. 

Fuck. We are missing 2 cashiers and a supervisor. Supervisor no answer, but i get in touch with one of cashiers (i dub thee Asshat), this happens:

Me: ""Where are you?""
Asshat: ""Its not a real job, so I don't need to give two weeks notice""
Me: ""Can you just come in for one last shift for a little while? We are understaffed badly, besides You need to turn in your uniform anyways...""
Asshat: ""Already threw it away, just mail me my last cheque, and don't ever call me again &lt;click&gt;""

Basically i spent the next three hours dancing between the phone and the POS (checkout), trying to batphone any sort of help. Theres 3 cashes open on a sunday morning, customers were extremely pissy (i had more then one customer ask to speak to the manager because of the long lines, when i told them i was the manager they kind of realized how messed up the situation was, i hope). Sadly no one is willing to come, or i can get in touch with them. Thankfully there is two people starting around ~noon~. However before this i ran into the first extreme couponer of the day.

---
Foreword: At the store i work at, we have had ALOT of problems with couponers cheating the system (it almost screwed our store BAD (but that's another story)). Typically if there an extreme couponer wanting to checkout usually myself or the other cashier manager will deal with them. This is mostly due to the fact that it is a nightmare for almost all of the employees (including supervisors), and Couponers are typically be extremely fucking harsh to the cashier (especially if you are new and don't know you lingo). 

Also thanks to shows like extreme couponing people immediately went ""i can do that do"", without actually realizing A. the show is american and the rules are different here, and B. its a lot more complicated/time consuming then most people realize. 

---
Stuff quieted down a bit (the time between the morning rush, and the after church rush). Sadly a wild couponer with her posse of three friends appeared, and tried to checkout at one of the new girls cashes (poor millie didn't know to call a manager, and i am trying to get people to show up early):

The lady and her posse (the 4 hags), had 3 carts filled with hair products, frozen dinners, toothpaste, and some other stuff. The 4 hags wanted it split like this:

They each wanted each product split 4 ways, with the exception of one of the hags not wanting product X (i don't remember now), and another not wanting product Y. Then dumped it all in a cart.

DO NOT EVER FUCKING DO THIS, IF YOU HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA HOW MUCH YOU EACH TOOK, THEN YOU KEEP IT SEPARATE FOR FUCKS SAKE. SIMPLE == BETTER FOR EVERYONE.

They basically cleared the shelves from what it seemed. However the new girl started trying to process their order, and 15 minutes later she was basically nowhere and in pretty much looked like she was about to cry, so she asked for help. Now i am in a bad mood, she looks like she got ripped apart.

I void the whole order, and ask if they are going to be using coupons, and of course they are.

Me: ""Show me the coupons you are going to be using before we start scanning the products""
4 Hags: ""No after you scan and divide up the products""

IF YOU ARE A CASHIER AND A COUPONER DOES THIS TO YOU, IT MEANS THEY ARE TRYING TO SCREW YOU:
- Basically they want to piss you off enough with their extremely difficult and complex order so you will get frustrated and just accept whatever coupons they give you so they can get you the hell out of there. 
- Typically they won't scan, or if they are internet coupons they might scan as a something else, or something close to the product, or they might just not have a barcode
- They will try and rush you along and try and get you to hurry up

I've seen this before, and i know they are trying to screw us, and basically refuse to budge, finally they show me their hand of 11 coupons:
- 5 internet coupons that fail to meet any sort of minimum criteria for an internet coupon basically if they are making money back after applying a coupon to a product not on sale, something is seriously wrong
- 1 pad of coupons that has obviously been ripped off something. 
- 3 Coupons state they cannot be applied to any other promotional offer (the product was on sale)
- 2 of them having ""One per customer in fine print""

I refuse to accept any of them since they treated her like shit, and they keep arguing the scemantics of our coupon policy. After 15 minutes, they finally fucking leave. All through out this there is huge lines, form god damn it.

Finally reinforcements of two more cashiers show up, and stuff gets back to normal. Later on during the day another couponer shows up, armed with a trusty ipad and spreedsheet along with her enveloped coupons, i take over. All valid coupons! It takes almost 25 minutes to get her checked out (she had a lot but saved overall ~80% of her costs). Except... 

The price doesn't match what her stupid fucking ipad says. Shes one of those. There is a 1% chance the computer screwed something up, so check twice and three times, and everything seems fine. But no, thats not good enough, she shows me that according to her ipad spreadsheet she her final cost should be under 50 bucks. However its almost triple that. I check and check again, computer seems right. 

DONT EVER TELL A COUPONER HER HOLY IPAD SPREADSHEET APP IS WRONG, NO OUR COMPUTER IS WRONG, THERE IS 0 CHANCE SHE SCREWED UP HER FORMULAS. 

I hate these people, they refuse to budge, i go through the whole bill with her line by line. She agrees everything seems right. BUT NO HER IPAD SAYS ~47.XX DOLLARS. This had been going on for almost 45 minutes, i was tired. She kept going over the print out. Then a breakthrough:

Her: ""Theres something definately wrong lets restart from the beginning""
Me: ""Mam there is nothing wrong with the POS everything is right, you may have messed up your formulas or calculations""
Her: ""NO MY IPAD IS NOT WRONG, YOU OR YOUR COMPUTER SCREWED IT UP YOUR TRYING TO CHEAT ME, I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER""
Me: *Points to Manager Tag On my Shirt*
Her: ""GIVE ME THE NUMBER FOR YOUR STORE MANAGER YOU ARE RUNNING A SCAM HERE"" 
Me: ""Mam, the store manager is not here today he will be in tommorow, the POS is correct""
Her: ""Starts going over the bill, again""

Finally a lightbulb went off somewhere, and she figured out whatever mistake she had made:
Her: ""Oops, your right""
Me: ""Alright your total will be ~160$""
Her: ""No i don't want it, i only brought 60 dollars with me, *grabs her coupons and walks away* ""

No apologies no nothing, for wasting my fucking time. 

Yes, i just waisted almost 2 hours in total for this mess. FML.

---

A big problem is about 3~ years ago, there was a manager named janet (not real name), she would accept any coupon without thinking/looking/verifying it:

- No Bar Code ==&gt; She would manually override it
- Wouldn't scan ==&gt; Manual override
- Obviously a coupon made in microsoft word or mspaint ==&gt; manual override

The store ended up getting burned really really fucking hard, until the owner started keeping track of who was accepting fake/invalid coupons and basically fired them if they accepted to many bad coupons. Alot of cashiers got screwed because of this and since janet was the one who trained cashiers it was bad. So we still get alot of people who think our store is basically like the USA for coupons (google searching our store comes up on old posts on some couponing forums).

So thats my story. I am still in a terrible mood, and needed to vent. Honestly i have nothing against it, i just fucking hate when people abuse the system, and the cashiers. This was too long a post.

One day, I'm working the counter where the slicers are. We weren't very busy on this day, so everyone else was working in the back while I was by myself on said counter.

An older woman rolls her cart up to my register, loaded up with two of those big plastic litter buckets and so many individual little cat food cans I can't even begin to count them. She just sits there and stares at me, I just sit there in awe of what I'm seeing. ""Can't you take this stuff out of the cart?"" she asked. I politely said, ""Ma'am, I would really appreciate it if you could hand them out to me, that way I can scan them and get you checked out faster."" She acts like I've asked her to lift a car, and slowly makes her way about putting the cans on the belt. At this point I can already tell this is not going to go well. 

About halfway through, she said something along the lines of, ""I guess you people just don't care enough to help someone with a bad back."" I thought, *Really? If that was the problem you could have said something.* I would have understood if she had told me she was having back trouble and took the stuff out of the basket, that's not as big of a deal to me as someone just being blatantly lazy. I can't read minds.
After scanning and sacking about two bags worth of cans, she looked at me and said, ""You aren't keeping those cans in stacks like I had them? You're just *throwing* them into those sacks in a big mess?""

""Ma'am, the little cans don't stay that way once you put them in the sacks. I've tried.""

""Well, those better be stacked up like I had them, I can get your supervisor if I have to!""

At this point I'm so furious I'm shaking, and she's puffed up like an ugly old toad. I make something of an attempt to keep the remaining cans stacked, but as soon as I go to move the bag of course they fall over.
""What about those first bags? You aren't going to fix those?!""

I'm still shaking, and so angry. I just want to shut her up and get her out of the store. I pile the cans from the first bags up and throw all the bags back in the basket. I rang up her total and she paid with one of those pre-paid Visa gift cards. I neatly folded up her 5 foot long receipt and handed it to her, and she has the nerve to chime in one last time. 

""Where's my 16 cents?""

""Excuse me?""

""That gift card was the same as a $100 bill, I want my change.""

""Ma'am, I can't *do* that.""

""You're telling me I can't get my change back?!""

""I can't give change unless you use cash.""

She huffs and I call for the carry out she so ""kindly"" requested, and she exits the store with the manager that volunteered to help her.
Sometime later the manager comes back by and I asked him if she said anything on the way out. Apparently she decided to inform him that the cashier that waited on her was a stupid b**ch and she didn't appreciate how they didn't stack the cans like she wanted. He said at that point he stopped talking to her and shoved the stuff in her car. I've been at my job for a while, all the managers know I do my best to be nice to customers so he didn't believe a word she said. 

TL DR: Older woman gets angry at me for not unloading her basket for her, not keeping her ridiculous number of little cat food cans stacked just like she had them, and not giving her change for using a gift card. Proceeds to tell the manager I'm a stupid b**ch.

This means I'm stuck with whatever change was left in the til from Saturdays shift. Which shouldn't be a problem as there is $250 in various notes and coins except for the $50 customers.

Now the $50 customers don't actually spend $50, they spend less than $10 and pay with a $50 note, which quickly eats up all the change and leaves me with several $50's and no way to give customers change until the lunch shift where I would have to find another business who will exchange my 50's for change.

After the same customers coming in with the exact same habits several weekends in a row I decided to start asking them if they had any smaller change. They never did, which was quite frustrating.

So I got my co-worker to prepare one weekend, before the end of his shift on Saturday he got $150 of the til changed into $1 coins. Come Sunday morning the same customers came in at various times, picked up their $3-$7 items and handed me the fifty. Keeping my 'friendly customer service smile' I would count out the correct amount of change in $1 coins and happily hand them their mound of change with their receipt and do my best to hold eye contact with their state of surprise upon receiving the pile of coins.

I was picking up some last minute gifts for my boyfriend at like, 9:30. Any sane person would know that at nine thirty at night, right before closing and the day before christmas eve, things are going to be crowded and stock is going to be low. I knew the job was dangerous when I took it.

As expected, there's a large amount of empty shelves and the only things left on the rack are xxxl or xxs.

1342458662.0,308,self.TalesFromRetail,wnh4m,BUT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO TELL MY SON?,birdbirdbirdbirdbird,370,62,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/wnh4m/but_what_am_i_supposed_to_tell_my_son/,"First, I’m so thrilled that this subreddit exists!  I thought I’d share a story from a few years ago, when I worked at a public library in the southern US.  I recognize that a public library isn’t retail, but hopefully this still applies.

So I’m at the children’s reference desk with another librarian, Krissy.  It’s summer, which means that in an already abnormally busy library, shit is bustling.  I’m directing patrons to the latest Dora DVDs, pushing Roald Dahl at every opportunity, teaching people how to use their iPads and Kindles, and helping over-eager parents find study guides to the elementary-level aptitude tests that no one is supposed to study for, per usual.  

This kid of about nine or ten comes up to the desk, looking for books about Greek mythology.  Cool, I get up and walk him over to the 200’s in the non-fiction section.  For those of you not familiar with the Dewey Decimal System, the 200’s house pretty much anything that falls under the topic of religion – this includes modern monotheistic religions as well as ancient ones.   We find a book he likes – Greek mythology illustrated as an action comic book.  He seems happy and toodles off on his way.

I’m called away from the desk, and come back about ten minutes later to find Krissy looking like she’s just narrowly avoided being hit by a bus.  I ask her what happened, and she says, “Crazy guy, I’ll tell you later, I think he’s still here.”

From across the library, I hear someone say, “There she is!”  I look over, and there’s Greek-mythology-kid pointing at me.  His dad is standing next to him, and his dad is a really big guy.  He looks pissed.  I’m a tall enough woman that most men don’t tower over me, but this guy is just intimidatingly large.  He marches up to me with the kid trotting in his wake, and slaps his hand down on the desk, making a loud THUMP that gets the attention of several people nearby.   Krissy and I have already put on our stone-faces – you know, the one that every service/retail person perfects to defend against members of the public afflicted with Crazy Face.

**AngryDad:** WHERE IS THAT BOOK?

**Me:** Pardon?  (I should point out that while I’m keeping my cool, I have absolutely no idea what’s gone wrong.  So far, I’ve helped this kid find a book he specifically asked for, which is something I’ve done several dozen times already today, to no adverse result.)

**Krissy:** The book you gave me?  It’s there on the red reshelving cart behind you.

AngryDad turns around, grabs the book, and drops it in front of me on the desk.

**AngryDad:**  WHAT IS THIS? HOW CAN YOU CALL THIS NON-FICTION?

At this point, I think I’ve got a handle on the situation.  A lot of parents think that if something looks like a comic book, it can’t possibly be educational, factual, literary, whatever.  That’s unfortunate, since lots of boys wind up responding more readily to graphic novels and huge exploded illustrations of machines than, say, Anne of Green Gables, which is boring as shit.  I assume that the father is upset because I’ve handed his kid something that doesn’t look scholarly enough.

**Me:** Oh, don’t worry!  I know this looks like a comic book, but the comics just illustrate the real Greek myths.

**AngryDad:** YEAH.  MYTHS.  HOW AM I GOING TO EXPLAIN TO MY SON WHY THESE MYTHS ARE IN THE NONFICTION SECTION NEXT TO THE CHRISTIANITY BOOKS?

Oh.  I get it.  This is one of those people.  We’re in an affluent, young, predominantly Christian suburb in the south.  It’s the kind of place where people behave as though it’s a given that you would share their beliefs, and are not shy about making sure you know what is and is not moral or appropriate.  It’s also, apparently, the kind of place where some people think that the only religious books that should be classified as non-fiction in the DEWEY DECIMAL SYSTEM, in a PUBLIC LIBRARY no less, are religious books about Christianity.  Great.  I realize that I should probably expect this kind of thing, or at least not be surprised by it.  I drop my Friendly Children’s Librarian Demeanor and use my very best Unwaveringly Stern Voice.

**Me:** In the Dewey Decimal System, all religions are classified in the 200’s.

**AngryDad:** BUT YOU JUST SAID THEY’RE MYTHS.  AM I SUPPOSED TO TELL MY SON THESE STORIES ARE REAL?

**Kid:** Yeah Dad, are they real? (It’s apparent that the kid is loving every second of this.  Who knows what his motives are, but his dad seems like a pretty volatile guy, and I guess there’s something about getting to push your parents’ buttons in a way that directs their hostility onto someone else that’s in some way satisfying or exciting.)

**AngryDad:** SEE?! 

**Me:** In the Dewey Decimal System, all religions are treated in their historical, sociological context.  They’re non-fiction because they’re beliefs that people held in the past.  

**AngryDad:** BUT – 

**Me:** Greek mythology was a religion, so it’s housed in the religion section.

**AngryDad:** BUT WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO TELL MY SON?

**Me:** That’s not for me to say, sir.

**AngryDad:** THAT’S RIDICULOUS.  WE’RE LEAVING.

A gentleman (in the rage of 50-60 years old) mosied up to the service desk today with a cart full of molding that is sold by the foot/inch to check out and announces that he has X amount of boards at exactly X length.

I apologize and inform him that because they are sold by the foot, each one has to be measured.

To which he says 'Do what you need to do.'

So, I start measuring. Now, I'm not certain if he didn't understand that 'Each one needs to be measured' meant that each one needs to measured or if he lodged one up his ass, but this began a tirade that would continue throughout this whole transaction. He keeps getting up in my face and moving things around on his cart intentionally and making this whole process take about three times longer than it normally would.

'I can't believe you have to do this' 
'This is why people go to your competitor'
'You're worthless and wasting my time.'

And now in my head I'm like whatever. Enjoy your temper tantrum. So it continues with his yelling and general berating and really nothing I haven't heard before.

'I've never had anyone do this to me before'
'What do you mean that one is X feet X inches! It was in your X foot bin!' (That bin that has pieces between X feet and X feet 11 inches? Okay.)
'I'll never shop here again'
'Can't you see? They're obviously all the same'
'I think you should be giving me money for wasting my time'

I stop right before I measure the last piece. 'Sir. These are literally sold by the inch, so we pay by the inch for them and so do you. We get audited if we don't measure each piece. I do not make these rules but I value my job enough to follow them.'

So he shuts up for a tick

Then starts again about how it's a bullshit policy and that I'm clearly lying to him and he wants a supervisor.

So, I pull my department head over from the 10 feet away she was standing where she has listened to this whole transaction and just inform her that this gentleman doesn't like the policy and would like to speak to a supervisor *

So, having heard everything that just transpired she almost verbatim repeats what I told this guy adding that each transaction is recorded and on video and loss prevention would write me up if I didn't follow it.

This guy apologizes to her and says a couple choice phrases about how awful this policy is. And we all think this is the end of it.

BUT THEN he turns, voice raised and instantly back in tantrum mode and  yells that I shouldn't let someone yell at me and when someone is up in my face I shouldn't let them keep going and get a manager, all while simultaneously getting up in my face and yelling at me in front of my manager.

Eventually he leaves. Manager and I are dumbfounded. And after a little bit she looks at me and goes 'Did he just yell at you for letting him yell at you?'

Then we both died laughing.

*Please note that the whole yelling thing is an everyday occurrence for us and she didn't help me because normally people just want to be assholes and I usually don't have a problem de-escalating or getting a supervisor when the situation becomes too much and has nothing to do with her being a bad person or whathaveyou.

""Oh, I get it! They take your handprint and turn it into an animal!,"" is what I hear ALL day. But aside from having to give directions, hearing the same things over and over again, and being paid minimum wage...I like the job pretty well. I've been doing this for almost 1 year. The gist is that the customer and/or the customer's children pick the animals that they want their handprint turned into out of our sample book. Simple designs: lions, tigers, flamingos, butterflies etc. Next, based on the animal choice we paint their hand and take their handprint. I did a family of handprints today and got my first ""rejection."" I just graduated from an art college (majoring in Drawing and Painting) this past fall, so these designs are pretty easy for me to complete.

 Anyway, as is normal I write down each member in the family's desired name along with the animal that they want. I begin taking handprints, youngest first. The youngest happened to be this baby girl who began to cry and scream her head off as soon as I started painting her hand. All of the other handprints were easy. I rang them up (total around $64) and told them it would be about half an hour for me to complete. So, they said they'd come back. All was going well, the handprints were turning out cute, finished them up, wrote the names in calligraphy and then noticed that they had returned (sitting on a low wall across from the stand.) I grabbed a bag, the painting and walked towards them. Held up the painting (pretty pleased with how it had turned out) and all the dad says is that the animals are ordered in the wrong direction, I.E. the hand placement isn't how he wanted them. I had ordered them from youngest to oldest from left to right. He insisted that he had told me that he wanted them ordered from oldest to youngest from left to right. Thinking about it I have zero recollection of him making that request. If he made it, he didn't make it clear to me. 

So, he starts complaining about how he thought that i knew what I was doing. And I said I did, but that I didn't know he wanted them in a special order. He started talking about how he wasn't going to pay for something he didn't want (mentioning that he had NO problem with the actual artwork). And me, being naturally defensive of anything good that I create, was getting irritated and angry. I said, ""You know what, I'll get my supervisor and she can give you a refund."" Seeing that she was just leaving the office I walked over that way, with them following slowly behind, and just sort of quickly give her the artwork, not explaining the situation (I imagine i looked pretty upset) and continued on into the office while I let her handle the situation. I stayed in there until its all taken care of (fuming because 1. They didn't specifically ask clearly for any order, 2. Why should it be THAT important. ) Find out later that they didn't end up taking the full refund, but instead get 50% off what I created for them. I would have rathered they took the full refund, because for all the trouble they made of it, they didn't deserve to take it home for half the price; let alone at all. 

All in all, I had a pretty good run before my first ""major"" complaint by a customer...almost 1 year. :) Plus the good customer's infinitely make up for and are far more common than the bad ones.

I work at a big auto part store, and usually when it rains we get a lot of wiper blade sales. everyone at the store knows how to put wiper blades (This part is important so keep a mental note of it.) So one night I am the closing manager and i have a female co-worker (ill call her bubbles) closing with me. she is very bubbly and always smiling and being cheerful which kinda of annoys me but i digress. so this asshat comes in to the store and immediately bubbles go up to him and greets him:

Bubbles: ""hello welcome to Auto parts store! Can i help you?""

Asshat: ""Is there a man working today? i don't think a women can help me, you guys are useless here! I dont know why they hire you chicks!""

I was on the next aisle and I overheard everything and was not pleased. nobody insults Bubbles like that and gets away with it! So I go where they are at and with an attitude i ask him what does he want. He wanted some wiper blades and also wanted them installedt(he fucking nerve on this dude.) So i decide this is where im going to get him, since I personally trained bubbles on installing wiper blades I know she is a pro and can switch them out in like ten seconds. so i proceed to ring him out and this is how the conversation goes:

asshat: so can you install them for me?

me: oh! im so sorry sir,  i have a lot of paperwork to do right now and i cant go outside to do it for you. Its not that hard to change sir, you can probably do it yourself.

asshat: ive never changed them before, can you please help me put them on?

me: i got a better idea sir, my employee bubbles is an expert on changing wiper blades!Ii bet she can do it for you and teach you how to do it. its sad you dont know how to put them on its by far the easiest thing to do on a car other than check your oil.

at this time more people have showed up, and this dude is not happy i messed with his ""pride"" as a man but bubble plays along and shows him slowly how to put them on and actually makes him put one on himself. after he left he called the store angrily telling me he's never been treated like that in his life! I just tell him that next time he comes around dont be so sexist and he wont be treated like that.

We work together in a larger Australian supermarket, and on this day he was in the Deli and I was in Admin. He told me this story after the situation had gone down. Sorry for the long post but it's so worth it, I've heard this story so many times so I can assure you every sentence is the same.

It was about 8:45pm on a Saturday (when our store shuts at 9pm) and he'd just finished cleaning the entire Deli, which includes cleaning the slicer. It's a big metal thing, with a giant blade that you can set to different widths for different cuts. He's already done cleaning it for the night - nothing gets cut after about 6pm, because it would be a waste.

This older woman comes in, about 40 years of age, seems fine, goes and lingers around the deli cabinet before wandering off to look at pre-sliced and packaged stuff a metre or so away. T goes back to cleaning and covering the deli meats up (usual end of night protocol) at the other end of the deli.

She coughs, standing in front the salami and like meats. T walks down, all friendly, and asks her what he can help her with. 

'I want some prosciutto.' the woman says, poking her finger at the cabinet. T just stares, most people usually add exactly how much of said meat they want. For those who don't know, prosciutto is sliced extremely thin. I think it's Italian but I'm not sure, nice stuff though.
'Did you hear me? I said I wanted prosciutto.' 'Okay then, how much would you like then?' T asks politely. 'Well, I want prosciutto, but I don't want that one there. It's too thick. I'm going to go do the rest of my shopping, and I want you to cut some up for me even thinner when I'm gone.'

First of all, we have a policy that you have to stay there while we cut. But my this time, it's so close to finish, T just goes 'No. The slicer's already been cleaned for the night, I don't slice past 6pm, you can have that prosciutto in the case and that's it.' Point I forgot to make, there's already a lot of cut up prosciutto in the cabinet.

* Older lady: 'So you're saying that the slicer's broken?'
* T: 'No, I'm saying that I'm not cutting anything else up when there's already some available.'
* Older lady: 'But that's too thick, what's the problem with you cutting up some more? Is the slicer broken?'
* T: 'I didn't say the slicer was broken! The store is about to close, I don't cut anything up past 6, there's already some there. That's the thinnest the prosciutto goes already out.'
* Older lady: 'So what I'm hearing is that you're refusing to cut me some prosciutto.'
* T: 'That's exactly what I'm saying! I am not cutting anything up. You can have that stuff and that's it.' 

At this point he's almost shaking mad, and the woman's just staring at him in disbelief because he's refusing to cut up the meat for her. So she says the typical customer back up sentence, 'I want to speak to your manager.'

It's now 9pm, T hasn't finished cleaning because she's wasted 15 minutes of his time by arguing and wandering around. He calls the manager, K, over the speaker and goes back to cleaning while the woman taps her fingers on the glass cabinet and tells him, 'If you'd just cut the prosciutto up I wouldn't have to do this you know, now I'm going to tell your boss you should be fired for being so disrespectful and not listening to customer.'

K walks over  - he's a pretty big black guy, use to be a bouncer at the local gay club, fairly scary. He comes over, asking T what the problem is, but the woman cuts in.

'He told me that the slicer is broken but how can it be when there's already so much sliced meat!?'
K and T just look at one another, and T explains, 'I told her that I wouldn't be cutting up any prosciutto for her because it's so late, there's already thin sliced prosciutto there, and the slicer's already been cleaned for the night and I don't want to have to re-clean it for the one thing.'

K looks at the woman, who's muttering about customer satisfaction. The store has technically shut, but obviously the doors aren't shut because she's still in the place refusing to leave without her prosciutto. She has no other groceries, by the way. 'Well, Ma'am,' says K, crossing his arms and staring at her, 'I'm going to have to ask you to leave there store. Without the prosciutto. We've been shut for ten minutes, and we'd all like to go home.'

'BUT YOU HAVE TO SERVE ME AND I WANT PROSCIUTTO CUT FOR ME!' Older woman starts screaming. K just tells her to get out, security comes over, K tells her the police will be rung etc. and meanwhile T just goes back to cleaning.

Later we find out Older Woman was banned from the store due to 'employee abuse' and 'creating issues'. Beautiful.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1eqgtb,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1eqgtb/so_youre_saying_the_slicers_broken/,

So a bit of background - this story comes from when I was working as in store tech support/device specialist for one of the big 4 cell phone providers. I was basically the person that would get called over to help with customers that were either having issues that nobody else could figure out, or to give them a quick 10 minute walkthrough on how to use their new cell phones.

So one day, this woman comes in, wearing what I can only describe as a power suit. Everything about her was power - power suit, power walk, swinging her keys to her company car, the whole nine yards. She has an attitude from the moment she gets signed in, so I decided to keep an eye on her. At the time, we were having some issues with a couple of the phones that were on display. She gets called a minute later by one of my coworkers, who opens the phone and can see definitive evidence of liquid damage.

I don't mean the LDI (liquid damage indicator) was tripped, I mean there were clear wet spots, some stickiness, everything. Lady apparently doesn't have insurance, and won't admit that she got her phone wet. I can hear the arguments escalating, and eventually go over and work closer by in case my coworker needs assistance. 

As soon as I walk over, she asks for confirmation that there was liquid damage. I take one look at it, agree, and even point out the visible liquid underneath the screen. The customer keeps trying to play games with me, asking questions like ""if I got it wet, don't you think I'd admit to it? Do you think I'm some kind of liar?"", and I'm refusing to take the bait.

Eventually, she pulls out this gem. ""Honey, I'm a lawyer, and I'm going to do something we call boxing you in until you admit I'm right.""

My response was ""that's fine, ma'am. I think outside of the box.""

She looked like a fish out of water for about 5 seconds, turned around, and left.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1ea58c,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1ea58c/im_going_to_box_you_in/,

About every 3 months, we would get this customer who was always an asshole. He always walked through the door in a shitty mood. His face was permanently scowled and he acted as if we owed him our service like he was single-handedly keeping the doors open at our store. He always had problems with his rental tools, always complaining they weren't working correctly or that the blades were dull, or any other fault he could find. 

One Saturday he came in informing us that he needed a chainsaw, and that he wanted the most powerful one we had. I set him up with a 20"" chainsaw, with a new chain, oil, gas and wrench, so that he shouldn't have any reason to call us. I fired it up for him, showed him how it worked and how to tighten the chain, and sent him on his way. 

A few hours later, he calls in and tells us the saw isn't cutting anymore and that we must have given him a dull chain. Even though we put a brand new chain on the saw, I swallow my pride and tell him to bring the saw back and we'll replace the chain. When he arrives back at the store, I set the saw up on the counter and begin the process of replacing the chain. I take my time showing him how to replace the chain himself in case he has another issue, and I happily offer to top off his fluids and send him back out. I punch out for lunch, and I leave for the hour.

When I return, my coworker informs me that this customer called *again*, this time claiming that the chain fell off as soon as he fired the saw up and that I forgot to put the nuts back on the chain guard that hold it in place. He suggested that I should check my pockets, since they must be in my pocket because he couldn't find them anywhere(and for the record, they weren't). I was instantly irate. I had taken his shitty attitude for months, and I was done with it. If there's one thing I will not tolerate, it's people calling me a liar or a fuck-up. I had done the procedure of replacing those chains nearly a hundred times, and because I know how dangerous it could be to make a mistake, I knew to always make sure that the nuts were tight before I leave the saw. This, combo-ed with the fact that I had shown him step-by-step how to replace the chain himself, made me firmly believe that his guy was lying out his ass. I also had an Ace up my sleeve. The spot that I had chosen to work on his saw, also just happened to be the very spot our security camera was pointing towards. I knew that if it came down to it, the security tape would back me up.

I waited for his return, all the while planning what I was going to say, seething as I imagined his cocky ass walking through the door, ready to call me a fuck up to my face. When I saw his truck pull up, my adrenaline started pumping, and I got ready to unleash the fury. He rings the buzzer, and I open the door, saying ""How are **WE** doing, sir?"" I was trying my best to stay cordial, but there was no mistaking the tone of anger in my voice.

""Well, did you find 'em?""

""Find **what**, sir?""

""The nuts to the chainguard, you put them in your pocket! That chain flew off and I could have been seriously hur-""

""No, I did **not** put them in my pocket, sir. I put them on the chainsaw. I have a fairly photographic memory, and I can tell you exactly how it went down. You were standing over there, I was standing right here. I went the whole process of showing you how to put this chain on, just as I've done about a hundred times, and I know for a **fact** that I put those nuts back on that saw. And that camera right up there (I pointed to the camera), is looking *directly* at me, so we can check the tapes if you want to.""

I work at a pretty well known fast food restaurant: you know it, you've been there, yep.



So last night a man came into the lobby of our restaurant and he ordered four large drinks and began to tell the girl taking his order how he wanted them made. He was unaware that when you buy drinks, you are given your cup and fill it up yourself. So the girl taking his order pointed this out to him.



Upon hearing this the man looked extremely confused and loudly says ""WHAT?!"". He then ran out of the lobby and disappeared. Just moments later and order of four large drinks comes through the drive thru. You'll never guess who it was that appeared at my window, the same guy!



This wasn't really bothersome, it just blew my mind how lazy this man was. To avoid filling up his own drinks, he RAN outside, got in his car, drove to the drive thru, and then drove around to pick them up. What?

And many customers were wearing big ugly frowns.

Instead of waiting in queue as is common courtesy

A woman kept cutting to interrogate me.

In a variety of styles and colors and whites.

On a flashing light pattern for her short, shitty tree.

Ringing up my fair share of crafting morons.

Huzzah! And hooray! I knew just what to say.

#1
So I've got about an hour left on my shift and didn't feel like driving all over so I agree to take the motel order and then come back and fold boxes. I get to the motel and realize I'm delivering to the room on the corner of the first floor, which is awesome cause I don't have to venture to far from my car. Knock on the door and say pizza guy and hear ""I'll be right there"", about 10-15 seconds later there stands before me a naked man covering his junk with a towel, hopping up and down on one leg while the other has blood pouring down it onto the carpet. As calmly as I could I tell the guy to close the door and get decent, he comes back with pants on this time, I get a $3 tip and a story.

#2
There was a gated community just down the street from us and for some reason they refused to give us a remote for the front gate, which meant that I'd have to buzz them from the gate or if I was lucky I'd be able to follow one of the residents in. Well I got lucky and was able to drive right in, I got even luckier because the customer was one of the first houses. I get all of food and drinks and knock on the door, a few seconds later I'm greeted by this beautiful woman (early 20's brunette lowcut top) who takes the food and drinks and sets them on a table next to the front door, she comes back and starts making small talk/flirting (awe yeah, everyone loves the pizza guy) then grandma no bra with the see thru blouse comes to the door screaming how she never buzzed me in, tosses the money at me and slams the door. On the bright side she actually threw enough money at me to where I still got tipped.
#3
I'd been delivering about 3 months at this point and hadn't experienced crazy customers yet. So it's my first delivery of the day and it's in a nice part of town, so I don't bother to roll the windows in my car up. I grab the guys order and knock on the door, hand him his pizza and drink and he hands me a $20 on a $19.92 bill and then tells me he wants the change. I tell him no problem I've got some change in my cup holder I'll be right back, walk over and lean into the car and grab a dime and as soon as I turn around the guy is right in my face demanding his change, I hand him the dime and leave. When I got back to the store I told my manager who showed me how to leave comments about the customers so other drivers knew what to expect.
#4
So it's about 8 PM on a thursday night and I'd sent out to deliver to customer who'd complained about every order they'd received from us. They'd say that we'd given them the wrong order, food was to cold, the usual b.s. complaints to get free food. My manager made sure that the order was 100% correct and told me to call her when after I delivered their food. I call back about 10 minutes later and so do they, since theirs was the only delivery I had I went straight back to the store. I see my manager is fuming, apparently everything was wrong and tastes horrible, so my manager remakes the exact order and sends me back but not before telling me that no matter what this customer is banned. So I put the pizzas into the heating bag and head back into the night. I made sure to park to where they couldn't see me coming, got out and grabbed the heating bag, made sure that it was secured tightly and started throwing it around, I did this for a solid minute and then I walked the order up to the house. They called and complained and for once they were right but they cried wolf too many times.
#5
Had a really bad shift culminating in my last hour driving to opposite sides of our delivery area and not getting tipped. I'd been saving my delivery tags (not sure what they were actually called) for the last couple weeks, they had the customers phone number, whether or not I was tipped and then I made sure to write down if they were dicks. One night after my shift I was hanging out with one of my buddies when a moment of genius hit, I told him that we're going to start prank calling all of the rude no tipping dicks. We'd come up with the idea that we were talk radio hosts from Maine and we were calling random people through out the U.S. to see if they could answer our $10,000 question. We figured that since we were from Maine that it had to be a Stephen King related question, something easy and well known like which state were most of his stories based in or around? We waited until 2-3 AM one weeknight and started calling, at first they'd be all grumpy but once the idea of $10,000 was mentioned they perked right up like obedient little dogs. By the time I quit we'd called roughly 60 customers, some of them on more than one occasion. 
#666
I'd started collecting my orders when I noticed that I had no idea where one of the deliveries was going, the address was a main road that I'd driven hundreds of times in my 6 months delivering but I'd only seen trees  in that area. My manager comes over and tells me that there is in fact a house but I'd have to drive slowly or I'd miss the turn for the drive way. So I get in my car and head over to where the address should be and  start driving extra slow and notice a little dirt path being blocked by several weeping willows. I turn down the makeshift dirt driveway and notice that I'm surrounded by tall grass and weeds and a couple hundred feet further down the driveway there was a large house mostly obscured by more weeping willows, the sun has already started to set but where the house was situated its not like that mattered. I park my car at the end of this dirt driveway, grab the food and drinks and step out into the waist high grass. I'd almost made it to the front door when I noticed a little girl come walking out from the grass, she asked me what I was doing and I told her I was delivering pizza to whoever lived here to which I turn and point to the house and in the split second it took me to make that motion and turn back to face her she's managed to disappear. I didn't hear any childish laughter or sounds of playing just birds returning to their nests, I walked up to the front door and knocked, several seconds later an elderly woman opened the door and paid me. I turned and ran back to my car and hauled ass out of there, as I was backing down the dirt drive way I noticed a candle burning in one of the second floor windows.

[FIXED]",thisspaceexists,390,86,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1hhwgy/sorry_i_cant_accept_tips_fixed/,"Drawing nearer to Independence Day means that customers swarm our stores for whatever they need in order to prepare for the holiday. Since it's the 4th, we usually get the average customer interested in a grill or air conditioner or grilling/patio furniture. 

Today, 30 minutes before my shift ends, 2 customers come in. One lady and her decrepit mother who uses our shopping cart as a makeshift cane (we provide electronically motorized sit in carts called EZ-Shoppers). I offer her to sit on the cart. She says no. ""What about this swing set canopy display?""

Her: ""I don't want to sit. I just want my grill"".

Me: ""Sure thing. Let me just pull the internet order information and grab your grill""

I go into receiving (which by the way, is in the back of the store but is usually just a storage area for products to be delivered or picked up later. For future reference, it is not ""the back"" where we keep more stock items)

I find the grill and wheel it up front. Nice and polished and put together very well.

I asked her to sign the Loading Ticket and let her know that if she pulled her car up to the Loading Zone in the front of the store; someone will come out to load it for you free of charge.

The old hag and her daughter both sigh and the daughter goes out to get the car and the mother shortly follows.

10 minutes later (I am a Front Loader, but I was helping customer service and was told that someone else would load the grill for those 2 customers. That person decided it would be a good time to go to lunch without letting anyone know)

In walks Susan Rotten Crotch and her cart cane.

Her: ""HEEEELLLLOOOO?! I've been waiting here forever. Is anyone going to do this shit?""

Me: ""Sorry Ma'am, the person who was going to help you is busy at the moment, I'll find someone el-""

Her: ""I want my money back if I have to wait another 10 god damn minutes""

Already annoyed by this bitch, I shut off my light, log off, and let the other customer service associate know that I will be back in 5 minutes or less.

I grab the grill and wheel it outside. What am I loading this grill in to? A Jeep Wrangler. I have to load a 3 burner grill into a Jeep... There's no way it would fit as is, so I grab my trusty screwdriver and start taking off the side panels. It takes me less than 30 seconds.

5 minutes go by. I have another 15 minutes or so left in my shift and this grill is still not in the back of her 2lb Jeep Wrangler.

Daughter: ""Can't you just like angle it in? I just need to get this door shut a little bit and we can drive without worrying about it falling out""

That's not a bad idea, but the pile of shit they have in the back is going to make things a little less easy.

I start stripping the other side panel, which is just a side burner. I explain how easy it is to reassemble. Just connect this wire into the burner and it should be good to go.

Once I get it off, I put it into the car and I gave them some free string to anchor the door shut as much as possible and a flag to let other drivers know that the door is open.

Daughter: ""That's not going to fit. Can you just hurry up and put all this shit back together? I came here to buy a grill, not build one""

Me: ""Oh, okay. It's not that hard to reassemble. It's 4 screws on each side and a wire to reconnect""

Hag: ""Just fucking put it together. We're going to pay the $65 for delivery. I'm never fucking doing this again""

Store Policy states that we are not allowed to accept cash tips. I let them know that as she started pulling out money which turns out was for the delivery fee (Yes.. she really thought that she could just give me the money in person and get it delivered.)

Honest mistake on my part by thinking it was a tip for me. As a front loader, I get offered money all the time so it is just a natural reaction to say I can't accept tips. But what she does next was completely unnecessary.

She takes the screws and washers that she was keeping in her purse and throws them on the ground. Takes $2 out of her purse and drops it in a puddle.

Bitchy McCuntaHag: ""Here's yah fuckin tip""

I wheeled the grill and it's side panels into the store and waited for them to leave before I started putting it back together.

Half an hour went by before they finally left. I'm punching out late. If it wasn't for my amazing ability to not flip out on customers during their worst; Someone would be out of a job and the other in the emergency room.

She spends a decent hunk of time just sitting there talking on her phone about something completely unrelated to her current situation at the drive thru window.

No more than four inches. And let me tell you, her car wasn't close to the window.

Now I'm not about to climb onto the window ledge and extend my whole body out to get her money, so I stick my arm out the window as far as I can while keeping at least one foot on the ground, and I can't reach her money.

She looks at me like I just asked her what planet we live on. Like I am an idiot, and she is a Ph.D'ed professor. And SHE DOESN'T MOVE HER HAND.

Instead, she closes her window, opens her car door, steps out of her car door, takes a stride over to the window, sticks her head into our fine establishment, and places her money on the counter in front of me.

I'm pretty wordy, so I apologize for the wall.

**The Legend of the Exploding X-Box**

I worked at several stores, and although I had one main home store, I was called in to other stores pretty frequently.  I was scheduled off on a Thursday (one of the slower days) and another store that I had never worked for called me and asked if I could work- one manager was on vacation out of town, their assistant was sick in the hospital, and their third keyholder had gotten in a car wreck- no one was available to open the store.  I agreed to work all day, because yay overtime.  I met the district manager at the store 5 minutes after open, expecting an angry customer since we weren't open yet- but nope, all good.  My DM even helped with opening, which wasn't something he normally did- I could tell he was thankful I came in.  I settled in and looked around the store, so I would know where things were.  This particular store had demo units with X-Box 360, Gamecube and PS2s in fiberglass boxes on the shelf next to the register.  I turned them on as I got ready for the day.

About two hours later, one of the part-timers (we'll call her Jane) came in for their shift.  I found that they were new- this was their third shift working.  I love training people, so we went over their workbook and training program, and I was showing her how to use the register.  Only one customer was in the store, and he was playing the NBA demo on the XBox 360.  All of a sudden, he yells out, and I look over.  The XBox is emitting clouds of white smoke.  I ask Jane where the keys were to open the demos, and of course she doesn't know.  I call our DM as I'm opening the front door, and he doesn't answer.  I run to my car, grab a pen-knife I keep in the glove box, and using it and a paper clip, I pick the lock with smoke streaming in my face (for once I was thankful I grew up in a not-so-nice neighborhood... skills of a mis-spent youth).  Jane had run into the back to grab a fire extinguisher, and we were able to put the X-Box out.  The case had melted somewhat, and the store smelled of burned plastic all day.  Needless to say, we didn't sell a single X-Box that day.


**Trade-In Troubles**

One of the most common complaints we received were the low trade in offers we gave.  I was usually pretty good at handling these customers, since I had quite a few lines that worked.  We offered trade in specials quite often that helped soften the blow, and for older games, I was able to deflect the complaint by pointing out that we took in almost all games that we still carried, even if we had hundreds of copies of it.  That Madden football game from 4 years ago is worth a dime to us because we have 40 copies in the back, and no one is buying one that old anyway.  

Anyways, a customer comes in with a Nintendo GameCube and what looked like every game made for it, ever.  I explain our current trade promotions, and he's thrilled- he wants an X-Box 360.  Our system had a limit of 50 items that could be traded at once, so I grouped everything together in stacks of 48, since we had a ""trade in 3 games, get $10"" special going for all games valued over $2.  I had three full stacks of games I thought were worth more than $2, one not-so-full stack of games I knew were worth less, and then the hardware and controllers.  Instead of using both registers to run the trades, I did it all on one to leave the other one open for other customers.  The customer was fine with that, and started browsing the X-Box 360 wall, after asking if we had any systems in stock to purchase.  I process the first two stacks- all fine.  I'm putting their credit on a card after asking them, so it'll all be together at the end.  I finish with the third stack, and hit Total, so it'll apply the promotion, and then my computer decides to freeze.  I wait a minute to see if it's going to come back up, and I'm forced to restart it.  By this time, our customer has selected about ten games and is ready to check out, and I explain the issue.  I then start ringing the trade on the good register while the other one is booting up.  Same thing happens- register freezes.  The customer starts tapping his toes and acting a little perturbed, as I apologize a ton.  First register is back up, and I process half of stack three without a problem.  Finish the stack, no problem.  Finish the garbage stack, and I look up.  Customer's face is now purple.  I feel it coming.

RAGER-  WHAT IS THE DAMN HOLDUP?!?!

Me-  The registers couldn't handle all the games at once, so I've had to break them up.  We're almost done with the trade.

RAGER-  I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE NOT DONE!  WHAT THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?  WHERE'S YOUR MANAGER?

At this point, it's obvious that I'm the only person other than him in the store.  No other employee is present, and I explain that I'm the manager on duty, and we'll be ringing him up in just a few minutes.

RAGER-  FORGET THAT, JUST GIVE ME MY GAMES BACK!!!

I sit there with my mouth open for a minute, and try and explain that if he takes them somewhere else, it's going to take them the same amount of time or longer to process it.  He proceeds to reach across the counter and start grabbing his games, some of which have been processed through in trade and some haven't.  I proceed to void out the previous transactions as he's yelling and screaming.  As he's leaving the store with his box of goodies, he screams ""THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS FUCKING RIGHT!"", to which I yell back ""EXCEPT WHEN THEY'RE A DUMBASS!"".


**Corporate Craziness**

Anyone that's worked for a retail corporation can tell you- it sucks, especially when the focus is on ""Numbers"".  Our store had requirements for hitting a certain amount of game preorders and also for selling a certain number of discount cards.  I was usually among the top in our store for these, which was strange because I never pushed them as hard as anyone else.  If a customer came up with a purchase, other employees would use the scripted ""Is there anything you'd like to preorder"" or ""Hey, the new Halo is coming out!  Do you want to reserve it for $5?"".  I always felt it best to open conversation with the customer and determine if the sales opportunity was there.

One beautiful Tuesday, I was working alone until 3 PM.  Tuesdays were great for preorders, because games came out on Wednesday, and we'd get last minute people to come in and preorder the game coming out tomorrow.  I had done 8 preorders by noon on just 6 transactions, so my percentages (company wanted 10%) were sitting at 133%.  I had also sold two of our discount cards, so my percentage on that was 33%.  At noon, when I'm processing that day's deliveries, our district manager comes in for a surprise checkup.  I was pretty cordial with him at that time, and we chatted as he looked around and I processed things.  A few customers came in, and as they came to the register, I chatted them up and rang them out, but I didn't mention preorders.  They rang up on two transactions, but no preorders or discount cards.  As they left, and the store was empty, I turned around and saw a somewhat angry look on our DM's face.

DM- ""Are you happy giving away sales opportunities?""

Me- ""Umm, what?""

DM- ""You didn't mention preorders, or discount cards, or any upsells at all.  You're never going to hit your numbers without engaging people more"".

I proceeded to bring up the day's sales report, showing my percentages being 100% and 25% (requirement was 10% and 5%).  My DM had an incredulous look on his face, and pulled up our monthly report, showing me at 21% and 12% for the month.  He never mentioned numbers to me again.


I'm out of retail now, working in the wonderful world of e-commerce.  I still deal with customers, but nowhere near the level of idiocy of retail.  If there are two things I don't miss the most, they are hearing ""The customer is always right!"" from a customer and ""you're missing opportunities"" from corporate.

Everything was going okay until probably approx late 50's year old lady and her approx 30 year old daughter come through, they only have one item, a casserole dish. 


""Okay, that'll be $19 today mam""


""EXCUSE ME?!?!?""


""Your purchase comes to $19""


""No, that label by them clearly said $17, I ONLY WANT IT FOR $17""


""That's fine mam, the system could be off, I'll ring and double check for you""


Now I know this item, it was in the catalog this week for $19, however if it's been mislabeled on the shelf then the customer can get it at the reduced price, so since I'm feeling generous I decide to get someone to physically check (because her and her daughter seemed quite insistent that the tags said $17) instead of just waving the catalog in her face. (*REGRETS 2013*)


Floor Assistant goes and checks, nope there is actually THREE DIFFERENT TAGS/SIGN saying $19 dollars. No way I can give it to the lady at $17, she's gonna have to accept it at $19. 


""Someone on our floor just checked and they're definitely $19, they're also in our catalog at $19 dollars mam, would you still like to purchase it""


""NO, I'M SORRY BUT IT DEFINITELY SAID $17, YOU CALL THAT ASSISTANT DOWN HERE NOW""


*her daughter steps in at this point and says*:

""Mum it's only $2, just get it, I'll give you the $2 if you must""

""I'M SORRY SWEETIE, BUT REALLY IT'S THE PRINCIPLE OF THE  MATTER""

At this stage I can see my checkout line is growing longer by the second and by god I wish I could just over-ride it and be done with her, but my store is a price-override stickler and at this stage I really don't want this lady to get her way. 

""Madam, I could call the assistant down but it's not going to make a difference""

""NO, I WANT TO SHOW THEM""

""Alright mam, if you walk back down to kitchen I'll get the assistant to wait by them for you""

""FINE, THANK YOU FOR NOTHING""

unsure why she said that considering she's going to have to return to the checkout to purchase said dish. I suspend her transaction and serve other people. 

Oh, her daughter also apologized for the fuss her mother was making. 


Five minutes later the devil lady returns with the frazzled looking assistant. God knows what she went through. 
I'm still serving a customer, and I hear her declare

""oh look, she's serving another customer, WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO DEFINITION OF CUSTOMER SERVICE""


In the end the customer was wrong (as usual) and the ended up buying the $19 dollar casserole dish. BUT REALLY ALL THAT FOR $2? + all that wasted time

Oh when I was talking to the assistant about her afterwards, when she was shown the $19 tags she tried to pull the whole ""YOU'VE JUST SWITCHED THOSE PRICES NOW BECAUSE YOU KNOW I AM RIGHT"" move. In the end, they had to call down the floor manager to put her straight. At least her daughter was polite

From my very first job, in fact, working at a well known guitar store.

When you work in specialty retail, you get repeat customers.  Some you just recognize because of what they buy, or their mannerisms, or their voice.  Not Antony.  No, you recognized Antony because he was HUGE.  Not in the fat slob kind of way, but in the ultimate definition of ""Big Russian Bear"" kind of way.  Easily 6'10"" and 400 pounds of solid muscle, and I'm not exaggerating.  I'm 6'2"" and 220, and the man TOWERED over me.  It was like trying to do business with a garbage truck.  The fact that his massive paws somehow managed to play Mandolin (and quite well, I might ad) just made the visual that much more comical.

Now, Antony, aside from being a miniature mountain, was also loud, bold, brash, and ugly.  I'm not saying he had an ugly personality, quite the opposite in fact.  No, I'm saying his face looked like some very brave soul had used it for kicking practice.  A hideous scar ran across his right eyebrow, puckered and discolored.  His nose looked like someone had tried to staple a potato to his face.  His right eye was cloudy.  His ear was missing a fairly significant portion of it's structural aspects.  He had, quite obviously, been through several ringers.

Thing is, Antony liked me.  And I liked him, because he was that big, larger-than-life kind of character who makes things interesting.  His thick Russian accent and propensity for wearing massive leather bomber jackets just made the effect better.  It was as if someone had taken every major Russian soldier and/or mob character from every movie in the last 20 years, rolled them up in a carpet, beat them with tire irons so they mushed into one person, and then set it loose to scare the villagers.  Always had a smile when Antony shouldered his way through the doors.  (His story is pretty awesome as well, but it would make this post far too long, I'll write it in the comments)

Anyway, one day I'm dealing with a rather difficult customer, whom we'll call....Todd.  Never met a Todd that I've ever liked.  Anyway, egos and attitudes abound in music, and Todd was REALLY not interested in hearing what some 19-year-old with spiky hair and a club shirt embroidered with flames had to say (didn't matter than I knew about 5 times what he did, and his knowledge was 20 years out of date).  He was ranting and raving at me, and starting to make a bit of a scene.

In walks Antony.  He instantly sees this burnt-out ex-rocker (who really should put down the guitar and pick up a can of Ensure) chewing me out, and glides over behind him.  Have you ever seen a man who's the size of two normal men glide?  It's impressive.  He slides in just as Todd makes a rather vulgar and insulting remark.  Antony raises a massive paw and places it on Todd's shoulder, running his voice down into a low baritone and making his accent even thicker.  Think the Ivan guy from Boondock Saints:

""You are yelling at my friend.  There is problem?  Why are you yelling at my friend?""

And then Antony smiled.  Not a friendly, I'm-glad-to-see-you-we-should-drink-vodka kind of way, but in the way that a predator smiles when he's run his quarry to ground and is about to go in for the kill.

Now, I've seen people get scared before.  I've seen them become fearful of other people, of situations, of events, even of stuff that doesn't actually exist.  But the way that Todd went from full bluster to a quivering, pale, meek little mouse of a man was so instantaneous I thought for a moment Antony may have access to some weird Russian teleportation technology and had just swapped Todd with a clone from somewhere in Siberia.

Todd pulled back like a cobra had just latched on to him, and scampered from the store.  Antony looked over his shoulder at the quickly retreating form, and simply remarked, ""I do not think he will be problem anymore.  You have bronze Mandolin strings for me, yes?""  And I laughed, I laughed very hard.  So did Antony.  Other customers looked over at us nervously, because if there is anything scarier than a big Russian laughing, it's a big Russian when he stops laughing, and they all wanted to know when to duck.  Todd was never seen again, which didn't bother me too much because he was a cheapskate who never bought much and haggled like an asshole.

This guy came in one time when I was bagging groceries.  He kinda looked like [Brian Posehn](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0692634/?ref_=tt_cl_t3)

He was nice enough, but he kept slapping the air around him, and yelling at his shopping cart (he was alone).

After a long conversation with the air, he finally comes up to the line next to me.  After placing a box of mints on the belt he starts yelling,

""NO, YOU'RE NOT GETTING THOSE!!!,"" Slaps his own hand and puts the mints back.

I immediately move over to this line and start bagging his groceries for him.

The next 5 minutes were an argument with an invisible person about not needing certain items, why he can't buy such and such, and who should pay for the groceries this time.  He pointed out several times that ""I PAID LAST TIME!!! YOU'RE SO CHEAP!!!""

He finally, grudgingly, used his card to pay.  The cashier suddenly leaves the register and pretty much everyone else it avoiding eye contact with him.  At this point, I want this guy to stay forever.  I offer to help him to his car with his groceries.  He immediately says,

""Sure.... OH SHUT UP, HE'S JUST TRYING TO BE HELPFUL!""

I walk him to his car.  The whole time, he's still screaming at this invisible person.  It was like watching an old Jewish couple fight, and I couldn't get enough of it.

We reach his car, where he is quite for about 2 minutes while I place his groceries in his trunk.  He thanks me and then turns around and starts screaming,

""NO, YOU CAN'T DRIVE, IT'S MY CAR!""

This conversation lasts for about a minute before he gets into the passenger seat, throws the keys on the driver's seat, and sits there....  for a full five minutes, screaming and waving his arms the whole time.

I had to go back inside, but one of the other baggers told me that he eventually got out and moved to the drivers seat, complaining the whole time about how this invisible person was intolerable.

As the girl went to call electronics our assistant manager walked by and said he would check it instead.  

He takes the camera out to look at it and the male starts going on about how they had bought it for their wedding but ended up not using it and how they had just got back from their honeymoon which is why they were just getting around to returning it now.  He repeated his spiel several times.

My manager puts the camera in the box and hands it back to them.  ""I was going to do the return for you but you lied to me.  Next time you try to return a camera, make sure you take the tape out.""  They looked totally shocked but left without a fuss.

Here we go.Last night at the beautiful Schmee-Schmobile cell phone store where I work, a lady came in with her three children. While the eldest (around age 11) looked at cell phones, the younger two, (age seven and four) played on the pink spinning chairs near our front door. After about 15 minutes, while Mom is ignoring her kids, talking to one of my co-workers, I hear a shrill scream-cry from the spinning chairs. The four-year-old had spun the chair too quickly, fallen off of it, and hit her head on the corner of a coffee table. Well, the back of her head is bleeding from a three-inch gash.

You don't go from arrest to trial that fast.",SweetGoat,398,93,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/181a1u/the_update_portion_of_yall_dont_yell_at_my_kids/,"To start with, procedures differ by county and state, but so much of this is just wrong that it screams fake.

* #1. In the original post, u/PardayTarday, indicated that, ""As of today (Friday, 25 January) - the police arrested the three boys, they pleaded not guilty, and we're going to court.""

And then on February 5th he posts that the week long trial is already finished, this is 11 days after the supposed arrest date. Cases do not go to trials anywhere near fast. It's not clear if the supposed trial started on Monday, January 28th or Tuesday, January 29th, but either way, it would not have been in trial 3 or 4 days after the arrest date. This alone indicates fake.

* #2. Where I am, the State Attorney is supposed to try the case with 90 days of the arrest for misdemeanor offenses and 180 days for felonies. This is referred to as Speedy Trial (this can be waived by the defendant if they need more time, but the Public Defender's office hardly ever waives speedy trial).

A much more likely set of events is that you are arrested and you go before a Judge for preliminary proceedings (aka first appearance court for adults or detention hearings for juveniles). This is supposed to happen within 24 hours of your arrest. Bond is set or you are released and you are given a new court date. At that new court date, which is usually at least a week later, if not a month, you have your 
arraignment. There, the division Judge that will be trying the case will read the charges against you, if the State Attorney has filed the charges. If the charges have not yet been filed, arraignment is reset for yet another court date a couple weeks later.

Once you've entered your plea, not guilty in this story, the case would be set for trial. Again, this would be set out far enough that both sides would have time to do subpoenas, etc. Often the lawyers want another date in the interim (a status conference or disposition date) so that they have time to do depositions with witnesses, gather evidence, etc, before they decide if they want to go to trial. But we are talking about trial most likely set out a couple months after the date of arrest.

The only reason a case would go to trial in 3 to 4 days was if the case was running into speedy trial issues and the defense did not want to waive speedy trial. But again, speedy trial in my area is 90 days from the date of arrest for misdemeanors. Fake fake.

* #3. A week long trial, for misdemeanor charges? Really unlikely this would happen. A complicated felony case? Sure, a week is possible, but exceedingly unlikely for misdemeanors. Likely fake.

* #4. u/PardayTarday talks about how he was a witness and what the other witnesses testified to. Even the most inexperienced defense lawyer would invoke the Rule of Sequestration, where witnesses are not allowed to be in the court room or talk to each other about the trial while it is going on. Afterwards, yes they could talk, but he would not have been in the court room. Fake.

* #5. He talks about people from ""Sprawl Mart"" testifying. Unless they had been in the store and witnessed the event, they would not have been allowed to testify. Only people related to THIS case would be testifying. Towards the end he also talks about teachers and a warden as character witnesses for the juveniles, they would not be heard during the trial. The Judge would talk to them before sentencing, if he/she wanted to. Fake.

* #6. The charges: ""found guilty of these charges: 1) Indecent Exposure 2) Property Damage 3) Simple Assault."" Property Damage isn't a charge. It would be something like Criminal Mischief and a degree. Example, Second Degree Criminal Mischief is up to $300 property damage that was willfully and maliciously inflicted. Simple Assault, not a thing. This would be some type of Battery charge. This doesn't make sense. Fake.

* #7. The sentence, ""two years each in jail - but not juvenile!"" doesn't fly. Misdemeanors are punishable by up to 364 days in the county jail for adults where I am. It would be possible that they would be sentenced to serve consecutive sentences, but highly unlikely. Usually you get concurrent sentences. Also the jail time... juveniles would be placed into a commitment program, but not jail, unless they were tried as adults. Again, unlikely for these charges. Fake.

* #8. The community service hours. You aren't sentenced to do community service when you are placed in jail. How can you do community service when you are locked up? Community service hours are only given to people who are put on probation. If it was something like 10 days of jail and then probation with community service, yes. But just jail with community service doesn't happen. Fake.

* #9. The crazy mom was supposedly removed and never seen again. If you are a junvenile, you have to have an adult with you. If the juveniles does not have a parent or guardian, they would be assigned whats called a Guardian Ad Litem, which is basically another attorney volunteering their time to watch out for the juvenile's best interests, in lieu of a parent. Likely fake.

1375542826.0,302,self.TalesFromRetail,1jmn8l,I apparently stole a 5-year-old's wallet,hollysglad,369,67,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1jmn8l/i_apparently_stole_a_5yearolds_wallet/,"I used to work in a chain music store at our mall as a third key.  We were one of the more popular stores so it was rare that we weren't busy and it was nice because it made the days go fast even though I loved my job.

It was one of the rare moments during the week in the school season that we hardly had anyone in the store.  I was doing my rounds, fixing the products and doing a quick search for things that looked tampered with when I came across a child's wallet just laying on top of the children's music area.  It had a popular character that loved to explore on it.  I looked inside to see if there was any ID or something that would tell me how to contact anyone that knew the child who owned it.  There was about $75 dollars and a couple of gift cards, but no ID.  So I put it behind the counter in a spot where we could find it but no customer could see it and just come up to claim it without describing it.

Fast forward about an hour and this stocky man in a leather jacket comes up to the register.  I ask him what I could help him with and he tells me that when his family got home they realized their daughter didn't have her wallet so he came back to ask in every store if they had found one.  The right thing to do is to ask the person what the wallet looked like BEFORE saying that one was found.  He described it, money and all.  So I took the wallet out from it's hiding spot and handed it to him.  He looked through it, profusely thanked me and went on his merry way.  Everything was hunkey dorey.

Wrong.  The next day I walk in for an evening shift and my manager tells me that a woman, her boyfriend and daughter came in looking for a wallet that the daughter lost the day before.  He didn't see one in the hiding place so he told them that we didn't find any and apologized.  I explained to him what happened the day before.  He asked me what the guy looked like that claimed the wallet and, wow, what a coincidence, it fits the description of the boyfriend that came in with the woman and daughter.

We threw around ideas of what to do.  Should we call the police?  No, because we didn't have any proof.  Should we call the family and tell them?  Well, we didn't have their names, or their phone numbers so that wouldn't work.  So we just figured that it was out of our hands because I did  the right thing.

A few days later I come in and there is a police officer at our counter (not a mall cop).  Not unusual because they like to come in on their breaks once in a while to buy a few things since they patrol the area around the mall pretty often.  But he wasn't on break, he was looking for me.

He got a call from a very angry woman a couple days ago telling him that the woman at the music store stole her 5-year-old's wallet.  She gave him my name and even a description.  This made everything on my side even better because my manager didn't give the woman my name when she came him with her boyfriend and daughter.  He just told her no wallet was found and that was that.

The officer and I went to the back room to talk about what happened.  He agreed that the whole thing just made no sense.  And we even wondered who would let their kid that young carry around that much money without worrying about them misplacing it?  He told me that I wasn't in trouble and I did what I was supposed to do.  The woman was going to be called back and explained what I told him.
I wish I knew what happened after he left.  That was the last I heard of it all and I never saw the couple and daughter again.

There were a few printing/copying places in the general area, back before people could easily access any kind of digital information on a device in their pocket and actually relied on the printed word.

One afternoon a man came in to pick up a print job his wife had left with us in the morning and paid for in advance. He gave us his name and her name and we attempted to locate his print job. Unfortunately, there was no trace of it. The name wasn't in the system. There was no trace of the job anywhere. Now sometimes jobs didn't get completed properly or on time but for there to be *nothing* was bizarre.

We started turning the place upside-down, checking and rechecking every job to make sure it hadn't been misfiled or mislabelled, everyone was in a frenzy of activity while the shift leader called the morning shift leader to see if they had any idea what had happened.

The customer was standing placidly at the counter while we searched, looking around the store. He looked at the brightly lit neon signage. The large banner displays showing off our oversize printing services. The logos on the shirts of the team members. You could almost see the wheels in his head come to a stop with an audible crunch as he looked levelly at the girl behind the counter and said accusingly: ""this isn't Kwik Kopy!""

It sucked because people would always go to Chipotle and order food then come to eat it at our restaurant. Many of them figured it was alright because one person in their twelve person group had ordered a small salad from us and we don't mind cleaning up their shit. Of course, our managers wouldn't let us tell them to GTFO or ask them to not leave their trash. 

But, we eventually started going down the passive aggressive route. This meant being welcoming and chatty with the people who ordered from us and ignoring those who didn't.  Many of them caught on to what was going on. However, we had one horrible ""customer"" (meaning no one ever saw her buy anything) who did not understand our issue with her.  
We liked to call her the Chipotle Cunt (or CC for short) because she would go to Chipotle almost daily and eat it at our restaurant. Half the time it was alone, too.  It got to the point she would ask us for a to-go box or napkins and we would just flat-out ignore her because that's what the managers would allow us to do.  
Shortly after I had quit working at that restaurant, I was walking around the local mall and I see CC. She recognized me and then decided to come up to me.   

CC: You're the guy who used to work at the burger place, right?

Me: Umm, yea? 

CC: I haven't seen you in there for awhile, did they finally fire you after I complained about you? 

Me: No, I quit on my own awhile ago..... (I'm confused as to why she is talking to me about this)

CC: Well, I hate going there because of you and the rest of the staff there. They are horrible at customer service.

At this point, I was furious and let out months of frustration out. 

Me: It's probably because you were never a customer. You never bought from us, you just ate your Chipotle in OUR restaurant and always tried to demand service.  

CC: That doesn't matter and I totally bought food from you all the time! Maybe I just won't give you guys my business anymore!
 
Me: I think everyone there would be fine with that.

She then proceeds to huff and puff and storms off.  The last I heard from a friend who worked there, she didn't show up anymore. ",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_14yfda,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/14yfda/the_chipotle_cunt/,

",WinnifredBurkle,346,42,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/192hoi/stop_right_there_you_ticket_thieves/,"Hello again! It's been a little bit but after being complimented on my TFR stories on a comment of mine on /r/cringepics, I thought I'd share another story from my wonderful retail past.

So if you've happened upon my other stories you already know that I spent about five years working at a kids play place/pizza restaurant/arcade that was not a national chain but a *lot* like it. Mostly it was awesome, I had a badass boss and all of my friends worked there. Sometimes there were crazies (and poop) but I still had fun. This particular story was pretty funny, not really rage inducing or anything, just some sweet sweet justice. 

So on the weekends, we would have quite a few older kids come in to play putt-putt and mess around in the arcade. One night we had two fine upstanding young citizens (read: hooligans) come in and drop about ten bucks on tokens. Tokens are $.25 a piece, so they got 20 between them. Plenty of tokens to get some sweet ticket action (if you know how to play the high payout games) and win some king-sized candy or something. 

So they head out to the game floor and I go about my business of helping other kids redeem tickets. About fifteen minutes later, teenage douchebags #1 and #2 come back with an *assload* of tickets. Way more than ten dollars in tokens can get you. I get suspicious, since they didn't come in carrying tickets, and it was impossible that they'd won that many in such a short amount of time. 

I'm the first one behind the counter free, so they bring their tickets to me to run through the ticket counter. As I'm feeding the tickets through, I realize that they're folded up extremely neatly, just like we fold them to get them inside the games. Then I notice that they're missing the small bumps that every game on the floor punches into tickets as they are dispensed. These tickets are smooth as could be, meaning that a game didn't spit them out as winnings and that somewhere, a game cabinet was empty. 

I discreetly send a coworker out to check the game floor, and sure enough, we've got an empty and unlocked game. These little thieves are looking like the cat that caught the canary. They thought they were soooo smart. 

Now, I should interject that we had some pretty expensive prizes. Bikes, skateboards, huge high-quality stuffed animals, board game sets, and so on. We even had some electronics. They cost a bajillion tickets because they were much more expensive to buy than the shitty sunglasses and such that were 25 tickets or what have you. An these kids were *definitely* old enough to understand that stealing something like that from Wal-Mart or somewhere would land them in trouble. But here they were, using stolen tickets to try and scam us out of an expensive prize. 

Anyway, I finish running their tickets through. They easily had well into the thousands, plus they mentioned they had a ticket bank on file with us. I nod and say that I can look it up, but they can't use the tickets they just brought up. 

Douche 1: We won those. You *have* to use them.

Me: Okay, but what game did you win them on?

D 1: Uhhh...

D 2:  The one where you hit the moles with the rubber hammer thing. 

Me: Guys, that game doesn't even hold this amount of tickets. Come on, tell the truth. I *know* you stole them. 

I proceed to explain about the bumps and how we found an empty cabinet, and they give me a deer in headlights look. I'm about to have them come sit in the back room so we can call their parents when those kids fucking *bolt*. They're almost to the door and I'm thinking its a lost cause when someone shouts:

""HEY. Stop right there, *ticket thieves*!""
 
This damn voice was commanding; it stops those kids dead in their tracks. A dad who'd been standing near them during our exchange was marching towards them, saying that he was police and that we could absolutely press charges against them. He made them park their stealing asses on a bench while we called their parents to come pick them up. He made them apologize to all of us and tell their parents what they'd been caught doing. I would *not* have wanted to be either of those kids when their pissed off parents got them home. 

Finally things settled down and the dad came back to finish helping his daughter pick out prizes. I said, ""thank you, officer. You were a big help.""

Police dad looked up at me, smiled, and said, ""don't tell, but I'm not really police. I just didn't want those shits to get away with it."" He gathered up his kids toys and disappeared into the crowd on the game floor, the hero our little world of fun didn't need, but *deserved*. 

And before you give me shit for it, *yes* I know that guy was in the wrong to pretend to be police. I didn't tell, so you guys don't either.

I work in a c-store and am apparently quite the asshole magnet, since this is what every shift entails at one point of the day.

For some reason, something that happened a few years ago just popped up in my head.  I remember that, at the time, I was internally livid with this person, and I guess I never shook it off.

This little rant of mine is practically a how to guide of successfully wiping someone's ass, and getting paid minimum wage to do it.

Those of you working a retail location with a lottery machine will understand the stress of performing such transactions.  This transaction, however, has nothing to do with the fact that the name of the game is not ""The Big One"", or ""Tuesday's drawing"", nor is it ""The One for a Buck.""  

This has everything to do with manners.

Customer comes up while talking on his bluetooth, and holding his hand up, seemingly biding my silence as he finishes up his call.  He then asks, word for word, for a ""quick pick power play.""  Fantastic, someone knows what it's called, and I don't have to list off the other 4 games that are drawing that evening.

I said ""sure thing.""  Printing his ticket and walking back to the register, I was amazed that he didn't follow me down the counter where the lottery machine was.  Normally it's like there is an invisible leash I am holding and the customer has to follow me everywhere, not understanding that what they want, is usually never in arms reach, and I must retrieve it.

""That will be $2.""  He hands me a $20.  I ring it through and count his change back to him and i turn the bills so he can grab them with ease.  I then thanked him for stopping in, and wished him good luck on his ticket.  He says nothing.  I say nothing.  He just stares at me.

Confused, I asked if there was something else I could get for him.  He let out a large sigh and said, ""I guess not.  ASKING you to pick the ticket up and handing it to me would defeat the purpose.""  I look down, the ticket is on his side of the counter, literally 3 inches away from his hand.

""You are clearly new at this, so maybe one day you will learn your place and develop some manners.""  

Without missing a beat, I then reach across the counter and pick up the ticket.  I walk it over to the lottery terminal and grab a player sleeve (lottery envelope), and slide the ticket in there.  I walk back to my register, grabbing a plastic bag on my way and push the receipt button on my register.  I place both the player sleeve with the lottery ticket, and the receipt into the bag and ask if he would like me to walk it out to the car for him.

He snatches it out of my hand and storms out, with me thanking him for shopping and to come back and see us, on his way out.

(kinda NSFW, and long)",Lydious,352,52,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1adz9y/just_one_of_my_many_bosses_from_hell_kinda_nsfw/,"Back on 2007, I worked very briefly in a certain black &amp; yellow cell phone store. Things started out great, boss was cool at first, but I began to notice little red flags here &amp; there. After a week he started making me park half a mile away in the ""employee parking"" at the end of the strip mall while he himself continued to park right in front of the store(didn't give me an explanation why either). There was one other girl that worked there, and she &amp; I always had to deal with the customers &amp; do all the work while the boss &amp; the other male employee hung out in the back ""taking inventory""(AKA smoking or watching TV) or went to sporting events during company hours. 

One of my training questions when I first started was along the lines of ""what kind of phone should you sell to a senior citizen?"". I answered sensibly that I would probably set them up with something basic &amp; easy to use, with big buttons &amp; a simple interface. Wrong! I was to push high end smartphones on ALL customers whether it was what they wanted or not. Needless to say, we had an astronomically high return rate. And here's the kicker- every return &amp; exchange cost HIM money, yet he refused to actually work with the customer's needs in order to reduce returns(and of course, he constantly bitched about money). 

He was so anti-customer it wasn't even funny. People that came in that didn't spend much money or sign new contracts were all but told to leave. One guy came in with a defective battery, REALLY nice guy too, and we didn't have the battery in stock. I offered to order it for him but since it was like $60 &amp; would take several weeks to come in, he declined &amp; said he had an old phone at home he could use instead. I suggested that he look on ebay to find it cheaper, and he was delighted with that suggestion &amp; I felt good for actually helping someone. But then I got chewed out for ""losing a sale"". Gee, just trying to help someone but fuck me, right?!

He was one of the greediest people I've ever met. He marked up the accessories through the roof, and then bitch cause nobody ever bought them. Well duh, nobody's gonna pay $60 for a crappy wired headset that they can get at Walmart for $15!

There was more general stupidity, but then the creepy sexual stuff started. The boss was Muslim &amp; claimed to be celibate, but he would make little comments to me like ""We should run away together!"", and talk about how his ex-girlfriends would give him head in public. Uhh, didn't need to hear about that, but good for you...? One day when the male employee walked in, out of absolutely NOWHERE the boss blurted out, ""Hey so &amp; so, you should go eat her out cause she's sexually frustrated!"", pointing at me.

This was a casual work environment, but jesus christ. The male employee tittered nervously &amp; changed the subject, and I was too stunned to even react. Normally I would have sprinted to HR &amp; filed a report over something like that, but this was an independent shop, owned completely by the boss &amp; his father. I knew if I went to his father he'd undoubtedly take his son's side so I didn't even bother, plus I didn't like the idea of talking about such things to a humorless, 60-something, ultra-conservative Muslim man. Not that he was a mean guy or anything, but it would have been horrifyingly uncomfortable. 

The final straw came one night when he &amp; I were the only ones in the store. He came waddling out from the back &amp; informed me that I would be in charge of the store for a couple hours because he had to go take a shower &amp; get ready for a ""meeting"" (which was actually a **date** that he had made with one of the female customers a few days earlier). OK fine, whatever. I knew how to activate phones &amp; sell stuff well enough to handle the store for an hour or 2 &amp; it'd be nice to be rid of him for a while. Only he didn't come back after a couple hours.

He left around 4, the store closed at 9, and at 8:45 he was still gone. I had no store keys, no alarm codes, no way to lock up or secure the place  whatsoever. He wasn't answering his phone either. Did he expect me to just hang out there all night?! There was literally a line of angry people all demanding to speak to someone in charge(DoucheBoss had left me alone with almost no stock of phones on the ONE night when everybody wanted a new phone &amp; I had none to sell), and I was panicking &amp; near tears by the end of the night. I had been there only *three weeks* at that point. 

I ended up calling the other girl that worked there and thankfully she had keys &amp; could come rescue me. She arrived shortly, and we locked up &amp; went home. I gave her a hug, thanked her profusely, and told her to tell Asshole that he would never see me again in his lifetime. 

It felt so damn good to walk out &amp; leave that assmunch hanging. This happened on a friday night, and he had to run the shop alone all weekend(and do actual WORK, omg!) cause I had been the only person scheduled to work :D

So I call a manager to ask about the coupon and she says she doesn't know what I am talking about. She and another manager come upstairs to my department to find out what is going on. I explain to them that we had a coupon specifically for the children's department because there was an error in the system. The two managers proceed to argue with me and tell me that I am wrong. So I pointed out all of the signs in the department that say the customer gets an extra percentage off for using their card and ask if I need to take the signs down if that's not true. 

The whole time, my customers are standing at the register patiently waiting while these two managers are yelling at me and telling me that I don't know what I am talking about and that I am lying about the coupon. I tell them that no matter what I have to give the discount to the ladies because of the signs and I go ahead and continue to manually put in the discount for the customer. As I am doing this, the two managers are still arguing and I am ignoring them and speaking with the customers. 

My department manager and her new assistant come upstairs at this time and are trying to figure out what is going on. I explain it to them and then its the managers battling it out while I finish up the transaction. The whole time I've kept my cool and the customers tell me that I handled the whole thing really well and said they were sorry I had to deal with those managers. 

After they left, my manager is still trying to figure out what happened and as I am speaking, the other two managers are still yelling and arguing about how I am wrong until my manager tells them that they are the ones that are wrong. She also tells them that they all were there for the store meeting for the managers explaining the coupon the week before. When the two managers realized they were wrong, they left and went back downstairs. 
Victory was mine. 

My manager immediately goes to the store manager and I am called in to tell him my side of the story. Both managers were written up and wouldn't speak to me for months until one got fired for stealing and the other became my new manager and had to. 
It is sad how even when those managers were wrong, they wouldn't admit it and ended up looking like complete idiots. They never questioned what I said again though.

Whether it’s calling a product by a wrong name, thinking that they know more than I do, or simply just being a cotton headed ninny muffin.  Now, I’m not going to claim that I know everything or that I am never wrong, but I will always listen to someone who knows what they are talking about. My boss, on the other hand, is the complete opposite, but that’s another story for another time. What follows is a collection of stories of ignorance and stupidity that has stuck with me in my 3 years at Crappy Electronics store. 



**That thing got a HEMI?**

It’s a normal day with normal customers. Nothing out of the ordinary to report. People are browsing our overpriced crap. I’m ringing up their overpriced crap. I finish my current transaction and head onto the sales floor in search of a customer who needs my help and knowledge. The first person I come in contact with can only be described as Bilbo Baggins-esque. The Lord of the Rings Bilbo, not The Hobbit Bilbo. Old, short, grey hair, a burning passion for The One Ring. You know, the usual. I approach Bilbo and ask him if I can assist him on his journey.

Me: Hello, what can I help you with, sir?

Bilbo: HEMI. (He said without making eye contact or greeting me in any way. I do around 40 transactions a day on the register and probably speak to twice that many people. 90% of them are nice and pleasant. They treat me like an actual human being instead of a service droid. Bilbo was part of the 10%. The 10% that think just because I wear a zazzy uniform and a name tag that I won’t choke a bitch.)

Me: HEMI? Like… a truck? What’s it for? (I was confused. More confused than the time I watched Prometheus aka The Girl with a Dragon in Her Cooch*.)

Bilbo: TV. (Bilbo only speaks one word at a time. He must have had a rough time in Valinor. With the second word I realize what Bilbo is after, an HDMI cable. I guess it’s a simple mistake. ‘E’ is the letter after ‘D’, after all. I will correct his simple mistake and we will carry on through Middle Earth together.)

Me: Oh, an H*D*MI cable.

Bilbo: WHATEVER! (He actually yelled at my head. It’s ok to make a mistake and call something by the wrong name, but if you’re going to be a turd burgling ass-dick about it when someone politely corrects you then there’s no hope for you. You should go live in the woods and leave people alone. I should have just told him that we were sold out of HEMI cables and to check back on Friday. And when he came back in on Friday, tell him that we just sold out, but we would be getting another shipment on Wednesday. Repeat this until one of us dies. 

Instead, I just laughed at him. I laughed at his ignorance. I laughed at his rudeness. I laughed at his wrinkled, old balls. Then I pictured his wrinkled, old balls and weirded myself out. Father Time is not good to male genitalia.)

Me: Hahahaha! Yeah, we’ve got those. How long did you need it to be?

Bilbo: *mumbles something that I can’t understand* (It kinda sounded like he said, “Bee’s waffles are offensive,” he was probably saying, “These cables are expensive.” Speaking more than one word at a time must have broken his brain.)

Me: Alright, well you let us know if you have any more questions. (Then I danced away like Tom Bombadil)


**tl;dr – Bilbo Douchebaggins, The rudest little Hobbit in the Shire.**

**Boys have a penis. Girls have a vagina.**

A customer levitates into the store. He is the God of Dicks, blessing us lowly mortals with his presence. His dick word is dick law. His dickery knows no bounds. He is known far and wide as the utmost expert in the field of Dicknology. If he were an actor, he would be Lawrence Odickier. If he were a sitcom from the 90’s, he’d be Dickfeld. If he were a standup comic, he’s be Louis D.I.C.K. I’m saying that this particular gentleman is a dick.

Me: Hello. What can do for you?

God of Dicks: Adapter. (I’m sorry, but that is too specific of an answer. You’re going to have to make more vague and generic.)

Me: For what?

God of Dicks: Just show me where the adapters are.  (I’m sorry that I’m inconveniencing you by trying to help you find the exact thing that you drove to the fucking store to get. I apologize for not pointing in a random direction and just saying, “Somewhere over there.” Fuck me for trying to do my job in a professional and timely manner. Maybe I should lie on the floor with some SpongeBob coloring books since I am beneath you, oh great and merciful Dick Lord.)

Me: Half the store is some kind of adapter. You’re gonna need to be more specific.

God of Dicks: *sighs* Male-to-Male coax. (That really must have exhausted you. Here, have a Gatorade and a Cliff Bar while I wrap you in a firefighter’s blanket. Then it clicks. ‘Male-to-Male’? He surely means ‘Female-to-Female’. 10 times out of 10 they mean Female-to-Female.)

Me: What are you trying to do? Couple some coax cables?

God of Dicks: Obviously.

Me: Just regular coax cables?

God of Dicks: Ugh! Yeah! Are there any other kind? Do you have it?

Me: We do. But if you need to connect two coax cables, then you’re going to need a Female-to-Female coupler.

God of Dicks: No. I. Don’t. 

Me: Alright. (I give up. Fuck this guy. I’ll sell him what he asked for. I’m gonna let him drive home, try and connect his wrong ass adapter to his stupid cables, drive back to the store and let him fuck himself.)

I sell him the adapter and he leaves. 30 minutes later he calls the store, probably from his cell phone while he’s driving, eating a burrito, and changing lanes without signaling.

Me: Thank you for calling Crappy Electronics, this is hate_tank. How can I help you?

God of Dicks: This guy sold me the wrong thing! ( I knew who it was, but I was gonna play stupid.)

Me: Oh, I’m sorry. What were you looking to get?

God of Dicks: That guy didn’t know what he was talking about!

Me: What?

God of Dicks: He sold me the wrong thing! (He seems to be having a different conversation than I am. I’m just gonna fuck with him.)

Me: Ohhhhh, reeeaallyyyyy?

God of Dicks: I needed a blah blah blah. ( I stopped listening and started browsing reddit. Wow. Horses can’t throw up. He finishes ejaculating his dick voice into my ear.)

Me: Bring it on in and we’ll get you the right thing.

God of Dicks: Are you gonna be there?

Me: Oh, I will. (He had no idea that I was the one who had dealt with him before.)

I go grab the correct adapter and wait. On this night a god will fall.

A few minutes later our villain returns. He enters the store and one of my associates greets him. I’m about 15 feet away doing fucking whatever, when the Lord of Dickery, The Crown King of Cockery, The Dick of all Dicks, opens his dick mouth and sprays the store with a golden dick shower of lies and dick.

God of Dicks: That guy doesn’t know what he’s talking about! ( He points at me)

Other Associate: I’m sorry. What can I help you with? 

God of Dicks: I need an adapter for two coax cables.

Me: He needs a coupler.

God of Dicks: I’m not talking to you, I’m talking to him. 

Other Associate: Um…

Me: Are you a plumber?

God of Dicks: What?
Me: Plumbers tend to use the opposite terms for adapters and such then.. (He cuts me off.)

God of Dicks: I just need the right thing. (Then he throws the adapter he purchased earlier on the counter.)

Me: Let me finish. Coax cables have male ends. The part you plug it into have female ends. If you want to connect two male pieces together then you need a *female* coupler.

God of Dicks: No. That’s not right. 

I pick up the male-to-male adapter and produce the female-to-female one out of my pocket. I lay them side by side and ask him which one looks like the coax cables. He points to the male-to-male.

Me: Ok, that’s a male end.

God of Dicks: No it’s not!

Me: See that little piece of wire poking out of the middle? That means it’s a male.

God of Dicks: You don’t know anything.

Me: It’s basic biology.

He then looks at me with the most confused look on his face. The look that says, “I just watched a David Lynch film and have no idea what the hell just happened.” He’s still not getting it. So I have to make it as dumb and simple as possible. On simple line can some up everything.

Me: Boys have a penis. Girls have a vagina. (Yeah. That’s right. I quoted Kindergarten Cop. And you know what? It worked. He totally got the reference. We all had a good laugh, he apologized and left in good spirits. Wait. No he didn’t. He actually got offended, as only a dick would. )

God of Dicks: Go get me the manager!  (I smiled. It was actually more of a smirk than a smile. I was about to become a mushroom cloud laying motherfucker, motherfucker.) 

Me: I *am* the manager. You can either take your money and leave *or* you can take the *proper* adapter you need. Your choice. (I told two lies. 1: I wasn’t the manager, but he didn’t know that. 2: He had a third option. The option to fuck himself with a dull circular saw. He stood there with his stupid dick face and thought for a few moments.)

God of Dicks: Gimme the right one.

Me: That’s right, bitch. (I didn’t actually say that.)

God of Dicks: I don’t need this shit! See if I ever shop here again!

Me: I don’t know what we’ll do without you.

So in the end, I showed the world that even a god can bleed. They just won’t ever apologize or fully admit that they are wrong. 

**tl;dr – It’s not a toomah!**



**One Flew Away From the Nonexistent Bird Establishment**

I’m talking to a customer near the front of the store about the differences between Androids and iPhones. It was a nice, normal conversation until the Bird Lady squawked her way into it. She looked like a Pixar character. She was four foot nothing and dressed the way that a stereotypical old lady would dress. Brown old lady jacket. Brown old lady shoes. Big ass old lady sunglasses.  Nothing made her look dangerous, but looks can be very deceiving. I was in the middle of a sentence about how iPhones have more compatible devices when she chirped up.

Bird Lady: Bird store.

I heard her but ignored it. I didn’t know she was actually addressing me. I continue on with my customer.

Bird Lady: Bird. Store. (I’m sorry. That’s the incorrect password. It’s actually ‘Swordfish’. Come back tomorrow and try again.)

My customer and I are probably standing 4 feet away from each other. I’ve got my back leaning up against the tables with all the cell phone displays.  He asks me about battery life, when out of nowhere, the Bird Lady sidles up in between us. Her back is to my customer and she’s facing me. I am suddenly very uncomfortable. Listen lady, this man is not my jilted lover and you are not Steve Wilkos. Give us some space. “Bird store,” she whispers. Fight or flight kicks in. I throw a right elbow at her but she dodges it. She hops back and pulls an Uzi from under her old lady jacket. I immediately start cart wheeling away as bullets strike the cell phone dummies. HTC Evo 4G; destroyed. Samsung Galaxy SIII; demolished. See you in hell, Pantech Revue! I come to a stop near the iPhone cases when I realize that her gun has jammed. I pull the Bowie knife from its sheath on my right ankle and threw it at the Bird Lady. It struck her in the chest, went through her back and pinned her to the cash wrap. She drops the Uzi and slumps down. I turn to the camera, pull the cigar out of my mouth and say, “Someone call a doctor. This lady needs *tweetment.*”

That didn’t happen. I just told her that I had no idea where the Bird Store was. She then coughed on me and then left.

**tl;dr – Just read it. It’s a short one.**

I really like my job, it's a small business and the place is fun.  Sometimes, though, the customers are so annoying I want to run them over in the parking lot.

My story today is about grabby customers.  The candy at my kiosk is stored in bins like [this](http://www.candyconceptsinc.com/assets/images/verticalscoopcandybins.jpg).  And for sanitary reasons, you HAVE to have a glove on when getting candy.  We have tongs, but they are for samples and much harder to use.  Sanitation is very important to us, it's the number one priority above even customer service.  Nobody wants to eat germy candy.  So we have signs that say bare hands in the bins will result in the purchase of the entire bin.  Despite those signs, I still have people reach in on an almost daily basis and take out candy!  

This story is about an older lady who wander into the kiosk.  She was being really rude from the start, walking away from me and asking questions that I couldn't hear, that sort of stuff.  So I'm filling a bag for her and right in front of me she reaches into a bin and takes out a piece.  I stop her and she gives the excuse everyone does, ""oh, I only took one!""  HOLY SHIT do you think I care!  Would you want to eat that candy if someone took a piece?  What if you were with your grandkid and they did that?  You'd slap their hand and say DON'T TOUCH.

I don't understand how they think just because they're an adult they an ask like a child and get away with it.

So I don't have the guts yet to charge people for a whole bin.  This store's only been open for a few months and I'm the only person there.  What I did do was take the top layer of candy that would be thrown away otherwise and stuck that in her bag.  And of course she threw a hissyfit.

""I don't want that candy!  It was stale!""

""Well, you could've have asked to try a piece, since I was right there, and then found out it was stale and not have to buy any of it.""

""I'm going to return it and say it's stale!""

""We don't accept returns so good luck.""

Seriously guys, if you pass a candy bin, don't help yourself to a ""sample"".  Just ask me!  I like giving candy to people!  Some just like the thrill I guess.

Minimum wage and all the movies I could watch made me a douche to rent movies with for the few years following.

There were also many confrontations, and we prided ourselves on the fact that the moment you start ruining the experience for someone else, you were out. My own personal record for throwing someone out was about ten minutes into The Mummy Returns. It was a packed afternoon screening, and lots of young teens were in there.

Just after the start, a girl that couldn't be more than 13 came out of the screen crying, absolutely soaking wet. Turns out it was Pepsi.

A boy behind her had poured his drink over her head. She didn't know the boy and hadn't even made eye contact with him. She was watching the the movie, then ""boom"". 

I grabbed my torch and stomped in with my blood up, but promising my self I would allow him his side of the story too (I've been fooled in the past).The kid was about 16, a chav (British slang) and clearly old enough to know better. He first refused to step out until i explained to him that I could radio the projectionist to pause the movie then announce it would only resume when he stepped out the theatre.

Once outside I explained what I had heard and asked him to explain himself. The young girl at this point had gone to dry herself off in the toilets. The kid looked at me almost confused and said defiantly 

""well, it was funny, innit?""

I stared at the kid for a moment.

""I don't think it's funny. I'm asking you to leave right now. You can obtain a refund from the box office.""

I considered this reasonable as he had only seen about 10 minutes of the movie.

At this point he squared up to me. I was only 19 myself at the time, so this was a little intimidating. What followed next was around a 3 minute rant where he used just about every single swear word he knew about 7 or 8 times, and colorfully described the promiscuity of my immediate family. I was at that point where you are so angry, but so powerless, that I was starting to feel a little light-headed.

Whilst this had been occurring, I was unaware that my manager had come onto the floor and had witnessed the full exchange. As the rant from the boy began, she had walked up beside me and was now glaring at the kid until he finished. 

""Are you done?""

The kid shrugged.

She pulled out her radio and spoke into it. 

""Box Office.White cap. Nicholson T-shirt. Adidas trackies. He's not getting a refund. Okay?""

""Okay""

During this, she had never once broken eye contact with the kid. she addressed him again

""Now get the hell out of my cinema before I have your removed.""

I could see the boy consider arguing, but to be honest the death-stare my manager was pumping out was making even me nervous. The kid stormed out in silence.

Afterwards, my manager congratulated me on keeping my cool (which almost gave me an aneurysm) and then we laughed about some of the more interesting insults the chav had come out.

This group has been doing it for years, and frankly I can't quite understand why they keep attempting it at our location because the same people have worked there for 5+ years, and know every trick they have. We also run a curtailed schedule, which means during the week, we don't run 9/10pm shows. 

On thursday, the phone rings so I pick up the call. 

Me: Thank you for calling Movies at (Location) How can I help you?

Her: Is there a manager I can speak to?

Me: Yes, I am a manager. 

Her: Well I have a problem. I was at your theatre last night at around eight or nine o'clock  with my two friends and while I was in the theatre, there was a group of teenagers talking and being loud. Then, they saw me sitting there and started making fun of me because I am overweight. 

Immediately I can smell the bullshit emanating through the receiver. Not only has this woman tried ticket fishing before, but she used the same exactly story that she did last time. So I take a deep breath and attempt to be cordial.

Me: Ma'am, we're not open at around eight or nine o'clock. Our last show time is at 7:50.   

Her: Well That's the time they made fun of me. 

Me: What movie were you seeing? 

Her: Sinister. 

Me: Hold on just one minute. 

I immediately put her on hold, and pulled up the ticket sales for Sinister for the night before. I has been working then, and knew for a fact that we did not have a group of teenagers in any theatre. I found the sinister showtime for 7:50, and bingo. Only Four tickets were sold. So her story of there being ""A large group of teenagers talking and making fun of her."" is bullshit. 

I picked of the line:

Me: M'am? You were in the 7:50 of Sinister? 

Her: yes. That's the show I saw.

Me: And how many people were with you? 

Her: It was me and my two friends. 

Me: I'm sorry Ma'am, there were only four tickets sold to that feature, so it's not possible that there were teenagers in that film. 

Her: Are you sure? Well then it must have been another one. 

Me: I am looking at the figures right here in front of me. And the one before that, the 6:50, only had 1 ticket sold. 

Her: Well what theatre is this?

Me: This is the Movies at (location) located at (intersection). 

Her: Oh. Well I meant to call (Other location up the road). Bye.

I can't see without my glasses!,CurvedStraightLine,369,70,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1h1epk/my_glasses_i_cant_see_without_my_glasses/,"The store I worked for catered to upperclass women over the age of 45.  Finding reading glasses was a daily experience, so it was no surprise to get a call from a woman saying she had left hers in the store.

I put the woman on hold and check the lost and found.  We put anything found in a manilla envelope, maked the contents and when it was found.  No glasses had been turned in that day, and she had lost them that morning.

I filled the customer in and then put her on hold again, checking all the major spots glasses usually turn up--checkout, fitting room, sitting on the display tables.  No luck.  I had a staff of three, so I told them to be on the lookout for the glasses and to let me know the second any turn up.

Then I speak to the customer, asking for her phone number so we can call them if it turns up.  At this point, she's bitchy, but not over the top yet.

Some time later, I go to fix a basket of scarves that had been messed up.  The glasses were actually underneath the scarves, apparently she had placed them on top, then rifled through the basket, knocking it to the bottom.  I immediately called the woman, and told her that I would put them in the safe for her.

There was a pause, then rage from her end.  Why had it taken two hours to find them?  What had I been doing all that time?  How the heck did I think she could get over there to pick up her glasses?  She lived in &lt;town twenty minutes away&gt;, she can't see without her glasses to drive!  Did I expect her to risk her life to get there?

I apologized, suggested she get a ride, or have someone else pick them up.  Perhaps I could mail them to her?

I was stupid.  An idiot.  How the hell did I work as a manager.  She was BLIND without her glasses.  She was bumping into things around her house.  It was dangerous!  Someone needed to bring her glasses TO her.

Now, the store I worked for was big on going above and beyond for the customer, and I immediately knew (from a previous experience) that I would be expected to do just that.  Actually, our store was insane at the time, although I heard they fixed our policies.

So I went to the two employees left and asked if either felt comfortable driving to this woman's house.  They didn't. Which, to me, was fair.

We also began to look at the glasses.   nNow, my eyes need a horribly strong prescription, and these weren't.  They were the buy at the store reading glasses.  Furthermore, we asked each other, how did she leave the store and get home without noticing she was ""blind"" enough to bump into things?

Of course, we didn't say this to her!

I got back on the phone and told the customer that my employees were unable to drive them to her, but I could.  However, as I was the only manager, I could not leave the premises until after we had finished closing.

Not good enough.  I actually called other managers to see if one could come in.  Of course not.

Finally, the customer gave in and said it was fine that I drive them there.

This was during Christmas season, by the way, and we closed at 10.  By the time customers were out of the store, closing procedures were finished and everything, it was 11.  I got to her house before midnight.

She snatched the glasses out of my hand, and basically slammed the door on me.

The next day, I get a call from the district manager.  I had a customer complaint.  According to it, I had refused to help the customer find their glasses, refused to help them retrieve them, leaving the customer blind.  The customer had injured herself stumbling blind around the house and was considering suing.  Then I didn't show up until 3am, obviously just coming from a party and smelling of alcohol, waking her up and scaring her son.  She had never been so mistreated in her life.

Customer complaints were taken against our overall customer service score.  Meaning I lost my bonus for the month over this bull.

Customers would want to come in and buy a computer and sometimes the first person to catch them would be a female sales person.  Some of the customers (both male and female, surprisingly) would dismiss them and ask to talk to a man.  I'd gladly step in and ask of I could be of assistance.  

When they inevitably asked a ""harder"" question, I'd pause as of to not know the answer, look confused and ask them to wait for one moment while I'd find out for them.

I'd then walk up to the same gal the customer passed over (within sight but not so they could hear if I could help it) and ask them some unrelated question or just talk to them for a few seconds.  I would then go back and relay the answer.  Doing this made them shift very uncomfortably and it was always very satisfying.  Several of the girls were used to me doing this and always play along.

On this particular afternoon I arrived in time to take over for my co-worker, so that she could head home for the day.  

As I approached her I noticed that she was on the phone with a customer, and I managed to catch the middle of her conversation. 

""Oh the Xbox mentioned in the ad? Yeah we have that. Yeah, we have those games....""

I suddenly realize that she is referring to the ad that claimed if the customer purchased an Xbox we would throw in two games for free.  Unfortunately, we no longer had either of those two games in stock.  I try to politely catch my co-worker's attention, so that I can inform her of this. 

Me: ""Umm... Derpette""

Derpette: ""Not now, Retails.""

Me: ""No, Derpette, we don't have the games...."" 

Derpette: *scoffs and turns away*

Me: ""Derpette! We don't have the items mentioned in the ad for the Xbox!""

Derpette: ""Shut up Retails, that isn't what she wants!""  *turns away and picks up the phone again*  ""Yes Ma'am, we absolutely have all of the products mentioned in the ad.  Bye now!"" 

She then quickly hung up, informed me she was off for the day and left. 


Of course, when the customer came in she was livid about us not having the free games.  

My co-worker later denied doing anything wrong.

Long time stalker so I broke down and made an account because my old coworkers and I could write a book. I consider the Library retail's cousin because although we don't ""sell"" anything really, we do still deal with the public in the same way.

Background: I used to work at a Library, first in the Circulation (circ) department then in Tech (public computers) department. I loved and hated my job at times, but I don't miss working with the crazy ass public I was dealing with on a daily basis. My bosses were all pretty cool the majority of the time even if we had to bend over and take it from the public on occasion.

Anyway, this is one of my favorite days.
At the Circ desk we would check out books, returns, make cards etc. This was a terrible stormy day and I was happy to be at a desk away from most of the windows (storms make me nervous) however this is the desk with the most people coming at it. 
I see a man walking toward my desk he's in a black suit jacket, blue sweater and dark jeans. He's handsome in a rugged lumberjack kind of way and he's probably late 30's early 40's and water was dripping dramatically from his tousled hair (I swear I'm not making this up). Since we can't use names let's just call him BW.

Me: ""Welcome to ----------- I'm Awesome, how can I help you?""
BW: ""I'd like to get a library card please.""
Me: ""Sure, I need your state ID/License please.""
BW: ""Here you go Miss Awesome."" *hands me ID*

At this point I look at his name and search the system to see if he has a card. Then I do a double take at his name and get this ridiculous smile on my face and look up at him.

Me: ""Please tell me this is your real name....?""
BW: ""It is.""
Me: *Huge Smile*
BW: ""Go on, you know you want to.""
Me: ""Are you Batman?""
BW's answer? ""Yes, I am. Shhhhh."" 

After I gave him is card he winked at me and walked out. I still hold to the fact that I made Batman a library card.

This was a standard night shift, not really that busy at this point but enough toys, dog toys and clothes on the floor that I desperately needed a liquid vixen to calm my nerves. While I am hanging discarded skins from the Valkyries of the discount racks, a very sweet older woman walked up to me. She stood out a bit because she was dressed in one of those pink church suits and had a matching hat with a massive, fake lilly on it. 


She hangs up her things, we converse and I send her on back, thanking the gods that she was at least nice. I turn back to my Stygian ritual and, without warning, I feel my breasts being squeezed. 


Now...this is a horribly relevant fact but I am a curvy lass and my girls are triple D nightmares. It is not something I enjoy but they are there, consistently blocking my feet from view. 


Anywho, I turn and look, too stunned to roar or even grab for the box cutter and there is my bonny little Steel Magnolia, still groping. She sweetly smiles and says, ""Oh, honey, you are just getting no support here!"" 


Me: ಠ_ಠ ""Indeed...I am wearing a sports bra..."" 
Her: ""Well, let me give you my card. I do custom fittings you see-""

A very pleasant guy came in today to buy an iPhone 5. We discussed options, ended up selling him a 32GB, as well as a case, Applecare, and a screen protector. 

Bill came up to $500.58. He thought I said ""$558.00"", so he took out 6 $100 bills to pay. I corrected myself and said:

*""Oh it's only $500.58, sorry about that. I didn't phrase that very clearly.""*

We laugh, no biggie, re-counts his cash, hands me 5 $100s, 2 quarters and a dime.

We finish the transaction, turn on his iPhone, he's happy, he leaves, alls well.

I take a phone call about an hour later in the day. Just a basic question, I answer it and hang up.

**A HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL.**

Well shit.

I do some double checking, just to make sure we hadn't been short $100 at some point. Nothing. This is DEFINITELY the customer's cash.

I call him up, he's ECSTATIC, as he had no clue where it had gone to.

He's comes in a half an hour later to pick it up. He's super appreciative and happy. I noticed he had an LCBO bag with him. He pulls out a six pack of Corona and plops it on the desk.

We didn't do most of the framing in-house (our shop was tiny), but there were some things we could do ourselves. Over time we were slowly restricted on what kind of things we were able to do in-house (mostly because of the economy sucking and us not being able to afford to have more than one framer on duty at a time, which not only made it impossible to *do* the extra things in-house, but also train the constant stream of new employees how to do them).

Anyhow, this story takes place after I had only been working in that department for a few months. Because of this, I hadn't been trained on a few of the more complicated things, like using the drymounter, or stretching a canvas. I knew how to do it in theory (so I could explain it to do-it-yourselfers), but in-house we had to use a motorized staple gun (kind of like a nail gun, but with staples) that was very noisy and tempermental. I hadn't been shown how to use it yet, but we hardly ever had to stretch a canvas in-house anyway because most people who buy un-stretched canvases want a frame (so it is sent to our framing facility) or were artists who wanted to do it themselves to save money.

It was 3 days before Christmas. The framing manager told me that I could do in-house jobs (like cutting mats, simple mountings, and glass cuts) at my discretion. However, I could not take any in-house jobs for things I couldn't do, because she had to finish up the Christmas-rush orders the next day and wouldn't be in on Christmas eve. If I took the job, I had to do it myself. Fortunately, I only had one drop-in-the-frame-job which took all of ten minutes, so for the rest of my shift I helped out with the Christmas madness (as well as doing pick ups and taking non-Christmas orders of course). 

10 minutes before closing I was called to my counter to help a customer. I was thinking that this late at night it HAD to just be a pick-up. Oh how naive I was, I hadn't been working long enough to get many last-minute people at the frame counter (seriously, if you're going to be spending money in custom framing, you don't want to rush through the selection process). 

Customer: I wanted to get this canvas stretched

Me: (mentally sighing) Ok. Let's see how big this is.

C: (pulls out huge canvas) Oh and I need this by Christmas.

M: I'm sorry, but we can't do any more orders of this nature before Christmas, we won't have time to complete it.

C: What do you mean?! Christmas is 3 days away! (Well, by this point it's more like 2 days away lady)

M: I know, but we are finishing up the frames for customers who placed their Christmas orders before the deadline. We are obligated to make sure they are completed before we can take new orders.

C: I don't believe this, the guy I talked to on the phone said I could bring it in and you would do it!

M: I'm sorry, but there are no men in our framing department, do you remember who you talked to?

C: Well then, it was a manager! (Note: none of our managers or supervisors would have told her this. They always transferred framing questions to our department. Even if the framer was on lunch, they would have taken her number and have the framer call back).

M: Do you know the manager's name? (So I can chew them out later for putting me in this situation...)

C: No, but it was a man!

M: We have 2 male managers and several male supervisors that can act as managers, so I'm not sure who you talked to. Unfortunately, they made a mistake, this is not an order we can take and have in time for Christmas. 

C: *starts screaming incoherently, snatches her canvas from the counter and storms off*

M: *completely bewildered*

(Also I did leave the name of the store but they are out of business now, so?)

**The Idiot:**

A few years back, I was working for Gottschalk's before they closed. I worked in the back side of the store, in the Children's Section and Intimate Apparel. Once I was next to my register, organizing panties or something, when a woman walks up and asks me to ring her up. I walk over and begin scanning her items when her son wanders off towards the expensive leather jackets in the women's section on the other side of my register.

The woman is paying absolutely ZERO attention to her son, even has her back to him. As I am still ringing up her massive amount of items, her son climbs up into the middle of the coat rack. He grabs on to the metal bars on top, and begins swinging back and forth screaming 'IMMA CHIMPANZEE IMMA CHIMP...'
Of course, the rack tumbles over on it's side... causing a freaking chain reaction that sends ALL of the coat racks crashing to the ground.
I run over, pull her son out of the middle of the collapsed rack, make sure he's okay, and attempt to get the (FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH) coats off the ground.

The lady (still at the register, she didn't even bother checking to see if her kid was okay) suddenly shouts 'EXCUSE THE FUCK OUTTA ME. YOU WANNA FINISH RINGING UP MY FUCKING ITEMS?'
Flabbergasted, I stare at her in shock, the carnage of her son's exploits all over the ground behind me.
And then yeah. I rang that bitch up. FML.

**The Asshole:**

I had a guy come in with a bag of items he wanted to return one day. He pulled them out, and although yes, they were in fact from our store, they had OBVIOUSLY been worn, washed, worn again for a couple months. They had bleach stains all over them and reeked of cigarettes (I had just gotten in from a smoke break and the smell made me take a physical step back).

I said I would have to get the manager's approval and called her over. She hemmed and hawed for a bit then decided we could only do store credit (when we pointed out the bleach stains he said ""well that's why I'm returning them! I don't even own bleach!"" ...bullshit).
Finally he picked out his new items and came back to me for the exchange. Mind you, this entire time, I watching his wife walk around with a baby stroller... and her two children, both way too old to need one. Stealing, much? I ring up the items and hand them over... at which point he leans over and whispers ""It's a good thing this all worked out... I would hate to have gotten... upset."" and pulls out a giant freaking knife.

I back up, surprised, and he slowly reaches down, staring me straight in the eye the whole time, and cuts the tags off his new clothes. When he was done, he pocketed the knife, went and got his family from... the dressing room (which really, they had no reason other than the fact they were stealing from us to be in there).
As soon as he left I went straight to my manager and she assured me that, in the future, I have every right to just walk (or run screaming) away.

After that, I went to security, had him review the tape and determine that the knife was, in fact, way bigger than the legal limit, and that he did in fact steal a whole BUNCH of shit from us.
About a month later I was across the street on my lunch break when, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted them walking back in to the store. I immediately called security, and got to watch, gleefully, as the asshole was gracefully tackled right in front of his wife and kids about 30 seconds after walking through the door.

I raced here as quick as I could so I could share my experience.

I work part time for a British based pub franchise know as something similar to the red queen.

Today we had a group of people in we'll call meat heads. Meat heads look as if they've come from 6 years in the gym.

To begin with there all relatively polite, they're not very talkative but they say please and thank you. About an hour in I noticed meat head#1 getting a lot of stick from the other dudes in his little girl brigade. He's drunk and getting abused by his pals.

They carry on drinking and Meat head #1 is getting drunker and more volatile as the minutes pass by.

Around 3 hours after they arrived meat head #1 is ruined. He comes to the bar to ask for a drink. I politely refused him and explained I could be fired for serving someone alcohol whilst intoxicated. This is where shit starts to go down. Meat Head #1 starts ranting and raving he wants a drink, he's bashing his fists on the counter demanding I serve him. His pals are giving him more abuse. Eventually he gives up and goes to sit down. 3 minutes later meat head #2 comes to the bar and repeats the exact same order meat head #1 relayed to me. I explain I can't serve him because I think the drinks for his friend who is already intoxicated, meat head #2 doesn't look happy but admits the drink is for meat head #1 and maybe he has had too much to drink.

Meat head #2 relays our conversation meat head #1 who comes storming to the bar wanting to know what my fucking problem was? He then goes onto try and humiliate me, he tells me I'm a waste of spunk and I'll amount to nothing serving drinks likes a peasant. He carries on calling me every name under the sun.

I replied, ""I work this job part time on top of web development job. I'm trying to save money to buy my own house so I can move out of rented accommodation. I'd appreciate if you could sit down quietly with your friends or I can call security to remove you from the premises (we have no security)."".

Well, he obviously didn't like this as he started walking to the end of the bar, he was obviously pumped, walking like a monkey, chest pumped out, fists tights.  He gets to the end of the bar and comes behind the bar, straight for me. He gets within 2 feet and swings a punch at me....

Now, I'm a  smoker (what up Ents) not a fighter, I'm a big lad but never really been in a ""serious"" fight but I've got this meat head hulk looking mother fucker swinging for me.

I have absolutely no idea where it came from but I avoid his swing and returned with a blow Hulk Hogan would of been proud of. I dropped this meat head like the sack of shit he is. He's out cold for about 15 seconds, his pals are howling with laughter. I stand above this guy like I'm the king of the world. His eyes open, think marbles in a plastic bag.

He gets up, looks at me, I'm guessing considering having another pop. Turns around and goes to walk off, he falls straight over wiping out a bar top full of dirty glasses.

At this point, my manager appears claiming he saw what happened on CCTV. It's at this point I start thinking shit, what if this falls on me. My manager guesses I'm worrying, tells me to chill, he saw I acted in self defense and besides ""you'll probably kick my ass if I fired you anyway"".

10 Minutes later, the police arrive, ask me if I wish to press charges, like I said smoker not a fighter (CBA with courts and such like) so I declined. He's arrested for breach of the peace and drunk &amp; disorderly anyway.

Needless to say we got our share of asswipes and crazy bitches but being the boss man I had little tolerance for putting up with bullshit. One thing I always told my employees was that if they ever felt like they were being treated less than a human being feel free to refuse service or, if they didn't feel comfortable doing that, get me or the assistant manager and we will gladly handle it. 

Here's a few episodes:

(Keep in mind that my shop was on the first floor of a skyscraper that housed mostly lawyers. Most of them were regulars and were completely professional and polite. They are always the few, though.) It is a busy morning and we are slammed as always. (We were open 6:00am to 5:30pm M-F and served well over 1000 customers a day.) I had a policy that let everyone have a turn at what music to play and one of my employees decided Black Sabbath's first album would be good to get through the madness. I agreed. 

There were a group of lawyers having a meeting. One of them came up, butting in front of everyone in line, to ask if we could turn the music down a little. ""Sure,"" I said. I turned it down a notch and went back to making drinks. 

Five minutes later the same suit penis comes up and says, ""Would you mind changing the music? It is really disruptive.""

""I will change it when I get a chance, sir. As you can see we are busy."" No, I wasn't going to change it. It's Black Sabbath, not fucking Slayer. 

Five minutes later. ""Listen, we are trying to have a meeting here and this, whatever it is, is interfering. I am going to ask this just once more. Please change it.""

""It's Black Sabbath. And I find it odd that you would choose a place to have a very important meeting that is playing Black Sabbath. Not too professional, if you ask me.""

He just stood there, dumbfounded. He turned and walked back to the table. If he had a tail it would've been between his legs. They remained there for 45 more minutes finishing their meeting. 

Another one:

Being in the downtown area we got our share of panhandlers and miscreants. I had a zero tolerance policy for them...though there were always exceptions. (One guy, ""Wheelchair Mike"", was always outside and I would always bring him coffee and talk. In the winter I allowed him to sit in the cafe to warm up a bit. He was always respectful so I had no qualms about helping him as much as I could. He stank sometimes but, meh, I don't care.) The girl running the register came up to me and said that there was a drunk dude saying rude things to all the girls and that they were all starting to feel uncomfortable. 

I walk up and there he is, leaning on the counter. ""Is there something I can help you with?""

""I just wanna know what perfume she is wearing.""

""It's none of your business. I'll tell you what I am wearing, if you want.""

""mumblemumble""

""You have to go.""

""No, I don't.""

""Yes, you do.""

&lt;stands there.&gt;

""I am going to give you to the count of five to make your way to the door. Then I am gonna jump the counter and physically remove you from the store.""

He laughs and then mumbles something else.

I count. I reach five. I jump the counter and grab him by the back of his coat and push him out so hard that he stumbles and lies face down on the sidewalk in front of my shop. I grab his arms and pull him to the corner and leave him, hopefully for dead. 

Never saw him again. 

It has been years since I had that job but I have more stories if anyone is interested. 

**NEW STORY.**

Sorry for the delay but I didn't expect the love, though I appreciate it.

As I stated before I managed two stores in the downtown area. While at the first one I received a call from a ""customer"" that said he bought 50lbs. of coffee for his church and had us grind it for him. I was unaware of this (such a big order would have been brought to my attention) but kept listening. He was ""so embarrassed"" that when he got the coffee there were pieces of foil in it. Now I had helped out on the production line before and knew that it was nearly impossible for such a thing to happen.

""I can gladly get it ready for you tomorrow.""

""No, I'm sorry. That won't do. I have already picked up more coffee from the grocery store and all I am looking for is my money back.""

It seemed shady but I didn't feel like dealing with it. ""Sure. I will be in tomorrow from open to 4pm. Come on by and I will give you the money.""

""Thank you, sir. And god bless.""

Red light. Whenever someone says 'god bless' I distrust them.

He comes in, I give him the money.

Done.

Months later.

I have been transferred to the other store in the downtown area because that manager pretty much fucked the entire operation. I was brought in to bring it back into the black. A few months in...

""I bought a bunch of coffee for my church and had it ground up and there was foil in it.""

Hello, my friend. Obviously he didn't know that I would be at this store.

""I am SO SORRY that happened. Come on in and I'll give you your money back."" He said that he would be in at a certain time. I called the police.

The police and I are shooting the shit for a while and we made up a plan. When he comes in they will act like they just got a call and leave so as to not freak him out. After I stall him a bit they will come back in and detain him (can't arrest him as there is no proof of anything, just run his name through the system).

Here he comes.

I recognized him from before and played it cool. The cops left. The employees were all in on it so they handled it perfectly. One of them came up and knew that I knew so just asked me about nonchalant things. I then approached him.

""Can I help you?""

""Yeah, I may have talked to you on the phone. I had purchased all of that coffee for my church...""

""Oh, yeah, and it had the foil in it.""

""Yeah.""

""And it was really embarrassing...""

""Yeah..., I tell you what...""

""NO...I tell you what...stand here for a sec, no...nevermind. Here they come.""

The cops roll in.

""What is this,"" he asked.

""You may not remember but I helped you with the last time this bullshit incident happened. These boys are just gonna run your name through the system and even if it checks out you are banned from all the businesses in the loop.""

The general, empty comeback arises but to no avail. He had multiple warrants for theft and (!) rape and is carted off. The rape thing kinda shook me, I have to be honest. But I am glad he was taken off the streets.

I was also happy to get the last word in: ""Where's your god now?""

Usually they aren't a problem aside from the occasional drama fest or immature jokes. However we recently got this one boy working the register that just...just...ugh... He is 16 and has been here a few weeks. Let us call him Ray.
 Ray is the slowest cashier we have but insists on working our express lane so he doesn't have to bag a lot of items. Even the 60+ year old women are faster than he is. Every time he works our lines get backed up but our manager, instead of fixing the problem, pulls someone from the office to get on register. So, an area that has at most two people working at a steady pace is reduced to one with two lines of people to take care of because this one guy can't scan a few cans. Not only that but he just can't seem to grasp the simplest of rules/procedures around the store.
 
Two things happened today that makes me think he needs to be fired.  Number one,  I was working office alone and here's Ray on register calling for me to pick up. Cashiers only do this if they have a problem. I have two lines and am currently counting a customer's $1547 for a money order. After I finish counting with three more calls from dear Ray I finally pick up. I still have about seven people combined in the two lines I'm running and had to ask them to wait just to talk to him. His big emergency, what he bothered me and made his customer wait for, was that he had let two pennies drop in his register and didn't know what to do. A little annoyed I tell him 'Well I guess you'll be two cents short tonight Ray' and hang up. About twenty minutes later  h e calls again and asks 'Were you serious about that penny thing?' And I have to tell him yes unless he wants to crawl under his register (which is disgusting)  through the service door and find the two pennies. He just hangs up on me.
So this same night I catch him bitching out our only bagger. She's an older woman from India and her English isn't the best but she's pretty cool. So I see this while I'm on break and he calls her lazy because she wouldn't stop what she was doing to come bag his probably 20-30 small items so he didn't have to. We have six cashiers and one bagger, if she's not at your register then you bag it yourself. Dem's da rules. Tired of this I go over and call him off his register. I explain to him that he has no right to speak like that  to someone who a) is his elder, b) has seniority over him and c) isn't doing anything wrong.  I pretty much politely lay into him that he's on the express lane and he's the last person that needs a bagger. While all the other cashiers are getting 100 to 300 dollars worth of stuff to ring up he can ring and bag three orders in the time it would take them to do one. (tis true, I often worked the express line and would time my orders compared to the others when I was bored) Last thing I said was that if I see this again then I'm going to get the manager to handle his attitude. 'Okay' is all I get.

The rest of the night goes by just fine but when I get ready to leave I see someone sitting out in their car. I walk outside a little wary being paranoid as always. There in the car is Ray and who I assume is his mother. She gets out and comes up to me in the parking lot and starts bitching about how I mistreated her son and I have no right to talk to him like that. Before answering I take a quick look. I'm off the store's property, off the clock, and out of uniform. Perfect. I rip this woman a new one about how her son is lazy, can't understand simple things after they've been repeated to him tons of times, and feels the need to verbally abuse other coworkers. Her son is an ass and her showing up to bail him out after he was talked to by his supervisor (me) for his actions is not helping. She's probably the reason he thinks he gets to act like this then just call mommy dearest if someone says anything to him.

I was just going to leave it at me talking to him for talking to our bagger like that but after his call to mom I think I'm going to be writing Ray up for this.

Small update: 
So I talked to my manager about the issues we had with Ray. Turns out I'm not the first person that he sicked Mommy on. He did the same thing to my grandmother ( who works with me and has been at this store for ten years now) because she caught him taking an hour break when for his schedule he's allowed one 15 minute break. Mommy met with her in the parking lot and complained that since my grandmother isn't a manager she has no right to tell her little boy what he can and can't do. I made my complaint but if nothing gets done (which, it might not knowing my manager) I'm considering going over his head and talking to the owner of the store.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,1349217528.0,,,True,t3_10sse8,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/10sse8/ray_calls_his_mommy/,

I'm wearing a t-shirt and short shorts with flat sandals because it's really freaking hot out, which probably adds to the appearance of youth.

I'm checking out at my favorite grocery store with my boyfriend. I have several things in my cart and get directed to a register. The cashiers here are pretty friendly and at least say ""Hello"" or ""How is your day"", but when I greet my cashier today (middle-aged lady) I get no response. Okay whatever, no big deal.

Cashier is ringing me up, and this grocery store has a screen visible to the customer showing their purchases. I don't usually police the screen since I've never had any problems before, but today I notice that an item on the screen shows ""Baby Squash--$4.67"".

Wutwutwut. I bought no squash today. I don't even particularly like squash. I quickly realize that the cashier has rung up my bag of small Persian cucumbers as squash.

Note that I'm usually the kind of person who, aside from going super-alpha when severely pissed, am rather soft spoken. I have slight anxiety of objecting to minor things an employee gets wrong, for example if I ask for a salad without onions in a restaurant and get onions anyway, I won't complain and will just shut up and eat my salad. When I do object, I'm really polite and nice about it because I work in the service industry myself and dealing with bitchy customers is the worst.

I'm almost about to let the baby squash thing slide, but decide to speak up.

Pudding: ""Um, excuse me. I think you rang up those as squash, they're cucumbers.""

Cashier: ""These are called baby squash.""

Pudding: ""They're actually Per--""

Cashier, interrupting me with a rude tone: ""They are *squash*.""

She looks at me like I'm stupid. Maybe I'm projecting a little but I feel like her attitude is because she's so much older than me. I'm suddenly aware of how short my shorts are.

Damn okay. I'm pretty sure I know the difference between cucumbers and squash, I know they look kind of similar but I've been buying these cucumbers (they're always in the same spot) for weeks, because I love cucumbers.

Slightly peeved now but uncertain (maybe I did accidentally get squash?) I pay and leave the grocery store and start to walk home with my boyfriend. As we walk past the entrance, I get a burst of self assurance. I'm sure I got cucumbers. I hand-picked each of those things. I tell boyfriend I'm going to check the price of the cucumbers, and go back inside.

Sure enough, the very large sign hanging above them reads: ""Persian Cucumbers, $3.99 per lb"". Furthermore, upon checking my receipt, I realize that the ""baby squash"" was $8.99 per lb. OH HELL NO. Okay so it's only a couple bucks, but still, why should I pay more than twice the price for something? I am not that loaded.

I go to the Customer Service booth and explain to the lady there that I was charged incorrectly, showing her both my receipt and my bags. Out of pettiness I throw in casually that I *tried* to explain that they were cucumbers...

The customer Service girl looks up which cashier checked me out, looks at my receipt and at the bag of cucumbers, then asks if she can show the cucumbers to the cashier. Thankfully the customer service booth is out of view of that particular register, boyfriend and I are giving each other ""oooooh shit"" looks.

The customer service girl comes back and asks if it's okay that she refunded me in cash. I get $2.60 back in cash and walk home with the smugness of a customer who was right.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1iz5a7,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1iz5a7/but_theyre_cucumbersxpost_from/,

Alright, I've been working in coffee shops for about two years now and I have an endless plethora of stories. However, one customer tonight almost sent me over the edge. 

Since it's the summer, I am working 5 days a week, each shift beginning almost immediately after the summer school course I am taking. Needless to say, I'm exhausted. Usually, when I am tired I get cranky; but, today was an exception. I got to work early in a good mood that carried on until a single customer, who will be referred to as Bitchface from now on. 

I was on bar, it was slow, and I was happy as a clam. I was in the mood to make any customers experience the best it could be. Bitchface walks up to the till and orders. Just one drink, perfect. I write her specifications on the cup and ask ""Could I have a name for your drink?"" ... And this is when things went south. 

Bitchface: ""No. There's no one else in here."" In the snottiness tone. 

Me: ""Oh. Uh..."" That's weird. Just trying to be nice and follow policy. 

Bitchface: She snaps ""You know what? It's a stupid policy anyway I wish you would just stop asking such stupid questions.""

Okay, whatever lady. I won't let her get my mood down, but I'm still a little irritated. I make her drink and before I turn around, I decide that I will kill her with kindness. I hand her the drink and in the most genuine tone I could muster I tell her to have a great night. Her small response almost drew me over the edge. She looks at me. Scoffs. And walks away. 

I was so close to jumping over that counter and punching her in the throat. I'm sorry that I tried to make your fucking day a little better by being nice. And you know what? Ordering nonfat milk doesn't make the drink any better for you. It still has 500 calories. So suck the dick I wish I had to tell you to suck.

Sidenote: I work in a clothing store with a fairly generous return policy. We also do gift reciepts which we get a lot of returns with after Christmas. With a gift reciept our store policy is you get store credit in the form of a store gift card. 

So a guy comes in and had a sweater he got for Christmas and wanted to return. He has a gift reciept, no problem, I inform him that he can pick out a gift card (each cash has it's own little GC rack so I usually just let customers grab one (some people are picky)). This is basically what happened...

**Guy:** What do you mean a gift card, I have a receipt?

**Me:** A gift receipt, it says right on it that you can either exchange or get store credit in the amount.

**Guy:** Well then what the bleep is the point of it!? I want my money for it.

**Me:** The point of gift receipts is that you give them with a gift so that the person can exchange the item if it doesn't fit and the purchaser doesn't have to be with them. Was this not a gift? If you have the original receipt I can get you your money back in the original form of payment

**Guy:** Well that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard, I'm never getting a gift reciept again (whatever like I care). Obviously I don't shop here (as he gestures at his clothes, basically wearing the exact same type of stuff we sell), store credit is useless to me.

I get a phone call.

I never got a review in 2012. Neither did the majority of the staff. I'd asked about it repeatedly, and was put off for months. When I came back in October, I found out that most of the staff had not received a review, so I took up asking about it, and she kept putting me off until she left for maternity leave. So I took it to the acting GM, who took it to the DM.

I'll leave out the conversations for the most part, but I found out that I'd received a Needs Improvement, and, as you might expect, had a major wtf (calmly) fest with the acting GM and DM. She (the DM) did what you'd expect to try to smooth it over, promising she'd look into it, telling me she didn't think it was true at this point so why worry, etc, etc. Well I asked her to do two things for me: 1) see if the other people who hadn't gotten a review (who are all senior staffers) also received an NI; and 2) pull my actual review.

Well a few days later she has actually jumped through all the HR hoops and pulled my review, so she called to chat with the GM and me, and told me I'd signed it. I assured her I hadn't and after some back and forth, she said she'd pull my review from the year before and compare signatures. Yesterday she called to say someone had forged my signature on the new review. Guess who is the only one who had access.

So, I'm kinda ticked, as you can imagine, and word has gotten around to the point that three managers have begged me not to quit (I never threatened to, considering I'm looking for a second job anyway). Well today aunty DM called again to talk with the GM and me, and proceeds to tell me all the ways I'm awesome. ""You're really good at training people. You make good suggestions that no one else would think of. You're really fast and accurate with displays."" etc etc, you get the point. So, I respond with leverage (who wouldn't?), ""Well I should be getting a promotion to compensate for the review.""

DM: Well, that would have to go through [regional VP].

Me: Then put in a suggestion.

DM: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that.

Me: She's already approved two, I suggest a third.

DM: I'll think about it.

Me: What are the problems with your agreeing to it?

DM: Well, you're really competitive.

-.- No shit. You just complimented me on that. Multiple times. Repeatedly.

Me: When you brought [acting GM] into the store, you said he was the best candidate because he was really competitive.

DM: Well that's different.

Me: How?

Silence.

DM: We'll talk later this week.

So, without me having said anything, the whole store seems to know about the forged signature and the fact that the GM on maternity leave is really the only person who could have done it. I expected them to be pissy with me, but instead they are desperately trying to convince me not to quit (which, again, I never even threatened). As to the forgery, the DM said she'd ""look into it"", which, I was told later, meant she was going to check everyone else's review who also received an NI.

Will update if anything happens.

Clarifying point: I didn't put it in the conversation bit because it would get long, but the promotion I asked for is effectively giving me the title for the position I'm already doing and a 15c raise, which is less than I've ever gotten from a review for this company, save this year.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,1358758229.0,,,True,t3_16o301,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/16o301/i_may_have_gotten_my_gm_fired/,

We were having trouble keeping some of the stuff stocked on the shelves and had people running back and forth to try to keep the shelves stocked with the big sale items.  All the cutters were cutting, all the wrappers were wrapping (especially when I dropped a sick beat) and the rest of us were running the racks of meat out to the case and customers.  Most of the areas people were standing two and three deep.  They'd mob us when we would pull a rack out and grab the stuff before it even hit the meat case.  It was busy, chaotic, but for the most part, fun.

I was doing my meat packing when a bitchy ol' bitch was complaining about anything and everything. ""steaks were cut like crap."" ""hamburger was too fatty"" ""not enough product on the shelves"" At one point she said to her husband, ""Come on, let's go to the OTHER store where they care about people."" and she said it with the intent of getting my attention.  I chose to ignore her and she kept saying it louder and louder hoping to get a response. 

Finally, another customer, a regular that I saw every week for the whole time I worked there said something to the effect of, ""Just shut the hell up and go then so other people can shop in peace without your ass in the way bitching and moaning.""

She said, ""I'm going to tell your manager that you're not helping me."" 

I asked, ""Would you like me to page him for you?""

She looked disgusted by my response. She said, ""Why don't you do that? I can tell him how rude you've been.""

I last left you with the story of CBL and [the deadly runaway cart, that was actually stationary and posed no threat.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/18covs/crazy_bag_lady_part_2/)

Fortunately for me, but unfortunately for you all I guess, I have only one story left. However, this is the story of my greatest victory against the wretched wench, or at least, ya know, it left me feeling pretty good. Whatever.

 Shortly after the last encounter with CBL, I was moved to a different area of the store. I was still a cashier, but not in an area she frequented. Shortly after that, I was put in charge of the front end during the later hours of my shift, making me the PIC. It was wonderful! I would only be on a register if there was a rush and spent the rest of my time helping customers and other departments. I finally earned some respect from our usual grumpy customers. But after three weeks, still hadn't had a run in with CBL. It made me quite happy, to say the least.

All was well with the world... until I got called to the front end for assistance with a customer. I felt a knot in my stomach as I checked my watch and realized it was around the time that CBL usually wobbled her way into the store. (*Shit! Please don't be her!*) I made my way up front, rounded the corner, and my heart sank. It was her. But! It dawned on me that with me being in charge, she would have to bend to my will or leave with nothing. Cue Mr. Burns *Excellent*.

The newest cashier was the one dealing with her. Poor girl looked like a deer caught in headlights. She had recently gotten all the paperwork on corporate policy, including the one about charging 5¢ per paper bag. You can probably see where this is going.

**Me**: What's up, ""Trish""?

**Trish**: This customer said she wanted paper bags, and I told her about having to charge more. She insisted that we don't actually do that and told me to just get her order done. When I said I needed to check my hand book (holds up a minute version of our policies) she wouldn't let me and told me to call you.

**CBL**: No! I told you to call a manager! (She then gives me a snarky look, thinking I have no power over her, since she seems to remember me.) 

**Me**: (As condescending as possible) I'm sorry ma'am, all of the managers have gone home for the evening. Maybe I can help. (*Big smile!*)

**CBL**: No, just send over whoever's in charge! I'm so sick of you people pulling some kind of crap with me every time I come in! Which is A LOT! I shop here all the time, so I pretty much pay your bills!

Poor Trish didn't know what to do. She just kept looking between the two of us and using her eyes to plead with me to get rid of this woman. Oh, I know that feeling...

**Me**: Trish, why don't you go ahead and take your 15. Sign out of the register and I'll take over. (This means she'll have to cancel however much of the transaction that had already gone through, and I would then have to sign in and start over. Hehehe)

**CBL**: You can't do that when you have a customer! (She was fuming at this point.)

**Me**: (As I was getting behind the register after Trish had nearly bolted out of there, I said to her) Actually, I can. I'm the person in charge at the moment. (She started to talk, but I cut her off this time) And for that matter, let me tell you that your weekly purchases in no way pays for a single cent of my paycheck. I get paid by my corporate for doing my job. And I work very hard! And even though it's pretty good pay at this point, it's not *nearly* enough to make up for the way I get treated by people like you daily. This store owes you nothing more than what you pay for, and I'm pretty sure you can't handle slave wages, so the most you'll get out of me is a greeting, your items bagged, and your change. Now (deep breath), if you're done complaining about non-issues, I can get your order done and you can leave.

**CBL**: Oh, you can go ahead and do that. Just know that I'll be back tomorrow to speak to your manager! (She's still a little smug, but I can tell her some of her fight has fled.)

**Me**: And that's certainly within your right. (I'm now signed in and ready to go.) So, would you like paper or plastic?

**CBL**: (Groaning, and speaking through her teeth) Plastic inside of paper!

**Me**: No problem. But I *will* have to charge you an extra 5¢ for every paper bag. (*In your face, you cow!*)

**CBL**: (Still through her teeth) Fine! But your managers will hear about that as well!

**Me**: Oh that's fine, ma'am.

So I finished her order and sent her on her way after receiving the deadliest glare from her. A little while later Trish made her way back asking how it went. I gave her the gist. She said she'd have my back if she really did come back in to complain. So I thanked her and told her she did a good job in trying to follow policy and not just backing down without calling me. I went home feeling pretty good. Slept like a baby that night.

Next shift, which was three days later, I came in expecting to have to explain her complaint. However, all I heard from a manager was a ""good morning"". Trish had the same deal. No one mentioned anything to her either.

I worked there for another few months, but never saw CBL again, which was more than fine by me.

**TLDR**; Crazy Bag Lady finally got put in her place.

It was a pretty sweet job for a teenager, not gonna lie. I most definitely looked 16, but by virtue of being a bank teller, most people assumed I was in university. I was often asked what I was studying, and would simply reply that I was still in high school. This wasn't usually a problem.

Then there was Mr. F., a semi-regular who I HATED serving. So much so that if I saw him in line, I'd try to time my transactions so he'd get another teller. He always had a million things to do, which wasn't the issue, but serving him took a good amount of time. Time that Mr. F. would use to hit on me. 

Sometimes it was more subtle, like asking me what I liked to do for fun, or what I was up to that night/weekend. Most of the time he was just creepily familiar with me, chatting me up like we were friends at a bar, instead of a 50-something-year old man and a 16-year-old girl processing his bill payments. He never called me by name, it was always some totally inappropriate pet name, like ""darling"" or ""hun"" or ""sweetie"", or my personal favourite, the day he kept calling me ""angel"". 

(After the ""angel"" incident, I remarked to my coworker George how creeped out I was, and George's response was: ""WAIT, you don't know that guy?! I thought he was like... a family friend or something. He's just a customer? Gross!"") 

The worst was one day, after I'd finished going through his 42 transactions, I asked him (as one does in customer service) if there was anything else I could do for him. He turned his head, smiled, pointed to his cheek, and said: ""A kiss?"" I THINK I managed to keep a lid on my [reaction](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/yuck.gif), and awkwardly laugh it off, but... so much ew. My only consolation was that I knew (I assumed... I hoped...) he didn't know how old I was. 

I finally got my... well, not revenge, but vindication... the day he decided to ask me the question I always got: ""So, angel, what are you studying?""

Haha! Bingo! I smiled at him, and said, as pointedly as I could while still being polite: ""Oh! Actually, I'm still in **high school.**""

Mr. F. laughed. Then he saw that I wasn't laughing. Then I got to watch the [slow realization](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wuhwhat.gif) come over his face. ""...what? Really?""

Me: ""Yep! I'm in grade 11 at &lt;Local&gt; School.""

With that, he turned white, fumbled for his things, and made a hasty exit. Oddly enough, I don't remember seeing him too much after that.

**TL;DR:** Yes, I'm only 16. Yes, you are gross.

I've worked there for a while now and have seen my fair share of bullshit, but this story from last Wednesday sticks out in my mind simply because every once in a while karma rolls up and slaps a bitchy, self-centered, entitled son of a bitch right in the face. 

I was working a pretty typical 9-5 front service shift. I was basically down to do whatever needed to be done. Cleaning, pushing in carts, bagging, running register, etc. The beginning of this tale takes place at about 12:50PM. I was covering one of our express (10 items or less) registers for the other cashier's 12:30-1:00PM break, and then was scheduled for the 1:00PM-1:30PM shift pushing in carts. This is important later.

I'm ringing up all the cool customers who can count to 10 when an old lady walks up with, from my estimate, 15-20 items in her cart. 

""I have 11 items""

Now, I'm usually pretty cool with taking people in express that have a couple more than ten items, provided its slow enough and it won't affect other customers who are actually following the rules that much, but I'll be goddamned if I don't hate being lied to.

""That looks like more than 11, items. Here, why don't you go into this register behind me. She's not express and is almost done with her customer,"" I replied, trying my best to be polite.

She huffs and puffs, yanks her cart out of my line and stands at the end of my register *counting her fucking groceries.*

She pokes her head back in after I take a couple of customers and says ""I have *fifteen* and *I don't like your attitude*""

I said the only thing I could think of at the time, which was a little too snarky if I had to be honest ""Well, either way that's certainly more than 10!""

She ends up checking out in the line behind me (because I had a customer in my line l-o-fucking-l) and I closed my register as it was time to hit the lot and do carts. As I walked outside I noticed she was at the customer service desk, of course, asking for a manager. 

I bring in a group of five carts and pass her as she's leaving, with one of my managers a few feet behind her. She asks me what went down, my supervisor corroborates that she was being pretty rude to me, my managers doesn't write me up because in my years of working there I almost never have customer complaints. 

Now here's the juicy part. I head back out onto the lot and see the lady waddling at top speed toward the bus stop, cursing at a medium volume because *her bus was leaving before she could make it to the bus stop.*

If this ridiculous, entitled bitch of a woman hadn't stopped to try and get me in trouble because I wouldn't bend the rules for her she wouldn't have missed her bus and had to sit in the Florida heat waiting for another one. I had a big stupid grin on my face for the rest of my cart shift, went in and told my supervisor and she started laughing.

**The E-mail, Redacted to Protect the Stupid:**

&gt;Wow,

&gt;I demand a refund and the immediate cancelation of my order. Your website is very deceiving. Game selection - Earthbound etc. I will be filing a claim with PayPal as soon as the lines are open, and possibly suit against domain owner of this website. ....soap? Why would anymore buy soap that looks like a game cartridge. This is a scam.
I hope that I may be refunded quickly and with no problems. Maybe, then, I will forget the whole thing. Still, it is very wrong what you people are doing, bc if one doesn't take the time to look over the site, one will fall prey to this scam.

&gt;You can't legally have a drop down bar that says ""game selection"" if it's soap. I would know, my uncle is a webspace legality attorney and I've seen this kind of thing a hundred times. Whoever owns this website can get in serious trouble. I hope to get this resolved quickly

&gt;Thank you


**The Response, as written by my boss:**

&gt;Dear REDACTED...

&gt;Thank you for your feedback. If I understand your issue correctly, you are upset that the bestselling product from our bathroom category, titled **Digital Soaps SNES Cartridge** is, as advertised, soap.

&gt;I'm sorry if the page describing our product using the word 'soap' no fewer than ten times was confusing. Try as I might, I honestly can't think of a way to make the specs of this item clearer to our shoppers.

&gt;Some stores would tell you that this is your fault for not reading the product description fully. We at BUSINESS NAME, however, are a benevolent group, and we would be happy to cancel your order.

&gt;Here's how it works: I have copied our shipping department on this message. When they arrive at work tomorrow, they will mark your order for cancellation. By my experienced estimation, the order should be cancelled and your payment refunded by 1:00 p.m. PST on Monday. If it hasn't been, please do not hesitate to contact me directly.

&gt;I would also encourage you to show the page in question to your webspace legality attorney uncle and get his opinion on the matter. Maybe we can even hire him to further advise us on the legality of all the other drop menus on our site.

&gt;Thank you for your business, and please have a wonderful day.

&gt;MY BOSS


If it were not against posting rules, I would link you to the product in question, so you could observe for yourself how plainly the item is listed as soap. I will select a few gems from the listing for you.

*""Bet you never thought you'd see a SNES Cartridge made of Soap!""* - The FIRST LINE OF TEXT ON THE PAGE.

*""These SNES Cartridge soaps by REDACTED are so convincing that we regularly have to break hearts by telling excited gamers that we don’t actually have a copy of Chrono Trigger in our display case.""* 

*""Product Details: Each glycerin soap is made using only high-quality, VEGAN ingredients""*



**TL;DR: A customer ordered a product from us without reading the listing at all and threatened to sick his ""webspace legality attorney uncle"" on us for duping him with our nefarious video game soap scam.**

They always have 4 coupons, one with 20% discount, two with 15% and one with 10%.

Most of the time it goes as expected with these coupons (people wanting four times the 20% discount or turning in 10 coupons) but there are some exceptions like this one;

At the time I was by myself at the checkout because it was a bit quiet. My colleague was somewhere near, cleaning things.

I was helping this nice old man who had a 3 items and 2 coupons. While busy with him the couple after him started talking to me so I asked them to please wait because I was still busy with the man and wanted to concentrate on him.

He paid, I gave him his receipt and noticed the coupons. Jep, I had forgotten to him his discount. Not wanting to cheat him out, because it was my fault, I called him back and explained the mistake.

I was kinda like watching a mild mannered Bruce Banner transform into the Hulk. He suddenly started raging at me. How I was dumb, how the store was trying to cheat him and that he wanted his money back. I explained patiently that he could return the items at the servicedesk and return to me so I could give him his money back. That's the system that we work with.

Instead he demanded that I take the money out of my cash drawer and pay him back immediately. Obviously I couldn't do that which I tried explaining to him. At this point the couple, that had made me forget about the discount in the first place, started getting involved by telling the man to just calm down. Which made him even more mad. I don't remember precisely what he said but basically they were a bunch of hippies who shouldn't mess with other people's business.

After about 6-7 minutes of this my colleague walked by, got the receipt, went to the servicedesk, got the return paper and came back. It took less than a minute.

Doing everything correctly this time I gave the man his change back. It was €0,20. He raged for 6-7 minutes for 20 cents when it could have taken him 1 minute of just walking back and forth. I understand wanting to get the discount you are promised. What I don't understand is raging so much for 20 cents when I offered a solution that he **wouldn't** take.

It's a frustrating, gruelling shift for us, and probably for customers as well, because they don't know what's happening behind the scenes. 

1: The speaker boxes that you talk into to place your order in the drive through? Did you ever look at those and think, wow they look like they'd make understand orders difficult. Well.... they do. A lot of the time, we're struggling to hear you over a background of humming machines, fryers spitting, beeps and alarms and orders being communicated around the store. Not to mention sound quality is terrible and ""large sprite"" sounds exactly like ""large fries,"" I kid you not. If you're not in the driver's seat next to the COD (the box), we can barely hear you. (Having said this, if you honk your horn, or scream, or rev the engine near the box, we can hear that. In fact, we can more than hear that. Please don't, it's very painful and dangerous for us). So if we ask you to repeat a order, it's not because we're stupid or slow, we just want to make sure we haven't misheard you. 

2: If it's a drive through only store, it's a drive through only store. Don't walk through the drive through. It's dangerous for you, and for us, because if we serve you, we have to serve everyone else on foot, and that includes the drunken, abusive knobs. So you will be refused, and it's not because we're arseholes, we don't have a choice.

3:The computers have to be shut down **every** night. Otherwise they don't work. It only takes seven minutes, it's not the end of the world, and we try to schedule it for a downtime. If you're unfortunate enough to come through during that time, please be patient, we're doing our best.

4: There's two types of overnight managers: the ones who cook a full batch of food and use it until it's gone, no matter how old and gross, because they don't want to park you. And then theres the second type, who will cook your food to order, so you get hot, fresh, tasty food every time. But this takes longer, a whole *gasp* 3 minutes to cook a mcchicken patty. Please park for us and not abuse as, lest we all become the former type just to get you out of our hair.

5: Lastly, this may not be true for all stores. But at mine, between certain times, it's just me (the manager) and a kitchen boy. We cook the food, make the burgers, take the orders, run the orders, take your money, and we do it all while doing several other things at once. If there's a line up, it's because we're doing the work of five crew all at once. We also have to fully stock the store, clean everything, do five hours worth of computer work, count all the stock, all while making sure you guys get the best service we're capable of. And we do it with a smile. But we cannot do it as well as a daycrew with full staff, we apologise.

If there are mix-ups, we can guarantee, it was not on purpose. But we're pushed to work fast, fast, fast, and the sheer amount of orders we pump out, mix-ups are going to happen. I would be happy if every order I handed out was perfect and every customer was delighted, that's what I aspire to. But if there's not enough lettuce on your mcchicken, or you've got the wrong burger *again* (I know it's frustrating, it's just as frustrating for us!)  bring it back and we will replace it! No problem at all!

A woman in the back had her iPad on (full brightness might I add), earbuds in, watching what looked like a youtube video. I walked up and did what I was trained to do. I stood there until she made eye contact.

It didn't take long, she looked up from her device, obviously confused. I quietly motioned toward her device. No reaction. I motion again, thinking she didn't notice. Still no reaction. I lean in toward her so I can whisper without disturbing other patrons, leaving a few feet of space between us. She immediately speaks up, saying, ""Don't you get near me!"" I back off a bit. ""What the hell do you want?"" I politely ask her to turn off her device.

""Why the hell should I? Is there a rule against it? Do you have a rule book with you?"" I tell her the screen would distract the patrons around her. ""I see no rule against it!"" This is getting too loud. Time to find a manager. I exit the auditorium, and run into the General Manager. I start explaining the situation to her, when the customer walks out of the theater, demanding to know why she can't have her iPad out.

The general manager explains that she can't use electronic devices in the theater. ""No, it says no talking or texting! I'm listening to music! I'm using earbuds!"" We tell her that the texting rule applies to this situation because it involves the bright screen in the theater. We politely suggest that she turns off her screen while listening, then there wouldn't be an issue. ""Look, I have anxiety, and I need this music because the movie is so loud. I'm calling a lawyer!"" What? I thought she was bluffing.

She angrily walks back into her theater. General manager says to forget it for now, the other managers would look into it. I go to clean theaters. This insane woman starts taking pictures of every ""No talking or texting during the movie"" sign we have posted. She gives me this smug face as she walks by.

Eventually, she walks up to the concessions employee and demands a manager. She complained to the manager that her iPad shouldn't be banned because our talking and texting rule didn't specifically state her music. The manager tells her that it does apply, and that it had to be put away. She demands a refund (and got it too) and eventually leaves.

There were certain categories of items they'd want us to push (computers, routers, digital cameras, etc), but nothing is more important than mobile phones. Seriously, these are the meat and potatoes of the business's income. Our location (and the economy) being what they were at the time, the majority of people were on prepaid plans. 

As such, one of our common transactions was to put more money on someone's prepaid phone. Easy. Fuckin' cake. Ask the person their phone number, verify a few details (name, address, anything), then confirm the amount (""You said $50, right?"") and ring it up. 

One evening, about an hour from closing, a woman comes in. She looks like she's in her 40's-50's.

HER: ""I want to put some more money on my phone.""  
ME: (smiling) ""No problem. I can do that for you. What's your phone number?""  
HER: ""XXX-XXX-XXXX""
ME: (typing it in and repeating it back to her).  
HER: ""Yes, that's right.""

ME: (assuming the mixup is on my end) ""One second, let me double check something. The system isn't showing that.""  

I double check everything, even asking her number again as I take the whole thing from the top. Twice. She says she was using the phone this week, so the number wouldnt've been recycled yet. 

When she asks what's taking so long, I explain to her that, at least in my system, this number is not registered to her. 

HER: (getting louder) ""That's bullshit. Let me see it.""  
ME: ""Absolutely not."" (For all I know, she rattled off the first 10 numbers that came to mind and got lucky). ""As far as I can tell, it's not your number. Are you sure this isn't your *old* phone number?""  
HER: (almost yelling) ""I'VE ONLY EVER HAD ONE. THIS IS BULLSHIT. SHOW ME THE SCREEN!""  
ME: (it's been a slow day; I've had a few beers; I'm calm) ""Ma'am, I can't do that. I could lose my job.""  
HER: ""YOU CHANGED IT! YOU WENT INTO THE SYSTEM AND CHANGED IT!""

It really wasn't too bad.

I am working on the cash, and out of the corner of my eye i see this massively obese lady on one of those disability scooters (i have no idea what they are called), and she pulls up at the end of my checkout lane. There is a line of maybe 3-4 customers, so i just ignore her, and continue on with the customers transactions. 

***BEEP BEEP***

The lady honks her scooters horn (why the fuck does it have a horn?), and basically makes me jump. 

(Paraphrasing)

**Her**: I need you to do a return for these products, and proceeds to start dumping cans on the bagging area.  (Completely ignoring the fucking fact i am in the middle of a fucking transaction).

**Me**: ""Mam, you need to wait in line like everybody else.""

**Her**: I won't fit, bla bla bla. Do it now. (Ignoring the fact that a shopping cart can fit comfortably through there)

**Me**: ""Mam, you need to wait in line, otherwise i will not help you"" (I am irritated as fuck).

I turn around finish ther transaction with the customer -

***BEEP BEEP*** - [Me](http://i.imgur.com/1u2L0.gif)

**Her**: ""I AM DISABLED"" (She basically couldn't grab the cans off the bagging area, because she dumped them)

**Me**: ""Leave the cans there, and go wait in line like everyone else""

So she finally fucking goes and waits in line. I deal with the other customers, but turns out her the stuff that the tons of shit hanging off her scooter (bags of i don't know what the fuck), gets caught in the magazine rack. I didn't notice that until -

***BEEP BEEP*** 

**Her**: ""I TOLD YOU THIS WOULD HAPPEN, MY SCOOTER IS CAUGHT WAHHHH"" (Because she is apparently too fucking fat to reach down and fix it)

So i go over and fix it, but not before she tries to try drive forward basically ripping and pulling magazines that are caught in the middle of this clusterfuck. Fine whatever i complete the other customers transaction and begin to deal with her. I throw all her cans she dumped out onto the conveyor belt. 

**Her**: ""I have more returns, but your checkout is too tall i need helppppp""

So i fucking walk back around basically have to get on my knees and grab the rest of her returns, while she makes zero attempt to help. As i am doing this she starts lecturing me about how our store is violating the AODA (Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, basically Canadian version of ADA for you americans), because our checkouts are too high for her to be able to put her stuff on the conveyor belt (Nobody else has ever had this problem, and people in wheelchairs have no problems). 

Basically she had cans of chick peas, and other random canned goods. 

**Me**: ""Why are you returning these products?""

**Her**: ""Because you idiots sold me expired products!""

**Me**: ""I apologize for that, i need your you receipt to begin the refund""

So she turns around and hands me a stack of receipts, now these receipts are not just OUR store they are other random stores as well. This is a huge stack. She rants about how her eyesight is going (HINT: GET GLASSES), and she rants about how stores use tiny text is not good for people with poor eye sight (HINT: GET GLASSES). 

Fuck this, i already have customers waiting behind her, to hell with the receipts and i start just scanning and refunding.  We are undermanned and i just want this lady out of the store. We are understaffed and one of the cashiers desperately needs change.

So i start scanning, then we get to the cans of chickpeas, scanning them causes the POS to give me an error that basically saying it has no fucking idea what this product is. I flip the can over and notice it has a best before date of ~2007.

**Me**: These expired ~2007, 5 years ago, and the computer says we do not carry them. 

**Me**: Unless you can provide me proof in the form of a receipt indicating you purchased the chickpeas, i am not refunding you for them.

**Her**: ""I need your manager!""

**Me**: I am the currently on staff manager, you can come back tommorow and speak with a different one.

At this point she relents and takes her chickpeas back but not after she bitches about she can't grab her cans and put them into her scooters cart. So i walk all the way around and put them back in her cart basket. (ARE YOU TOO FUCKING FAT TO GRAB THEM). In total she ends up with like 30 dollars in the form of a refund.

I just wanted her out of the store at this point. But no she needs to do some ""Shopping"", and she wants help for her shopping, because the shelves are too high. I tell her if she needs help reaching something she can find someone on the floor and ask them to get it for you, but i am not assigning an employee to be your own personal grocery shopper. She bitches some more and rolls off.

Looking back at this I really fucking wish i did assign her, an employee to act as her own personal grocery shopper.

**The Warpath**

When ever she couldn't reach something that would require her to stand  there would be a **BEEP BEEP**, until she got someones attention. 

She even told one of the people who was working on the floor (he was setting up displays for halloween), that when she honks the horn ""he better come running"" (he promptly ignored her after that), basically anyone who helped her she was picky and needed to inspect EVERYTHING. 

From where i was working i could see her in the aisle directly infront of me, beeping her fucking horn. Nobody came to help her, after the first half dozen beeps so i page someone to that aisle. But she tried to solve the problem on her own what did she do? Did she stand up? Fuck no, she tried using her umbrella to pull stuff off the shelf. End result? Broken glass everywhere.

[http://i.imgur.com/1vxHz.gif](http://i.imgur.com/1vxHz.gif)

Does she give a fuck? Nope just rolled on.

She ended up leaving without buying anything, but not before she bitched at me about how she was going to have our store written up for violating AODA, because:

* The shelves are too high for her disability
* We weren't accommodating to her ""disability""
* The aisles were too small
* Checkout lanes were too small
* And some other bullshit

Furthermore she is going to file a complaint against me personally because i refused to help her. I just pointed out that we are not your personal caretaker and told her to leave and never come back.

What the fuck is wrong with people? I need to cry. 

*EDIT* I am not hating on obese people are terrible or anything like that. People have medical reasons for using scooters to get around. The lady for all i know has a medical condition, however, that does not give her the right to:

* Treat me and others like shit, or obnoxious and disruptive **BEEP BEEP**. 
* Feel you are more important than other people, i don't care if you are disabled or not if i am with a customer, you need to wait your turn.
* If you have a problem reaching stuff then i suggest finding or asking for help, politely. If you have a specific and manageable list of items you need, i have no problem with getting you those items. However if your going to browse every aisle, i suggest bringing a friend or someone to help you. 
* We are not your personal servants, we have other customers to help, and jobs to do.

The way the lady acted, was insulting. 

**Update**

So today during work i talked with the store manager and explained what happened, i also had several staff back me up about what she was doing and how she acted.

Unfortunately he explained how if she did injure her self, she could technically sue us. Since according to the AODA the store has to be just as accessible to disabled people as normal people. So technically i should have assigned an employee to assist her for the duration of her shopping trip. 

However he also said the way she acted he would have just asked her to leave for be insulting to employees.

Also not sure if this belongs in ""retail"" but I've seen other tales from bouncers so thought it might fit.

Backstory:  One of my brothers earlier careers was working as a ""show dresser"" for cattle. Now, for all those folks that have never heard of such a thing, this basically is a hair stylist for cattle at state fairs and national livestock shows (Google ""National Western Stock Show"" for an example).

Anyway, as part of clipping hair along the legs of cow or bull, you end up standing very close to the hind legs of said animal.  The thing that is important is that when cattle kick with their hind legs, they can do so **very** quickly.  If you don't want to be on the receiving end of said kick, you have to develop extremely fast reflexes.

So now to the main story:  one night my brother and his friend were standing outside a bar that featuring nearly naked women dancing for money (aka titty bar).  They were just talking prior to driving home when this young kid comes out and decides he's going to go all Jackie Chan on my brother.  You know, does the fast one-two fake punches that don't connect, ditto with kicks.

After a minute or two of this, my brother gets tired of this guy's wise-ass moves, and, because he has developed said extremely fast reflexes, when the kid does his next leg kick, my brother just grabs the kid by the ankle and proceeds to drag him around the gravel parking lot a couple of times.  Meanwhile this kid is yelling and screaming from the pain of contact with the gravel.  It was probably face up so the kids shirt is hiking up leaving his bare back exposed.  Being dragged around on gravel does wonders for the kids attitude (quiets down real quick).  

Afterwards, the club bouncer comes up to my brother and says that was the funniest thing that he had ever seen.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1kb204,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1kb204/joys_of_having_fast_reflexes_or_justice_served_on/,

It was not uncommon for people to bring in their dogs and other various animals (monkies, miniature horses, snakes), and we didn't really care, as we were a pretty laid back place. I have three short stories involving animals that I thought were worth sharing.

----
**""Guide"" Dog**

There was this woman who would come in on a pretty regular basis and just stroll the aisles with her tiny dog who was usually sitting in the cart, or in a purse/carrier thing. It was store policy to go up to customers and ask if they were doing alright, if they needed help finding something, whatever. 

So it's pretty slow in the world of printing, so I see her in a nearby aisle and decide to go ask if she needs help. I walk up to her and say ""Hey there, are you doing oka---""

""THIS IS MY GUIDE DOG""

""....What?""

""YOU HAVE TO ALLOW GUIDE DOGS""

I look at this tiny dog that is sitting in the child seat in the cart and it has a guide dog vest on. I can't even fathom this. She's trying to pass off this tiny white poof of a dog as a guide dog. Not that we even care that she has a dog, but every time we'd speak to her after that, she'd shriek that we MUST ALLOW GUIDE DOGS and that we can't kick her out. 


**Dog Blood**

I was working in the copy and print center when a woman with a small poodle came up to the counter. She placed her dog on the counter while she placed her order. We finish up, and she pays, and she picks up her dog. She kind of gasps/stutters ""Um... do you have any paper towels?""

I look at the counter and see a small puddle of blood. Her dog was in heat and had bled on my counter. I told her we had special precautions when there is a blood spill and that we'll take care of it. Once she leaves, I sprint to the back and grab all the Clorox and sanitizing wipes I can find

**Rush Delivery**

At this store, we had a shipping department. A man walks up to the counter with a large styrofoam box that he wants shipped overnight. No problem. I weigh it, and it weighs over 20lbs. At that weight, we are required to check the contents to make sure the package doesn't contain a dangerous item. I tell him I'm going to open it and take a look and he slams his hand on the box and says ""BEFORE YOU DO THAT, I just want you to know that I am a hunter, and I'm sending this off to be stuffed. So... yeah...""

I look in the box, and lo and behold, it's a crazy-eyed, but adorable and quite dead frozen fox. I know it was against policy to ship animals, but... frozen dead animals? I'm not sure what the protocol is here. You know what? This is crazy weird. I'm going to send it. 

He was very thankful, and an all around cool guy. Just to show his thanks, a few weeks later he brought me in a picture of the stuffed fox, and a home made rabbit's foot. ",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1gip9e,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1gip9e/no_dogs_allowed/,

During the summer we would have summer camps, mostly soccer kids 6-12. We also had Jehovah witness there for some convention they had, it took place like 3 times each summer. When the convention group would come into town we would set up half the dorm as best as we could as a cheap hotel. Twin bed, a closet and a bathroom, for $29/night or $39/night if you wanted 2 rooms (the set up was 1 door entered into a entry where 2 doors went to separate bed rooms and another door for the bathroom.

So for $39 were talking CHEAP. I could not believe the requests I got, remember you paid $39, this isn't a hotel, we don't have room service. People would be mad because we didn't have TVs in the room. One women even called ahead of time and said if I bring a TV with is there a wall jack for cable, I replied yes and I thought that was the end.

Several hours later, this women shows up. The longest people would stay is 2 nights, so small clothes bag is all most people had and needed. This women came in asked for a luggage cart, I gave her one, she then comes back with the most loaded up luggage cart I have ever seen. It was quite impressive actually. Included was 4 large suitcases, several other blankets, pillows, etc... and the crowning jewel a 60 inch TV.  This women brought her 60 inch TV to stay for 2 nights, yet they stayed at the convention from like 9am to 5pm. I about died from laughter after I saw that. 

~~~ some time passes ~~~~

A women comes up the front desk and I great her ask if I can help her with anything. I'm thinking its either going to be an order for these box lunches we would make up for people (those were a headache for another day), or complaining when she realizes $39 doesn't get you the Hilton. She asks me do I have a cable to plug her TV in. I suddenly realize this is 60 inch TV women. I tell her we do not have that behind the counter but there is a 24 hour store down the street. This was unacceptable to her. She completely went off on how she called before hand and worked it all out, they were supposed to have it all set up for her when she came in. How she stayed her last year and thought it was so rude we didn't have a TV (remember $39/night). I told her I don't have a cable there is nothing I can do. She then asked ""well I heard you guys live here do you got one?"" 

During the summer those who worked at the dorm could also live for free on the top floor of the other wing, and yes we did have TVs we brought because we live there. I said ""I am not going up to my room and getting the cable for you. There is a store 5 minutes away."" She then asked for my manager which was funny, because we were not a hotel, I was in charge. She eventually left but made a point to come down by the front desk and just glare at me from a chair, while her son was at the store. The son got back from the store and the women was so excited to see him. Some people are a little too obsessed with TV. 

I will have to share the story next of the guy who wouldn't leave me alone all night, so I told him I was an atheist, that was a big mistake.

He was a nice guy, very hands on. He was the oldest guy there, and had been a manager for over 30 years. He loved his job, and he cared for his employees because a happy employee meant better sales.

Mike was old, he was nearing 80, and his health had gotten worse so he had to take large amounts of time off. yesterday during the afternoon shift he was helping clean up one of the mens suits department, when he collapsed. Paramedics got there within minutes, but, he was pronounced dead at the scene. It was distressing to say the least, many workers were crying. Some of the older guys had known him for years.

After they took the body out, and everything settled down our store manager came up to us, and said ""Get back to work. Shows over folks. We still have 4 hours left before closing"". She still refused to let anyone go home unless their shift ended. The next day at the opening shift it was all the talk, she formally announced ""If you want to take off work, go ahead but you'll be wasting your points. People die everyday, unless you personally knew him I won't let you get off work. We have a busy day today. If i see anyone slacking off, I'll have you written up"".

ugh and then as the day went on, one of the guys in shoes, an elderly man who was close to ""mike"", started weeping and had to leave. Our store manager went up to him and started yelling at him because he was slacking off. When he requested to be excused for the day, she refused saying ""We are already understaffed. Go cry on your break, don't do it here you're bothering the customers"".

She can't even feign a little bit of sympathy? Even some of our more jerkish managers were upset over his death and thought she was being harsh. Mike was a beloved manager, we all knew him as like a grandfather to us, he treated us like real people and whenever we fell behind on our quotas he would always help us out. I always knew our store manager was hard, everyone warned me about never getting on her bad side.

Having recovered from my previous [Walmart trip]( http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/13rmk7/i_do_not_work_here/), I was working phones in our dealership last night when I had an encounter with a young Robin Hood...or was it Smeagol? In any case, he was after a ring, and the innocent-looking babe nearly got it without anyone noticing. Here's the scoop:  
  
It's around 6pm. Usually by that point I'm digging through my bag for something to occupy my time; customers come in sparingly and even fewer will call the store, rendering my position a waste for another hour. This particular night, a man and his around-10-ish son wander in. They're both dressed like normal, middle-class folks, and neither respond to my greeting. They head off to shop, and I put my nose back into a copy of Grimm's Fairytales. For a while, things proceed as normal, until I hear them wander up to the clothing counter to my left to check out. Because I'm human and respond to noise, a bit like a souless, ginger-colored Furby, I turn to look at them.  
  
The way the layout is set up is rather simple. I sit in my desk to the left of the entrance. To MY left is the clothing counter, and between us both is a sale table, where smaller items on mark-down get placed. This is usually jewelry that we normally sell for about 200$ or so, marked down to half that. It's still very expensive and I don't really know why they don't keep it farther from the door, as I don't sit there all the time. That night, however, I was.  
  
The boy of the twosome, while his father was checking out less than four feet away, had one of the markdown rings on his finger. Even on markdown, we're talking a 75$ ring, so you can imagine it's original price. As I go to turn back to my book, he does it, out of the corner of my eye, and my head snaps back around. He slipped the ring off his finger and *made to put it in his pocket*.  
  
Satan must've whispered in his ear that he was being watched, because he whipped his head towards his father and then to me. We locked eyes; he froze. He knew, I knew. For a tense moment, it was a silent battle of wills. He knew I'd seen him, and was debating whether he could still get away with the precious. I only stared, and the blank, soul-hungry eyes of a cold ginger must've finally broken his bravado.  
  
Slowly, out came the ring. He retreated to his father, stalling, hoping I would stop staring. He asked what the ring said (It's our damn brand name, like everything else in the dealership). Every so often, the young bandit glanced at me, eyes first full of hope and then bursting with fear. When he could stall no more and the father was getting his reciept, it became clear to young Robin Smeagol that he had been bested. Defeated, he put the ring back into its box, and went to leave. I immediately got up to check the other boxes, but everything else was present. The girls running the clothing department were shocked when I told them what'd happened, and began talking about where they should move the jewelry on the table. I went back to my book, satisfied to have helped but now craving soul something fierce.

It was Easter weekend. A rather to do affair in my very small and religious community. People dressed in their Sunday best, whites and pastels gleaming from the multitudes heading home from Easter Sunday service. 

I was not a terribly religious person myself, so I had volunteered to work that day all day so my coworkers could be with their families. It was only myself and Kickass Manager, Josh, all day.

 To be quite honest, the day started out wonderful, almost no customers the entire day at our major game store. It was sunny, warm, and hardly any customers, so we laughed, joked around, did some facing, and threw a movie onto the display tv we had.

The few customers we had gotten were just thankful we were open, And were extraordinarily nice.

The day passed with no problems, and soon it was closing time. Josh shut the shudders, locked the door, and started counting out the drawers. I started facing the walls. 

Suddenly, we heard a banging on the door. Josh headed to the door and sorrowfully let the customer know that we were closed. The man, a semi regular, started screaming at us.

Man: open these doors I KNOW you aren't closed yet! You bastards cheated me and damnit you're going to help me!

Josh: I'm sorry sir, we closed 5 minutes ago. If you come back tomorrow we'd be- 

Man: *cuts him off!* you did it on purpose! You know you sold me a shitty Xbox so you closed early! I won't put up with this! 

Josh: again, we close early on Sundays. Our hours are right there. If you come back tomorrow we'll gladly exchange it for a working system!

Man: *starts screaming obscenities not fit for the ears of the Easter enthused!* 

At this store we did sell refurbished systems. Broken systems traded in, and fixed at headquarters. However every once in a while one would slip through the fingers of the all mighty HQ and come back to our store still not working. We were always happy to help if this happened. 

At this point Josh figured he had done all he could at the time and Angry man child would just have to come back tomorrow. So he turned from the door and started walking away.

As I got up to work the other side of the store, I saw the man lift the Xbox and do the unthinkable to a 250 dollar piece of gaming equipment. He -hurled- it, full force, at our front door. Our, completely made of glass, front door.

Instinctively, I flinched, waiting to be showered in a barrage of sharp tiny pieces of glass. I'm pretty sure I yelped too.

Thunk, crack!

I looked up, not a scratch on our door. The Xbox had fallen pitifully onto the sidewalk in front of our door. Josh just stared at the man until he picked up his console and left. He then looked at me and laughing said, ""Those are storm windows, Sweets, nothing short of a car is breaking them.""

And yes... We did still do the return the next day.

The other day I get a woman come in. She a had a trolley that was relatively full and chose to get her produce last. I was filling one of the stands when she called out to me (she must have been about 10 meters from me):

**Lady:** Excuse me, do you have any lemons?

**Me:** Sorry ma'am. We don't have any at the moment. There's ........

**Lady:** ntaahhh !!!!

**Lady**: Fine... I'll go to the supermarket cross the road then.

**Me:** ... no I think I'll let her discover there's a state shortage of lemons at the moment and there won't be any across the road either.

The couple both burst out laughing and the woman walking away thought they were laughing at her and said (in a loud voice as she was almost at the exit at this point)

**Lady:** Don't laugh! I'm never shopping here again!!

She was very well dressed, about 27 years old if I had to guess.  And the cashier was an older man, about 45, who very clearly loved his job.  He was very enthusiastic, and I don't think I've seen anyone that passionate about coffee.

In any case, the woman starts her order.  ""I want one small nonfat latte, the corner oat bar, a muff-"" when the cashier says ""Sorry, I didn't get the second item?""  and she smirks and goes (in the voice you would speak to a five year old) ""smaaaaall, nonfaaaaat latte""  and he says ""your name please?"".  She holds a finger up, and in the same condescending tone she says ""nooooo"", as if she was training a puppy.  This cashier was barely fazed by it, and asks for the next part of her order.  She says ""an oat bar, the corner piece""  and follows him to the pastry display to ensure he understands her obviously deeply complex order.  Then she finishes with ""a muffin"".  And he asks ""what kind of muffin?"", at which point the woman scoffs and says ""you should already know that.""  Now at this point, I'm getting impatient since I had been waiting in line anyway, and I don't enjoy watching uppity bitches treat people like shit.  So I'm wondering ""how in the fuck would this poor guy *know* what kind of muffin you want?"".  No answer from the cashier.  Her explanation was that there was only one kind of muffin left, and the cashier (the hero of our story) says ""well today we have banana chocolate chip, caramel coffee cake, strawberry-""  and gets cut off once more.  She explains that she wanted the *one*, the kind that only had *one* muffin left.  She goes to pay, and pulls out a gift card.  She tosses it on the counter (at least it wasn't at him, like some other customers do), and says ""use whatever is left on this"". So he offers the card back to her, she scoffs and says ""why do I need this?  I told you to use the rest""  and he says ""well, in case you want to reload it online""  and she just walks away.  

So, I give her a death glare while waiting for the cashier to finish up the transaction and take my order.  I order quickly, pay with cash and tell him to keep the change for his lunch break.  As much as I hate seeing people mistreat those who work in retail, I love seeing professionalism even more.  As a side note, I went over to grab my drink and it was ready as soon as I walked over.  The bitch was still waiting for hers.   I'm thinking the other barista was taking out some petty revenge of his own.

**EDIT**: For everyone saying I should have interfered - for me, it didn't seem appropriate.  The cashier wasn't bothered by her, and he proceeded without any attitude or impatience. He knew just how to react to coffee snobs (thanks Lyssabex for perfect phrasing). I cannot stress how professional he was.  As for the tip thing, I thought it was a nice gesture and nothing more.  I wanted him to know that I appreciated his service, but left it up to him as to where the money will be distributed.  I didn't see a tip jar, but I also wasn't looking for one.

Of course, as with any job, you always run into a few disrespectful customers and a few dimwit ones as well (""Do you people live in igloos?"" ""Excuse me?"" ""It's so cold here, do you live in igloos?"" ""No, ma'am, you just drove through the town to get here"" ""Oh, I didn't notice""). 

We sell tickets at the craft shop, which is a building away from the lighthouse. They cost a whole two dollars, and must be purchased in order to enter the lighthouse. Seems like a simple concept, just purchase them and give them to us, then we give them back and you get to keep them and you can even use them in another site in town. So yeah, two sights for two dollars, I don't see the problem.

But there are many, many problems.

The first story that comes to mind happened to me a bit over a week into my job. A woman came in and gave us her ticket, took her tour, and then left. Around five minutes later, a man walked in without a ticket and I wouldn't let him in. He got up in my face ""My wife just did it, why can't I?."" I explained that his wife had purchased a ticket and that he should go do so as well, as it's only 2 dollars. 

He left the lighthouse and I watched him through the side window. He went over to his wife and took her ticket. He tried to come in with the same ticket that I just saw him take from his wife and had already punched, and tried to tell me that he just bought it in the thirty seconds it took for him to walk outside. I don't care how fast you are, you aren't getting across a full parking lot, to a register in a store full of tourists, and making it back with a ticket in thirty seconds.

Long story short, the man threatened to tell my supervisor that I was refusing service when he was too cheap to spend 2 dollars. A senior employee actually let him in for free to avoid the drama, because fuck it, you can find 2 dollars on the ground if you look hard enough, basically making me seem like a jerk. But I digress.

Here's another one involving those pesky tickets.

A group of women came in and we directed them to the craft shop to pick up their tickets. There were about four in the group, so they would've spent 8 dollars on tickets, 2 each. They came back in with just two tickets, and I explained that they needed two more. The bigger lady in the group was being snobby and said that the girl at the counter in the craft shop said that 2 people could get into the site for one ticket (misunderstanding the 1 ticket = 2 sites thing that I mentioned earlier). I explained this to her but there was no getting through. She threw her tickets down on the floor and stormed out. A week later, my supervisor came over and told me that he had received an email from that woman complaining about shoddy service and that the site should be closed down. My supervisor just laughed and said he added her to his junk folder.

The (apparently) much anticipated second part of Coworkers from Hell! You can find Part I [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1hafen/coworkers_from_hell_pt_i/), in case you missed it. 

* First up is a gem that will go by the name of Lazy Douchewad. He quickly discovered exactly how much he could get away with and exploited the hell out of it. He essentially made his own work schedule because he was incapable of working for more than 5 hours at a time. If he was scheduled to work from 9-3, he might show up at 11:30 and work till 3:30, or he might not show up at all. If a manager would confront him about it, he would get all defensive and walk out, only to show up the next day at whatever time was most convenient for him. This went on for far longer than it should have until one of my managers finally caught him trying to steal something from the store and told him to GTFO. Last I heard, LD was sitting in prison for one reason or another. Total time of employment: 3 months.

* Next on the list for today is a coworker we'll call Racist Twatwaffle, RT for short. He was the longest running employee on this list, and to this day I still don't understand how he stayed employed here for so long. His job entailed stocking shelves, unloading trucks and doing carryouts for customers, and was hired shortly after Creeper Kid from Pt. I was let go. He was one of those people that only ever did his job halfway, and I had to essentially follow him around and fix everything he did. It got old real fast.

   RT was one of the most racist people I have ever met. Hispanic, African American, Asian, it didn't matter, he would find some completely imaginary fault in them and just seethe about it after they left. It resulted in most of us just walking away from him when he got on one of his racial tangents. He got himself into trouble on more than one occasion for saying something he shouldn't to the wrong person. One day he came into work with a gnarly looking black eye. When we asked what happened, he said he was at a bar the previous night and a black guy punched him right in the face. We all just laughed, because we knew RT most likely completely deserved it for saying something stupid.

   His most annoying trait to deal with on a daily basis was the fact that he loved to talk. Boy he could talk. About anything and everything. I think [Dilbert said it best](http://www.dilbert.com/strips/comic/2012-03-07/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+DilbertDailyStrip+(Dilbert+Daily+Strip): RT was a serial talker. You would be trapped for hours while he strung together infinite, unrelated stories. Many of our regular customers knew better than to engage him in a conversation because it was almost impossible to get away from him once he started blathering about whatever popped into his head. He would begin talking about a topic, get busy with something and walk away, and come back ten minutes later still talking about the same subject. He would even talk to himself if no one was around to listen to him. It would have been funny if it wasn't so sad, pathetic and annoying.

   I could probably devote this entire post to RT, but I'll go ahead and jump to the end of his employment. After about 3.5 years at the store, RT put in his two week notice so he could ""focus on his schoolwork full time"". This lasted for a whole semester until he failed every class he took and gave up on university work. For reasons still unbeknownst to me, my managers hired him back to pick up where he left off. Fast forward 8 months, and RT took a week off for a vacation. First day he came back, he clocked in for about 2 minutes, and suddenly cleared out his locker and stomped out of the store, red in the face and shaking with rage. I asked my boss what happened, and he said that RT's vacation was unpaid, and RT expected it to be paid. In order to get a paid vacay, you need to have worked at the store for a full year (he hadn't, since he had quit and been rehired) and be employed full-time (he wasn't). He should have known this, but he was a bit lacking in the brain cell department, so he stormed out of the store in a blind rage. Total time of employment: 4.5 years.

* I've saved the best (read: worst) for last. There have been a lot of bad employees go through this store, but none of them have made me want to quit like this one did. We'll call her Raging Emotional Bitch. REB was a menopausal bitch on good days and a complete hormonal psychopath on bad days. I mean, she'd be all happy-go-lucky one minute, and would suddenly snap and start screaming bloody murder at you for something she imagined happening the next minute. She would get emotionally attached to every furry animal that came through the doors and would flip out if she even imagined someone ""abusing"" them. Customers that came into the store for feeder rats/mice would quickly learned not to ask her for them. If anyone said anything about feeding something furry to a snake, she would purse her lips and shoot daggers from her eyes at the offending party until they left. And that was on a good day.

   REB was always convinced that myself and the other pet dept. employees didn't give a rat's ass about the animals. She seemed to think that we would let everything in the store starve and/or dehydrate if she wasn't there to baby everything on a daily basis. On several occasions, she flipped out and began screaming at me because *I didn't give the mice enough food to last them until the next morning* (spoiler alert: I did). A more memorable rage of hers ended with her howling ""YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE ANIMALS LIKE I DO!!! EVERYTHING HERE WOULD DIE IF YOU WERE IN CHARGE!!!""

   She was also an animal hoarder in the making. Remember how I said she would get emotionally attached to everything? Most of those animals ended up going home with her. Nary a week would go by without her buying a hamster/gerbil/mouse/nibblonian because she couldn't bear the thought of someone else taking it home.

   Finally, after many a long talk with my managers, they decided enough was enough and hired someone else to replace REB. When REB found out that she was being terminated, she burst into tears and began screaming at everything that was unfortunate enough to cross her path.

So this motherfucker is walking around, muttering something about 'red shirts'. I should've stopped dead in my tracks and thought about this man's aggressive body language and hostile tone, but nope! Little ol' me was like ""I'm gunna make this customer smile!""

I approach the guy and asked if he needed any help this morning, and he just stared me down like I'd slapped his dead grandmother at the funeral. He didn't say a word for twenty seconds which made for an insanely awkward pause, because damnit, I'm human, I deserve a yes or no.

Earlier this week a middle-aged woman entered the store with her daughter. She was maybe 14-15 and seemed very shy, her mother did all the talking.

They were looking to buy a laptop for the daughter. Mother already decided on a model, so i got it for her and presented it to her and the daughter. They liked what they saw and decided to buy it. This is where the fun began.

The Laptop was 777€, so the mother decided we would have to give her something for free. The daughter saved all that money up on her own and if you buy expensive stuff you always get free gifts, that's just how the system works, right?
She asked for a mouse or a carry case, but being a sales assistant i couldn't just hand out stuff for free. Even if was in a higher position i couldn't because store policy tells us not to.
I politely explained this to the woman, but she didn't really care. It took her daughter so long to save up the money and she wouldn't leave the store without a gift.

I remembered we still had some nvidia t-shirts left that we usually give to customers when they buy very expensive graphics cards. So i offered to give her one of those for free.
I asked the daughter which size she needs. Before the daughter could respond the mother quickly answered the question for her.
""My size is L. Great, i can wear the shirt at the gym tommorow!""

I like leaving out specifically where I work, but it's easy to figure out sometimes. Anyway, I work at an overpriced clothing store, so I interact with a lot of interesting people. 

Like most places, we offer giftcards. In addition, third party stores also offer giftcards to our company, that includes four other different stores. Not that it matters, but it's obvious when someone brings in a third party gift card. That's what happened yesterday. 

I'm at the register and the woman is ready to check out, with one item. We had a big sale going on that day and she had a 25 dollar (third party) gift card to use. It would probably cover the whole purchase, so I take it from her and run it through. Declined. 

I try again, same thing. I asked if she got this card recently and she said she did. We both even mentioned that she JUST pulled the card off the cardboard-thing that's attached to it. So yeah, she just used it. 

Normally our registers automatically split tender, but I wanted to see what amount was on the card. It comes up as ""0.00""

Once I being to explain that something is wrong, she interrupts: ""So I can't use it then? You're telling me there isn't any money on it?""

""Yeah, it was declining it the first time. I wanted to check the balance on it and it says there's nothing""

""Yeah! But I'm saying... I can't use it now?""

""Correct""- and I turn the monitor around to show her what I'm looking at. Declined. 0 bucks. 

""This is ridiculous. Why isn't there any money on it?""

I tell her I have no idea and assuming this was a gift given to her, perhaps the card was never activated. Which is probably what happened. I end up explaining that. She's just staring at me.

I offer to call customer service on the back of the card and maybe get some more answers. I call, speak to an operator, and explain everything. She runs the numbers and says, ""Yeah, that was never activated. There isn't any money on it. But if she, or the person who gave it to her, has a receipt then they can get it activated""

I relay this info to her, still getting a cold stare. The second I tell her that ""it seems someone didn't activate the card when it was purchased, but! if someone has a rec-""

""So basically, this is your fault""

Time to abandon customer service. I put the phone down and tell her, 

""No, it isn't my fault that someone came in here with a card that doesn't have any money on it. It's the same thing if someone came in here and used a credit card that was maxed out; has nothing to do with me. See this? *(and I hold up one of our store gift cards, which is way different looking than the third party cards that you get at gas stations or grocery stores)*, this is one of our gift cards. We only give these out at the actual stores. What you have is third party card, something that you get at say, Walmart, but not at [Name of our store]""

I work as a Wireless sales associate selling wireless phones and accessories, however my store is small and so I'm usually in the back in Electronics helping out when things are slow in my area.


Anyways I'm helping customers when out of the corner of my eye I see a short plump woman (I'm 6'2.. She looked to be about 5'2) 
With glasses, and a Pink/Redish Robe on with slippers walking around.


Now this isn't a problem, you get accustomed to this kind of thing after working here. However just the way she was walking around looking at things, you could tell.... There was going to be trouble..


Now this lady also had a family Sized bag of generic Doritos she was eating, obviously she got it out of the food section of our store which is right next to us.
After a while she begins to walk over to the photo desk where An associate of mine is manning. She basically bypasses the line and asks  to pay for her chips, and a camera lens cover.


He calmly tells her to wait in line behind the people who were here before her and she kind of gives him a blank stare. She finally agrees an gets to the back of the line. She walks up to pay for her items tosses them on the photo counter an my co-worker begins to check her out. Her total comes out to be about $8 Dollars, she says ""WAIT"" and runs off and grabs a pillow pet (Stuffed animal that opens up to be a pillow)


And my friend adds it to her check out. Her total is now **29 Dollars**.
She proceeds to put her purse on the counter, an dig through it to find money. She grabs a hand full of bills and coins and gives them to my co-worker and he begins to count it. As he's doing this she continues to eat her Doritos while touching the pillow pet (getting Doritos residue alllll over it)


My co-worker tells her that she has only given him **4 dollars and 52 cents** and he needs more money to pay for her things.
Outraged she proceeded to yell that she has paid enough and to simply take the money. At this point I had left the scene as another customer had pulled me aside for help with a few movies and an ipad. 


I come back and find my bosses boss, behind the counter calmly explaining to her that she hasn't paid for her items yet and she needs more money. Or maybe she could put back the pillow pet and camera lens cover and just pay for the chips.


She furiously storms away from the counter as I'm walking by to go to my break. Without saying a word, she grabs my arm and attempts to drag me to the counter. I look at her and break free and ask her If she needs help with anything. She points to my bosses boss and proceeds to tell me He was being rude, disrespectful, harassing her and won't let her leave the store. 


I kind of look at my boss's boss with a apologetic look, figuring If I play along, maybe I can diffuse the situation. I proceeds to ask her what the problem is that caused him to be so ""rude"" and she explains to me in front of him and everyone else that she was simply trying to pay for her items and Leave, but my boss an fellow associate were making things hard for her.


I apologized and got behind the register and looked at the transaction taking place. She sat there furiously and I basically repeated what everyone else was saying. She needed more money, or less items....


She looked at my flabbergasted and told me she had everyone names, and that she was going to call and complain to corporate, (never happened) And stormed out of the store leaving her stuff behind... Including her purse...

I've come into contact with a lot of moronic customers, but this lady is definitely somewhere at the top.

So I work in the electronics section. Not too bad, and the people I serve are nothing like the ones I hear about at the front. 

So anyway, I'm walking around the counter area, and this nice old lady comes up to me and asks me where the mobile phones were. I told her where to go, she thanked me, and I went on about whatever it is that I was doing.

I decide to start some early recovery, and by the time I get to the phones, this lady is still there an she's looking at the phone cases. 

She turns to me and asks ""do you work here?"", ""yeah I do."" I was being nice because I was getting the impression she was beginning to lose her mind. She says to me ""I think there's something missing from this item"" and hands me a phone cover. I look at it and notice that just the tag it was attached to had fallen off and most likely disappeared into the abyss of beneath the shelves. It also looks like it had been on the floor for quite some time (from all the dust that was on it).

I begin to tell her that just the back cover is missing, and she starts to semi argue with me on how she thinks she's right and that something is missing. I show her the exact same item that's on the shelf and she sort of sighed. I asked her if she still wanted it, and she told me to leave it because she was going to buy all of them (there were about 10 and were on clearance). So I told her sure thing and started to help her carry them to the counter.

While we're walking there, she brings up the phone case she found and says ""Someone could have easily walked out of the store with that. Luckily I found it."" I smiled and said ""yeah luckily an honest person did"". We get to the counter and I'm about to ring up all the items, and she goes to me ""I think you should give me the case for free."" I thought she was joking and I semi laughed and said ""I wi-"" looked up and saw she was being serious. I told her I can't let her have something for free just because the tag was missing.

She begins to argue with me that she's frustrated that she's never spoken up before and for once she'd like to be rewarded for it. I kept saying that I couldn't give it to her for free, but I go ""look, the most I can do is give you a 10% discount"" she says okay and I tell her how much it'll cost after the 10% discount (keep in mind it was less than $5) and she said that it was still too much and she deserved more. She got me to call my manager, and he said to do 15% and that's it. Of course, this still wasn't enough for the lady. My patience is wearing thin at this point, and I started being really blunt with her saying ""Okay look, I can't give this to you for free. That's out of the question. They're all less than $10, and the one you found on the floor can be brought down 15%. That's it."" She seemed to stop arguing at this point, told me not to worry about ringing them up and that she wanted to lay-by them. She then told me she was going to write a complaint to the store. Cool story, bro.

End of the night, my manager comes up to me and tells me when I have a chance to go and read her complaint. It was pretty damn hilarious. It said something like ""I will no longer be an honest shopper at kmart."" We have created a criminal!!

The place, a large upscale mall in a heavily populated area. I had ""volunteered"" to work the opening shift for my store for the PS3 launch, I owed my manager a favor and figured the 5AM-12PM shift would fly by. 

I pull into the employee entrance to the garage and am immediately stopped by police and mall security. I let them know I'm an employee, and am working the launch today. I get let in by a guard who covers our store, and he gives me some details to what the hell is going on and why a SWAT team is at our mall. Seems over 3,000 people have lined around the mall. Everyone is trying to get in before the auto-lock doors open so they can get into our store and line up for the PS3. Here's the kicker, we have 12 PS3's. Half of which my manager has promised to his friends to begin with. I'm already thinking this is going to be a disaster. I told my boss we should have told everyone the 500+ people who have been waiting a week outside in crappy weather that we have a few units only, and there was no need for this madness. His logic was people would line up, and since they couldn't get a unit, they'd get something else instead. 

I make a quick tour of the mall, just to see what it's like when it's completely empty. I walk past a secondary customer entrance, hundreds of people see me start banging on the door, asking how the hell I got in. I quickly flash that I'm a mall employee and decide it's best to just head to my store. I was terrified they'd collapse the glass doors and murder me. Essentially I'm living in Dawn of the Dead. 

At 6AM the auto-lock on all 8 entrances in the mall open and the flood gates open. We purposely have kept our doors closed so we can try contain the madness as best as possible. I am standing in the store with my manager as I see people pushing and shoving, kids being used as battering rams, and strollers as death carts. I look up to see what's going on the second floor and that's when I see a 300+ pound man scale over the balcony. He makes eye contact with me, and I just shake my head no. But he gauges the distance to the ground, and leap to the 1st floor. Well his aim was off because he gets one leg land in the garbage pail. I'm thankful to this day that I never saw the actual damage his body took. Not one customer blinked an eye to help the guy. I ran to the back of our store and called 911.

The next 20 minutes were a blur, the police had to come in and create order. Paramedics came and hauled the guy away. We set up a ticketing line to give the ""first"" 12 people their units, which my manager took full responsibility for. I spent the rest of my shift that day answering calls and telling people we were sold out, we didn't know when we were getting another shipment, and no they couldn't reserve a unit. 

From what I gathered through mall management company, the guy broke both of his legs. He tried suing the mall because they created a dangerous and chaotic situation.

I tried a few other things, like carpentry and janitorial work, but this was the only thing that could guarantee me the hours and pay.

Well soon the hours started evaporating the more money I was making (some descent coin per hour by the end). But the company was not hiring any more full-time employees, so we were all subject to the whims of the schedule. Some weeks I'd get 35 hours, other weeks I'd get 10. This is no way to live, or save. Plus the management had changed, and a few of my fellow co-workers wouldn't lift a finger around the place to do what needed to be done (carrying stuff out for customers, hopping up on cash when lines got crazy). I brought all this to the attention of my supervisors, made proper complaints through the proper channels, and nothing changed for a year.

So I put in my two weeks notice right out of the blue, and I didn't tell a soul besides the management. I just wanted to slip quietly out of the place I had enjoyed working at, but had since given me one nervous breakdown, and a whole lot of miserable days and nights. But why are you leaving? The management asked. I just said I no longer wished to be employed by the company. This wasn't good enough for the higher ups, but that's all I gave them.

My last shift, literally the last hour, I'm up on cash and this fellow who reeks of stale cigarettes (you know the smell) comes through the till and tosses something on the counter. I ring him up, but he says it's supposed to be cheaper. He saw a sign. Now, this sorta thing happens where an old sale sign is left up. If it is, we take it down, and give it to them for that price with our apology. So I say, ""Oh, ok well let's see.""

Dude flips his wig. ""Whatdya mean let's see. You calling me a liar?"" No word of a lie, the dude jumped to that conclusion right away. ""Well, mate, it might be an old sign so I just need it brought here so I can ring it through for ya."" ""This is bullshit! You're disrespecting me, I don't even want it!""

Dude storms over to the front desks, and I can see him pointing at me and I just roll my eyes. Clearly he hadn't gotten the memo that I left all the damns I give in my other pants today. So the manager wanders up, he is not my favorite. Dude explains to him exactly how I was calling him a thief (not a liar this time) and how I was disrespectful.

Now here is where I wish I could have just dropped a bucket of urine on both of them. My manager totally throws me under the bus, on my last night there, and says ""Well, if it makes you feel any better he won't be working here tomorrow."" This sets him off even more, asking why I was even working here in the first place, etc. Clearly, manager realizes he said the wrong thing, and tries to calm him down and finally takes my side, explaining the procedure, etc LIKE HE SHOULD HAVE IN THE FIRST PLACE. Turns out, I'm right and he's wrong and he's an moron.

Dude has none of it, he storms out and as he's leaving I give him the biggest meat-eating grin I can. ""Have a nice night, sir!"" Dude stops in his tracks. I mean, I thought I heard tires squealing. He turns back around, marches right over to me and says, ""You know, you don't have to be such an @$$hole.""

I just sit there, shrug, not giving two flips and say, ""all I said was have a good night, Sir."" I stare him right in the eye like I've never gotten to do with any abusive, insane, and otherwise unpleasant customer up until that point. He just turns around and walks out, probably to go home, drink a bottle of dandilion wine, and cry himself to sleep muttering ""I'm tough, I'm tough... I'll show them.""

After my shift is over I walk over to my manager and throw my hands up in the air, like I just don't care. ""What the H-E-Double Hockeysticks was that? You tell him it's my last day? You didn't even want to pretend you had my back?"" I laugh in his face, walk right past him, and out the door.

A very good friend has since helped me get a lovely job at an insane cafe in town.

My previous job was as a key manager at a national chain record store and took a job at the smaller store after I moved because I thought it would be similar.  It wasn't.


The main difference is that this store was part pawn shop.  They sold pawned electronics, games, dvds, vhs, and stereo systems.  They also sold used music.  Pawning your items, as you may know, doesn't get you much.  DVDs we took in for about .25 .50, even new releases.  CDs came in at under $1.  


After I came back from lunch one day, the owner handed me a basket of DVDs and CDs with a roll of stickers.  ""Shrink these, then put on the stickers so they look new.  Put them in the new section.""  It was that kind of place.  If the DVD or CD wasn't scratched, we put it in fresh shrink wrap, put stickers on it, and sold it as new even though we only paid a few cents.  For reference, the markup at the time was huge, DVDs were usually around $20-$25 and CDs were selling for about $15 new.  


So I'm doing this slightly unethical thing because I was a grunt who needed money.  The stickers said things like ""Featuring the new hit single!"" and ""Billboard top 40!"" ""Nominated for Award!""  The kind of shit nobody really pays attention to, so if you didn't realize the stickers were usually customized to the CD, you wouldn't know you were getting a re-wrapped used CD or DVD.  


I came across a pretty rare CD, one from an artist who had become popular and released a limited edition CD of their early work.  It was a fan release, and something you just didn't see much of in stores but found at their show.  The CD was selling on Yahoo Auctions (yeah remember that, it was free so how eBay dethroned free I'll never understand!) for $45.   There was a problem though, when I opened the case, I noticed it was a burned disc.  The dumb woman paid for a burned CD which is illegal.  


I grabbed the disc and told showed her.  She became angry with me.  ""What did you take the real one out and put this one in? I bet that you did, I know that you like this band!""  I told her I most certainly did not.  She put the disc in the CD player and it didn't even play.  It was blank.  She yelled at me again, ""This is the kind of mistake that gets you fired, how could you buy a burned CD, how could you not look into the case?""  I told her I didn't do it, she said ""Of course you did, you are new, and that's why you make mistakes!""  I spend a few minutes pleading my case, she threatens to fire me, and then tells me to do the most horrifying thing imaginable.


""Shrink it, put on a sticker that says ""new"" and put it on the shelf for $25.  When somebody buys it and they tell us that it's burned we will tell them that's bullshit it was new.""    I can't even look her in the eye at this point.  I'd worked for a great chain before and as someone who was passionate about music in my youth, this hurt me.  I didn't want to deceive someone, I didn't want to rip someone off, I didn't want to break the law by knowingly selling this CD to someone.   I stammer, ""Well, that's not legal.""  The woman looks at me and says, ""Do it or go home.""  I should have just walked out there, but I've never been fond of unemployment and wanted to find a new job first.


I wrap the CD, put the sticker on it and put it on the shelf.  
I didn't sell the CD to anyone, but a few days later it was gone and I knew the scam had played out.  A co-worker relayed the story to me later, not realizing that our boss was the one in the wrong.  ""Oh the guy tried to tell us it was a blank CD pfft yeah ok man."" 


I felt like shit.  I started looking for a new job, took a few interviews and hoped for the best.  


A couple of weeks later I called in sick and was removed from the schedule without a word.  She didn't even have the decency to fire me, just took my name off the schedule and told a co-worker I didn't work there anymore.

In said deli, I worked in every area, depending on the day. On one particular day, I was working in the sub area while two other coworkers (both male) were working in the kitchen. 

A woman (who is known for being one of *those* customers) comes up to the counter that's part of the kitchen. Well, the boys in the back were a bit busy, so I went up to her and asked her if I could help her. She told me she wanted her rotisserie chicken cut up into quarters.

""Not a problem, I can do that for you,"" I said to her.

Then she looked at me and said, ""But you're not a boy! Only the boys know how to cut chicken. Go get me a boy who knows what he's doing!""

Wtf? Everyone in the deli is trained to cut chicken the same way, but I didn't feel like arguing, so I got her one of my male coworkers and went on my way.

Well, about a week goes by and this same customer comes by with her rotisserie chicken. However, I'm the only person working in the kitchen this time and everyone else is *very* busy.

She comes up to the counter and says she wants her chicken cut into quarters. I tell her I can do that for her and AGAIN she tells me how she wants a boy to do it.

I tell her I'm the only one working in the kitchen and the only one who can cut the chicken for her at the moment. She finally lets me do it for her, and I double check that she wants her chicken quartered. All is well. But then she noticed something: I had just taken more chicken out of the rotisserie just a few minutes before she arrived.

So this lady tells me to cut her one of the fresh chickens instead. I tell her okay but that it will take a few minutes longer because I don't want to burn my hands while cutting through the meat.

I cut everything for her (took about ten minutes because the chicken was FREAKIN' HOT). She watched about three feet away in silence.

Once I was done, I gave her back her chicken and she bitched at me for taking too long and for not cutting her chicken like the boys did.

I asked her if she would like me to cut another one for her and if she'd like to explain the specifics of how she wanted her chicken cut.

She gave out a heavy sigh and said, ""Next time, go find me a BOY!""",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_17nw9i,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/17nw9i/lady_doesnt_like_the_way_i_handle_her_man_meat/,

then, this is where it gets better, she asks if it's because he's black. now, when I helped them earlier, I found an older cd by him. so we had his music.

I apologize for the wall of text.

*A bit of background before we dive in...* I work in the footwear department of a sporting goods store. I am trained in telling people about what is the best running shoe for them, and therefore get to spend a lot of time talking to customers about their running. 

Now on to the tale!

I was working opening until around 4 today, and I am the only one in my department. That being said, I had about **5-6 tasks** that would take me most of my shift.I would easily be able to get everything done in a couple of hours, but it's during business hours, and we all know that customers will always come first in our daily activities.

Before noon, I'm with a few customers that need a bunch of help. I then get a call over the radio that there's a call for footwear. I respond that I'm helping a few customers and won't be able to tear myself away. One of my managers said they'll get it, and I return to answering questions and making displays at the same time. Not more than one minute later, they ask if we have a certain shoe (we do not). I don't hear anything else from my manager, and I continue on with my day.

Some 20 minutes later, I find myself getting something out of the backstock and notice 6 pairs of shoes all on hold for one lady, let's call her Martha. This is a new development, so I ask my manager about them. He said that he'll come over and explain it to me. Basically, I know that there's a tale to be told and I'm excited.

We'll call my manager Nathan.

Nathan says that the lady on the phone earlier might be stopping in. No big deal, but he has this look on his face that says otherwise. He believes that she might be a bit off in the head, and to just call if I need backup. To explain, he said that shortly after he told Martha that we didn't carry a certain shoe, she said ""Fine"" and hung up. Not two minutes later, she calls back and asks what are the cheapest stability shoes we have, he tells her which ones, and Martha tells him to put a size 10.5 on hold for her in those three styles.

Here's the thing, manufacturers will make a 10.5 for women, but almost never supply us with that size. We will get every half size up until 9.5, then get a few 10's and 11's, but no 10.5. My manager didn't know this, and put the 10 and 11 sizes for the shoes she asked on hold.

About an hour later, I see her in all her glory. She's wearing this leopard sweater and must be 300-350 lbs. Before I can ask her how she's doing or anything, she barks, ""I'm looking to spend $50, no more!"".

I'm thinking to myself, okay... well what item are you looking for? Shoelaces? Socks? Pedometers? I can't read your mind!

**Me:** ""Ma'am, what type of item are you looking for?""

**Martha:** ""Stability shoes""

For those who don't know, stability **RUNNING** shoes are made to provide slightly more cushion for runners to prevent things like pronation, overpronation, etc. (avoiding joint damage and what not while running). This might have been judgmental, but I wasn't really convinced that she knew what stability meant, even though we have explanations plastered all over our department. She seemed pretty firm that she wanted stability shoes, and I decided not to give the speech about the types of running shoes.  

I didn't want to argue, but here's the problem. Our stability shoes are usually more than $80 because of the design. I inform her of this. No response. She looks at the shoes, I tell her which ones are cheapest stability shoes (on sale for $79). She just stares. With bulgy eyes and a facial expression that has been burned into my memory. It's a state of confusion, but paired with the bulgy, beady eyes of rage. 

She then tells me to bring out the shoes on hold. 

I bring them out, juggling six boxes of shoes, but then she doesn't try them on. Doesn't even touch any of the shoeboxes. Then continues to complain about the prices. I explain about how the price reflects the quality and the technology, and suggest maybe looking at the clearance rack if there are any bargains (you never know).

She ventures over to the clearance racks, and keeps pointing out shoes asking if they're stability shoes. I usually know since they have been in the store and I am familiar with the product.

She is amazed at how I know if they are stability just by looking at them, but then turns around to complain about the price.

Martha finally decides to leave the store.

About a half hour before I leave, I get another phone call. Surprise, it's the same lady! Here's the conversation:

**Martha**: Hi, are you the same girl that helped me earlier with the stability shoes?

**Me**: Yes, it is. What can I help you with?

**Martha**: Well it turns out I went to another store and they have this pair of shoes. I tried looking on my phone to see if they were stability or not, but I can't find anything. Could you come over to (store that's about 1 mile away) and tell me if these are stability shoes?

**Me**: Umm... is that the store located (on main highway)?

**Martha**: Yes it is. I'm here right now and I don't know how to describe them. You'll just have to come over to the store to see them. It was amazing how you could tell they were stability just by looking at them.

**Me**: Okay, ma'am. Right now, I'm on the clock at my store and it would put my job in danger to just leave during my shift to go to another store while still punched in. If you would like to ask me questions about any of our products, you may come to our store and I'll be more than happy to answer them for you.

**Martha**: Well, can't you just punch out?

**Me**: Ma'am, I can punch out, but then I will not be getting paid, and an action like that can reflect poorly on my performance rating. I would like to keep my job since I do need the money.

**Martha**: But I'm here already and I don't want to purchase these if they're not stability. 

**Me**: Well, ma'am, in that case, you can always buy them and then return it to that store if they do not work out. I'm sorry that I couldn't resolve your issue, but I'm going to return to my customers that are looking to purchase merchandise in my store currently. We're open until 9:30 if you want to stop in, but I have to go. Have a great day!

I kind of felt rude, but I literally had customers who were looking to buy stuff from my store. I just really don't understand how that lady expected me to lose/threaten my job in order to answer a question... I still don't understand why anyone would ask this.

**TL;DR After dealing with the same customer for almost 5 hours, she finally goes to another store. Customer wants me to leave the store in order to help her at other store, while I'm punched in.**

Yesterday morning I went to yoga dressed in yoga leggings, a sweatshirt, and a pair of Toms. My hair was pulled back in a messy bun and I had no makeup. Right after yoga, I was invited out shopping, so I hopped on a bus in all my disheveled glory and went out with my friend.

We passed a shoe store that sells more expensive, higher end shoes. My black flats had fallen apart and I'd gotten many great reviews about this particular brand lasting a long time, so I decided to stop in to try on some shoes. A young woman of similar age came in right after me, and she was well dressed.

There were four people working in the store (that I could see). One immediately approached the other woman asking to help her, but nobody approached me. The other woman asked to try on many pairs, so another associate helped gather shoes from the back. I looked at the displays for awhile, then had to flag one of the associates down to ask for my size. They took awhile getting the pair of shoes to me and basically just tossed them at me, while the other woman was being helped with measuring/sizing.

In the end, the other woman walked out without buying anything, while I purchased the pair of shoes I'd tried on.

I don't expect sales associates to wait on me hand and foot, I realize they have other things to do and other customers often need help. But nobody said hello to me, nobody offered to help, and when I asked for assistance I was mostly dismissed.

But this weekend took the cake for most frustrating. 

This weekend I had to apologize for my WEIGHT to a morbidly obese woman who threw a bitch fit that I weighed a mere 110 pounds.

""YOU CAN'T WORK HERE! YOU THINK YOU'RE FUNNY? ARE YOU LAUGHING AT ME?!""

To clarify, my face was all shock and horror, I was not in anyway smirking, smiling or laughing.

She then proceeds to argue with my manager about how she should have her entire meal (~30 dollars) free for the inconvenience of stressing out over my weight. It was a sick ploy to guilt her into a depression, which would cause her to overeat, thereby spending more money at the store.

Seriously?

My weight was so much of an issue to you, that you wanted me fired?! 

This was only the beginning. 

A woman went through drive thru and gave our ordertaker/chasier 33 cents for a soda, which is a dollar. She quickly drove to the seconded window. 


The message come in through the headset

""Uh...aphrodite? The woman only gave me 33 cents.""

Ok, no problem. Maybe she made a mistake.

I open the window:

""GIMME MY SODA""

""I'm sorry m'am but it seems that the girl in back didn't receive the correct amount of change, you owe her about 75 cents""

""EXCUSE ME?! ARE YOU ACCUSING ME OF STEALING? GIVE ME MY STUPID SODA YOU CHANGE NAZI!""

I refuse again, repeating she owed 75 cents.

The woman swevers into a parking space and stomps out. ""WHERE IS THE MANAGER"" she screams at one of the girls waiting to clock in.

My manager goes over and sees what the problem is, i quickly briefed on the situation.

""I GAVE YOU 20 DOLLARS! CHECK YOUR CAMERAS! CHECK. YOUR. CAMERAS.""

Dave would rent 1 video each visit, but usually something tasteful to either satisfy his boring libido or to watch with the wife. A big fan of Vivid Video. Whatever, I'm the guy behind the counter, who the fuck am I to judge?

Anyway, Dave would always rent just one boring shitty tape each week. He's pay for a one night rental and invariably bring it back a few days late. Never long enough to get a phone call, but enough times that he was running a tab. Dave also, either worked as some sort of Pirate performer or REALLY liked Pirates.

A LOT.

Like, he would always come into the store dressed as one down to the bandana, scruffy beard and LIVE PARROT ON HIS SHOULDER. If you made the mistake of accepting the late tape from his hands, the fucking bird would squawk violently at you, stretching out its plumage to make sure you knew you were its bitch. 

This amused Dave mightily. It also forced me to rehire constantly because some of the kids concluded that $6.85 an hour wasn't worth dodging a cockfighting parrot. If you told Dave to just leave the tape on the counter, nothing ever happened.

Fast forward about a year and a half later and his late tab is up over $500, and my absentee owner starts to suddenly give a shit, says I need to get on his ass. His idiot brother in law who was busy running the other location into the shitter had also put it in his head that sales were down because I was skimming late fees and the owner makes the mistake of saying this to my face.

I respond: Okay ""Bob"", no problem, I'll get him paid up within two weeks. Translation: get the fuck out of my store you asshole. If I was gonna steal or skim, there's way easier ways of doing it than that.

A few days later, in comes Dave. I'm behind the counter, checking in new stock, and he of course is dressed as usual and with a tape in hand. I call him over since there was no one else in the store at 1pm anyway and I tell him that the owner's coming down hard on his tab. He says he doesn't have that kind of money right now and asks if he can make payments, to which I said, the owner wants his money in two weeks or he wants me to send him to collections.

He takes the bird off his shoulder and sets it down on the counter. Apparently that's what pirates do when they talk business.

he says to me that there's no way he can find that extra scratch so quickly, but maybe we can help each other out. My ass cheeks automatically fuse shut in anticipation of his proposal. He leaves the bird on the counter and heads out to his car saying he's gonna grab something and will be right back and won't obviously just leave the bird.

He comes back with this bag. Like a kitchen catcher bag, so bigger than a grocery bag but smaller than a trash bag. He says he thinks this bag will make it go away. I am no longer fearful of being violated, now I just hope it's not a gun because I'm not taking a bullet for $500 some odd dollars of some dirtbag's greasy porn money.

He says, the bag is worth over $1000, but no collection calls, no escalation, it's mine in exchange for wiping his lates off his account. I'm skeptical. He says to lock the front and back doors.

OK, now I'm freaked out, but I do it because WTF, am I going to refuse Cap'n Crunch?

With the doors locked, he pulls the bag's contents out: A 3 pound bag of weed. It didn't look like three pounds, but the heft was there. He put his dope inside of one of those medium sized space bags you'd only see on QVC or the shopping channel at the time; the kind where you fill it up with supposedly linens and sweaters, zip it closed and then attach  a vacuum hose to this spout on the bag to take out the excess air.

""These things are the greatest for dope. You'll be able to taste the Yucatan""

Touche. 

Decisions, decisions. I can refuse his offer and risk pissing off a guy who obviously knows some pretty gnarly dudes, or I can take it.

I take it. I clear his account and take the space bag up to the cottage that weekend. On night two, we're all pretty baked but I'm still bitching a bit about being accused to skimming late fees by Bob. My buddy Tony (who had been seemingly unconscious for 7 hours in a lawn chair, half his face sunburned) lifts his head up in a moment of clarity:

""Bro, didn't you just do that for this weed?"" 

I want to laugh but I can only muster, ""the right response is thank you, motherfucker""...and then I laugh uncontrollably, almost falling into a bonfire.

I work as a security guard in a big retail store. Part of being a security guard in this store is being very knowledgeable about the store and it's products because in the event that someone needs help then we must assist. Also if someone attempts to steal, we need to know what exactly is our product and with that I digress. 

So I was standing on the front doors when one of my coworkers approached me and informed me of a possible theft. He stated that some customers were currently on register paying for a $250 bicycle but they had a gel seat on the bike and it was missing the tag that has the price. My coworker also noticed that the customer was not going to make any attempt to pay for the gel seat. 

I alerted the other security guard of what was going on and told him to scrutinize the receipt for that customer. If he noticed that the gel seat was in fact on the bike but not purchased on the receipt then to please ask the customer if they have another receipt. 

Alright so the customer approaches the exit door and the other security guard asks for the receipt for the bicycle. He notices the gel seat cover on the bicycle and it wasn't purchased. He points it out to the customer, at this point I get closer to them in the event that the situation escalates. My buddy let's them know that the bike does not come with the gel seat and asks if they would like to purchase it. They continue to state that the bike seat does in fact come with the bike and they grabbed it from the area it was in as such. I then step in and asks what's the problem. The customer explains how my buddy is trying to accuse them of stealing. I explain everything again and tell them that if they want the cover then they have to purchase it and I would be happy to get them another cover which does have the tag on it. They agree to this after realizing their defeat. At this point, one of the customers gets very red in the face because he knows we're on to him. And his wife continues to act as if she doesn't know any better. 

I head over to the section where the seat cover is usually located and I look around the immediate area. Within a minute I was able to find the broken tag/package that encases the seat cover. I head back to the exit doors whilst holding the package behind my back. I get to the door and show them the package. The husband turns so red with embarrassment I swear he almost went purple. The wife's eyes bulges out so far in the most Wtf state. They agree to pay for the seat cover and they go on their merry way.

Tonight I am ready for this and waiting to catch the usual shelf.... Pull the trolley out and the next shelf over collapses instead.

I was working a day shift at a small ice cream shop which normally means not much will happen because we normally get most of our customers at night. A lady and her daughter (around 8-10 years old) walk in. Me and the other employee working at the time both walk up to her to say hello and what not. She tells us that she came in during the week and pre-paid for two ice cream cones because it was some sort of jewish holiday where you aren't allowed to buy things or something along those lines. We ask if she any sort of receipt or proof of purchase (the normal protocol would be for us to print out a receipt and write ""pre-paid"" with our signature). I can already tell that she is pretty offended by the question, she says she didn't have one because who on earth would try to steal ice cream. 

I go to the back and check if there's any notes or anything about her. Nothing. I go back to talk to her and see that she's giving an earful to the other employee. I tell her I couldn't find anything in back and that we cant really do anything for her. This makes her go crazy. She starts yelling and saying how we've offended her and that she feels like a victim. We try to calm her down by assuring her we aren't making any accusations towards her but she isn't having it. I tell that I'll go call the manager and see if he knows anything about this. I call him up and he says that he never spoke to her but to just give her the ice cream so she'll shut up. I walk back over and tell her that I'll give her the ice cream and to just remember to keep a receipt next time. For some reason this made her even more angry. She starts getting very aggressive towards me (she doesn't mind the other employee so much because she found out that she is also Jewish). She was telling me to go away because she felt threatened and to have the other person serve her but I didn't want her to get her way so I just told her that I work here so I dont have to go anywhere. We have an aggressive conversation about her trying to get me to go away but she finally gives up. I ask her what size cone ordered, she didn't know, so i just gave her mediums. Her and her daughter (who is visibly embarrassed) sit down to eat their ice cream.

I decided to have a little fun and went to clean the tables next to her so she could feel ""threatened"" some more.

We close at 9 PM on Sundays as compared to the regular 10 PM weekdays. So you can imagine how anxious the store crew is to leave...

At around 8:50, I get a call to help a customer with a crib.
First off, I'm in electronics, so I don't know anything about cribs. The customer, we'll call “Chirpy”, has a loud mouth and yells when she talks. Not angry, necessarily..
She was about 5'7” and 350 pounds. Her boyfriend/husband, on the other hand, was tall, lanky and looked exactly like Bubbles from Trailer Park Boys.

Chirpy wanted to purchase a new crib after demanding I grab the old one from her van. I go outside, set the box on the flatbed and bring it in. Apparently it was missing a few pieces (*surprise*) which is common at our store. I proceed to grab the new one and wait at the checkouts for her to exchange it. She looks at me with the most disgusted stare and tells me to open it. [Note: it's already passed closing time and she wants me to open this huge fucking box. [*sigh...*] I grab the box-cutter, slice tape, and **BAM**, Everything's there..
Bubbles then scrambles to the box, rips open all sorts of plastic and tape, then angrily explains to me what was missing in the other crib. I say “Okay okay, we'll help you get this in your van then you're set to go.”

Chirpy: “Then you're gonna come help take this up our steps and into the nursery room, right?”

I start laughing to myself (assuming she was only being facetious)

I didn't hear a join in laughter...

So I look up to see her with the straightest face and say “Well *we're* not gonna do it.”

Confused, I continue pushing the crib to the door... I thought to myself, “Did she really just say that?”
I meet Bubbles at the trunk of the van, help load it in and walk back into the store. This time Chirpy is conversing with a supervisor at customer service. I lurk by and 'damage out' the old crib. Chirpy tells me she's 5 months pregnant and can't walk up stairs due to her disabilities. 

[First off, I'm thinking “How in the *hell* is this my problem?]

She continues to blame me for any future defects of her baby and scorns me with a very mean look. 
At this point, I just wanna leave. So I calmly suggest our home delivery/installation services.
Chirpy, now very aggravated, says: “It's YOUR job to satisfy the CUSTOMER'S needs! If I call in tomorrow, and you're not here to build my crib by noon, I'm writing a complaint to your manager!”

My manager, now fully amazed at the customers lack of decency, points them to the exit and tells them to leave. Chirpy mumbles viciously out the store, giving up her attempt to slave me into building her freakin' crib. 

As she's about 8 feet from the automatic doors, I almost missed her **tripping over a cardboard Back-To-School stand.**

Not believing what I just saw, the cashier closest to her starts chuckling uncontrollably. The entire walk to the break room was the most joyful 40 seconds of my day.
**Karma's a bitch.**

It's fall of 2007. A fantastic new product just became available at America's largest retailer. New, high-definition films called Bluray discs are just gaining popularity, particularly among film lovers and PlayStation 3 users. 

Working as a Customer Service Manager, I greedily eye the boxes of brand new product, and drool ever-so-slightly when walking past the comparison display showing how awesome this new product is. 

We eagerly stock the shelves with several popular and new releases, with the awesome price of only $50-60 per bluray!! Painstakingly, we explain the importance of a higher standard of loss prevention, as the new products are relatively small and may be easy to hide. Our ragged crew of teenagers and stay-at-home man children blankly stare and nod their heads in agreement. 

On the front end, we explain the need for reinforcing the B.O.B. (bottom of basket) and L.I.S.A. (look inside always) policies, as some customers may forget they placed their new bluray discs in the plastic tote they purchased, or on the undercarriage of their cart.

About ten days later, I am heading to the back for a much-needed break and I notice that nearly all of the bluray disc racks are empty. I head to the electronics register and comment, ""Hey, those blurays are really selling, aren't they?"" The associate stares at me blankly, chuckles, and says, ""Oh yeah man, we can barely keep them stocked!""

To keep with the light mood, I offer to restock the blurays. The employee laughs, tells me to stop joking around, and turns around. I get a sense of foreboding, and ask the associate, ""(insert name), have you checked your department lately?"" He slowly turns around, irritated to get off his cell phone, and says, ""Of course man, why are you..."" and turns a greenish-white as he looks at the bluray display.

Mr. Oblivious then says, ""Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit shit shit shit ***SHIT***. Where are the fucking blurays?!! Please dude, tell me you and the stockers are missing with me. Fuck!!"" 

We quickly inform salaried management while counting inventory versus actual product. Loss Prevention pulls the tape and it shows a couple coming into electronics and loading a large Rubbermaid tote with blurays, all right behind the associate's back as he texted. The customers proceeded to snap the lid shut, and then fill a *second* tote, and a **third**. Three totes high, they wheel their cart to the front, and check out in the express lane (the cashier did not open the totes).

The customers then proceed to the exit, where the alarm is set off. The people greeter glances up, waves goodbye, and says a farewell. 

Final tally of blurays? Approximately $18-20,000 USD. Who got fired? No one. The same electronics associate still works in the same department, as well as the people greeter. The cashier was promoted to Customer Service Manager. The store manager got promoted to corporate the next quarter.

I was a teenager who did customer service and some light baking, ice the cookies, bake the cookies, help Mom X pick out the perfect Barbie cake for her sweet little princess 3rd birthday. Pretty boring stuff, a lot of smiling and talking about how delicious everything is.

So one day a woman comes in to pick up her very large cake and cupcake order. I go to the back, it's not in the freezer. I ask if she might have put it under a different name, answer is no. Check again, nothing. I ask if she might have the wrong day. Nope, today is the right day. Up to this point she's being very polite with me. (She is probably a 65 year old black woman wearing pearls and this lovely dress, she was really stunning) I grab my manager and make small talk while he looks for the order. He comes back and says they have no record of the order, does she have the receipt. She does. It's about a $180 order spanning 2 large cakes, cupcakes, custom cookies, and cannoli tray. Now she's mad. Apparently it is her granddaughters 16th birthday at a golf course clubhouse in a few hours with 150 some guests. She wants her sweets and she wants them now. My manager is apologizing and telling her that they will make the cake right away, at a discounted price. (luckily the cakes and cookies were separate sections within the bakery and those were made, the only things missing were the cakes and the cupcakes.) This woman is NOT having it. She is screaming that ""black women like cake too"" and the company was ""racist against well standing women, let alone let them be black"" and she just went on and on. My manager finally called the store manager who decided to comp the entire order and have it delivered to the golf course when it was all ready.

Fast forward like an hour, everyone bangs out the cakes and cupcakes faster then I have ever seen. I get the lucky job of delivering the order to the golf course, which is maybe a mile away. I arrive, nasty in my uniform and the woman greets me at the door we carry stuff in I help set up whatever blah blah. She looks at me and hands me a $100 bill and asks me to stay for dinner since ""I know what it is like to be an oppressed woman living in a stereotypical environment being bossed around by misogynist racist men."" (or something like that, my diction isn't as proper as hers.) I'm not allowed to accept tips or do anything while on the clock, but man was that woman a hoot. 


SORRY THAT IT IS LONG

Edit: Apparently I'm the only person in the world that wouldn't take the tip. CURSE YOU YOUNGER SELF

Also, as written somewhere in the comments I wrote about the receipt. The cake order is taken on a paper receipt, the top copy goes into a date separated file folder thingy and the pink copy goes to the customer for when they pick up the cake. Her order was placed into the wrong day, well right day just a month later, so the customer was in the right, whoever took the order just doesn't know the months.

I work in a gas station that is part of grocery store, you know one of those little huts at the end of the parking lot where the attendant is behind glass and you have to pay through a drawer.

Well a few weeks back this guy comes to the window and asks, ""How much is two packs of special blends?"" 
We sell a lot of those so I know that the price for a single pack with tax is $3.98. So after a little mental math I tell him that they're $7.96 after tax.

He then says, ""Nah, just give me one pack."" So I ring him up and take his money and just as I send his change and cigarettes back through the drawer he says, ""You know what go ahead and give me two packs."" 

I say ""That's no problem, it'll be $3.98 more."" 

Then all of the sudden he's mad and yelling, "" What? No! It costs more if their on two different orders! You said two packs was $7.96!""

At this point I'm dumbfounded. I try to come up with some sort of reasonable explanation of why this man is yelling at me, but finally realize he's just a moron. So I calmly explain that it's the same price no matter if it's on two orders or not and that 3.98x2 is in fact 7.96, but my rational thinking seemed to make him angrier because he continued yelling and cussing at me and finally demanded his money back. 

Well at this point i'm fed up and really want to put this guy in his place, but if working at that gas station has taught me anything, it's that when you really want to piss off an angry customer be sarcastically nice. It works every time and you can't get in trouble for it. 

So I put on the fakest smile I've got and say, ""Sir, you've already purchased that pack of cigarettes and there is your change, but if you want another then it's $3.98. Otherwise, Have a nice day and thank you for shopping with us."" 

He admits defeat. Grabs his cigarettes and storms off.

At that point a few more people were waiting in line and witnessed the whole thing. The first guy walks up and says, ""Man, if I were you, I'd have come out here and knocked that guy the fuck out. What an Asshole.""

In their hands is a relatively new-ish laptop devoid of dings or scratches. They do not have their laptop's charger.]

[IRF finishes dealing with the customers in front of IC. IC manages to cross the five foot distance with something approaching light speed, the subsequent sonic boom knocks product off of the shelves and causes a baby to cry. It may also only be occurring in IRF's head. IC slams their computer down on the counter.]

IC: This is broke. I want a new one.

IRF: Well, why don't we see if there's anything to do with this one first, yeah?

IC: Fine.

IRF: Do you have your charger with you?

IC: *No.*

IRF: Alright, I'll grab one for you.

[IRF procures a compatible laptop charger from The Swamp of Tangled Chords, sidesteps The Rodents of Unusual Size, and returns back to the counter, adventure completed. IC doesn't even acknowledge the completion of the quest; must be bugged.]

IRF: Alright, let's boot this thing up and see what's going on. While I'm waiting for that, can you kind of explain to me what's been happening so I know what to look for?

IC: It won't go on the Internet anymore, it's broke.

[Flashes of past conversations rise and fall in the mist of IRF's memories, and he suppresses a sigh. He attempts to use his words to head off The Troll of Irrepressible Righteous Indignation at the pass.]

IRF: Alright, and how long ago did you buy this computer?

IC: About four months ago.

IRF: Okay. Just to let you know, if the problem with your Internet connection is *hardware*, and by that I mean if an actually *physical piece of the computer* is malfunctioning, then what [BRAND OF THE COMPUTER] requires we do is send it to them for repair. Because it's less than a year old, that repair would be free, but the process can take anywhere from two to six weeks.

[IC begins raising up out of their seat.]

IC: Excuse me? I'd be without my computer for six weeks? That is just unacceptable I can't even-

[IRF interrupts.]

IRF: Now, I have no idea if that's the case. It's also possible that it's a software, such as a virus. If that's the case, the unit would not have to be shipped anywhere, and we could do the repair in-store. Typically, this takes a day or two.

IC: That sounds a BIT more reasonable.

IRF: Yes, but unfortunately, viruses and software issues are NOT covered by any sort of warranty. Removal of the virus would be done at cost to you.

IC: Now wait a minute! But I bought this extended warranty deal that was supposed to cover everything! I refuse to pay anything for it if that's the case, because I have this warranty!

IRF: [Sir/Madam], what you purchased is an extended *hardware* warranty that also covers accidental damage. It does not cover virus removal.

IC: Well then *what did I even buy it for*. What's it even good for?

IRF: Well, if you were to spill soda or drop it on the ground, even two and a half years from now, it would cover the repair of the physical parts damaged by those actions. But it still wouldn't cover a virus removal.

IC: Well, what if I just went outside and threw it on the ground, then? You'd have to give me a new one, huh?

[At this point, IC has started to lightly grab their computer, and has a victorious smirk on their face.]

IRF: As I said, the warranty covers *accidental* damage, and because you've now given me reason to suspect that any physical damage to the computer in the near future would have been inflicted intentionally, that would have to be noted by me and taken into account by the Nerd Patrol when billing the repairs to your computer.

[The smug look has now disappeared from IC's face.]

IRF: Additionally, even if you did that, assuming your hard drive was still intact, you would still need to pay for a virus removal to get your computer back to working condition.

[IC's smug look has now been replaced by a White Walker's cold rage.]

IRF: Ah, I see now that what you have on here is indeed a virus, it looks to be a fake anti-virus virus.

IC: Yeah that! You sold me this virus software and it doesn't even work! Why did I even get anti-virus stuff if it wasn't going to work! I should get a refund on that!

IRF: Well, no virus protection can be 100% effective, as new virus code is being written constantly to circumvent it. Anti-virus software costs are not refunded.

IC: Then why should I even have anti-virus, huh?

IRF: Because it protects you from the literally millions upon millions of bits of malicious software that have been written and already been stopped. If you didn't have anti-virus, odds are that you would have contracted a virus even more quickly than you already did.

[IC's rage has dimmed, and is now a bit of a infantile, neutered sulk.]

IC: Whatever, I'm taking it to [LOCAL COMPUTER STORE].

IRF: Sounds good!

[Card reads: Four days later.]

[IC reenters IRF's line, he holds his computer and his charger in his  hand. He looks defeated, as if he has been captured by Browncoats, given up information without a fight, and then returned to his Alliance officers.]

IRF: How can I help you?

IC: They wanted to charge me $100/hour to remove the virus and said it could take them up to four hours and it wouldn't be back to me for a week.

IRF: So you're saying you would you like to pay the flat-rate $200 virus removal fee?

IC: [His soul slowly slipping nearer and nearer the event horizon of Crushed, Bitter Acceptance] Yes.

Then one day I was working a miracle happened, 3 appeared in a drop-shipment.  We only had 5 pre-order customers left.  So the decision was made to phone all of them and let them know they had a chance.  Within an hour I watched Gameboy #3 walk away in the hands of happy customer just as the 4th remaining pre-order walked up.

Me: I'm so sorry ma'am, but we just sold the last one.


PreOrder: I had it reserved!  YOU CALLED ME! *insert fuming rant I can't recall precisely*


Me: I apologize, but there's a shortage of Gameboys.  There's just not enough for everyone who res-


PreOrder: I bet damn Nintendo is just holding them all back like Cabbage Patch Kids...

I think my mind snapped at that moment, for I never treated a customer like this before nor again.  Several weeks earlier, on 9/21 to be precise, a devastating [Earthquake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/921_earthquake) hit Taiwan killing 2,415 and injuring 11,305 plus billions in damages.  I recalled from a Bloomberg or NPR news story that one of Nintendo's factories was leveled as well.

Me (softly): Their factory was destroyed in the Earthquake.


PreOrder: huh?


Me: In Taiwan a couple of weeks ago...


PreOrder (snapping): They should fix the damn thing?! Don't they know it's Christmas!




With more venom I thought I was ever capable of, the following words left my lips, ""Lady, I'm sure they'll get to it as soon as they can after dealing with the **thousands of dead**.""

She went dead silent staring at me for a moment before awkwardly slinking away.  I can only theorize that her lack of response was that she assumed I was of Taiwanese descent due to my skin tone.  I'm Thai actually.

~~I never did anything like that before or again.~~  I ~~think my mind~~ just snapped after dealing with the unending parade of upper-middle class rich assholes my entire tenure there.  The store was located smack dab in the middle of a area booming with yuppies with too much money and too little sense.  It was an awesome day when I found out the store had the best sales in the district yet the worst customer service rating.

We had some pretty insane rules about 'catching' someone stealing and what you could do about it. It wasn't enough to KNOW they had a pair of shoes in their bag, you had to watch them put the shoes in the bag and then (I guess) kindly ask them to follow you into the back. If they agreed to go with you into the back of the store and wait for police to arrive you were good! Hooray, you caught a thief. If they ran, you were out of luck. If they said, ""no, I would rather not go in the back with you"" you were out of luck. 

We often worked one person in the store at a time during the day since the associates were all in high school and we were painfully slow. Sometimes there would be two of us during the day. 

One day a group of pretty rough girls came in and very obviously were planning on taking shoes and not paying for them. They had been in before and if you tried to talk to them they would flip out pretty dramatically. (It was not within my authority to ask them to leave and not come back, thanks, corporate.)

One day my 4 foot 11 coworker got a little feisty and approached these girls in a kind of up-front way. Think, ""I know what you're doing, put those down, get out of here"". The girls went apeshit. ""I WILL PUNCH YOUR LITTLE ASS OUT. I WILL CUT YOU. BITCH, GET AWAY FROM ME!"" I'm a pretty small girl so that was enough for me to step away from the situation and urge my coworker to do the same. 

Later we told our GM what had happened. Her response, ""You should have let her punch you. Then you could call the police. Seriously, then they couldn't do it again. Next time, let them punch you.""

I'm sorry, what? No $75 pair of shoes is worth letting 3-4 girls punch me in my face. No thanks. 

The following week I told a clearly physically disabled 12(ish) year old to get out of the store because I could see he was trying to steal... He went to the hypermarket next door and came back brandishing a KNIFE he had stolen and an old woman chased him down outside. 

I was finally allowed to call the police. I also quit that day. 

tl;dr - Threatened by a gang of ruffians, was told by my manager I should have let them physically assault me in order to protect the shoes they were planning on stealing in the future. Threatened by knife-wielding disabled boy and decided it was time to quit.

I work for a smallish company that rents equipment to conventions and other events. Our office is one out of about 5 suites in a single level warehouse building.  Our building's location is a bit odd, we are off of a main road but our street is over a mile long and we are at the very end of it. There are 2 other very small buildings about half way up our street, the rest is just grass and a few trees. It's basically unnecessarily long and empty. The only reason anyone besides employees would enter our suite is usually because they are trying to sell us something. 

One extremely hot day last summer, I was sitting in my office talking to a client on the phone when a middle aged black woman whom I didn't recognize came down our hallway and started to walk into my office. My co-worker had already noticed her and walked up behind her, asking if he could help her with something. Without even looking back at him, she kinda waved him off and did that thing that people do when they're drunk and trying to steady themselves, like she closed her eyes for a few moments and kind of cocked her neck back for a second while grabbing onto my door frame for balance. I was completely confused because I didn't know her and from her body language so far she appeared to not only be intoxicated but also adamant on talking to me. She took a few more steps into my office (I'm still on the phone at this point) and then my co-worker was able to guide her back into the hallway to find out what she needed. 

I was stuck on the phone unfortunately through most of her visit, but my co-worker relayed the story: After coaxing her out of my office and asking her again if he could help her with anything, she told him how she saw our big red ""SALE"" sign down the street and wanted to see what we had for sale. He tried to explain that the sign could not have been ours since we are in the business of equipment rentals, but she was insistent that we were having a sale (did I mention there are 4 other suites in our building?) My co-worker's a nice guy so he humored her a bit and tried to explain what we do, all the while subtly guiding her towards the front door. She kept asking him for the price of random things around our office, like our motivational picture, our guest chairs, a printer, etc. He said she seemed drunk and apparently just wanted to buy *something*, I guess it didn't matter what. She spent about 10-15 minutes in our office altogether, the last few haggling over items that we had no intention of selling. Nothing he said could convince her that we weren't a retail store. I think he finally had to lie and say that he thought the 'store' next to us was probably having the sale because she just didn't want to leave. 

When I left work that day, I was curious to see who's ""SALE"" sign the woman had seen and mistaken for us. I drove up and down our long ass road a couple of times before I finally spotted it: at the corner of our street and the main road, there was a large red Real Estate company's sign advertising that the small grass lot on the corner was for sale. So basically she was walking down the main road, saw a real estate sign, then walked over a mile in the sweltering heat down a nearly vacant road to our building, picked our suite as the one that must be having a sale, and refused to believe otherwise.

When you work in a system that punishes you for not selling enough add-ons, you learn to hate those things.

So this guy comes in with the coupon, and is just a general ass in the way that people are general asses when buying electronics from people who have to sell extended warranties. He'd cut me off when I was trying to go through my pitch, did that thing where he slapped the coupon and the ad down on the counter saying ""get this for me"" and just was a general jerk while I went though everything I needed to before my boss would get me a laptop (my boss didn't believe in lost causes, so even if they were screaming ""NO NO NO NO"" the whole time I had to keep explaining things until he was satisfied. If he was not, he'd send me back out to continue trying to sell things to a customer that clearly did not want them).

While I'm in the back arguing with my boss that I did indeed explain the benefits of our extended warranty, and it's hard to qualify them for a laptop if they hand me an ad and a coupon for that specific laptop, so no, I did not get his life story, the customer goes and gets $100 worth of merchandise. I ring him up for his laptop and other stuff and hand him his receipt.

He then says ""Now I need a receipt just for the laptop."" I explain that there was no way for me to give a receipt for just one item, but I would be happy to return the laptop and ring it up by itself, he agrees and then we have this exchange:

Me: Okay I'll now put $400 back on your credit card.

Customer: $400? That was a $500 laptop!

Me: Yes, but you only paid $400 for it, don't worry I'll re-apply the coupon on the new order.

Customer: I didn't use the coupon on the laptop, I used it on all of this stuff. Look, all I need is a receipt showing that I bought this $500 laptop. Are you going to do that for me or not?

Me: The only way I can do that is if you pay $500 for the laptop.

Customer: I did pay $500 for the laptop, then used the $100 discount to get all of this stuff.

Me: You actually paid $400 for a laptop and then bought $100 worth of merchandise, see? It's itemized on the receipt.

Customer: Here's the thing, my company is reimbursing me for the laptop, so I need a receipt with just the laptop.

Me: I can do that, but the total will be $400.

Customer: (screams in frustration) You can make me a fake one right?

Me: No

Customer: Fine, you just lost a customer!

He then walks out with his laptop and I cancel the refund.

I was working the front counter one day all alone, which is not a big deal I do it all the time,  the drive thru had plenty of people helping to move things along, and the back drive thru had 2 people, one taking orders and 1 taking money.

Well, I'm going about my day, when things start to become much busier, my line starts to become much longer and I'm doing the best I can possibly do to take the orders and then get their food out, but the line is becoming ruthless. It looked like it was never going to stop. Now typically front counter is never that bad and I may have 5 people in my line at one time, but today I had about 20 people with only me to help them. 

Realizing that I can't possibly do this alone, I take a few seconds to go to the back and ask the manager if I can get some help, as the line is extremely large, she was counting tills and seemed preoccupied and really just flat out told me I couldn't get any help, which I knew was bullshit, as I could get someone from back drive thru, as it only takes one person to take orders and get the money, but I go back to the front to face the raging crowd.

I'm doing the best I can do, but the line is visibly becoming more and more aggravated, people start complaining about the wait and I apologize for the inconvenience, but I'm doing the best I can do. Some customers take much longer to order, so I cannot give other customers their food that is up, so they are forced to wait longer. 

Then this middle aged customer comes up obviously angered, so I know it's coming, he tells me to get my manager, so I fetch my manager who tells me she'll be there in a second, so I go back to the front and tell the man to just wait there for a second for my manager and I continue to get food to the customers and take their orders.

Then finally, my manager walks up and I thought the man was going to be complaining about me doing a poor job and making so many people wait, but quite the contrary, he starts yelling at my manager for not getting someone to help me in the front, he even goes as far as saying that I was doing an amazing job, but it's was not my fault I could not possibly help all these people, I start smiling, as this made my day, I was becoming a little stressed over the abundance of people in the store, but this took a lot of stress off of my back.

My manager, who after the customer just chewed out, decided to actually do her job now and got me some help, I go and thank the man and I was able to get things moving in the front counter with another person helping me. 

Customers have so much more power than the workers and I love it when the know they do as well, sometimes. I was so thankful that man spent a few minutes to help me, when he had already had his food.

I finish checking out and I gotta take a deuce(like, fast.) The bathroom has two stalls, one was occupied. I go in and there is. Piss. Fucking. Everywhere. On the seat, on the floor...

Other guy wasn't done yet and I REALLY had to go, so I go over to the paper towel dispenser to grab some towel to clean the seat off. It turns out to be one of those fucking electric eye ones that won't just let you turn a handle to dispense a useful amount of paper towel, so I'm sitting there putzing with it trying to get enough.

While I'm doing that, an employee walks in(pretty sure he saw me leaving that stall) and goes RIGHT in the piss stall. I thought about warning him, but he was clearly in similar bowel distress, and besides I would have been fingering myself for the crime. The guy in the other stall finishes right about then and I've got the runs so I can't get in there fast enough. 

While I'm sitting there squirting, I can hear the employee in the piss stall grumbling and cleaning it up with the tiny little toilet paper, wiping the floor and everything. I don't think it was even his job to do, but he did it anyway, thinking the whole time I was the culprit and not saying a word, even though he knew I was in the next stall.

I have many blood-boiling stories about people with false senses of entitlement, but this one takes the cake - simply due to my reaction. 

I got off at 8:00 PM and it was 8:20 PM. And the only reason I was staying late was because the CSM (Cashier Manager basically for those unaware) decided to have me give someone a 15-minute break five minutes before I get off work. It sucked, but I figured, ""What the heck? I could use the extra money and what's ten minutes going to do? It probably won't kill me."" I had forgotten, but this particular cashier was amazingly notorious for taking longer breaks than actually allowed. She was pushing thirty minutes and I was getting pissed off. Not so much that I was having to stay later than I originally anticipated, but the principle. I never took a break longer than fifteen minutes. I would go to the bathroom, get a small bottle of water, drink it, then go back to work. Mine were normally less than fifteen, but I digress.
 
I was working the express lane this day (twenty items or *fewer*. Not always super enforced but sometimes people are just outright exceeding it). Two women walk in my aisle with literally two and a half cartloads full of merchandise - ranging from housewares to bedding to groceries - clearly exceeding twenty items. Normally I have a rather apathetic attitude towards this type of thing, but there was the issue of me being there when I should have already left, and there were two customers asking me - within easy earshot of *snootydum* and *snootydee* - why they were being allowed into the line. 

It was at this point I decided to see if I could get dum and dee to go to a different line - one that not only doesn't have that restriction but is better facilitated for a large amount of items (conveyor belt, larger surface area). 

**Me**: Ma'am I'm sorry but this line is twenty items or less.

**Dee**: Oh no one ever follows that anyway.

**Me**: I apologize, but I'm going to have to ask you to find a different line. Register 14 right next to us is open with only one person in it, and it will better suit a purchase of your size.

**Dee**: If you don't like doing your job, find another one.

I laughed.

Why did I laugh you ask?

Well something I didn't tell you the reader - perhaps because I like to write something that I'd like to read - was that this day was in fact my last day at work for this company. It was the last day of my two-weeks notice and I was going onto bigger and better things. I had already signed my ""termination"" papers on my last break two hours prior and done everything except turn in my badge. 

As I'm laughing, the woman displayed a bewildered scowl on her face.

**Dee**: And just what the hell is so funny?!

This is the highlight of my speaking-fast-while-under-pressure-almost-like-I'm-in-a-movie career. By this time I had put the lane-closed sign down because the other customers who didn't want to wait had left. Also the cashier who I was giving a break to - normally they would come back to the same register - somehow had been put on a *different* register which meant I was going to get off god knows when. Obviously this is paraphrased.

**Me**: What you don't know, and is amazingly coincidental, is that today *is* in fact my last day. And if it weren't for a cashier who can't responsibly manage her time you wouldn't have even seen me today. That said, I am actually already ahead of you on your advice and have another job I'm starting Monday. So to that end, as I previously mentioned, this register is only for people who have at most twenty items. There's a lot more things I could say to tell you how I feel about the type of person you are and how you treat other people, but I have a feeling it would never sink in past your arrogance. I truly hope you have a better day than you clearly have.

I turned around, walked out of my register to the back of the store, left my badge on the personnel director's desk and waved bye to the people who I had enjoyed working with. 

I also noticed that the two women were talking to the front-end manager and Dee (the one who was the big antagonist) was pointing in a random direction while somewhat shouting. 

I went home, cracked open a beer, and played some World of Warcraft.

TL;DR Women try to go through 20 items or less lane with **WAY** more than 20 items. I ask her to find another line she tells me to find another job. I tell her I already have and today is my last day, then leave without helping her.

I had taken a job at an Illegal made-to-order burrito type place which happened to be located on a street that always had a lot of late-night pedestrian traffic.  We were open until 2:30am so we could catch the last call rush and were also only one of two places in the entire area that was open past midnight.

Needless to say, every weekend we would get quite a lot of drunks right around 2:00am.

So it's about 2:15am on some random night.  I hear the door open and I turn to look and see 4 obviously wasted guys walking through the door.  Cool.  Nothing like a good late-night burrito to send you off to drunken slumber.  

I get through the first 3, no problem.  Then the last one, whom we can call GBM, stumbles over and asks for a chicken burrito with everything on it.  Now, we actually got this a lot; people asking for everything on it.  And usually, after I explain that it will include everything they see before them, they chuckle and then become more specific in what they actually want.  Not this guy.  GMB still asks for EV-ER-Y-THING.  Just like that.  I almost couldn't help from laughing since it reminded me of The Sandlot.

So I ask him one last time.  At this point, all three of his friends are just watching him, shaking their heads, and waiting to see what he really asks for.  Nope.  This guy wants it all and won't settle for anything less.  So I make this soupy mess of a burrito and can hardly roll the damn thing up.  I end up having to use three different tortillas to keep it from oozing all over the place.  It's now the size of a bowling pin and barely holding together.

GBM gets to the register and sees the total and immediately starts causing trouble.  The burrito was something around $25.  I calmly explain to him that this is why I asked 3 different times if he was sure he wanted everything and he just looks at me and starts yelling about how he didn't want *all* of this.

I'm about ready to tell the guy to leave, but one of his buddies comes walking up behind him and lays his hand on his shoulder.  GBM turns around, looks at his friend and goes, ""Can you believe this shit?  $25 for a fucking burrito!  And look at it!  I can't even eat that thing.""  I'm preparing to have to kick all of these guys out as the other two, still sitting at the table, are also looking over and watching with interest.

Well, the friend with his hand on GBM's shoulder looks him square in the eye and says, ""You're going to eat that fucking thing and we're not leaving until you finish it.""

GBM's face is priceless.  You can see the gears turning and the realization that maybe he's the one being the prat.  He turns back to me with his head down and asks for a glass of water with his burrito while handing me his credit card.

Sure enough, he sat there and ate (practically) the entire thing while his buddies just laughed.

Despite my dislike for children, the occasional kid ended up being ok.  You could tell their parents raised them right, they knew how to behave, ask nicely, didn't yell, etc.  Every once in a while a parent would come in with a mentally handicapped child looking for games that they could play without too much trouble.  Most of the time, it wasn't too hard to find something, but it was a struggle to either find out what the kid liked, or get the ok from the parent.  This was made more difficult because 90% of the time it was only the mother or father, and they didn't want to take the chance of the other parent sending them back.

This one night, a semi regular customer came in with his son.  I don't know what the disability was, I just knew to take extra time, not to call attention to the stutter, and let my patience run free.  The dad was flustered and I could see in his eyes that he was hoping I wouldn't snap.  His son was looking at used Game Boy Advance games and just kept asking for wrestling titles.  His father kept giving very frustrated versions of no, and would ask me what else is good for him to play.

I asked what he had, and once they told me, I named the best WWE game he didn't have yet.  The kid's eyes immediately lit up, and he asked if I was a wrestling fan.  I told him I was, and he asked who my favorite wrestler was.  I told him The Undertaker(This was maybe 8 years ago, currently it's CM Punk for those keeping score), and he yelled that's his favorite too!  We launched into an extensive conversation about current storylines and his dad tried to cut us off, and I wouldn't have it.  They ended up getting the game, and his dad thanked me privately for everything and going along with it.  I told him it was my pleasure, and that I actually AM a huge wrestling fan, so it was like I wasn't even working.  You could see the relief in his eyes, he knew he'd found a store and an employee that he knew he could return to and get a personal experience where him and his son would be treated as they should.

This happened last week, on Friday. I am the assistant manager of an ice cream/fast food restaurant. The store manager had left me a note several days before that we would be having a bus of 50+ track/field athletes and their assorted coaches at a 9pm after their event in town ended. Fine, okay, no problem, thanks for the advance warning. 

So Friday arrives, and we are totally slammed. It's one of the first warm days in my area of the country, and we are essentially the only ice cream place in town. The head coach calls around 8:15, and tells me that he's going to be late; their event is running long. They won't be in until 10pm.

Honestly, I'm a little relieved. We were so busy from 8:00 to about 9:30 that it would have been terrible had they come in at their initial time. The store was packed with people and we were, as always, one person short on the schedule. The store echoes with noise and the counters are a lake of milk. 10pm would be ideal, I tell the coach.

The rush dies down and I immediately hurry myself and the crew into stocking and cleaning like crazy; we have to prepare for the imminent arrival of The Bus. My grill cook starts to prep extra meat and fries, and all of my ice cream workers stock flavors and toppings as fast as they can. The phone rings again - now they won't be here until 11 pm. 

At this point, everyone in the store is exhausted from the day, and our store closes at 11pm. If a party of 50 gets here when we close, we're all guaranteed a long night after an exhausting day filled with hundreds of customers. Our company's closing rules have exemptions for special occasions, however - and a party of 50 starving athletes definitely counts. We all brace ourselves and start to clean and stock. 

So we wait. We clean what we can to get ready for closing afterwards, and the grill cook makes a bunch of extra burgers, as the coach had specified they'd be eating a lot of food and ice cream. 11:05....11:10....11:20, and they're still not here. We're all starting to get anxious. We have a ton of product prepped and we can't exactly afford to just throw a ton of food away. My hands are tied.

I call the store manager and ask her how long she wants us to wait for them before we officially close. At this point I've closed the drive through, but we're still serving walk-ins because I just can't afford to throw all that meat away. Store manager says go ahead and close. It's 11:40 at this point, and I am walking up front with my keys in my hand...*and the bus pulls in*. 

With dread in my heart and my keys back in my pocket, I move my people back to their places - a couple on the grill, a couple on shake making, and myself taking the order on the register. They're all on the same ticket, which can get very confusing, and it's a tax exemption, so I can't afford to have anyone else ringing it up. 

The orders go as all 50+ person orders do - loudly, and with a lot of bedlam. They order a massive amount of food - double cheeseburgers, bags of 5 burgers, large fries, large shakes all around. We end up having to cook more food even after preparing for their arrival. By the time I have totaled the order and accounted for the tax exemption and the free bus driver's meal, their ticket is still upwards of $300. They're very grateful that we waited for them, but I don't think they realize how long of a night we're in for. 

They leave in the same rush they arrived in, napkins and straw wrappers in their dust. The store is wrecked again; all the dishes have to be re-washed, and all the tables and counters re-wiped. 

I get most of the employees out as fast as I can, and a few of them make it home before 1 am. I was stuck there until 1:40am with my shift supervisor and main grill cook, and we were all exhausted and soaked with water from trying to get the dishes done as fast as possible. The night is finally over. 

***TL; DR: Party of 50 pushes back their arrival all night long from 9pm onwards; doesn't show up until 11:40pm when we close at 11, leaves the place in a wreck. Drones stuck there cleaning up afterwards until 1:40am.***

I formerly worked in the housewares department for a department store that features a big red star. Though many of this chains stores only have an hourly wage, my store was still on commission. 

During one of our one day sales (that last two days) my department was slammed. It was early in the holiday season so we had ringers at the registers working for the sales team. I was on the floor working to close a sale on a high end vacuum cleaner. The couple I was speaking to were clearly in the buying mood and seemed ready to buy. I was speaking to the female of the couple, we will call her PA for Pain in my Ass.

PA: So how much is it?

ME: Its $550 dollars, but today with your couple you will get 10% off.

PA: 10%! Thats it! I should just go buy it online.

ME: Unless you are getting it used you're not going to find a lower price on it (actually true).

PA: Well can't you do any better?

ME: Unfortunately not, the price is firm for this.

PA: 10%! Well if (Red Star Retail Outlet) wasn't such a Jew outfit you could find a way!

I've heard some pretty gnarly shit from customers mouths, and I won't say this takes the cake but it ranks pretty highly. I lost words and decided it wasn't worth my time. With out a word I turned and walked away.

About an hour later a manager comes and pulls me to our back room for a moment, I already know what its about. After I tell the story I know my manager has my back so I get back out a keep working. While selling one of the same vacuums they were talking to me about PA returns and walks right up to me, puts her hand on my arm and says:

""I am so sorry, if we had known you were a Jew I would have never said that.""

I smirked and walked away again. I am not actually Jewish, though I do look ethnically ambiguous.

Since black Friday, I've worked, on average, 12 to 18 hour shifts almost every single day. As Christmas approaches, I'm mentally and physically drained.  You definitely see the worst of people come out during the holidays. The amount of greed and entitlement is just overwhelming. 

On top of all of this, my dad had to have major back surgery two days ago and I'm not going to get a chance to go see him at the hospital until Christmas eve night. 
My main job is at a grooming salon and I love it so much. Animals truly fill me with joy. However, like I said , there's not much left of me at this point and I'm pretty much a zombie. 

Tonight, this sweet old lab named Oliver came into the salon. After I finished washing him, I put him on the table and sat next to him to dry him. Well Oliver climbed into my lap and just snuggled there with his head on my chest. I wrapped my arms around him and before I knew what was happening I just started to cry. If anyone outside were able to see me they would probably think I'm crazy. I have a damp, 70 pound dog sitting on me while I weep (and I do not have a cute cry face). 
So I kept hugging him and I cried. And cried. And cried. For ten minutes, Oliver just let me hug him and sob. All of the frustration, anger, bitterness, exhaustion, contempt; it all came pouring out. 
Eventually I let go and Oliver and I got back to the business of grooming him. After that experience though, I felt so much better. So much lighter. I had let my feelings bottle up and Oliver offered me the chance to just let it all out.

If you don't have one though, you're getting a store credit, and you have to show identification. One night a woman came into the store wanting to return two expensive hair care products without a receipt. The manager took a while because apparently, the woman wanted cash back, even though she didn't have her receipt, apparently claiming she left it at home. Now it doesn't matter if you've left your receipt at home or you lost it, but if you don't have one, the only option is to issue a store credit. Usually when somebody argues like that, it's most likely because the item(s) in question have been stolen. Still after a few minutes the woman is walking away with her store credit. The manager saw the two bottles have been opened, and instructed me to put them in the damages tote and draw a line with a black marker through each barcode, which I did.

30 seconds later this guy, either her boyfriend or husband, but most likely also her abuser, came storming in and started yelling at me demanding why he didn't get his money. He then claimed to have the receipt for the two items and showed me the receipt for the refund, claiming that it was his receipt for the purchase. When I told him that wasn't the receipt for the purchase, he claimed to know that and demanded to talk to the manager. The manager came up and this guy then proceeded to go off on some bullshit claim that ""the corporate laws state that we have to give a cash refund, even without a receipt, if the customer asks to be given cash back."" The manager then directed the guy to the refund policy which is stickered on to each section of the counter, stating what I stated earlier about our company's return policy. He demanded to have the items back, claiming again he had the receipt at home and then went off on us for drawing the black line through the barcodes, and then upon ""further inspection,"" accused me of twisting off the caps and pulling off the safety seals. The man started to walk out of the store, screaming ""FUCKING IDIOT"" in frustration. The manager yelled out, ""sir please watch your language."" The guy then walked back towards the counter and went off on a tirade about freedom of speech which says ""IF YOU'RE A FUCKING IDIOT, IT'S MY RIGHT TO SAY YOU'RE A FUCKING IDIOT,"" and then finally walked out of the store, with his store credit, which at this point was clearly obtained by returning stolen items.

That being said, we occasionally have customers that come in and buy multiple bags that we know they are selling on the Internet, but y'know. What are ya gonna do.

Anyways. This woman comes in every so often with her two sons and husband, and we all know that she's difficult, so I'm the one who deals with her. 

A couple weeks ago, she came in and asked for a coupon. I told her we had a thirty percent off coupon going that weekend (which I shouldn't have done, NEVER give a customer a coupon once they're inside the store. Oh well.). So she comes up to the register with six bags that are all forty percent off, and six wallets, which are also forty percent off. And she hands me each one and says ""What is the price of this after the sale, with the coupon, and after tax?"" Which is all fine, I have a calculator right there. And then she starts asking me to figure different combinations of them (after the coupon, sale, and tax), which is still fine. I wasn't working on any big projects. So then she asks me to ring her up with the six bags and six wallets. So I did. And she starts complaining about how the prices are not what I told her they would be, because the machine displays the raw price without the coupon or tax. So I calmly try to explain to her that the coupon will be taken off at the end and she goes OFF. Dear Lord. She starts saying I'm not giving her a fair price and all I can do is say ""Ma'am, it'll be taken off at the end."" And then she gets all huffy and starts asking me to take some things off and leave others, so I have to void the sale (which requires paperwork later, mind you) and start over. 

My manager just groans and other customers are looking at me with a look that says ""that poor little girl."" This entire process takes about 30 minutes. AND THEN. She accuses me of scanning something an extra time to cheat her out of $60. Miss. How would I benefit from scanning something extra. I have a fixed pay, I don't make commission. So I call my manager over, and he pretends to look over my transaction, just in case, and tells her that I only scanned what she told me to scan. All the while, her husband is apologizing over himself for her attitude. 
They FINALLY leave, and then at 9:05 (we close at 9:00) they come back and start banging on the doors. We're closed. We ignore them.

As the manager I was in the Customer Service desk doing various things, while also selling cigarettes to the customers who lined up there (this is the only place they are kept in the store and they are behind black shutters as a govt regulation).

Anyway, we keep about 10 loose packets of each variety in this desk, along with some cartons of them as well. Because of limited space, and issues relating to theft, the rest of the stock is kept in a room out in the back. 

So about 30 minutes into my shift I was a little nervous as I didn't want anything to go wrong on my first management shift. A middle aged woman comes up to the desk and asks for a certain kind of cigarettes. Conversation went like this:

Her: I'd like XX Brand, gold, in the 20s

(I go to get it out of their spot behind the black shutter but there are none left)

Me: I'm really sorry but we don't have any left in the gold, we do have blue however. I will check in the overstock cupboard. I won't be a minute.

(I crouched down and looked through the cartons but we didn't have any left)

Me: Sorry about this, but we don't have any left. I would usually go to check out the back as well but I was there earlier and remember that we are out of XX Brand in all variants.

Her: This. Is. Not. ON! I came here yesterday and was told you didn't have any and I know you are lying!! You must have some out the back!

Me: Once again, I apologize but all of our stock is either in these cupboards or out the back, and we do not have any left.

Her: The chubby man who works here said the same to me yesterday, the large guy!! You're both lying!! 

Me: Okay I will check out the back then, just to be sure.

-- Several minutes later I return without the cigarettes --

Me: Yeah, we are out of stock like I said before, I checked but there is nothing we can do.

Her: THAT IS IT!! GET YOUR MANAGER! HOW HARD IS IT TO BUY SOME CIGARETTES!!?

Me: I am the manager on duty tonight and like I have been saying, I am sorry but there is really nothing else I can do for you.

Her: This is fucking ridiculous. Fine. Get me *other brand* in the gold, 25s.

(I quickly get them and scan the item. All packets of cigarettes in Australia [look like this now](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17w1u525y54s3jpg/original.jpg) and have random pictures on them. Because of strict govt rules we are not allowed to pick certain pictures for customers)

Her: I don't want that packet with the picture of the foot on it. Get another one.

While hiding a huge grin I explain to her that I won't and can't change the packet for her as it is against govt regulation. At this point she explodes again:

Her: WELL THAT IS JUST STUPID!! THAT PICTURE IS OFF PUTTING!! AND WHAT IF MY CHILDREN WERE TO SEE IT?! IT IS DISGUSTING!! You know what!!..... uggghh

And with that, she stormed out without any cigarettes.... I was shocked at the stupidity, as the whole point of those pictures on the packaging is to deter people and thus the pictures are quite gross.

Now let’s get the formalities out of the way: This post is long, I make no apologies. I do however apologize if I in some way offend you; I only intend to amuse not anger. And on the subject of anger, please do not let it fill you if I make a mistake, I am not a native English speaker and only humbly borrow your beautiful tongue so that I may communicate with you all.

So when we last saw each other I told you of **The Baby Dyke** and her ways and customs. This time I will tell you about another sort of young girl. She’s 16 and is not quite sure if she’s gay or straight, but she did kiss a girl this one time so she just tells people she’s bi. Not her parents of course because they totally wouldn’t understand. 

We shall have to give our young protagonist a name. Hmm how about Violet since it’s a shade of blue? You see blue is her favorite colour. Her eyes are blue and her shoes are blue and one time she dyed a blue streak in her hair, but she had to wash it out because her mom got mad. And tonight, tonight her dress will be blue too. She only just bought it and it’s beautiful.

Tonight is going to be big! Violet turned 16 two weeks ago and now she can get in to the gay parties in town. She’s going with all her friends that are old enough, the others will probably try to sneak in. Oh god, that one time she tried to get in even though she was only 15. It was so nervewrecking standing in line with her sisters ID. And getting rejected in the door, she almost cried. Almost.

But tonight nothing can stop her. You see they let people in when they are 16, even if you aren’t allowed to drink, not until you’re 18. 18, that’s so far away! Violet can’t wait till she’s 18, the day after her birthday she’s moving out. Goodbye mom, goodbye dad, have a great life!

Text message from Sheila “Hay, u ready 4 tonight? Kat got sum pills if u wanna try”  

Oh yeah, she forgot about that. Well Sheila’s done it at least three times, and she just had fun. No, she will try it, at least just so she can say she has. Okay, time to get ready.

At Sheila’s place they have WKD’s and shots. Sheila is so lucky, her mom let’s her do everything, and she has a room in the basement with her own exit so she can get out when she wants to. They smoke cigarettes; Sheila says she has smoked since she was 14. Violet doesn’t like the taste at all, but she smokes them anyway. 

Kat has her hand all the way down her pants, she’s grinning as she pulls out a tiny, clear ziplock bag. “Had to make sure the folks didn’t find it, didn’t I”. She opens the bag and dumps three little pills on the table. In between all the bottles and ashtrays they look so innocent. Like they could just be the ones Violet takes for cramps.

Kat hands them out, one for Sheila, one for Kat, and one for Violet. They swallow and Violet’s pill is stuck in her throat. She takes a big gulp of WKD and it’s down. No way back now. They each grab an extra WKD and walk to the bus stop. Violet keeps thinking when the pill will kick in.

It doesn’t. They get on the bus and everything is normal. They get off at the station and walk to the party, still nothing. They stand in line and suddenly, everything changes. She can see the music and it’s blue, everything is blue in fact. She looks at Sheila, her face is blue. She looks like an oversized smurf. Violet starts laughing. Laughing, laughing, laughing. Her voice sounds like crystal glasses taping against each other. Sheila is mad now, she is telling her to be quiet or they won’t get in. Of course they will, nothing can stop Violet, she’s wearing a blue dress!

She’s keeps it together enough to get past the entrance.  Once in she heads immediately for the dance floor. The DJ is amazing and absolutely beautiful. It’s like she is talking to Violet through the music. Someone’s left their beer on one of the speakers. Violet doesn’t really like beer, but she grabs it anyway, it gives her something to do with her fiddling hands. 

She drinks and finds another once it’s empty. She’s dancing and laughing and drinking and whirling and suddenly so very tired. But there’s nowhere to rest, everything is so loud. She goes to the toilet. Here at last a little peace and quiet.

(So far so good right? I mean it’s a little different from the other two stories, but I felt it needed some backstory. So I made one up. Yes, yes I know, I’m a filthy liar, but I couldn’t just dump you into the story where I come in. It would be much too confusing and there would be too many notes and parenthesis so I could explain it all. Anyway this is the part where I and my good friend and coworker Ray come in, you ready? Let’s go!)

So it’s a big gay party and as usual I’m in charge of the whole shebang (get it, she-bang, because of the lesbians). Around 2 AM I get a call over the walkie from Ray. He is my second in command that evening and this is the conversation: 

•	Ray: “Neo to Ray, Neo to Ray”

•	Neomety: “Neo here, over”

•	Ray: “I have a situation in the bathrooms, need assistance, over”

•	Neomety: “Roger that, ETA 30 seconds, over”

•	Ray: “Roger, over”


Nah I’m bullshitting you. It was more like “Uhhhm Neo, you should come take a look at this, I’m in the bathrooms” “Aight, be there in a mo” Yeah we don’t do radio etiquette.

Back to the story: I push through the constant flow from dance floor to bar to bathroom to dance floor, dodging a few hysterical Powder Puffs (and maybe an ex or two) and I make it to Ray. He’s standing there in this tiny little stall and he seems to just fill it up completely. It’s as if the light has to vacate the room, just so he will fit. You see Ray is big, not fat, but big. He’s 205 cm, that’s 6 feet 8.7 inches for the Americans and 25 and a half hands for horse salesmen from the middle ages. And he weighs in at about 120 kilos, that’s 264.6 pounds for the Americans and 18.9 stone for the Brits.

Enough maths for now. The stall was tiny and Ray is big. That’s what I tried to convey. Ahem, okay, in this tiny stall, on the floor, between Rays size 56 shoes (19, Americans) is a small girl in a beautiful blue dress. (SPOILER: it’s Violet) She’s passed out, so I kick in to “oh no” mode and do the first thing I always do in these situations. I grab around her shoulder, close to her neck and I squeeze firmly. This is a pain response thing, if they react, well I won’t say they’re okay, but it’s really bad if they don’t react. 

She yelps, well she’s not dead. I lift her head; open an eyelid and her pupils are the size of dinner plates.  Drugs. I (gently you guys, I’m not a violent woman by nature) slap her cheeks a bit to see if I can get her to wake up a bit. No go. Okay, this is starting to draw a crowd; I need her somewhere quiet and out of the public eye so I can work in peace. The break room it is.

Ray lifts her up like she weighs nothing. Hes carrying her like you carry your bride across the doorstep. In his arms she looks even tinier. We make our way through the crowd; I walk ahead and get people out of the way. I love it when I get to push the gay boys around a bit. Suddenly I hear Ray’s voice behind me “Uh oh, Oh oh shit. Neo, dude, faster, faster, she’s slipping!” His arms are locked by the crowd swarming around us, all he can do is try not to drop her, but she keeps slowly slipping out of his arms. Meanwhile I’m in front of them, trying to shout people out of my way. “MOVE, MOVE YOU FRIGGING TWATS, I’LL HAVE YA ALL KICKED OUT UNLESS YOU MOVE, NAAAOOW!!!”

And that’s when it happened. This beautiful moment, this once in a lifetime event, which I missed because I was busy shouting at gay people and I couldn’t have turned round if I tried. Violet slipped down Ray’s arms, and as she slipped, she turned a little. Just enough for Ray to clamp his enormous hand down on something to hold her by. Something, anything, to keep this girl from falling completely out of his grasp.  

We finally make our way through the mass of people and to the breakroom. I hold the door and Ray walks in sideways with his back to me. Then he turns around. The biggest shiteating grin on his face I have ever seen and he nods downwards. I look in the direction he is nodding. I see a young girl, passed out in his arms and I don’t quite understand. That is until I see his hand. This hand, this humongous hand. Clamped down on any part he could, literally, get his hands on, just to not drop her. And he’s gotten a hold on her...

...Boob.

He’s holding this poor girl by her boob and he is grinning like a maniac. I can’t help it. All concern for this poor soul flies out the window as I break down in tears. Tears of laughter that is. I actually get to my knees and rock back and forth trying my hardest not to piss my pants. And then there’s a knock on the door.

Ray quickly deposits the girl on the couch and wipes the smirk of his face. I attempt to wipe my tears and the look of immense joy of mine, I’m afraid I did a fairly poor job. Yet it didn’t matter much. You see the knock was her friends, and they were high as balls and concerned as shit.

 We got her and her friends into an ambulance to go get her stomach pumped. I heard from her mom a couple of days later, apologizing her daughters behavior, assuring me she would get a stern talking-to and thanking me very much for taking good care of her. But she also asked me a question; did I know if her daughter had fallen somewhere? Because she had a huge bruise on her chest, it was almost. And she paused for a second. Handshaped?!?

1372092563.0,280,self.TalesFromRetail,1gz793,Job that made me quit retail work. Long story.,primesrfr,323,43,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1gz793/job_that_made_me_quit_retail_work_long_story/,"Worked at a game store while I was still in college. Place was a semi mom and pop shop, meaning it was not big enough to compete with mainstream game stores, but had enough stores in different cities to give them some competition. The owners of the place liked to have an edge on the larger chain game stores so they kept their prices lower than the competition. Won’t go into detail but an example would be a PS2 new title game would be around 50 at a chain store and at our store it would cost 45. Same thing with DVD’s, always cheaper. 

Anyhow, place was awesome to work at. Got paid shit money, but I was there for around 10 hours a day and able to play games or study for school as I needed. Also helped that the customers were cool and always had interesting stuff to say. Things took a turn for the worse when one day we had major break ins at two of our locations. One was the store I was supervising at. I came in that day to find the owner of the store already there and the store taped off by cops. Story was that the thieves broke into a neighboring room adjacent to our store, sledge hammered through the wall to our store, quickly shut off the all the alarms and then had their pick of our merchandise. They cleaned us out. Systems, games, dvds. Not sure what the final count was as far as loss, but it was hefty. They did the same thing at one of our other locations.

A month went by and things started to get weird. The owner took up shop at our store a lot of days. Always sitting in the back and waiting for deliveries. Supposed wholesalers would come in with boxes, sometimes trash bags, of games and DVD’s. The guys bringing in the merchandise looked nothing like wholesalers, looked more like thugs and gang members. They would walk in the back and always walk out with cash. I had always handled the books when closing up the store. But now the owner took over my prior job. Also, he no longer had me go on runs to the wholesaler location to pick up games on new release days. He would always wait for his new wholesalers to bring him in what he needed. I noticed around this time that our prices also dropped. Games went from being 5 dollars cheaper to almost 10 dollars cheaper in some cases. The other employees and myself adopted a don’t ask don’t tell policy. I needed the job but at the same time, was scared of what was going on. The people coming in the store always looked so shady.

Next issue was one night when I was closing up the store with the owner. He was in the back and I was in the front closing up the register. The owner was a cheapskate and like to milk every penny and dime that he could. So he insisted that I keep the store open, even when closing the register on the off chance that a customer wanted to spend some money. As I was counting out the funds I saw a car pull up and two men walk in. I kept my head down and pretended not to notice them close the door behind them as they came in. I already knew what was going down. Below the register was an alarm trigger that I pulled. It was a silent alarm and the two guys were none the wiser. They proceeded to each pull out a gun and point them at me demanding all the money from the register. At the time, I was a smart ass and thought I was invincible, or maybe I was just scared….not sure. But for whatever reason I was not in control of the things I was saying. I berated the two men, scoffing their guns and saying they were not real. Proceeded by telling them they looked like henchman from a movie. They advised me that their guns were indeed real and they would be happy to show me. At that point, my common sense kicked in and I gave them the money. But they were not done.

They wanted me to take them to the back. I obliged, I headed to the back room but could not get the door open (the owner kept re-locking the door every time I unlocked it with the code). Finally he let me in (after hearing the two men say they were going to shoot through the door). Once we were inside the room, one of the gunman went to a book shelf and proceeded to pull it away from the wall revealing a safe ( I had no idea this was there). He demand the owner to open it up and luckily the owner did so without any complaints or hesitation. While this was going on, the second guy had me at gunpoint in the bathroom waiting for everything to be over. Strange enough, the guy was actually really polite and apologized for having to take my cell phone. Anyhow, they took the money and that was that. 

That was not the worst of it though. Everything came to a head one day when I was off for a week and was awakened by two detectives at my front door. Apparently while I was off, the police had done a sting operation at my work and solicited stolen goods to one of my co-workers. My co-worker called it in to the owner and the owner approved for it to be bought. The man soliciting the stolen merchandise was a cop and stated numerous times that it was stolen. The employee still handed him cash for the merchandise and this was immediately followed by the store being raided by police. They took everything, computers, merchandise…everything. Apparently the buying back of stolen items had been going on for as long as the store had been opened. The owner had been dealing with gangs to do his work for him. The reason why our store got robbed and broken into so many times was because these gang members knew that the owner kept large denominations of money at his stores to pay them with. Needless to say, I quit that same week. The police tried to call me into court for questioning or to be a witness, but nothing was ever pursued against me since I was not directly involved. I went into a different line of work soon after. Was done with retail.

I work at a large canadian bookstore, which is *usually* great. I get paid to hang around a bookstore, talking with people who generally like books just as much as I do. As a little background on my store, we have three types of product, books (obviously), home decor items, and kids toys. The latter unfortunately attracts exactly the kind of customer that I despise on a very personal level: The guilt-tripper. 

A lady came in today looking for some books for her children, which is something I adore helping with. Made my usual rounds, showing them some popular titles, recommended some of my favorites. The kids were awesome, kids like I was once, super keen on getting books. They ended up deciding on Tuck Everlasting, and my opinion of this group shot ever higher.

Cue checkout time. I walk them over to the kids section cash desk, ring the book up, and tell them their total, which came to around $12. This is where the aforementioned high opinion got shot down. The mother apparently only had $8.50 on her. At this point I'm feeling awful, having to tell two kids, who can't be older than 8- and 10-ish, that they don't have enough for their chosen book. 

""Can't you knock down the price for my children"" asks the mother, attempting to guilt trip me into giving a discount. To clarify, I am a lowly retail drone. I have exactly ZERO power to authorize markdowns, and would get written up if my manager found out I did so. I had to tell her no, to which she replied, speaking to her children:

""Looks like the mean man won't let you have the book, leave it on the counter, we have to go now,"" glaring at me the whole time. I was shocked. She wouldn't chip in an extra $3.50 for her children? Not only that, she tried to use her children as a a prop to wheedle herself a bargain, and failing that, blamed ME? I was livid. People like that just ruin entire shifts for me.

This afternoon, a blonde woman wearing bold makeup approached my register with her daughter. Each of them held one item. The daughter was holding a coupon with hers.

""No, we don't require you use coupons to make purchases!"" said me in my perky retail voice. 

""No, I mean, do I *need* coupons for both of these.""

""Nope, you can purchase things without coupons if you'd like...""

""Ugh no can I buy both of these and use coupons on each of them?""

""Oh...yes you can! One coupon per item!""

She turns to her daughter, shoves her item into the poor girl's arms and storms out after muttering something about getting more coupons from the car.

One night, when I was about 17 I had a man come into the store to make a return. The store closed at 9, it was about 8:50 when he came in. The item he was returning was a very expensive item, it was also a very commonly stolen item because, while small, it was pricey.

We had notices posted on the employee board in the back of the store to call an MOD of Front End Supervisor for all returns involving these items. 

So this guy comes up to my register and wants to return this item, retail value of $300...with no receipt. There are signs posted all over the registers, as well as blocks of text on the back of receipt that states you must have a receipt for a refund in your method of payment. If you don't or it has been past 60 days you will get store credit. 

I process the return up to the key turn point, explain to the customer that it would be store credit, then call the supervisor (who I really could NOT stand. He made a point to make fun of my weight) who just handed me the key without catching the back story. I called the manager up to the front and he, realizing that I was right to call him after the supervisor failed to do his job correctly, told the customer that he'd be getting store credit or nothing. He said he was going out of town the next day and needed cash. The manager told him that was impossible and the customer demanded to speak to the district manager. Come the eff on. Yes, the district manager is going to handle this? So my manager told the customer that the district manager was at a wedding and was unavailable, then asked the customer to leave the store. He outright refused so my manager looked to the other cashier and said ""call the police"". 

About 15 minutes later 2 police officers show up, one that looked A LOT like Bill Clinton, and talked to the guy, who agreed to leave with store credit. 

So the guy goes after I finish the transaction and my manager calls my supervisor into the office and lays into him about a cashier knowing store policy better than the supervisor. He then wrote up a compliment/gold star/thing and put it in my employee file. 

TL;DR: Guy wants cash for a no receipt return, supervisor didn't care, I called the manager, another employee calls the police, I get a gold star.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_197k51,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/197k51/calling_the_police_over_craft_supplies/,

Going anon really for no good reason.

Hired as a seasonal employee at a mall department store while I was in college, working in the handbag/accessory department. Day after Christmas, I’m the only clerk in the department, I’ve got a line of 50+ people but I’m OK.  Getting through each, one by one.  Everyone’s very patient and calm.

Enter the Bitch from hell.  She walked behind the counter and poked me in the arm, “I’ve been waiting back at the display case for twenty minutes!  Come back there NOW and show me a bag.”

Me – “Ma’am I’ve got an extremely long line.  If you would like to get in line I can help you when it’s your turn”  (Yeah I was an idiot.  Or maybe just young.)

Bitch began to SCREAM at me “HOW DARE YOU!  I’m not waiting in any line!  You will come back and help me now.  You will show me respect!”  Customers in line started grumbling.  So I called for a manager.  One showed up, took key to case and walked back to pull the purse Bitch wanted to see.  Then brought her back up to the register with the expensive bag and left to go handle the next crisis.  I kept ringing up the line of customers.  Bitch kept talking.  “Never been treated so horribly in my life.  Oh I don’t know if I want this purse.  How much is it marked down?”

Me “It isn’t.  Those bags don’t ever go on sale.”

Bitch “Don’t be stupid.  Everything is on sale today.  Look it up!”

Me “I have to finish this transaction ma’am, but I am sure that those bags never go on sale.”

Bitch “LOOK IT UP!”

Customer I’m waiting on “Just check it so she shuts the hell up”  I scanned it.  Sure enough it’s full price.

Bitch “Well I demand a discount because of your horrible customer service!”

Me “I’ll call the manager back.”  I continued to ring customers in line

Bitch “You are so incompetent!  I’ll just look around while you’re trying to find your brain.”

Me “You’ll have to leave the bag here behind the counter.

Bitch “WHAT!  You think I’m going to STEAL it!  You little fuck.  HOW DARE YOU!”  Ranted on for a few more minutes ending with “I AM NEVER SHOPPING HERE AGAIN.  I SPEND THOUSANDS HERE EVERY WEEK!  YOU HAVE JUST LOST YOUR BEST CUSTOMER!”  And stomped away.  I just kept working through the line of customers.  I had a few complement me on keeping my cool.

The absolute best was a woman about ten back in line when the woman was ranting.  She and her daughter reached the counter and she asked me “How much is that bag?”  I told her.  “Perfect.  My niece loves that type bag and she’s going to graduate college this spring.  I’ll take it!”

Daughter “MOM!  Really?  It’s kind of expensive.  I thought you were going to give her cash?”

Mother “She’ll love this more.  Besides I’d pay ten times that much so that Bitch can’t come back later and get it.”  I rang her out, including the expensive bag.

Sure enough, about a half hour later, Bitch came back.  Demanding her purse and a discount.  I told her the purse had been sold and waited for the explosion.  She just SCREAMED then started yelling “I WANT THAT BAG.  HOW DARE YOU SELL IT TO SOMEONE.  WHO DID YOU SELL IT TO?  I WANT THEIR NAME!”

The guy I was just finishing with looked at her.  “Thought you were never coming here again?  Never got pretty damn short all of a sudden.”

She turned bright red and just stood there screaming at the top of her lungs until security came and escorted her from the store.  The manager finally came back to tell me that several customers had gone back to file compliments but that I would be written up for failing to ‘deal appropriately’ with the Bitch customer.  Which was the exact moment I decided to never work retail again.   


EDIT - thanks for the comments - guess I should clarify - the Bitch was standing at a display case twenty feet or so BEHIND me.  I have no idea how long she was there before she walked over and poked me.  I had been in the zone of processing the line of people in front of me.  Should mention that another woman later that afternoon saw a purse in the display that she wanted, she came, got in line and when it was her turn, asked for the bag.  I ran back, grabbed it, and rang her out immediately.  No problem.

As for the write up - I was a seasonal hire, first time working retail - so I just read it, signed it, and listened to their bullshit about needing to have every customer leave happy.  Barely a minute after telling me how wrong I handled the Bitch, they asked me to stay on after the season.  I declined.  Walked out at week end and never walked in again.  I've never even shopped there.

I worked in hardware store as a yard person. This means lots of hauling lumber, plywood, nails, concrete blocks, any sort of building product you can imagine. So, naturally, it's not exactly a clean or always nice job. You tend to get scratched or cut or whatever, especially when wearing a t-shirt. Also, let it be known that at the time, I had a lot of pets. 2 dogs, 1 cat, 2 rodents, 2 birds so... more scratches. And I scar stupidly easy. A scratch that won't even break the skin can leave a mark for months. In fact, my arms are usually covered in them, but I never really thought about it before. 

So one day, I'm working out in the yard, and I get called into the main building to run till during another workers lunch. OKay, cool. I go, man the till, and about 10 minutes later I get this lady walk up to the counter with a few items. She places them down and I start to scan them. Suddenly she grabs my wrist and turns it over, and gasps with a loud,

""OH LORD!"". 

I blink, and ask ""...can I help you?"" She then proceeds to grab both of my wrist and looks at them, then at me with a total freaked out, yet sad face. She then goes,

""Oh, honey, I know you're young and life can be hard at your age, but it's okay, there IS hope, there IS an answer! You don't need to do this to yourself! You're so young, you have so much to live for!""

...Now I'm just lost. After a few seconds of just a blank look I can't help but say ""Pardon me, ma'am, but what are you talking about???"" To which she screams loud enough the whole bloody store must have heard,

""YOUR SCARS! You're killing yourself! You need help! Why has no one helped you?!""

...Now it dawns on me. 

""Ma'am? Those aren't cutter scars. They're scratches. I work outside in the lumber yard. I get scratches. See? They go all over my arms. I'm fine, I appreciate the concern but-""

""NO! No you don't need to lie! You don't have to hide anymore! I'm here for you! I'm here!""

By now, she has everyone attention. Even my boss pops out of the back office because of the racket. He asks the typical ""What is going on out here?"" and she rushes to him explaining how I'm just a ""poor, poor child"" that needs ""so much help"" and she starts to insist he calls someone to ""help"" me. He looks at me, I look at him with a shrug, and he tries to explain to her that no, really, I'm OKAY, but she won't hear of it, and starts to accuse him ""being ignorant"". Finally I've had enough and I just snap,

""LOOK Lady, if I was trying to kill myself, ""A"", I would go ""down the street"" not ""across the yard"", and ""B"" I'd have cut a HELL OF A LOT DEEPER! Now, PLEASE leave me ALONE!""

Her look. The shock. That was great. Wide eyed look of pure shock then she RAN out of the store screaming she would ""get help for my poor soul"". Never did see her again. Expected my boss to flip for snapping like that, but all I got was,

I work in a retail pharmacy chain that does money transfers through one of those third party companies.  
The money transfer company attempts to be cutting edge by being mostly digital only, no paperwork to fill out.  
Honestly, this causes more problems than it solves. Their terminal is crappy and anytime we have even the slightest storm, down goes the terminal. It won't communicate with their servers, so the whole thing is dead.  
And more often than not, once it's down, it stays that way for days. It happens so often that I have an out of order sign for the phone now.
  
Well, we are the only retailer in the small town that does this particular service. If we're down, it's hell on earth.  The best part about all of this is that even though the terminal that links their system to ours is down, the phone to contact a rep or use the IVR works JUST fine.   
  
**What happened today:**  
  
A storm knocked out the terminal like usual, and being early in the month everyone is coming to pay their electricity bill like usual. No bueno. I have my little Out of Order sign up which causes most people to sigh and leave without a problem. My regulars know the game. System is broken, come back another time.  
Occasionally someone will just completely remove my sign and go through the motions of setting up a transaction, which did happen today.   
  
So, in comes  Mrs. Important who strides right over to the phone, sees my sign and knocks it over.  
I'm watching, and I know what is about to go down. I know this lady is going to waste my time yelling about the system being down once I inform her I can't process her transaction. Oh boy... here she comes.  
  
**Mrs Important:** I'm paying my bill.  
**Me:** Our system is down, I'm not able to process your transaction. I'm sorry ma'am.  
**Mrs Important:** WHAT? YOU'RE LYING TO ME. THIS HAPPENS EVERY TIME I COME HERE!  
**Me:** No ma'am, the storm knocked out our machine and we can't receive the transaction from *companyname*. I am really sorry, I'm waiting for our tech to come fix the equipment.  
**Mrs Important:** BULLSHIT! I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER, NOW!  
**Me:** Sure, let me just get them for you.  

So, I walk to get my manager from the back and inform her that a crazy woman is screaming at me after ignoring my sign. I get her ready for the shitstorm.  

**Manager:** Ma'am, our terminal is down, we cannot finish your bill pay today. You will have to come back another time.  
**Mrs Important:** This is outrageous! You're lying to me now?   
**Manager:** Ma'am, nobody is lying to you. Here, I will show you.  

My manager starts the bill pay process in our register and turns the screen a bit so Mrs. Important can see too. So the register attempts to connect and download her transaction information.  
**Connecting to Host..** and starts counting. The register counts up to 120 seconds before it throws out an error message saying Communication Error. And THEN, it starts all over again, and counts back up to 120.  
Thankfully, the entire time this was going on, Mrs. Important was silent. She was just staring at the register, possibly attempting to force it to work with sheer willpower and ego.  
  
The transaction fails, and Mrs. Important throws her arms up in the air, and leaves quietly. The nightmare is over, and all is calm again. Thankfully the store was dead or I'd have a gigantic line and a bunch of irritated customers on my hands. Once we start to download transaction info we can't back out of it. Either we get the info or we spend four minutes staring at the monitor. I can't cancel and ring anyone up.

Right off the bat I could tell there was something wrong with him. I shake his hand and he gives me this weak limp and doesn't even look me in the eye, I try to make small talk with him and he mumbles and walks off.

As the day does on, the store gets busier, and he's doing ok, making a few mistakes, but, I'm guiding him basically. So about a quarter of the way through the shift, I have to go into back to get some items, and have to leave him to himself. I tell him if he needs help to call someone over. As I come back from the backroom,  see he's struggling and has a massive line in front. It's going to be a loooong day...but, I truck on and help him out. I ask him ""Why didn't you call for help?"", he mumbles something out. The customer in front of him is having a fit, while the new guy is visibly nervous turning red and sweating. I move him aside and do it for him and tell him to watch me. 

As I finish up, I turn around and he's not there, no, hes sitting in a dressing room texting on his phone. I'm mad and warn him to put it away, he then looks up and asks whens break. I'm fixing to lose my cool. But cut him some slack, he's new and break is soon. We both take a lunch at the same time. I pull him aside at the food court and give him the 411, I tell him loud and clear that this is his first day and everyone screws up their first day, but, he has to communicate more, he has to listen or else he won't be here much longer. He just shrugs me off and runs off.

he's 15 minutes late coming back from lunch. Maybe he was getting his head in place, he was young and nervous, first day jitters, I had hoped the rest of the day would go better,oh how wrong I was. I'm folding clothes and he calls me over, he wants to know what to do because an item the customer found has a different price then what was coming up. I ask her to take me over to where she found it. Misplaced item, easy to fix, I apologize and go back to folding clothes.

New guy comes up to me and says ""I found out how to change the price on items. The price on that item was wrong, so i had to change it"". I look at him with horror and tell him the item wasn't priced wrong, he shouldn't have changed anything. He just gave a very expensive pair of pants away for 60% off, when he shouldn't have done so. I just sighed and told him to stay off the registers for now as the store was getting busy.

The rest of the day went well, busy as usual. Closing time, new guy did, terrible, but, it was his first day and I would cut him some slack. it was a half hour before closing and he starts to close his register down. I'm not there, I'm cleaning the fitting rooms. he comes to me and asks ""Hey, I have an extra $20 in the register, can I keep it""?, I look at him and my eyes go wide. He's closing down the register a half hour before closing, and left a register draw open and unattended. 

I rush over to the register, and thankfully nobodys around. I explain to him very thoroughly we do not close the registers down a half hour before closing, and we do not leave the draw open and unattended. he looks at me as if I'm speaking a foreign language and says ""I thought cause nobody was around we could just leave"", what the hell is wrong with this guy?

We reopen the register, and I notice the register is short by $50. I recount, and it's still short. This is bad. Very bad. I ask new guy, if he knows why the register is short. He casually tells me ""Oh, I took $50 out for lunch and to get a few things"". He wasn't joking, and I look at him in horror. Why I ask, why would he take money out of a register. he says ""well, I was hungry and I had no money. I thought I could pay it back"", I explain to him how much trouble he is in now. He still doesn't understand, and just asks if he can go.

I've been in various retail jobs for almost 2 decades, so I'm sure I'll be able to share some stories here, whether for a laugh or for a cringe, which this story will almost certainly induce. 

**NOTE** as this is my first post, please forgive any spelling/grammar/formatting errors. *Please?*

A long time ago, I worked at a major pizza chain as an assistant manager. I relished the position because I truly enjoyed working with customers and staff alike, and I feel I was at least a somewhat decent manager. The part I least liked about the job was discipline. Sure, if an employee screwed up, I would try and be as nice as possible when pointing out mistakes in order to not allow them to happen again. But sometimes...well, sometimes a simple talking to wasn't going to help.

The location that I worked at was staffed mostly by teenagers (I was only in my 20s myself), so there was a fair bit of fun at the store. We were pretty laid back and our staff was able to function mostly unsupervised because they were a good group of kids. I was a transplant at this store, and the staff accepted me as one of their own pretty quickly. However, there was always one guy that left me feeling a little uneasy. This is the story of my worst, and last encounter with ""Robbie"".

""Robbie"" was a pretty stereotypical ""rave kid"". Super baggy clothes, piercings everywhere, tattoos, etc. He also was blessed with a dont-give-a-flying-fuck attitude. He was rambunctious, loud, a little crazy, but for the most part a decent worker. He worked in the kitchen mostly, so he'd have his music blasting and really didn't pay much attention to the rest of the goings on in the restaurant. It didn't bother us because he was actually one of our fastest pizza makers and didn't give us much shit.

Then one day, everything completely changed and I knew we were going to have issues. It was during a morning shift, and it was slow as per usual for that time of day. There were only a few staff working, including ""Robbie"" and myself. I took a delivery order over the phone and it got sent to the kitchen. 2 large vegetarian pizzas. While I went about my business, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. Did I just see what I thought I did? No, I couldn't have. But just to be sure, I watched ""Robbie"" make pizza #2 a little more closely. Sure enough...*""Robbie"" was spitting on the pizzas!!!*

I LOST it (on the inside) and I dropped what I was doing and went straight for the kitchen. Wondering if he'd come clean about it, I asked ""Robbie"" if he had spat on the pizzas. Obviously he vehemently denied it...until, of course, I pointed out that I had seen him do it. **TWICE!!!** By this point, I had seen something so repulsive I gagged (gagging a little now as I write this 10+ years later!) and I had been lied to, right to my face. Furiously I threw the pizzas directly into the trash and told him to remake them as I stood watch.

Now, because I was fresh at the whole assistant manager thing, I wasn't exactly sure how to proceed from here. I told ""Robbie"" he had to leave and that he wasn't to report for any more scheduled shifts until further notice. I called my manager who backed up my decision 100%.

I don't recall if we fired him or if he quit before we had the chance, but he never did work another shift. After the whole ordeal, I learned that ""Robbie"" was a total dick and a racist. On random veggie pizzas (not every one, thank god), ""Robbie"" would spit on them because he assumed the pizza was for an East Indian customer.

**tl;dr** little racist dick spits on pizzas, gets busted, lies, loses job.

**edit:** the way I grouped ""Robbie""'s attitude with the stereotypical raver fashion sense made me look a bit disrespectful towards ravers. This is not the case, so I changed it to reflect that.

The scammer then tries to confuse the cashier by quickly changing his mind about what change he needs. They hope they can confuse the cashier enough that the cashier gives out too much in change. Fortunately, we are trained to identify potential scams, including this one. 

Anyway, a guy paid for a bottle of Pepsi with a $100 bill. He said he needed $30 in one-dollar-bills, $20 in five-dollar-bills, etc. As I'm counting out his change, he changes his mind. Now he wants $17 in one-dollar-bills, $3 in quarters, $40 in ten-dollar-bills, etc. You get the idea. He kept changing his mind and talking really fast. At this point, I've handed him about $25 in change so far. Then he gave me a fifty-dollar-bill and asked me to break that too. After another 10 seconds of this, he gave me back a twenty and a ten that I already gave to him and he wants different change for it. You understand how this can confuse a cashier. 

And yes, I was beyond confused. At this point, I knew this guy was trying to scam me. I also knew that I had not given him all his change yet. So I called him out and told him if he doesn't leave immediately, I'm calling the cops. He pretended to not understand what I was talking about for 3 seconds then he ran off. I called over my supervisor and she called the cops while I counted my drawer. 

Turns out, this guy successfully scammed a store in a nearby town a few days ago. After I counted my drawer, I had an extra $45 in it. I'm sure the cops had to confiscate that money. But I guess I scammed the scammer. I don't know if he was ever caught.

EDIT: If a paying customer wants certain change, store policy says we have to give it to them (if we have enough in our drawer.) This was the first time I had ever lost track of money when giving change.

1371162263.0,273,self.TalesFromRetail,1gas1y,Entitled businesswoman wants a chicken,WOAHELLY,339,66,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1gas1y/entitled_businesswoman_wants_a_chicken/,"I was going to put two stories into one but my last post (misogynist customer) was pretty long anyway, so here's the tale of an entitled, condescending businesswoman that came into my work this morning. Warning: Prepare for a long-ass story. I am incapable of telling short versions.

Like I said in my last post, I work at a locally owned restaurant. I used to work in the kitchen but now am a manager in the front of house. The kitchen puts a lot of prepared and deconstructed food out for retail, and one of the things they prepare are rotisserie chickens (which are seriously the most delicious chickens ever). Customers lose their minds over our chickens and most of them are reserved before they're even put on the spit in the morning. It takes a few hours to have them ready as they're cooked in the mornings after brining for 4 days. Usually the kitchen will have them out around noon. 

So, this particular customer wandered into the restaurant just after my misogynist salesman left, about 845/9 AM. I let her look around for a few minutes before I approached her. Here is the exchange we had (I will refer to the lady as Entitled Businesswoman or EB).

Me: Good morning, is there anything I can help you find today?

EB: Yes, are your chickens ready yet?

Me: No, I'm sorry, the chickens usually don't come off the spit until 1145/noon ish, depending on the work the boys in the kitchen have to do in the morning. Did you call in to put one on reserve?

EB: NO!! You need to *reserve* chickens nowadays??

Me: Well, unfortunately yes, customers really seem to love our chickens and since we only do 4 or 5 a day, most of them are pre-purchased and put on reserve. I'm sorry if this is an inconvenience for you, and we really should put more chickens out, but the boys have lots of work to do in the mornings and just don't have the time to stand cranking the spit. If you like I could have one put on reserve for you tomorrow?

EB: Tomorrow?! I need one for lunch TODAY! Why can't I just pay for someone else's?

Me: I'm sorry but that's just not possible, all the chickens have already been purchased by other customers.

EB: Well can't the kitchen just put another chicken in the oven then?

--Now, this pissed me off mostly because I used to be in that very same kitchen and understand how ridiculous these sorts of requests are. Simply put, it's not that easy. We get 4-5 chickens delivered every morning, no more than that. The chickens are brined for 4 days before they are cooked. What we make for the day is what is available, THAT DAY. Nothing more. And even if we just happened to have an extra chicken delivered that morning, it wouldn't have been brined and would've taken even longer to cook since the ones for that day had already been going for about half an hour. I explained this to EB in a simpler version.

EB: *scoffs* Well it sounds to me like the kitchen is lazy and doesn't want to do a little bit of extra work. How much does one more chicken take anyway?

--Protip: don't ever call kitchen staff lazy. They bust their balls for shit pay because they love their job. I know this and was already having a bad day, so I decided to let this entitled bitch have it.

Me: In fact, one chicken does take a lot of extra work. There is a lot of care put into our food and it's not as simple as tossing one in the oven. We get the birds delivered every morning and it takes days to prepare them for the spit. And the boys in the kitchen are certainly not lazy. Any one of them works 10 times harder than the entire front of house staff combined. They are here at 6 AM, 7 days a week, to cook breakfast, lunch and dinner for YOU. One rotisserie chicken may not seem like a big deal to you but the amount of preparation that goes into it is enormous and takes time and attention. The boys in the kitchen have been here baking bread, pastries, sandwiches and hot meals to go for customers like you who didn't think ahead to put a chicken aside. I'm sorry we don't have one available for you but there is plenty more food for you to have for lunch. If you find something on the menu you'd like the kitchen would be happy to prepare that for you.

EB stood there, staring at me and blinked a few times before I just turned around and went back to my counter. She didn't end up buying any food and I didn't say goodbye to her as she left. Fuck you and your entitlement! Good food takes time to prepare and doesn't magically appear from thin air whenever YOU are hungry, and if you are condescending, especially to the kitchen staff, I will not cater to your ridiculous request. Go buy an MSG chicken from the grocery store, lady.

*edit: sorry if I made everyone's mouths water by talking about our rotisserie chickens, but since the restaurant is a well known place in a small town in a small province, it'd easily be identified if I said any more about it. Apologies, again, but if anyone wants I'd be happy to give our recipe!

Gather around, my friends, and I shall tell you a tale of pride, Sisyphus, and the physical detritus of human sin. It scarred my soul, and lifted the veil of youthful naivety from my eyes. It is the tale of the event I know only as “The Shitscalator”.
 	
It was the year 20XX. I was but a lowly cashier-slave bound to the will of the corporation that rhymes with “Holes”. Its business strategy is to soak the market with coupons until consumers craft the illusion of their thriftiness around their own eyes. The hour of my luncheon arrived, and I was unchained from the point of sale with a minimal whipping. 
	
There was a grocer’s next door, and their deli had a deal where they made you a sandwich and gave you your choice of off-brand soda for three dollars and tax. It was where I often fled for the first part of my lunch. Their music was far superior to our castrophany of Bieber songs and country wailing. I lingered for the five minutes requisite for my mealsmith to craft my sandwich and a few more to listen to the end of ‘Mrs.Robinson’. I hadn’t been out of the store for more than seven minutes when I returned, mealbag in hand. 
	
The first thing that hit me was the smell: a hint of our usual store ambiance underneath overpowering waves of feces. There weren’t any customers on the floor, which was odd for a Friday afternoon, and the only coworker I could see was my replacement register-peon, shivering, pale, and clammy. I had been working up the courage to suggest a date for months, so I knew that these were three adjectives that weren’t usually applicable to her. 
	
I requested information regarding her physical status: I.E. what was wrong, but she just shook her head at me and gestured blindly towards the escalators. Trepidation gnawed at the back of my mind, but I didn’t want to look cowardly before a member of the fairer sex, let alone someone I wanted to get off with. I gathered my courage, put the whole of it in a thimble, and strode towards the mechanical stairs. Fear met my heart, and they hit it off immediately. 
	
Have you ever tasted a smell? Smelled something so powerful that it starts invading your taste buds? If you had, you have some inkling of what I experienced then. You would also know if you have ever tasted human shit.
	
It was a waterfall. That’s the only way to describe it. Drowning in diarrhea, the machine kept moving with its singular, monstrous purpose, causing globules of crapwater to flow down even as it was lifted up. At the bottom of the escalator, a living whirlpool of crap swirled and churned. Churned, like butter might. A row of crap handprints displayed themselves proudly on the wall next to the escalator, the flag of the pillaging conqueror flying high above the burning ruin of our village. 
	
I thought about being sick, but changed my mind. Instead, I grew cold, and mechanically walked towards the elevators on the other side of the store. As I stumbled along, the store manager and the floor supervisor rushed by me, mops and safety cones held like weapons in their hands. They might as well have been fighting a dragon with feathers.
	
A short elevator ride later, I reached the second floor. There I could see that the horror did not end at the escalator, but trailed across the upper sales floor. From a solid stream it changed into spurted bursts and footprints of shit, until it suddenly swerved into the lingerie department, where hell’s ass appeared to have exploded. 
	
The crapstream then lurched out of the rubble of crap-coved bras and shitstained panties, and into the men’s restroom. I dared not enter there, my friends, for even one such as I knows when to abandon the fight. Venturing into a dripping shitcave, which I later learned was what the restroom had become, is literally the point to draw that line.

I work at a big box retailer that everyone probably knows. Approximately every other day, we get a truck that we refer to as the frozen/dairy/deli truck. The problem with this truck is that the truck driver can't just drop the trailer off and split like most drivers do. The driver normally comes in, says hi, pops open the trailer and has us sign the papers, and helps us unload the truck. On this day, the truck driver that graced us with his presence happened to be an impatient, angry fatass. The only people we had available to unload the truck were two (awesome and fully capable) women, one of them who happened to be our assistant manager, and myself. About 15 minutes in to unloading the truck, the driver goes ""Can't you guys move faster? I have things to do"". You can see our assistant manager getting annoyed with this guy say ""Moving as fast as we can"". A couple minutes later, the guy says ""Maybe i can get out of here quicker if you get another guy over here and another one to replace this queer over here (I'm very openly gay). My manager lost it.

About fifteen minutes after this woman and her whippit show up, another customer pays for her plants and heads out to the parking lot... And SCREAMS. I go running out to the lot to see why and see that the woman's dog had tried to jump out the window to follow her. It was still tied to the steering wheel and its leash was too short to let it hit the ground. The dog was hanging there by its collar, obviously dead. The worst part of it was that the woman didn't even seem upset. Hell wasn't even my dog and I wanted to start bawling. The only explanation my coworkers and I could think of was that she wanted this dog to die, the way it was leashed and with that window open. Maybe it was her husband's and she didn't like it, I don't know. But it now easily  tops the list of crazy shit that has happened here.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1axdir,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1axdir/most_disturbing_thing_i_have_ever_seen_at_work/,

I was working at a small gas station.  The GM was a good friend of mine, and got me the job when I was down on my luck.  He knew I worked hard, worked fast, and worked efficiently, regardless of the actual work.  Plus, as he put it, he knew I wasn't ""a goddamn druggy thief"".

I'd been working there about 2 months, and was pulling a solo 2nd shift (3PM to 11PM).  This didn't bother me; it was the off season (tourist area).  Also, the weather had picked up, and it was doing this wonderful mix of rain and snow that happens regularly in Wisconsin.  Slick as glass, and you'd be an idiot to actually travel in it.

It was slow for the first hour or so.  I had most of my side work done already (get it done early, so I can slack off later).  Given the weather, I gave a quick call to our plow guy to hit our lot on his swing through, and he said he'd be there in about an hour.  I started working the little front walkway with the shovel, and had intended to salt it, when a car pulled up to the pumps.

I headed back inside, and stuck near the tills, as I'm supposed to do.  As they're pumping gas, another car shows up, and another, and another, etc.  It appears I'd have a small rush on my hands; no big deal.  Coffee was fresh, and full, I actually had a few pizzas out, and the walk closest to the door was shoveled (but not salted).

I served a good 7 or 8 customers, and was surprised at this, given the weather.  I guess folks were just hopping off the Interstate for a moment to stretch their legs due to the weather and all.

Then, psycho hose beast walks in.

I've got a line of people at my till, 3 or 4 only, but still a line.  I'm ringing up their purchases and gas as fast as I can, with a general smile, some small talk for a few truck drivers that are our regulars, etc.  She marches up to the other register... the one with the 'CLOSED' sign in front of it.  She stands there for a few moments, and a few more people show up, and make the line longer.  She clears her throat and stares accusingly at me.

""Sorry ma'am, that till is closed.  Hop in line, we'll get you sorted shortly,"" I said with a smile.  She glowered, stared ice daggers at me, and went to wander around the store instead.  Whatever, I'm busy.

Finished a few more customers, and they just kept coming.  I'm glad I'd managed to get the little area in front of the door shoveled, at least.  Sucks I couldn't get it salted, but whatever, it's winter in Wisconsin.

Finally, psycho hose beast is in front of me, staring daggers.  There's 2 or 3 more people behind her, as well.  
""Why are you so slow?""  
""I'm not, just busy, and solo.  Do you have gas out there?""  
""I almost slipped at the pump!""  
""Yep, welcome to Wisconsin!""  I replied with a chuckle.  Oops.

Queue tirade about how the pumps should be clear of all snow at all times and should be salted and that she almost slipped and I shouldn't be making light of such a thing and I should go out there and clean that immediately and...

""Well, as you can see, I'm busy,"" I say, cutting her off and motioning to the other folks behind her.  ""I'm not to be anywhere but behind the till when there's people on the lot.  Next, it's *winter* in *Wisconsin* and there's *rain and snow* everywhere... in fact, we're slated to get a good 7"" from this storm.  My best suggestion would be to invest in a pair of boots and wear them, as high heels don't offer much traction.""

Death stare from psycho hose beast.  Customers behind her chuckling.  I smile.

""I want to talk to your manager!""  
""That's nice, I'd like to as well, haven't seen him all day.""

A guffaw from one of the customers behind her.  Ah, one of my regulars, nice.

She pays for her gas, her bottle of overpriced Fiji water, and leaves.

Just then, our plow guy comes tearing through the lot... as he always does.  Guy looks like a damn maniac, but he's amazingly accurate with that blade.

For some reason, she goes up to her passenger side of her car for something, looks up, sees the plow guy flying towards her (about a car length away from her, though).  She panics, and tries to back up into her seat for some reason... slips, and falls right on her ass.

I let out a laugh myself, the other customers in line follow my gaze and see it, too.  We all shared a good laugh :)

I worked as a cashier at a certain warehouse club for four years, and happily I never had a truly rude customer in all those years. Some minor problems, but nothing worthy of posting.

But on to my story. As a cashier myself for years, I had certain rules that I imposed upon myself that I think benefited everyone who came through my line, and also myself. One of these rules went like this: Whenever the supervisor would tell me to flip my sign to closed and go on break/lunch, immediately after flipping my sign I would tell the last person in my line not to worry, I will be checking them out, but they will be my last customer. Every time. EVERY TIME. Many times someone stepped into my line after I flipped my sign and I promptly told them I was closed. 3 or 4 times the person told me that I was open when they got in the line. All I could do was shrug and say ""Sorry, I'm closed now"" and exchange a knowing glance with the real last person in line, who knew the truth since I let him/her know they would be my last customer. Thankfully they all knew they were lying and changed lines without a fight. 

Well I was going through the worlds largest retailer at around 11 pm. I had just gotten paid and my fridge was a wasteland, barely any food left to eat. I had shopped for about an hour and a half and was ready to get out of there and go to sleep. I had approximately $200 worth of food (an accomplishment when it's all store brand) and got in the shorter of the two lines that were open. There were three folks ahead of me, with either a buggy full like myself or just took their sweet time paying for their items. After eighteen minutes (No exaggeration necessary) I was next in line, with one person behind me. The other line had three customers waiting with decently full buggies. The cashier then did something I would never do: Her supervisor came over and told her to go on break, so she flipped her light off and told me ""Sir, I'm closed"". I couldn't believe it. Without saying a word, I just stayed right there in line. After a minute or so she looked at me once again and said, ""SIR, I AM CLOSED.""  I said, ""I've been waiting in your line for twenty minutes (Sorry, exaggerated a little). I am already in your line, and I'm not going to go get in the back of the other line (now four buggies are in that line, the guy behind me moved over) and wait another twenty minutes."" She says, ""It's time for my break, I'm not gonna check you out.""

I was pissed but it takes a lot for me to raise my voice, and I just said, ""No."" A guy in the other line told me I could cut in front of him but I told him he shouldn't have to wait for me. I stood there for another 30 seconds fuming, and then I just decided to leave my super full buggy right there and walk out. 

In hindsight, I should have gotten the supervisor involved and hoped for a better outcome, but I was tired from a full shift of cashiering myself and then three hours of ultimate frisbee. I was clacking around the store in cleats.

I will start with my personal favorite.

So, it was the middle of the week around 11:30 or 12:00.  Right before we start gearing up for the lunch rush when a man came into the store.  He was 6'1 and pretty thin.  I would use the word disheveled to describe him.  Old tattered clothes and an unwashed look.  I took special notice of him, because he also seemed unsteady on his feet.  I assumed that he was probably drunk, and wanted to keep an eye on him because we had problems with drunk homeless people coming into the store before and either asking customers for money or passing out in the bathroom.

He got to the cashier, and loudly proclaimed that he had seen an add on TV about a ""Managers Special"" triple cheeseburger for something like a dollar, and he wanted 3 of them.  Now, we had no such offer, but did offer a similar burger for a higher price.  The cashier informed him of this very politely.

That did not go over well with him.

He raised his voice more than it already was and started arguing with the cashier that since he saw the add on TV, he should be allowed to have that burger for the price he wanted.  At this point I stepped in to protect my cashier, as the guy was getting in her face.  

I took him to the side and said that even though I couldn't offer him the deal he wanted, I could sell him triple cheeseburgers at a reduced price.  He said, ""Fine, Whatever"" and I rung the burgers in and I asked him to wait outside and that I would bring them to him when they were done. 

 He picked up his backpack and was headed towards the door, still swearing. There was a lady that was in line, probably about 5'10 and maybe 140-150 pounds, she asked him not to swear in front of her daughter.  The guy looks at her and says ""Whatever, Bitch"" and purposely runs into this woman with his shoulder, hard.

I saw this go down and shouted at him, I was on my way out from around the counter to go remove him from the store.  He turned to look at me and out of nowhere, an arm reaches from behind him, wraps around his neck, and he is taken to the floor.  Turns out the woman was an off duty police officer.  She had put him in a choke hold and landed on top of him, pinning him to the ground.  

Myself and another customer who witnessed it went over to help her, keeping the guy there until the police arrived.  When they got there, they searched his backpack and found a half empty bottle of wine, which they poured out in front of him.  

Pretty much the best encounter that happened to me while working there.  Also, I bought the woman and her daughter lunch.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_1dulvj,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/1dulvj/the_drunk_and_the_officer/,

My manager, I'll call her T, tells grill to hold off on making them right away because she has to double check with the costumer about the special one. There's a new girl taking orders, so it's possible she accidentally hit the only mustard button on one of them, or maybe all the cheeseburgers are all only mustard and weren't entered. Either way, the order has to be double checked. T comes back and tells the grill to make 19 regular cheeseburgers and one with only mustard. The grill gets started and I set aside a couple of the largest bags to put the cheeseburgers in. I tell the drive through girl to have them pull forward and we'll bring it out when it's ready. They pull forward and we multitask with getting that order together and the next couple ready to be handed out.

T: (raising and eyebrow). I double checked with you and you said 19 were regular with one special, and I double checked and made sure you had 20. 

SC: Well, it's wrong, and I want 20 more cheeseburgers. 

T looks around. We're swamped. Everyone is working at 110% capacity. THere's no point of arguing with this woman. 

T: okay I'm going to need those back. 

She takes the bags and tosses them in the trash right in front of SC. There was no way that these people are getting 20 cheeseburgers for free.

At around 8:30pm we see this older women walk in from the bus stop talking to herself as loud as most people do during a normal conversation, lets call her Crazy Bus Stop Lady (CBSL).  The following conversation took place:

CBSL: *talking jibberish to herself at normal conversation volume*
Me:  Good evening, is ther-
CBSL: WHERE'S A CLOCK IN THIS BUILDING!?

A little bit caught off guard I inform the customer that we do not have a clock in the building, but according to my watch it is about 8:35pm.

CBSL:  I DIDN'T ASK FOR THE TIME! I ASKED FOR THE CLOCK IN THIS BUILDING!

Both my ASM and I have a bit of a ""wtf?"" look going on and I re-inform her that we don't have one.  I had to stop myself from saying that we do, it's portable and called a watch.  Apparently she didn't like the fact that we had no clock, so she grumbles off and starts looking through the store.  My ASM is getting the store ready for closing and I man the registers (we have 3 and usually hop from one to the other depending on how busy it is).  CBSL comes to the middle register and plops her gubbins down on the counter.

Me: Did you find everything alright?

CBSL: *grumbles*

Me: ...ok, would you happen to have a **** card with us?

CBSL: *just shakes head*

I ring up her items and tell her that the total came to $6.66
CBSL then proceeds to look like I just turned into a three headed lizard trying to eat her face, then screams ""I DON'T WANT THE MARK OF THE BEAST!""  then bolts from the counter and runs out the store, leaving her items on the counter.

The customers were an older man and a woman who I assumed was his wife. The woman was wearing a rather expensive looking fur coat and jewelry yet she didn't seem to be all there. I'm not sure how to explain it but she looked like a woman who would have been drop dead gorgeous in her younger years, who then married a rich arrogant asshole who only married her for her looks. To be honest, the man didn't treat her like she was very smart either so there was probably some level of bitterness in that relationship. He had to stop her when she tried to swipe their credit card before I had even begun to ring up their things. Overall, they just seemed like a very odd couple. But none of this could prepare me for what that asshole of a man said next. 

My store used those touch screens that required you to use an electronic pen to sign your name whenever you used a credit card. I'll be the first to admit that these things can be a bitch to work with especially when the pens don't work half of the time. It wasn't unusual for our customers to have difficulty using these machines. As the man was signing his name he began to mutter, ""I hate these damn things..."" He then looked up at me and said, ""And your family probably made them.""

This comment left me speechless. I was too in shock to even be angry. At first I wondered if he really did just say that. It was then that I realized that their receipt was printing so I ripped it out of the register, threw it on the counter in front of them without saying a word and walked to another register where I told the next person in line I was ready to help them.

Its a Saturday afternoon and were just jamming. The orchestra of registers beeping is a sweet sound when you know that your best cashiers are on. Anyways I start to get a long line and an older lady comes up and asks me how to spell the word zucchini. I start to spell it out.

""Z-u-c-""

""What?""

Louder I reply ""Z-U-""

""What?""

Without being threatening I raise my voice. ""**Z**-"" 

**""WHAT???""**

Then the lady behind her steps up and says are you from Canada? The woman replies yes. 

The bitch then says ""These fucking Americans. They dont even understand their own fucking english. He's 'trying' to say zed""

 At this point im just flabberghasted. So i quietly finish her order while they're America bashing right in front of me. 

""God these fucking Americans are so stupid."" ""Its like trying to speak to a 5 year old"", and my favorite one, ""He probably didn't even get his highschool degree!""

 Now the customer behind them I've known for a while. He knows I finished my associates degree and am halfway through my dual major in Elementary/Special Ed. He steps up and lets them have it.

""For your information, ladies, this young man is almost a special education teacher. So before you be so fucking rude and insult the person who is working 50 hours a week to pay his way through college,  maybe understand that you are vacationing here and that if you don't like America you can go back to your own fucking country. Besides, This young man here will be teaching your kids soon, because if they're coming from you, they have to be retarded.""

Needless to say they shut up. Ah customer chivalry, you never cease to amaze me with your timing.

I was working at a big popular fast food chain, and I was in the lobby on my lunch break.  I watched a customer who had just been through the drive through walk inside and stop in the little area between the outside and the lobby (mudroom? Foyer? Not really sure what to call it), he was holding a full box of fries. When he stopped, he shoved as many fries into his mouth as he could. He ate about half of them, then walked all the way in and went up to the counter and complained that he hadnt gotten enough fries. Of course, they gave him more fries and an extra order. This particular place actually had a ""dont say no"" policy rrgarding customer complaints. We saw a lot of crazy lies.


Another time, when I was working at a big box retail store, I overheard a customer service manager complaining that somone had returned the box for a large flatscreen TV and had gotten a full refund! When they looked in the box later, there was no tv, but a big rock.


I once dated a girl who worked at a videogame store where you could trade in games(its not the one you're thinking of).  This was right around the time halo 3 was popular. She had a kid of about 13 come up to her wanting to trade in a copy of halo 3.... For a new copy of halo 3. Of course, this set off a few alarms in her head. When she checked the disc, she found it had a huge crack in it, it wasnt going to play. The kid argued and insisted that it worked fine, and started to het mad. Finally she asked ""if it works, then why are you trying to get another one?"" He couldn't answer. He yelled, ""THIS IS STUPID!"" and ran out.

This story details probably the best customer I've ever checked out at the cash register.

It was a busy Saturday or Sunday so tons of people in the store, I'm just ringing people out like mad. This guy comes up in a suit who looks to be about 30 years old. He's all like heeeeey man what's good? He had a ton of shit so I went straight to ringing all that shit up.

He starts going on about how he's pretty drunk and has been drinking all day. Right after saying that he makes sure to let me know he's just been drinking, not driving; just drinking.

Next he starts telling me about how he's here at the mall with his sister and her friend and how he let them go off with shopping with one of his credit cards. He wanted to know if I thought that was a good idea. Now obviously that sounds like a horrible idea unless he's so loaded that it doesn't matter but what do I know? Before I can even formulate some kind of answer he's like ehhhh she's good I can trust her with it hahaha!

Next one of my co-workers walks up near the front counter and he looks at her. He's like damn is that your girlfriend man? I say nah she's not and he's all why not man she's hot!! I inform him that she's 16 years old (I was 21) so then he changes his tune and is like WHAT? NO WAY!!!! FUCK that then never mind dude.

By now we're reaching the end of the transaction and he's like alright man so we good? I'm like yeah man we good and he reaches over the counter and gives me a bro-hug.

I open the window, bag in hand, and hold it out to her.  She stares back at me, this empty-headed expression on her face, and makes no move whatsoever to take the food I am trying to hand her.  This makes me doubt myself, so I bring the bag back in and awkwardly fumble around inside it to see what was in it.

Me: Uh...you had the...Big Mac? *looks further in the bag* Okay, *two* Big Macs and a large fry?

Her: Yeah.

A couple days before last night a guy came into the tech dept looking to have the computer he built diagnosed. He put it together himself and the machine was not posting any kind of screen. I charged him 30 bucks for a diagnostic and then spent 3 days testing all of his parts to make sure everything was working properly. Turns out the computer case he bought was shorting out the motherboard. I call him and tell him the problem and that since he bought the case from us, that we would be happy to give him a new one, and for an extra 30 we will swap all the parts out of the old one and into the new one. He said no, he will do it, and he will be in to pick it up in a couple hours. 

So let me preface. $30 for a diagnostic is the cheapest price in the area by $100. If he had us put the machine together for him in the first place then he would be covered under us for any malfunctions of the computer. 

So he come in around 8 and says he wants a new case, which we give him. He tells me he wants me to swap the parts though... But for free. I tell him no, it's an extra $30. He then informs me that he ALSO wants a refund for the diagnostic since it is broken. I tell him the diagnostic was done, we found the problem we did the job you paid for. Here is the conversation:

Me: ""I can't refund the diagnostic. We did what you paid for."" 

C: ""I buy from you all the time.""

M: ""So then you understand that my technicians get paid by the services you paid for. You will have made my techs work for 3 days to FIND the problem, then take away their pay because the found the problem""

C: ""Well I bought the defective case from you, it's your fault so I wan't compensation""

M: ""No. It is ULTRA's fault, since they manufacture it. But I already told you I will do my part by giving you a new case."" 

C: ""Well I want you to swap the parts out too"" 

M: ""For $30, we will. But not for free. My techs have families and bills, they need to be paid for their time"" 

C: ""I drove 40 minutes to get here, you're telling me my time isn't worth it?"" 

M: ""I did not say that. You choose to spend your time however you see fit. But this is a business, we did the job you paid for."" 

C: ""You're willing to lose a big customer! I was going to but 3 dozen PC's from you!"" (He wasn't. He is actually a regular, but not the good kind. The kind who returns things VERY often, and is always arguing for us to give him 20% off since he is a regular. I've never seen an order of his go above $100 and the build he has is only about $400. So to pull this line in a big box retail store is laughable. ^^Though ^^we ^^do ^^give ^^discounts ^^to ^^our ^^good ^^regulars.)

M: ""I'm sorry to hear that, but I have to stand behind my employees when it calls for it. What does it show to them if I return this? They do all the hard work, only to have it taken away? You paid $30 for 3 days of work. That's $10 a day for my techs.""

C: ""I'll be sure to shop at (Online store that has no local stores, or any for that matter) next time, you guys are assholes.""

M: ""Well if you're going to speak like that in front of my coworkers, and the surrounding customers and their children then we do not welcome your attitude here anyway. I will be happy to return your defective case, and I am sorry you feel as though you didn't get your way."" 

I then watched him huff and puff as he had to take the parts out of the case and put them into the new case with techs 10 feet away working on other stuff. 

I just don't get people and their entitlement. 

Also this happened after he threatened to return everything that he bought, which would have made his head explode if he went through with it because I would have also told him no since he had NONE of the original packaging and would have had to drive home to get it. 

I noticed it is always the people who don't spend a lot that do this crap and always expect to be treated like the big spenders, using phrases like ""I spent A LOT of money here!"" only to look up his acct and he bought like $300 worth of stuff in 4 years. I'll treat a small spender like a king or queen if they are nice, the same as I will treat a big spender. I will make you feel like you left the store with a friend and someone you can trust to give good advice in my field of work, even if it means you aren't buying it from me. But the second you pipe up and act like my company should spread their cheeks for you because you buy flash drive from us every once in a while, then I'm going to let you know where you can take that attitude.

Me, 19 and 30 weeks pregnant. I was living with my mom, dropped out of college (I'm back in now), two weeks away from marrying my fiancee who lived three hours away, and working in a DISCOUNT grocery store of all things. Needless to say, my self-esteem was in the shitter at the time. 

I was working the closing shift with my ever growing belly getting in the way. Scanning, bagging, and handling money/cards away, as usual.  Enter fat lady (FL) I can't guess her weight, but she was considerably overweight.  She was riding the store's mobility scooter and non-stop huffing through the whole thing,

FL's son was with her, emptying the cart filled with nothing but heavily processed, high sodium frozen dinners and other unhealthy items.  What people bought never bothered me, it was a discount store, so what we normally got was things that had minor defects, that didn't effect the quality of the food. So quite a bit of the stuff was junk foods, but you really could get some good deals. My pregnant cravings only got bad when I was at work because of the $2 Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream. 

Things were fine, until I turned to grab some more bags.  FL looked at my belly and shouted ""Are you pregnant?!""

""Yes.""

She then turned and moved the scooter as far as she could from me, while still being able to complete her transaction while shouting ""You pregnant ladies disgust me, I can't be near you or I'll puke""

I gave the look of confusion and all I could manage was ""OK""

FL then acted like she didn't mean to say it and quickly corrected with ""I don't mean you're disgusting, i just, you're so weird, I hate pregnant ladies, you're just so weird looking.""  I looked at her son, and was met with a blank stare

Then I just looked down and said ""thanks""

""I just, you, I just can't""

I wanted to butt in and stop her jabbering, but I was just done with the whole thing. So I just finished scanning and bagging all of her crap.  I put all of her bags in the cart her son was pushing, watching the woman and her open mouth gaping look of how gross I was.

I told her the total, holding back tears, I was trying to rush her out as fast as I could just be done with her. FL pulled out an EBT (foodstamp) card and had to come back to the counter to reach the machine. I said ""I'm sorry but you have to come close to me to pay."" She slumped down, knowing that she fucked up. I had to hold the machine up on its stand so that she didn't have to get out of her mobility scooter to see/reach the buttons.

I gave her the receipt, making sure to hold my belly (not that it was even very big and covered by the god awful apron). Luckily the rest of my customers were fairly pleasant.  My managers laughed at it when I told them after closing, they made my feel better by telling me other pregnant hate stories of other employees. 

I can't help but laugh that she was a mother and shaming me for being pregnant. My husband thinks she didn't want to catch the pregnant. Because 55+ year old morbidly obese women can catch the pregnant.

I could tell she was fighting emotion.  She told me that she knows how to cook.  She told me that she had to buy a lot of  junk food.

It's another beautiful morning, I actually got some sleep last night, and am ready to shower another (hopefully) hilarious story unto you all. This one is long, and slow in the beginning, but I think it pays off in the end. Also bonus link at the climax of the story that ties along.  Enjoy today's adventure,called

**One, Two, Three, Four, FIFTH**

One fine day I am working at GDNickels.  My co worker Stacy and I are watching the cameras, when she informs me we have a case.  I look at her screen, find out what camera she is using and who she is looking at, and get other cameras in the area ready for me to take over should we need to quickly switch cameras.  

On Stacy's screen, we have a young, teenaged man, who was shall call DAVE, after Dave Chapelle.  (So yes the title was a reference to his sketch.  You'll see why).  So Dave proceeds to rip off some tags from shirts and shorts.  He's wearing  baggy jeans, a baggy black hoodie, and a baseball hat.  He's glancing around, looking for people watching him, and plainly up to no good.  Dave then proceeds to enter the fitting room.  I make my way downstairs, grab a few shirts to pretend I am shopping, and head to the fitting room.  Dave soon exits, empty handed except for one shirt, which he places back on a random shelf.  Dave is looking slightly *fluffier* than when he entered into the fitting room. Almost like he is wearing layers.  Sure enough the fitting room is empty.  I tell Stacy its a go, and that I'll wait for him to exit the store.  The kid is all of 5'5 and probably 17 tops, so he shouldn't be an issue.

Sure enough, Dave decides to  leave the store, and I'm there waiting for him.  I approach him, he starts to panick. I identify myself, he tries to dart away, I grab him. He's still trying to run away while I'm holding onto him.  So I grab  the hood in the back, yank him down, grab his arm, and use the leverage of his shoulder to force him to flip onto his back.  This is a very good technique that ""encourages"" the person to comply with your commands. If they roll over while you apply leverage, its not painful at all. The second they resist, their shoulder is  cranked and it hurts.  It also allows you to control one of their hands and keep them from getting up easily.  Eventually Dave learns to just comply, and rolls over onto his back.  I kneel down, pinning him to the ground, and cuff him.  I do a quick check of the inside of his waist band (to make sure he doesn't have anything that he can grab with his hands and stab me with), and lead him back to the office.  

The whole time Dave is cursing at me, saying he didn't do anything, that I'm gonna get sued if we don't let him go, etc.  As I'm leading him in I explain why I stopped him, and that he's in the shit for trying to run, so he best just go along with it.  He keeps trying to pull away, make a scene in front of customers, etc. Anything to try and bully me into getting embarrassed and letting him go. 

Fuck that. I got you mother fucker.

So we bring him in the office, I put on some gloves, and begin a pat down.  I find the usual assortment of items, wallet, keys, phone.  Then I bring him into the second back room of our office, and make him remove the clothes he stole.  He starts saying I can't make him do that, that its sexual harassment. I only want to see his dick, etc.  I tell him he can either do it here, or the cops will make him remove them at the local pd. And since he used his clothes to conceal our merchandise, they'd be confiscated for evidence, and he'd have to sit in the cell in his boxers.  It's total bullshit but Dave bought it and quickly removed his pants and hoodie and all our stolen clothes. Under neath was a pair of cargo pants and a white t shirt, that were old and obviously his.  So I bring him out to the processing room and pat down his main clothes that were hidden. As I placed my hand on the pockets of his cargo pants, I felt something big and heavy and made of metal. I reached inside, and told Stacy we had a weapon.  Dave starts stammering its not and I quickly instruct him to shut up and not move, or I'll throw him on the ground before I secure the weapon.  I make sure I have him and myself in the right position where I can pat him down while being able to throw him down if he makes a move, and reach into his pocket, pulling out a big fat pair of brass knuckles.   I throw them onto our table out of his reach, and quickly handcuff Dave again after I made sure he had nothing else on his person.  We are still waiting for the cops to arrive, so we being to question him for our report.

The first question is obviously why he didn't tell us he had a weapon.  Dave is adamant that the brass knuckles aren't a weapon, they are a part of a belt buckle. The belt had fallen apart and he had thrown it away, but kept the buckle.  To his credit, he wasn't wearing a belt, despite needing one, as his pants kept falling down.  And the brass knuckles did had a metal piece at the bottom that looked like it was for sitting them into a belt.  I had seen buckles like these before, so it seemed like a legit story.  However we had to explain to Dave that while its a belt buckle, it's made so that you can quickly remove it and use it as a weapon. And seeing as he wasn't using it as a belt buckle at that time, it just didn't look good for him.

He had stolen 3 or 4 pairs of shorts, and 4 or 5 shirts if I recall, so that was about $150 right there, but the weapon charge would be what hurt him.  We finished our investigation and waited for the cops. Seems like we always caught people right before or after the 3 o clock shift change when it took forever to get any response.  Eventually one of the cops shows up, starts the paperwork, and we wait for the Sergeant to arrive.  Now this is a cop we all loved, and we will call Sarge.  Sarge was close to retirement, kinda riding out his last years, and a ton of fun to be around. He was all business when need be, but other than that, he was a big jokester who always made us laugh, and would often swing by on slower nights to hang around and shoot the shit.  He always gave us a ton of support, and was even a guy who gave younger shoplifters a break, realizing they were just young and dumb and could learn from this experience.  But sometimes, like with Dave, they just don't want to take the help.

So Sarge walks in, gets the story, and sits down in front of Dave.  He looked at him and began this conversation, which I will paraphrase here.

Sarge: ""HI Dave. I'm Sarge.  Listen.  My friends here said you gave them a hard time.  Now I'm willing to bet you were just panicked.  You seem like a good kid who just did a dumb thing.  Now you only stole about $150 of stuff, so that's the lowest misdemeanor charge you can have. You're 17, so if you're found guilty, you can still apply for youthful offender, and after you pay them back, and stay good for a year, it'll be off your record forever,  However, the issue with these brass knuckles can get you into trouble.  Now its obviously a belt buckle, but as everyone here explained, it's still a weapon.  Now you say you had a belt that got torn up so you threw it out?""

Dave: ""Yes Sir. At work earlier today. But the buckle was expensive so I didn't want to throw it out.""

Sarge: That's understandable.  Where do you work?

Dave: In the mall here. 

Me and Stacy exchanged glances. So THAT'S why he was so nervous about telling us.

Sarge:  OK. Listen Dave. You're detained right now.  You're going to be formally arrested and processed and probably released under Personal Recognizance.  But before we do any of that, I'm going to give you the chance to let us help you.  We will bring you to your job, and if we can find the belt, or any of your co workers swear they saw you throw it out because it was ripped up, I wont charge you with Possession of a Deadly Weapon. So where do you work?

Dave:  In the mall.

Sarge: Where in the mall?

Dave: I plead the Fifth.

Sarge: No Dave you aren't under oath, and you haven't had your rights read to you yet. That's why I'm giving you this chance, otherwise we have to charge you. I understand you're nervous, and don't want your bosses to find out you were stealing from another store.  That's something you have to deal with though, because this is more serious. I'm not trying to trick you here.  So where do you work, so we can go get this sorted out.

Dave: In the mall.

Sarge: Yes. I know. Where in the mall?

Dave: I plead the Fifth.

At this point me and Stacy are cracking up.  We love when shoplifters play Lawyer and start quoting the law or judicial process. Especially since they are almost always wrong.  Sarge is getting testy, and keeps this circle of conversation up.

Sarge: Ok let me explain it to you again. I know you're nervous but listen.  (Sarge then explained how serious the charge could be and why he believes Dave but he needs the proof to throw out the charge. Also explains how pleading the fifth right now doesn't really apply and the basics of the legal process so Dave can fully understand.)  So, Dave, where is it, that you work?

Dave: In the mall.

Sarge: ::Facepalm::  Ok WHERE IN THE MALL?

Dave: I plead the Fifth.

I'd like to say this was it. But it went on for a solid 5 minutes. All of us just pleading with the kid to just co operate so he doesn't get in trouble. Eventually I pulled out the trump card

Me: Hey David. Listen. Normally I only do this for younger kids who obviously value the mall as a hang out spot AND lie to me when I catch them, but if you keep being uncooperative, I'm gonna get mall security and file a trespass report with them.  That means if you set foot in the mall they will arrest you for trespassing.  So you can either work with Sarge here, get the charge dropped, and have to talk to your bosses about what happened, which may be bad maybe not. Or you can not only get arrested and charged with felony possession, but also most definitely lose your job.  

Sarge: So where do you work son?

Dave: The Mall.

Sarge: I think I know what is coming next, but I'm a glutton for punishment. Ok, where in the mall?

Dave stops, and looks at all of us, a longing in his eyes. You can see it. He would rather be somewhere, anywhere than on that bench right now, handcuffed, and bound.  He eventually looks down at his feet, and slowly breathes in and out, not saying a word.

Sarge: Where do you work in the mall son?

Dave: I.... I plead the Fifth.

Sarge stood up, and shook his head, and asked me to remove my handcuffs from David.  David quickly looks around, a glint of hope in his eyes that wasn't there a moment before. You can see it. You can see this kid thinks he just won. That he is getting away scott free and won't have to face any of the consequences of what happened. What a lucky day.  Maybe he'll just go home. Or maybe his luck would continue and he would ask that girl Miranda from 4th period science to the prom.  With luck like this she had to say yes. Then he could go and take her out, and maybe get laid. YES! YES ANYTHING WAS POSSIBLE AFTER SOMETHING AMAZING LIKE THIS! I AM DAVID AND I AM A TEENAGED GOD!

So I remove the handcuffs, hoping Dave doesn't wet himself in anticipation of his percieved victory.  Then Sarge tells him to turn around and face me.  He then instructs Dave to place his hands behind his back.  A moment of stunned silence before David realizes why I took the cuffs off.  He didn't think it was so that the cops could put their cuffs on him.  I sit here now, and wish to this day we could have had cameras in that office.  It's amazingly vivid in my memory, but I would love to be able to just watch his face over and over as it goes from pure joy to the hellish realization that he is fucked.  I swear if it was on video [you can actually pinpoint the moment when his heart rips in half](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N65IJC5A5GM).

Dave begins to silently weep. Sarge reads him his Miranda rights. Dave keeps trying to talk to Sarge, saying he changed his mind. But Sarge just keeps saying ""Nope, you need a lawyer.  I can't talk to you till you get a lawyer. Plus maybe he'll explain to you what pleading the fifth means. But I'll take your wish to not testify in court to mean you don't want to talk to me.""  Eventually, Dave was led to the police substation we had at that mall.  We inform mall security, and they charge Dave with trespassing.  We eventually find out what store he worked for ( A skate board shop that rhymes with ""Zoobies"", and went and explained what happened.  The manager was very understanding, and glad we caught someone who would steal, even if it meant her employees.  She talked with mall security about having him come in for his next shift where they would terminate him. And sure enough, she showed us the trash can next to the register, where there was a a long, torn black strip, that may have just been a cheap cardboard belt.

I was 17 and working at the front end of a grocery store bagging groceries. This was in a relatively upper-class area, with a lot of hoity-toity soccer moms coming through all the time. One such lady came through my line, being very snippy and dismissive with us, rolling her eyes, not putting down her phone, the usual. She had a huge platter of shrimp with a big bowl of cocktail sauce in the middle, all packaged in plastic - however, the plastic lid was not holding like it should and looked like it could come off pretty easily. The cashier and I both asked her if she would like us to re-wrap the package, and she put her phone down long enough to say ""NO. I'M BUSY."" So that was that. 

3 minutes later, she comes back in the store. She is SCREAMING. I look over to see her very expensive-looking fur coat (seriously? fur coat to the grocery store?) is COVERED in cocktail sauce. The package had come apart and she had spilled the sauce all. over. herself. 

She proceeds to shout obscenities that I don't want/need to repeat - meanwhile everyone in the store is staring, and mothers are taking their children by the wrists and running them out of the store to get them away from this obscenity-spewing madwoman. She demands to see the manager, and starts yelling about how she's going to sue him and the store and everyone in it.

Here's the best part - the manager calmly calls me and the cashier over. We both explain that we asked her if she wanted the package re-wrapped and that she said no. So without saying a word, he grabbed a plastic bag, threw the remaining shrimp/sauce in it, handed it over to the lady and told her that he hopes she has a nicer day as soon as she leaves. 

The look on her face was priceless - almost as good as watching her then immediately leave the store in a stunned silence. Never heard from her again. 

tl;dr: Lady refused to let me secure a package of cocktail sauce. Sauce immediately ends up all over her fur coat. ",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_125zd5,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/125zd5/customer_got_what_was_coming_to_her/,

The weirdest one, was this one woman. She waltzed up to my cash, holding a Pedi Egg (for though of you who don't know what this is, its like a cheese grater for your foot with a little catcher) and a poster of the human digestive system. 

She lays them on my counter and with the biggest grin says ""I'd like to exchange this"" (points to the pedi egg) ""for this"" (points to the poster) Now the dollar store had a strict no returns no exchanges rule. The staff would occasionally break it for exchanges if some one bought the wrong colour of something, but in this case there was nothing I could do.  I apologized and explained it, then looked at the next customer in line (who happened to be my manager) expecting her to either pay or leave. She did neither. 

Without a falter in her smile, god bless her lying soul, she said ""I made a mistake, I meant to get the poster instead."" The best thing about working in that store was, we didn't have to have the fake smile and do the regular b.s that came with Customer Service. I looked at her and asked ""Oh, you mistook a poster of the human digestive system for a pedicure tool?"" 

Changing her tactic, she whipped out her receipt, and thrust in my face almost yelling ""On the receipt it says I can exchange it!"" Her thumb conveniently covering the part on the receipt that says what  in big black bold letters? Bingo, No Exchanges or Returns. 
Pointing that little fact out she got even angrier, asked to see my manager. Who was still standing in line behind her.

1356117984.0,269,self.TalesFromRetail,158pvf,More Adventures from a Former LP: The Time a Manager Literally Sold Me Out For A Sandwich...,Drunken_Black_Belt,357,88,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/158pvf/more_adventures_from_a_former_lp_the_time_a/,"Hello once again TFR!  Today I will be telling you a story about the only manager I ever had that I truly hated, and the time she sold me out for a sandwhich.  

So this was early on in my LP career, and the blue shirted electronics retailer.  I had been there about 2 years, and was the top LP.  Before I was there, the other LP guys were averaging 3-6 cases a year.  I was averaging that a month. And that is extremely low for most companies. But this company only cared about your greeting the customers, and making sure the receipts matched the items going out the doors, especially for large items like TV's.  Now several months before this incident, we received a new manager. From day one, me and her didn't get along.  I couldn't tell you why I initially didn't take to her. She seemed nice enough, just fake.  But whatever I could deal with fake people no problem.  Lets call her *Dakota*.  She was as large black woman, short, overweight, and with a high shrill voice.  

Or so I thought.

Now the main issue I had to come with this manager, was her time management skills. Many was the night where I, as the LP, along with another random female employee, would be forced to stay hours after everyone else, because Dakota was finishing her daily paper work.  LP always had to be the last one out with the managers, and if it was a male/female combination, then another female employee had to be there to ensure no funny business was going on.  So I would often sit an hour or two after the store was closed up waiting for Dakota to finish. Problem with this, was when you pulled up tape of her during store hours, she was either in the office talking with the front end supervisor, or eating.  ALWAYS EATING. And when you talked to her, before he daily gorge fest, the only thing she would talk about would either be criticisms of you, or about what she was going to order for food later.

So late one winter night, its about 1/2 hour before closing, store is empty, everyone is getting everything ready so we can get out right on time.  In walk these two customers.  So I follow them on camera because they are literally the only customers in the store.  I see them approach our associate in the photo department, ask some questions, then pick up something next to the register in the department.  They then walk over to another aisle, and the woman places it in her purse.

Here we go.  

So I call a Code Blue (theft) on the radio, and call Dakota in the office to come out and verify the tape and stand with me. Standard procedure at the time to be able to make a stop.  Dakota tells me she's busy doing paperwork. *Bitch I can see you on camera.  A cheese steak is not paperwork. And stuffing it down your fat guff is not work.*  I tell her I need her to verify in order for me to make a stop.  ""Just call the cops"" she tells me.  I tell her I need to verify this stop before that, otherwise its wasting everyone's time.  ""Well if you can't do your job, I will.""  I see her hang up and pick up a phone.  

Fine, fuck it, and fuck you. You look like an Aunt in Eddie Murphey's next *Nutty Professor* film.

So I'm still watching this couple browse the store, and I try calling the assocaite in photos over the walkie multiple times. No answer. Maybe his radios dead. Ok I try the phone in the department. He ignores it.  At this time the store is ready to shut down, and I'm just hoping these people just try not to take anything else, because I won't be able to perform a stop on them either way.

Next thing I know, the doors next to me open, and in walk two local PD  Officers.  Fuck. Dakota actually contacted the cops.  The first officer comes over to me while the second one steps outside to be ready to go. I explain to the officer that I saw them place something in their purse, but I can't verify what the item was, and my manager isn't letting me follow my steps, so I'm not going to be making a stop.  I'm not risking my job, even on a legitimate stop.  The cop says ok.  About a minute later the couple exits.  

Problem was that Officer Dipshit forgot to inform his partner.  His partner jumps out and attempts to stop the couple.  The man, obviously startled steps back, and the cop, thinking he's going to run, grabs him and puts him against the wall.  FML.

A few moments of confusion, and the first officer says we weren't going to make a stop.  We explain the situation to the couple, and they show us what she placed in her purse

*A fucking FREE sample of photo paper*.

They are pissed at first, but after showing them the tape, they agree that it looked like they were stealing.  Of course, this is the time that Dakota decides to emerge from her cave, and try to take all the glory for this apprehension.  ""Did you get them?  We don't mess around with that kind of stuff here!""  

I thanked the couple for their understanding, and the officers for their time, and they all went of.  Dodged a major bullet and lawsuit there.  Dakota didn't understand why they were leaving.  I just ignored her, and locked the front doors and exit.  I immediately went to photos and talked to the associate as to why he wasn't responding to the radio.  Turns out he had taken the ear piece out of the radio, and plugged it into his iPod and was listening to music.  I then went to the LP office, and started burning multiple copies of everything. I knew this would be a huge issue, and I wanted to document it.  Dakota was still trying to talk to me about it all. Eventually I looked at her and just said ""I didn't make the stop, because you weren't there to verify it.  They didn't steal anything. The associate was listening to music on his earpiece instead of paying attention to the radio. Meanwhile where are you? In the office, eating, as usual. You should have been out on the floor, following prodcedure for a Code Blue.  Even if THAT hadn't happened, you were supposed to be closing registers. Instead, you're having one of our cashiers do it. A cashier who isn't allowed to handle keys, yet you have her running around handling money, and keys, because you're too busy to do you job.  So, since you woulnd't let me do my job before, let me do it now.""

Dakota started in with ""I'm a manager. You're just LP you can't talk to me like that. You can't tell me how to run MY store. YOU made a bad stop and you're gonna pay for it."" Just picture that as a 5'2 Madea and you got the idea.  She then walked back into the office and started making phone calls.  I got everything together, wrote my report, and began to call my manager, and the regional LP manager.  By this time it was almost midnight, as we closed at 11 during the holidays.  But I wasn't going to get stuck with this bullshit.  I explained the situation to my Regional Manager, and he said to just keep everything for Monday, and he'd be in to talk to me.  

Monday comes around, and I'm called in on my day off.  The store GM, my Manager,Dakota, and the Regional Manager are all there.  They want to talk to me about the incident. Dakota has this HUGE shit eating grin on her face.  I would never hit a woman, but if I could have paid someone to do it for me, I'd have gladly given up my entire paycheck. My regional called me in, because somehow the footage I copied disappeared in my two days off.  Strange. Good thing I made 2 back ups and hid them in the office.  The look on Dakota's face was priceless when she saw me emerge with two more disks.  It took a few hours of questioning, and review, but eventually they informed me that while it was a bad stop, it wasn't my fault. Dakota was written up for failure to follow procedure, and the kid in photos was written up for having his iPod on the floor.  The only thing that could have made it all the more glorious is if Gerard Butler came in at that moment, and Spartan kicked Dakota down a pit.  

Dakota avoided me for a while after that.  But she would still try and find things to bust me on. Any little infraction she could find, she'd try to write me up or rat me out to the GM.  I really should thank her. She really showed me the importance of documenting everything. I made sure to know that anything I said or did could be backed up with records.  And while I feel that I was wrongly persecuted during all of this, there is one group of people that truly suffered from all of this.  I honestly think that my actions put a couple of food delivery guys out of work, as Dakota couldn't take as many food breaks now that she was being watched by the GM.

This didn't seem right to me. I knew I missed a day last week because of a stomach issue, but previously hadn't called out since March. I said, ""BossMan, I don't want to sass you, but when was the other day you're saying I called out? I'm just pretty sure I haven't.""

He insisted that I had in fact called out at the beginning of the month (it was in the attendance binder that I had) and told me to sign the sheet so we could get back to work. 

I took out my cell phone and looked at my calendar from the last month. I input every shift I'm scheduled into my phone so it's easier to check, and it helps me keep track of my hours when paycheck time comes around. (I have been burned before with not getting paid the correct amount from this same company.)

""Well, uhh, I wasn't scheduled to work that day. In fact, that was my one day off for that week because of the 4th. So, I'm sorry, but unless you're willing to check the schedule on the computer for that week, proving that I was supposed to work, I'm not signing that paper.""

He checked, and guess what? I was right. I should also mention that this would have been my second write-up, so if I had gotten in any sort of trouble for the rest of the YEAR, I would get suspended without a week's pay.

So just a tip for my fellow retail slaves: Keep a record of your schedule! Make note of the days you call out! Because management will try to fuck you on everything they can. 
If I were five years younger I would have been too scared to speak up even if I know for sure that I was right.

Tonight I (6""1, white, male, overweight) walked in and got handed the drive-thru headset by the (5"", Asian, unmistakably feminine,speaks with a pretty strong accent) girl who was running it over dinner. Everything runs as normal until, 5 minutes before close, a P-plated (in Australia you have to display these for a while before you get a full license, as a general rule if a car has these you can bet there's an 18-20 year old driving) Luxury Car with two expensively-clothed young girls comes through.

**M** = me, **C** = Car

**M**: Welcome to _, place your order please!

**C**: Hi, we came through at about 6 and our food was gross and the burger was falling apart (Aside: Please, for the love of God, if this is an issue for you and the burger you like comes in a box, please just ask for it to be wrapped, it's about the least irritating request you can make) and the fries were cold and it didn't look enough like the picture and the tomatoes weren't ripe enough and the line was too long and....*

**M**: Just drive around and I'll talk to you at the window.

**C**: Ok,  and just so you know, we've been trying to call you and couldn't get anyone to answer!

At this point I'm suspicious because even among all the constant alarms that go off at work to tell people that fries, eggs, wraps etc. are cooked the phone is one of the loudest things and the office is more or less next to me. No one has called since I've been here.


A couple of minutes later after I've gotten a couple of orders ahead of the car under control and, as I walk to the window to talk to them I notice them hurling the most childish insults I've ever heard (what kind of adult calls someone, anywhere, *ever* a poo poo head?). At this point I decide that these girls are going to jump through some hoops if they're getting anything (usually we just give out stuff if you seem like you might make a fuss and/or you're polite about it, but if you are being an asshole or have just been handed an absolutely enormous $30+ order you can probably afford the 50 cents extra for the onion rings you've decided you want instead).


**M**: Hi, so what did you order exactly?

**C**: A large burger X meal and a small burger Y meal with no tomato.

**M**: And were you looking to get that replaced or refunded.

**C**: Replaced please.

**M**: Okay, I'm just going to go through and check for your order.


I go to the till where all the orders get sent and there's nothing in the last ten hours that fits.

**M**: Well, I just looked and there's no order in the system that matches your order. Tell me about the person that served you. Was it a boy or a girl?

**C**: It was... you, actually.

**M**: Well I'm afraid that's wrong, I've only been here since 9, there was a girl on before that.

**C**: Really? That was a girl? She looked just like you!


At this point my manager (who had been handing out orders all day until I got here and got quiet just after I arrived and unlike most other managers I've ever had is willing to call customers on their BS if he has to) has walked over wondering why on Earth this car is still here when it hasn't ordered anything.


**C**: Hey, are you the manager? This guy called us liars!

**Manager**: What seems to be the problem?

**C**: We wanted our order replaced and he's not giving it to us!

**Manager**: So when did you come through?

**C**: About 6, this guy served us!

**Manager**: No he didn't. There was a girl on then and I was handing out orders. I don't remember you.

**C**: You're lying to me and we're not leaving until you give us our food.

**Manager**: Well if you want food you're going to have to pay for it, because you didn't order anything to begin with.

**C**: Well we'll just sit here and hold up all your customers (the lights were off at this point and anyone else who came in was going to get told that we're closed)

**Manager**: Well I'll just have to call the police, then. &lt;at this point he reaches into his pocket and pulls out the phone&gt;

**C**: We've been trying to call that all night!

**Manager**: Well if you'd done that it would have, you know, rung.

**C**: We'll take this further!

**Manager**: Well our complaints hotline is _ or you can go into our state office which is at 123 Fake Street, my name is Manager and he's Jorcoga.


Both the girls in the car sit in stunned silence for a few seconds.


**C**: &lt;Fast food place&gt; are a bunch of penisfaces**! &lt;speeds off&gt;



**TL;DR Large white guys are indistinguishable from small Asian women.**

",CondescendingMartian,309,42,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/19eydo/lock_stock_and_a_cart_full_of_clothes/,"**TL;DR** Middle-aged shoplifter lifts a cart of plunder over her head and runs screaming out of the store.

This story is a bit different from my previous two, in that I played the part of a spectator instead of participant. It was at the first store I worked at, the one that sends out a wave of coupons every week but only has a few active any given day. It rhymes with Bowls and starts with a K.

I was working customer service at the time and hating every moment of it. Most of the bosses I worked with would bend over backwards to take a return, but only after I spent half an hour arguing with the customer about the return policy that said that we couldn't. Almost garunteed, if you stood your ground and screamed at the wageslave behind the counter you would walk out with what you wanted. It was a policy that encouraged some of the worst behavior in people. (It actually got to the point where I would break some rules for people who were nice to me, since they walked in just slightly less often than unicorns. Besides, we'd have ended up breaking them anyways for the tantrum throwers.)

So, there I was, languishing behind the counter the way only minimum wage college-age retail workers can. The lines were long and the tempers were short. I prayed to the sweaty, obese retail god that the next customer would just shank me and get it over with. Suddenly, looking over the crowd, I caught the glint of the fluorescent lights shining off the LP guy's pale bald head. I knew him reasonably well, and I knew that the only reason he would leave the lofty throne of the security camera room would be to surreptitiously shadow some ne'er-do-well. 

For some context, the store managers had been getting tight-assed about loss prevention in the weeks leading up to this event. Some new employees had bungled some returns, and the store lost money. A food processor was returned and when the box was opened there was a cinderblock inside. Also, people had been buying little handheld tag-guns so that they could attach the price tags of things they had bought to old, worn out clothes, then return the old clothes for the price of the new ones. At the return desk we had a shiny new set of rules to follow to ensure that it didn't become a trend, and the LP guys were put on alert. 

Looking at LP guy, who looked a lot like a musclebound Lex Luthor now that I think about it, I strained my head to try and see who he was following. The only person in the area he was looking towards was this tiny, and rather frumpy if I say so myself, middle-aged woman. To help paint the picture further, imagine Dolores Umbridge if she was a mexican muggle. (Not Imelda Staunton, Dolores Umbridge.)

Given that I still thought that age brought class, I discarded her as a possible suspect. However, I did glance at her as she passed closer to the service desk and I noticed that her cart was absolutely bulging with items. Imagine, if you would, a laundry hamper stuffed with two baby hippopotamuses. Two baby hippopotamuses suffering from the obesity epidemic. 

For further context, we didn't have the usual metal shopping carts most modern retail stores use. The ones at Bowls were pretty much laundry hampers. [Cloth-canvas-plastic things] (http://imgur.com/kFdioUg), in varying sizes. Besides making them easier to store, they were much lighter than their metal equivalents.

She stalked past me and Lex Luthor came skulking along after her. At this point I was distracted for some time processing different returns. 

About an hour and fifteen later, when we were experiencing a surprising lull, one of my managers came up to me. He quietly intoned that I was to move to the other bank of registers, by the other exit. The woman working customer service with me was told to keep an eye on the door. (As an aside, I find this amusing in retrospect since the same woman was later arrested at our store.)

As we walked to the other side of the store, he told me that the LP guy was onto a suspicious women who had gone into the changing room about an hour previously and had yet to come out. I don't know what originally made her seem suspicious, especially since Lex didn't seem like the kind of guy to racially profile, but when people are in the changing room that long it's generally a strong clue that they are either up to something nefarious or having hot exhibitionist sex.

Anyways, I was to be on register so that there was someone near both doorways. I wasn't allowed to interfere if she tried to walk out, but it was good to have a witness I suppose. I started ringing people up.

About thirty minutes later, while I was in the middle of ringing a gentleman up, the notice came over the walkie that she was on the move. The air was heavy with the expectation of shit going down, and a chill ran up my spine. 

Señora Umbridge came walking down the pathway, pushing her stuffed cart before her. She started walking towards the registers and for a moment I thought that I would have to ring everything up instead of watching an attempted heist. 

Suddenly, she swerved and made a clear line for the doorway. Lex Luthor jumped out of the dress section and stood in front of the exit. He raised his hand and said ""Excuse me, M'am, can I help you for a moment?""

She said in broken English that she only spoke Spanish. Undeterred, Luthor waved over one of the ladies working in Jewelry to translate. My coworker asked if she could help with anything and the woman just stared at her for a moment. Her eyes flickered towards Luthor and then the automatic doors. My customer asked why I wasn't ringing his purchases up.

In a burst of bestial strength, the tiny, dumpy woman yelled something in Spanish and lifted the entirety of the cart over her head. The jewelry associate beat a hasty retreat. Lex stepped back, first in surprise and then to avoid the woman swinging the cart at him.

I had previously been considering going to stand by the door to deter her from running, even if I couldn't actually do anything, but when I looked into her eyes in that moment, as she was swinging a full cart two-thirds her size and screaming with every last bit of air in her lungs, I knew that she wanted to leave with the cart far, far more than I wanted to stop her. Mr.Broderick, the only winning move is not to play. 

Given that the way to the exit was unblocked by supervillains, she made her bid for freedom. Still holding the cart full of clothing overhead like Atlas held the earth, she sprinted to the doorway, screaming all the while. Everyone in the store watched her exit like a crowd might watch a missile burning through the atmosphere. 

In a screech of burning tires, a convertible rocketed to the curbside right outside the doors. The lady made her exit and leaped into the air. 

Time stood still for a moment as she left the surly bonds of earth. Then, like proud Icarus before her, she began to plummet. Both the woman and the cart landed with a thud into the back of the convertible and, with her legs sticking up into the air, the car screamed off into history.

My customer looked at me and asked ""What the fuck was that?""",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,1362089141.0,,,True,t3_19eydo,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/19eydo/lock_stock_and_a_cart_full_of_clothes/,

We get many bikers on the weekend where we are and it is store policy to ask bikers to take off their helmets (or lift their visors if they use the older style ones that reveal the whole face) because our secutiry cameras cannot see their licence plates on the back of the bike. We have notices on each pump, literally right underneath the display that clearly states this, but alas customers are dumb.

So yesterday the weather was a bit nicer after a crappy month or 2 in winter so bikers are coming out more. 90% take their helmets off to fill up anyway (its a common policy in most stations around here so most of them know anyway). Most of the others are polite when they dont and we ask them to before they get fuel. But a handful are not polite. At all.

So anyway, yesterday i was working and the young girl on the till calls me over to say a biker hasnt taken his helmet off. She's very shy and doesnt do well with confrontation so i so i'll run out and let the guy know about the helmet policy.

As soon as i step outside he shouts (through his closed visor) ""Oh fuck off, i aint gunna take my helmet off!"". I was a bit taken aback but point to the sign right next to him saying he has to or he wont get fuel and politely ask him if he could comply.

Then he shouts in my face ""And what if a muslim bitch with those scarves fills up, do you get her to take it off? I'm english, i aint got a bomb on me so why the fuck should i if you dont make them show their faces?"".

I started to tell him that religious descrimination doesnt apply to bikers who dont want to take off their helmets and that the policy was recommended by the police (last year we had a string of bikers riding off without paying and getting an ID was very difficult because of our front facing cameras). He demands that i let him fill up because he is very low of fuel and wouldnt make it to the next station.

This is music to my ears. I tell him i will not be serving him at all because of how he was acting to me. He throws the pump on the ground and wheelspins out of the place with not a drop of fuel.

A regular customer was filling up on one of the other pumps at this time and i hear a few days later from her that after she filled up she was a few miles down the road and saw the biker standing on the side of the road with a bike clearly out of fuel. Awesome. Also knowing he had at least another 10 miles before he got to the next station made my day.

TL;DR: Be polite to the person who can refuse to give you fuel when you are running on fumes.",,False,self,t5_2t2zt,False,,,True,t3_18mvwy,http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/18mvwy/racist_biker_fun/,
