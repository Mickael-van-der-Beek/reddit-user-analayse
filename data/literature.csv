1369159368.0,259,self.literature,1erzti,Favorite Sentence? What makes it great?,Threedayslate,302,43,448,http://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/1erzti/favorite_sentence_what_makes_it_great/,"I just finished reading Mark Twain's *Letters from the Earth*.  In the back of my edition there is also *The Diaries of Adam and Eve*.  I enjoyed both of these works a great deal.  At the end of the story when Eve has died, Adam writes:

&gt; Wheresoever she was, there was Eden.

The line struck me as wonderfully beautiful, both in sentiment and execution.  It joins a list of other sentences which I adore, for themselves alone.  Some other favorites:

&gt; Oh when I was young and easy in the mercy of his means

&gt; Time held me green and dying

&gt; Though I sang in my chains like the sea.

Dylan Thomas - *Fern Hill*

&gt; A day of dappled seabourne clouds.

James Joyce - *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*

and:

&gt; Shut up he explained.

Ring Lardner - *The Young Immigrants*

I love all of these for completely different reasons.  The Twain for giving a common sentiment a heart pulling new spin.  The Thomas for its beautiful presentation of fatalistic rebellion.  The Joyce for perfectly illustrating its content.  The Lardner for its unexpected juxtaposition.  All of them, seem to me, first rate uses of the English language.

I'm curious what other people's favorite sentences are.  Although there is clearly no formula for a brilliant sentence, anyone have thoughts on what makes one great?

Turning and turning in the widening gyre

The falcon cannot hear the falconer;

Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;

Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,

The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere

The ceremony of innocence is drowned;

The best lack all conviction, while the worst

Are full of passionate intensity.


Surely some revelation is at hand;

Surely the Second Coming is at hand.

The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out

When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi

Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert

A shape with lion body and the head of a man,

A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,

Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it

Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.

The darkness drops again; but now I know

That twenty centuries of stony sleep

Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,

And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,

Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born? ",,False,,t5_2qhps,False,,,True,t3_13532h,http://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/13532h/i_often_when_drunk_start_reciting_a_yeats_poem/,

I don’t know why Lolita is so taboo today. Well that’s a lie, of course I do. 

But one has to put it in context. Nabokov’s Lolita has sold more copies than Harper Lee’s To Kill A Mocking Bird, most of the Harry Potter novels, and thankfully for society, more then any Dan Brown. And at any rate, Lolita was very quickly a massive commercial success. 
          
So the more pertinent question is: when and why did it become unmentionable? 

My guess is that it has always been pretty taboo. But what I notice and really hate is that people who have never read it or any of Nabokov’s other works are the quickest to scorn it, or you for that matter, for having it in your case of books.    

And as someone who occasionally takes a book out of home, in the world of Google searching, Lolita is a book that I felt odd about being seen with. But I shouldn’t. Nabokov is a towering figure in American Literature, and a man who wrote prose ecstatically. But I did, and the times that I have read the book I don’t ever remember going to a public place with it. And you would rightfully then ask: are you not just perpetuating this taboo you are here trying to debunk? Regretfully, yes. But as a reader, after an opening page of this: 

	Did she have a precursor? She did, indeed she did. In point of fact, there might 	have been no Lolita at all had I not loved, one summer, a certain initial girl-	child. In a princedom by the sea. Oh when? About as many years before Lolita 	was born, as my age was that summer…
  
	[Spoiler alert – don’t read on if you want to read the book and haven’t] 

Given that, you could defiantly understand my reservations. 

So you see, Lolita is a sadistic pornographic novel. It also doubles as the funniest and saddest novels I have ever read. And knowing its’ likely public reception, Nabokov found it necessary to contribute to an epilogue outlining his intentions.  It should also be said, he, Nabokov, was not writing for the fiery and simple-minded libertarian any more then he is writing for the reserved libertine; he was writing for readers, and those who can read him, will be well rewarded. 

The narrator and main character: Humbert Humbert, is a 40ish European man; a spoiled poet turned critic; possessor of a private adequate income and an enormous agonizing personal problem: a lust for 9-to-14 year old girls, “nymphets.” 

Finding himself where he does: a Northeastern American city, the poor panting Humbert recognizes that the twentieth century, legally and moralistically denies him the only female thing he really desires. 
But suddenly, as if a fairy tale, his one wish comes true: Stumbling around Northeastern American small towns, Humbert finds Lolita by accident. To get her, he goes through a chaotic, grotesque and hilariously erotic choreograph. 

He will do anything, and he does. The “anything” involves marrying Lolita’s widowed mother, Charlotte, with all the lies and distastes that that implies. And Charlotte, deeply in love with the charming, good-looking, cosmopolitan Humbert, immediately sends Lolita away to camp, so the “lovers” can be alone together. Out of the sheer necessity of the lies, Humbert is to consider immediately, the need for her murder. 

Fate, however, intervenes. Charlotte is killed by accident and Humbert’s steamy, anxious plotting goes to waste. A dream come true! 

Now with his little stepdaughter, Humbert sets out on a peregrination of lechery that approaches the flights of schizophrenia. 

It turns into a nightmare. Two years and two lengthy circuits across the American scene, Humbert spirals. He is insatiable, can never stop craving Lolita, because he never really has her, only her body. In the end, his punishment: Lolita runs off with a monster. Humbert, in despair, attempts to track them; after bouncing around the country, into a sanitarium, and living in utter recklessness, Lolita finds him. Now a different person, an accomplishment for the vital force that has managed to make a life out of the rubble that Humbert’s passion created, and the monster’s activities reaffirmed. For a moment Humbert repents as her destroyer. But this does him no good. He is rushed off to seek murderous revenge on the monster.  

And as Nabokov famously said: “Lolita has no moral.” 

But all I can say is that Humbert’s fate seems classically tragic; Humbert is the hero with the disgustingly tragic flaw. Humbert is the symbol of every man driven by desire.

My god, has anyone here read this book?",davinox,139,9,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/1irl4y/pessoas_the_book_of_disquiet_my_god_has_anyone/,"When I went to college for English and Creative Writing, I had never heard of this book. It was never mentioned as part of the international cannon and was never referenced in any of the criticism I read. I had heard some kind of mumbling about it at some point, and I picked it up by chance recently.

And **wow**, my god. This is one of the most startling, electrifying books I have ever read. It feels like the novel Rilke would have wrote if he had the talent for prose. (Malte Brigge has a few flashes of inspiration. The Book of Disquiet is a thunderstorm.)

I'll even go so far to say, this book is THE definitive work on creative poetic genius. It has the same self-deprecation Milosz wrote about when he described literature as a ""tournament of hunchbacks."" He realizes how silly and ineffectual poetry is to the world. But it also penetrates right to the core of why it's all beautiful and important and sad. He lays bare the solitude, poetic beauty, and pathetic self-involved weakness that an overly sensitive modernist poet would experience. And it's all written in these ultra-concise meditations, like beautiful small gourmet dish after dish to savor. This is at the level of Nietzsche. It's that fucking good.

I was wondering if any of you have read it or any other works by Pessoa. I was just simply amazed that this isn't frequently compared with Rilke, Joyce, Kafa, and the rest....",,False,,t5_2qhps,False,,,True,t3_1irl4y,http://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/1irl4y/pessoas_the_book_of_disquiet_my_god_has_anyone/,

1376408746.0,126,self.literature,1ka7lh,What is Postmodernism?,bronzeclocksofbenin,177,51,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/1ka7lh/what_is_postmodernism/,"Seeing as that my other post on the postmodern canon was so popular, I thought I'd start a new post concerning a discussion of postmodernism. Here are some questions that I thought would be interesting to discuss:

**1:** What do you think defines postmodernism? Do you think it's existence relies on the ideas of modernism (i.e., that it is mostly just a reaction to modernism), or do you think it is an independent movement?

**2:** Do you think postmodernism is a literary school of thought or a literary time period? Do you think Cervantes and Sterne could be considered postmodern writers? 

**3:** Is postmodernism still applicable to the present world? Will the Dada-like questioning of the literary experience ever disappear form the literary scene?

**4:** What are the main problems of postmodernism? Is postmodernism a perfect device with which we may describe the world, or is it flawed? If it does have faults, are there solutions?

**5:** Do you think postmodernism is defined by an ontological contortion, or is reliant on some other principle?

**6:** Is postmodernism destroying or elevating the artistic experience in literature? Would you consider a postmodern text art even if it blatantly attacks the idea of coherent artistry?

**My own analysis:** This is my attempt at a definition of postmodernism, taken from a response to mynamematters on my previous post:

""Modernism deals with the angst of a world that is falling to ruin. The modernist writer explores this by examining the psychological state of the individual. For the modernist, reality is universal, and we should try to achieve a ""oneness"" of humanity. Example: James Joyce's ""Ulysses"", which utilizes stream-of-consciousness to examine the life of a man in a single day.

Meanwhile, the post-modernist celebrates the cacophony in the present world, and explores it and ""plays"" with it by bending reality. For the post-modernist, the individual's journey through space and time is less epistemological and more ontological. Such a journey is complicated because, unlike the modernist, the post-modernist sees reality is relative; i.e., all reality is socially constructed. Example: Alasdair Gray's ""Lanark"", where reality is fluid and seems to echo the protagonist's fears and feelings.

All in all, we might be able to see the difference between modernism and post-modernism as similar to the difference between Wordsworth's and Coleridge's verse. The modernist is like Wordsworth; the writer tries to make the commonplace fantastic by emphasizing psychological phenomenon, whether it be melancholy, nostalgia, or angst. The post-modernist is like Coleridge ; the writer tries to make the fantastic commonplace by emphasizing ontological phenomenon."" 

So, as you see, I believe that postmodernism relies on postmodernism because postmodernism is a response to modernism. However, I believe that Cervantes and Sterne could be considered postmodern writers due to their attack of a coherent reality and a questioning of the aesthetic. Postmodernism relies upon modernism for the most part, but it can exist in special circumstances as defined above. Postmodernism is defined by its questioning of the ontological and the nature of static existence, and I would also like to add that postmodernism depends heavily on the questioning of the value of the literary medium itself (thanks to davinox for this input). The main problem plaguing postmodernism today is that its running out of fuel: in the same way that modernism relied upon a seemingly decaying world of pre-WWII Europe, the idea of postmodernism relies upon a fluid view of reality brought about by the rapid demise of the European superpower (or, in Cervantes' case, the fall of the age of chivalry). Ultimately, postmodernism relies upon the end of an era, and we not at that end anymore. The Cold War is over, and even though much of the world is in poverty, the general population are not sent off to fight wars or sent to the gas chambers or gulag. Eventually, postmodernism will give rise to more great works from South America, India, and Africa, and the literary scene of North America, Europe, and the developed parts of Asia will see a new literary movement separate from postmodernism. In conclusion, I believe that postmodernism is still art even though it critiques art, in the same way that the sentence ""no sentence can convey actual information"" is still a sentence. Now, what does everyone else think?

That being said, I thought I'd kick off what I hope is an interesting thread about some of the most loved and thought-provoking works and writers we can come up with.  I'll start with some of the biggies:

The Setting Sun by Osamu Dazai -  A book about the waning days of the old guard of the Japanese aristocracy, this is about a young woman named Kazuko, her experiences during and after World War II, and the existential crises she encounters as her world changes.  It is a work that covers a lot of ground.  It tackles her evolving sense of her place in the world, the dissipation of her aspiring artist brother as well his dabbling in Marxist thought, leading to his eventual suicide, and the role of the artist - both literary and traditional - in post-WWII society.  Also of importance is the nature of the ""influx"" of western thought into her world, shown in one instance through her idiosyncratic understanding of Chekov.  It contains a lot of cool, thought provoking ideas, such as a favorite line of mine, paraphrased, that ""Men do what they do in the end, fighting and toiling, so that women can have healthy babies.""  Dazai was an original talent; he seemed not to think highly of avant-garde Japanese artists such as himself, and is deeply critical of their self-destructive lifestyles.  I would consider it sort of a Japanese The Sun Also Rises, but that may not make sense.

Thousand Cranes, Snow Country, and The Old Capital by Yasunari Kawabata - A Nobel Prize winner and a truly exceptional talent, Kawabata has a famously understated style.  His works are also about the melding of old Japanese thought with new western-impacted ways of thinking and living, and his prose is excruciatingly beautiful.  He mourns loss and mourns the human condition, and his works are a tribute to emptiness and loneliness.  Snow Country is probably his most famous work but Thousand Cranes is my favorite; his description of the intricacies of the Japanese tea ceremony are transcendant.  Again, mourning is the name of the game with Kawabata, as well as his fascination with what I would describe as ""sublime nothingness.""  A word of warning, though:  To us readers today, coming from the tradition we do, some of his allusions and foreshadowing can be a bit heavy handed.

Spring Snow by Yukio Mishima - This is the first book of Mishima's so-called Sea of Fertility tetralogy, and it is stunning.  In my opinion (not a rare one), this is his magnum opus.  A heartbreaking love story, this book helps the uninitiated such as myself better understand the intricacies of the 20th Japanese ""human condition"".  It is a story that takes place after the Russo-Japanese war about a young man from a sort of nouveau riche family reared in an old aristocratic household for the sake of social standing and refinement.  Mishima was also a singular genius, and though much is made about his incredible personal life for good reason, his art is stunning.  Beauty, heartbreak, longing, and a tenacious desire to encapsulate the Japanese ethos set this work apart.  This book is Mishima coming into his own as another Japanese writer who should have won the Nobel.

A Personal Matter by Kenzaburo Oe - This one is a postmodern classic by another Nobel laureate.  A story of a man grappling with what you have to consider as the aftermath of a bout of a nihilistic loss of all hope, it is a jarring account of human frailty and dealing with an untenable situation.  I don't want to delve into too many details because I don't want to give too much away, but if you want to read a  dark work about the machinations of a man in what he sees as an untenable situation, you may want to check this out.

Kokoro by Natsume Soseki - Another book about the changing nature of Japan, although written in an earlier era than some of the other books I've listed.  Kokoro is the story of a young man studying in university in Tokyo, and his relationship with an older man with a mysterious past that gradually reveals itself over the course of the novel.  The protagonist's relationships with his family and the ""Sensei,"" as he is called, are particularly enlightening.  Even when you finish this one, the nature of the sensei's story and his telling of it leave you with more questions than answers, and you begin to have the idea that everything is perhaps not quite as it seems.  I read this work over a decade ago, and I still think about it fairly often.

Obviously I've just barely touched on some of the most famous works of the past hundred years, the ones that I feel everyone should read, and I haven't included quite a few other great works that should, by all rights, be included.  These are books you would read in an Intro to Japanese Lit class, so they seem like a good place to start.

Wizard of the Crow by Ngugi wa Thiong'o (Kenya): This book is hilarious, insightful, and a real pleasure to read. It is long at 750 pages and quite an undertaking, but I don't know if there is a contemporary African author who is a better writer than Ngugi. He also wrote the classics Petals of Blood and A Grain of Wheat, which, although quite different and of an earlier era, and with different goals than Wizard of the Crow, are also highly recommended as well. Ngugi is a writer who I'd very much like to see win the Nobel.

Anthills of the Savannah by Chinua Achebe (Nigeria): Achebe is an author a lot of people have read, as Things Fall Apart is now by-and-large considered to be canon and is thought by many to be the quintessential post-colonial African novel; my brother actually had it as required reading in high school (he graduated in 2008, I graduated in 2002), which I think is fantastic. However, Anthills is a very strong book in its own right, and I find it to be the better novel. I don't know if there is a better work on the problems of post-colonial governance.

Houseboy by Ferdinand Oyono (Cameroon): A very powerful and enraging novel about the waining days of French Colonialism in Africa, Houseboy (translated from French) is one of the most heartfelt works I have ever read about the strong divisions between the colonial masters of the era and their black African workers. This one is short, engaging, and very bleak in some ways.

Xala by Ousmane Sembene (Senegal): A searing novel (it was adapted into a very fine film by the author), Xala takes as its subject matter the power vacuum left by former colonial overlords, and the greed and mismanagement by the new African leadership of a formerly colonial state. It documents, to a degree, the trouble of the synthesis of the colonial style of governance with deeply-ingrained African social and moral codes. This one is fairly bleak too, and the film, in particular, has a pretty troubling final act.

The Book of Chameleons by Jose Eduardo Agualusa (Angola): This one is different from the other books I've listed. It is a very recent novel (I believe from 2007), and is written by an Angolan author and journalist of Portuguese descent, but I highly recommend it. It is a short and fascinating story of identity, dreams, reincarnation, and reinvention, and features as its narrator a lizard who lives on the walls of a house who is a reincarnated Jorge Luis Borges - and, as I've learned on reddit, much to my delight, almost everyone here loves Borges. Short and breezy, as I said previously it is quite literally an oneiric work. However, it still has a politically conscious heart, and the relatively recent troubles in Angola figure very heavily in its plot. Agualusa has a very active imagination, and I found this book - though I apologize for the triteness of the following statement - to be an irreverent revelation.

Thanks for reading my little post, and I sincerely hope someone may have something to add which I haven't yet read or heard of. There is something about African literature, the freshness of it, the novel perspectives, that I find invigorating and fascinating.

Edit: I intentionally left out one of my favorite writers, JM Coetzee, because his works are well known and their brilliance strongly attested. However, I've not read his entire ouevre, so if there is something by him you feel belongs here, by all means let us know!

I've tried since to find reading lists from other parts of the world (outside of America, mostly, since your lists are so easy to find that they make locating any others difficult).

So the question is: what do people read in school in different countries or regions around the world?

I'll start with an example: living in Canada our high school reading included: *A Handmaid's Tale* by Margaret Atwood, *I Heard the Owl Call My Name* by Margaret Craven, *The Stone Angel* by Margaret Lawrence (I never before realized that there were so many Margarets in our list!), and *The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz* by Mordecai Richler.

I previously found this ['top 100' list of African literature](http://www.ama.africatoday.com/Africa_100.htm), which has given a pretty good foundation for the area. Big blank spots on my map include Eastern Europe, the Middle East and basically all of South and East Asia. Currently South America consists of Jorges, Bolano, and maybe one or two others.

His writing style is so simple yet so beautiful. I can't think of another writer who powerfully communicates simple yet complex ideas so well. Reading Chekhov is not like reading Dostoevsky or Tolstoy, there are no grand ideas or debates, other than perhaps, the greatest of them all: What does it mean to live? 

I like to see Chekhov's opus as a study of man in general. From early stories like Heartache, in which a peasant cabby driver cannot find anyone to grieve with him over his dead son and instead finds solace in crying out his soul to his horse, as the horse chews oats, and ""understands"". To the angst we find in Vanya, angry at having arrived at middle age and with not much to show for it. Having expected greatness of himself, he has to reconcile his reality with his dreams, as we all do. There are no villains and no evil in the world, everyone does what they believe they have to do. 

In such stories as ""Anna on the Neck"", we find an extraordinary portrait of a beautiful young woman who marries a boring old bureaucrat. To him, she is simply a decoration meant to raise his standing among his social circles. And so can we blame the young girl as she notices attention she never received back in her village and powerful handsome men circle her? Can we blame her as she begins using her wile and beauty to get what she wants and gain an upper hand even over her husband, due to her affairs with his superiors? Is it her fault that she becomes a cold and calculating femme fatale, or is it a society that has delegated her to a piece of decoration for the rich and powerful men and has deprived her of any meaningful method of personal advancement? 

In another story, a peasant man weeps as he asks for the priest to forgive his daughter of being a prostitute. The priest gets angry at him and tells him to shut up and that she was just an actress. But we see through his memories that he was a land laborer for a rich family and his daughter grew up to be the play-mate of the family's daughters and was raised with the attitudes of the wealthy but none of the means. And when she is beguiled by wealthy young men to serve as their sexual education (encouraged by wealthy parents) and no one will marry her, she becomes an actress and visits her simply hardworking father, laden with gifts given to her by ""admirers"". He loves her and knows it was his fault, he wasn't there for her and she grew up with a cruel taste of wealth but none of the ability. As he weeps over his grave, he asks God to forgive her even if she was a whore. 

Chekhov's true skill lies in capturing the whole of experience in select works. Time is transitory and human beings live either in the future or the past, but with Chekhov we arrive at works that capture the transitory experience of the present in fictional works that convey the emotion, and ""truth"" of human experience. He is not a ""realist"". Rather, he is concerned with creating portraits that convey the present as well as possible and transmit timeless landscapes of human interaction. 


Any grand ideal or message in Chekhov is intrinsic to the situation and not to the story or the writer's own method. We may find vestiges of philosophy and the like but these are natural outgrowths of treating humanity with sympathy and simply telling their stories, as honestly as one can.

*The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner* by James Hogg

This tells the story of a young man who believes that because he is one of the righteous and saved, any evil he commits must be the will of God. The murder, betrayal and destruction that follows is guided by a mysterious companion to the young man who might be the Devil, or may not exist at all.

*Jurgen* by James Branch Cabell

A comic fantasy novel from 1919 that is also a thoughtful examination of religious belief and the meaning of aesthetic beauty, as well as a hilarious deconstruction of heroic journeys. It can be read as straight fantasy, but the more you delve into its wealth of reference and allusions, the more rewarding it becomes.

*The Arabian Nightmare* by Robert Irwin 

The tale of an English spy in 15th century Cairo who finds himself afflicted with strange dreams that pull him into a world of stories, myths and intrigue. The narrative twists and turns and it's often difficult to tell what is real and what is being imagined through its protagonist's fevered mind. While it does drag at parts, the total is an inventive, often exciting tale.

Edit: Here are a few more I thought of while reading through people's responses:

*The Ballad of Typhoid Mary* by Jürg Federspiel

Morbid and interesting piece of historical fiction the details the life of Mary Mallone, the first person every found to be a healthy disease carrier, who was known as ""Typhoid Mary."" Based on the real person, but highly fictionalized to comment on the society of turn of the century America and foaming with a witty gallows humor.

*Traps* by Friedrich Duerrenmatt

Tells the story of a man who finds his himself on trial as part of a parlor game. What starts as an interesting diversion turns into an examination of guilt and justice.

In the first chapter alone, he touches on the main things that are wrong with current media. The whole story line was complex and well developed, it was not just satire, it had a real story with an intense meaning that is very applicable to the world. 

I know I am young, but I view Chuck P.'s work as on the higher end of modern literature, but every review I read and teacher I encounter paint Chuck P. as some kind of fake who BS's his way through literature and only appeals to the hipster-literature-wanna-be-crowd.

At the beginning of May the college sent me a [reading list](http://imgur.com/a/ysVKb) - books I've read are highlighted in green - from which I'm expected to read mandatory ""Core"" material and *""a good amount of material on the General list""*. The letter I was given says that prior reading is essential. 


Honestly I'm really really stuck. The only novel we studied properly in school was *Wuthering Heights*, and even that took the course of a year to annotate since we went at the pace of the class. I don't feel at all prepared for graduate-level reading from my high school education. During the Oxford interviews I was intimidated by the number of interviewees with good background knowledge of literary study, especially one with a heavily-annotated copy of Ulysses!


My question is how much do I need to *know* a novel I've been set before I start the course? I've got no problem reading the books on the list as I'm quite a fast reader, but are tutors expecting a thorough knowledge or would they rather teach you themselves? Only got a short time I have until I leave home (term starts on October 13th), and I want to be as prepared as I can but I don't know where to start with studying. Help!

Anyway, since then I've been trying to figure out what it was that I missed in the novel that made it so great. Some people here find it funny, but I didn't think there was any part in the novel that even made me grin a bit. Then again, I thought Catch-22 was as funny as the Holocaust, so perhaps I'm just an utterly humorless guy.

Perhaps it's the great symbolism in the novel. However, I think the same message could've been told without the incredibly pointless expositions about whale anatomy or the page-long sentences.

I don't see why people like it, let alone why it's great. I just can't figure out why it's such a classic.",Question,False,,t5_2qhps,False,question,,True,t3_1b29zg,http://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/1b29zg/what_is_great_about_mobydick/,

What I came to realize thanks to my limited knowledge of Russian which is not even close to being enough to read the original Russian versions of the books, is that translation makes the character interactions seem extremely unnatural. When I try to translate what I've read back into Russian, it usually makes much more sense, and seems so much more natural, while when read in English the manner in which the characters speak seems extremely out of place, like a poor, uneducated person speaking in a way that reminds the manner in which an aristocrat might speak. 


I feel like this leads readers of translations miss out on a huge part of the book, and feel very foreign since the reader doesn't get to understand the actual meaning of a certain speech, as it is hard to understand things like sarcasm.


So, what's your opinion on reading Russian classics in translation? Especially those who have read them both in the original language and translated versions (if there is anyone).

I ask this because I'm reading LOTR for the first time and I find that people have had a lot of misconceptions about it. First off, I don't think it's about Magic or the One Ring. I think it's about a lot of things and a lot of people focusing towards common goals. And it's not as Magical as the movies have shown. Sure it has Elves and Dwarves and Dragons and shit, but nobody will be turning a lamp into a newt or whatever. 

But that's not the point, the point is however, is how much did Lord of the Rings influence the literary world? Was Tolkien considered to be one of the Greatest Authors ever, is he still? Was Lord of the Rings held in very high regard, or not as much? And how much did LOTR and The Hobbit influence other books and the Fantasy Genre, and did it actually kickstart the interest in everything we attribute to the Fantasy genre, i.e. Wizards, Quests, Unexpected Heros, stuff like that?

**From his correspondences:**

&gt;I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound and stab us. If the book we are reading doesn't wake us up with a blow on the head, what are we reading it for? We need the books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea inside us.

                                                    * * *

&gt;We are as forlorn as children lost in the woods. When you stand in front of me and look at me, what do you know of the griefs that are in me and what do I know of yours. And if I were to cast myself down before you and weep and tell you, what more would you know about me than you know about Hell when someone tells you it is hot and dreadful? For that reason alone we human beings ought to stand before one another as reverently, as reflectively, as lovingly, as we would before the entrance to Hell.

                                                    * * *

&gt;Write to me only once a week, so that your letter arrives on Sunday  for I cannot endure your daily letters, I am incapable of enduring them. For instance, I answer one of your letters, then lie in bed in apparent calm, but my heart beats through my entire body and is conscious only of you. I belong to you; there is really no other way of expressing it, and that is not strong enough. But for this very reason I don’t want to know what you are wearing; it confuses me so much that I cannot deal with life; and that’s why I don’t want to know that you are fond of me. If I did, how could I, fool that I am, go on sitting in my office, or here at home, instead of leaping onto a train with my eyes shut and opening them only when I am with you?

                                                    * * *

&gt;I write differently from what I speak, I speak differently from what I think, I think differently from the way I ought to think, and so it all proceeds into deepest darkness.

                                                    * * *

&gt;You once said that you would like to sit beside me while I write. Listen, in that case I could not write at all. For writing means revealing oneself to excess; that utmost of self-revelation and surrender, in which a human being, when involved with others, would feel he was losing himself, and from which, therefore, he will always shrink as long as he is in his right mind… That is why one can never be alone enough when one writes, why there can never be enough silence around one when one writes, why even night is not night enough.

                                                    * * *

**The Castle:**

&gt;I can’t think of any greater happiness than to be with you all the time, without interruption, endlessly, even though I feel that here in this world there’s no undisturbed place for our love, neither in the village nor anywhere else; and I dream of a grave, deep and narrow, where we could clasp each other in our arms as with clamps, and I would hide my face in you and you would hide your face in me, and nobody would ever see us any more.",,False,,t5_2qhps,1341313873.0,,,True,t3_vz247,http://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/vz247/happy_birthday_franz/,

The five big ones:

1. Gosh this arts vs sciences stuff is heavy-handed. Could this have been handled better by Atwood? How?

2. The technology has aged in an unflattering way that I think Atwood could have easily foreseen/fixed -- especially as she goes into some detail in a note at the back of the book about all the research she did. CD-Roms? Really? Did this bother you?

3. Plot point: I didn't buy Jimmy/Snowman's reason for shooting Crake, at all, and as that is such a pivotal thing, it somewhat ruined the story for me. Yes, Crake just killed Oryx. It still doesn't make sense to me. Can anyone explain it? Did anyone else feel that it required a suspension of disbelief/was Atwood really stretching character to fit plot?

4. Leaving the radio in the watchtower and that not causing some angst. Snowman's response when he realises he's left it: oh well. After he heard voices on it anyway? Really? Just unbelievable and seems like a forced plot point.

5. Oryx's character. Atwood has written some amazing feminist things -- Handmaid's Tale of course comes to mind -- but Oryx's character is such a cipher that I had to suspend disbelief for her. Is Snowman's memory that untrustworthy? I feel as if we're meant to trust Snowman's memories (or else the narrative structure doesn't make sense) but then Oryx is completely unbelievable.

Is it practical?

Secondly, what kind of courses are in the agenda? Obviously it will be a lot of reading and double that in papers, but what pieces of lit do you work with most/least.

1. What do you take away from his books? Why do you think he's important?

1. How do you compare Dostoyevsky to other authors (Camus, Tolstoy, etc.)?

    I've read this story a few times, and I think about it often. What I get out of it is confidence in my own decisions and a sense of conviction. In the story there is a character that goes against the laws and opinion of his country in pursuit of his own interests and goals. He also picks back up after a disastrous first attempt. 

    The character, John Harman, is a rocket scientist. His country has outlawed all rocketry and space exploration due to religious beliefs. They see space exploration as the same thing as Eve eating the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden. Harman, on the other hand, sees space as humanity's destiny, and puts his whole life and freedom on the line to further rocketry and space exploration.

    I find the story interesting because of both the story and the background context. Asimov always takes a purely academic approach to talking about religion, such as his famous *Guide to the Bible.* But, in ""Trends,"" Asimov seems to be openly calling out religious intervention in politics.

I should also say, though, that his work really isn't that difficult relative to certain other better writers - it's just that the difficulty of DFW does not pay off in ratio. I didn't stop reading *Infinite Jest* partway through because it was too long or difficult. I stopped because it is bad.

(In case this wasn't clear, major spoilers)",IamlegendAMA,58,8,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/1gkk6i/just_finished_rereading_east_of_eden_what_do_you/,"This is one of those polarizing books that everybody either loves or hates. Everybody seems to either cite it as one of literature's most profound novels or the downfall of Steinbeck's ability to write. Personally, I'm in the former group (I wouldn't have reread it otherwise). I'd really love to discuss it with someone, no matter their opinion on it. I'll start with a few things I noticed about the book, feel free to expand upon them, criticize them, tear them apart, or throw in your own.  

* Cathy/Kate: her character is among the more controversial aspects of the book. I've heard critics complain that her character was boring and unbelievable because she is ""all evil"". While normally I'm not a fan of one dimensional characters, I thought it worked here. Cathy was meant to be an embodiment of all evil, all of humanity's sins in one person. Today she would probably be labeled as a sociopath (Whose existence in the novel I do not find unbelievable). She exposes the weaknesses of mankind, and forces the people around her to confront their own. Because of her twisted world view she is unable to see the good in others, a view which other characters, especially Adam and Cal, go great lengths to disprove to themselves. My English teacher always said that a character cannot be a symbol, but her existence as pure evil may be one of the few exceptions to this rule.

* The ability to choose goodness: This theme one of the most prevalent in the novel and is lain out clearly in Lee's ""Timshel"" discussion (which I personally found to be one of the most profound and inspiring scenes I've ever read). Steinbeck expresses the idea that you can choose to be good, that no matter your circumstances or genetics you can choose to overcome sin and be a good person, some may struggle more than others but the choice lies in all men. While this struggle is presented to almost every character (Adam when naming the twins, Abra in response to Aron's perceived image of purity, Aron after finding his mother, etc.) Cal struggles with this the most, trying to force his way into virtue until Adam presents this ultimate choice on his deathbed.

* Inheritance: One of the largest barriers for the other characters to ""choose goodness"" is the guilt they feel from what they have inherited. This inheritance is often portrayed as money (such as Adam's inheritance of Cyrus' stolen money and Aron's inheritance of Cathy's money), but usually exists for beyond that. Cal is forced to come to terms with what he has inherited from his mother, especially his cruel tendencies, to choose goodness. The failure to do so is shown in Aron, who after learning about is mother becomes distraught and broken, indirectly leading to his death.

* Steinbeck's maximalist, meandering style of writing: Besides Cathy, this is probably the other most criticized aspect of the book. I as well as many others enjoyed many of Steinbeck's long digressions, detailed environmental descriptions, and brief comments about various aspects of early 20th century life, I have to admit I filed to see the importance in some of the side plot lines. I found the long, regular descriptions of the Hamilton family excessive, and personally I think these should have been shortened considerably (I do, however, acknowledge the possibility that I am ""missing something"" and would love to have this opinion refuted)

I understand that the philosophy is a huge part of it but there doesn't seem to be any kind of narrative either.  I was under the impression that it was a novel.  Is this book really just the philosophical ideals of a fictional character without any or much story to it at all?  Is there any point to read it strictly from a literary point of view?  To be clear, I'm not particularly interested in Nietzche, but I usually like reading novels that are considered ""classics"".  Even if I don't like them, at least I can try to see what made them so popular.  My gripe here is that ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"" does not appear to be a novel at all.  Is this accurate?

Vital for critical appreciation is the ability to “interpret” a piece of literature, which basically means coming up with a cogent, interesting account of what a piece of lit means, what it’s trying to do to/for the reader, what technical choices the author’s made in order to try to achieve the effects she wants, and so on.

B.) intellectually 

I'm thinking about pursuing a bachelors  degree in English. Literature has and will always be something I'm passionate about. I've recently came to a cross roads in my life where I was faced with either a.) doing something that I love and am interested it (English degree) while risking financial security or doing something practical such as a science or computer science degree which seems to be on the rise in high demand. 

So my question to you guys is...

If there are any English, literature or comparative literature majors in the house; are you happy with your decision?  Do you regret not doing something more practical? What are some personal rewards that it has brought you?

I love Pynchon, Nabakov and Beckett among others so I don't have that much problem with how to approach prose, however I have never studied Joyce and found Wolff (Jacob's room) really effing difficult so I have a feeling this will prove quite a challenge if I don't love/grok the plot. Also I am like, seriously, short on time (I estimate about one hr per day tops). I am in the legal profession and unfortunately for my soul/relaxation but vital to my clients, this will always take priority....

I know from my love of Senor Pynchon that I will enjoy without catching EVERYTHING but I do need to know what's going on to keep going (and I sense that with Pynchon that is easier as well).

What do you think is the best way to do this on my own? 

Are there any editions that I have to stay away from?

Do you know good guides that will help me with references/context but not force interpretations on me? I would rather not use one and just read/enjoy while taking some of my own notes here and there for looking up later on the 'webz.

To start things off, I'd like to say that I am 15. I hope that my age won't bring about a storm of down-votes as I'm here to learn how to appreciate from you guys. I want to learn how black text on dry paper can create vibrant worlds full of colours and personalities. I want to be able to appreciate the English Language and witness Literature giving a language a tune and a song. 

I have not read a lot of books so far and I'd like to change that. Off the top of my head, the books that I remember reading so far are as follows:

- The History of Love, by Nicole Krauss
- A Farewell to Arms, by Hemingway 
- Breakfast of Champions, by Vonnegut
- Disgrace, by Coetzee
- Lord of the Flies, by Golding
- Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte

I am currently reading 1984 by Orwell, and I have to admit that although it's a great book, it isn't as amazing as Reddit hyped it up to be. At the middle of the story it started feeling a little like Dictatorship 101 to me, with little tid-bits here and there on how to be an efficient dictator and how to oppress optimally. 

Brave New World by Huxley is next on my list and I feel that 1984 will serve as an excellent prelude to it from what I've gathered from a few friends I have. Some of the political theory goes way above my head and I'm not quite sure what to do about that at the moment. Also, I'm pretty sure I'm missing out on some clever word play by Orwell and certain uses of literary devices. Thinking about these things make my reading experience dull and makes me feel inadequate.

I was hoping that /r/Literature could give me a few tips, and perhaps set-up a small reading list that I could get into. As of now, I feel that my entry to literature has been sort of a baptism by fire. (I'm not too sure if I used that phrase correctly, but I do believe it's an idiom coined by Shakespeare! God isn't this language amazing?). I'm not entirely sure on what my preferences on books are currently, but I think I prefer more modern books; whatever the adjective modern entails in the world of literature! To explain myself a little bit, I would have to say that I prefer a more ""now""-style of writing. I found the language in Jane Eyre a little daunting, and when I was reading Disgrace, I found the text to be soft and mellow as I drifted along the story. I'm sorry if I don't make any sense.

Lastly, I'd like to say that I'm from Singapore, so maybe great ""American novels"" (just saw this term here) wouldn't interest me as much as it would for Americans.

That is until now. I'm not a literature wiz, I couldn't get through two chapters of *Pride and Prejudice* or *Catcher in the Rye*, but I do like to read classics now and then. And then I thought I'd have a go at Dante's *Divine Comedies* (translated and with notes for me of course). Within *Inferno* I finally came to Dante's meeting with Count Ugolino. I read it once, then read it again to make sure I was reading it right and the second time my heart just wrenched for him, especially after reading the historic notes in the back. I thought, as many of the characters in the *Divine Comedies* are historically based, I'd look up Count Ugolino and found out about the so called [cannibal count](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugolino_della_Gherardesca). His story wouldn't get out of my mind. I then read the poem's section a third time and this time for reasons I still don't quite know why, I just bawled my eyes out. Perhaps it was just the injustice of medieval Europe or just that real situation of absolute despair him, his sons and grandsons went through at that time. It amazes me sometimes how an 800 year old poem can still pack a massive emotional punch (My heart's thumping just thinking about Ugolino's section right now). Anyone else with a similar experience?

I will go first with my 3 favorite quotes.

From *Invictus* By William Henley

     ""In the fell clutch of circumstance
     I have not winced nor cried aloud.
     Under the bludgeonings of chance
     My head is bloody, but unbowed.""

    

Also from The Things They Carried, by Tim O'Brian

    ""A true war story is never moral. It does not instruct, nor encourage virtue, nor suggest models of proper
     human behavior, nor restrain men from doing the things men have always done. If a story seems moral, do
     not believe it. If at the end of a war story you feel uplifted, or if you feel that some small bit of 
     rectitude has been salvaged from the larger waste, then you have been made the victim of a very old 
     and terrible lie. There is no rectitude whatsoever. There is no virtue. As a first rule of thumb, therefore, 
     you can tell a true war story by its absolute and uncompromising allegiance to obscenity and evil. And 
     in the end, of course, a true war story is never about war. It's about sunlight. It's about the special 
     way that dawn spreads out on a river when you know you must cross the river and march into the 
     mountains and do things you are afraid to do. It's about love and memory. It's about sorrow. It's about
     sisters who never write back and people who never listen.”

    

and from Cormac McCarthy's Novel ""The Road"".  I don't know if this is my favorite quote from the book (there are too many to count or judge) but for some reason this passage always leaves me feeling breathless and could not have been a better ending to the book.

    ""Once there were brook trout in the streams in the mounains. You could see them standing in the amber
     current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand.
     Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in
     its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep
     glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.”

But it is no task to explain how William Blake was obviously quite 'insane', with his divine visions which played a big part in his writings, or how Nietzsche (rather romantically) was the 'genius who went mad'. But that's just the writer themselves. Sometimes it's important for the characters in specific works to be mad, such as Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth, or Dostoyevskys Raskolnikov. Other times it's important for there to be some form of madness in the setting, like Hellers Catch 22, highlighting the madness of war itself. Even Goldings Lord of the Flies, which is in it's own way a testament to the inherent savagery of man himself, and the madness that may be linked with that.

Thoughts on Finnegan's Wake.,j_la,49,6,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/1j4zpj/is_there_such_thing_as_an_untranslatable_text/,"I have come across a few articles in the past year which discuss an ongoing project that is attempting to translate Finnegans Wake into Chinese. Here is an example:

http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/joyces-finnegans-wake-takes-off-in-china/?_r=0

For those of you unfamiliar with Finnegans Wake, it is a radical reworking of the English language and conventions of story-telling. While it is still ""English"" (considering grammar, phonetics, and signification), it is built largely around puns, neologisms, and portmanteaus, which a lot of the meaning into the structure of the words and their resonances withing a particular culture. On top of that, it makes use of 60-70 different languages (creating a veritable babble, in all senses of the word...).

I have thought about the translatability of the Wake a good deal since having read it and I have discussed this issue with my reading group. IMO, a pun is almost impossible to translate since the point of reference can be lost. I have my doubts whether a text so complex can be ""translated"" or whether a translation could capture what Joyce is doing (seeing as how I cannot read Chinese, I can't verify the quality of the translation). Then again, this could be an obstacle to all translation, simple or complex.

Do you think that there is such thing as an untranslatable text (assuming that both languages are known)? Is translation an ultimately impossible enterprise or do we need to get rid of notions of ""authenticity"" and ""accuracy"" altogether?

P.S. Has anyone heard of Finnegan's Wake being translated into other languages or have you read one yourself? If so, what did you think?

This essay really helped me understand and see the transition that took place from the ""classics"" with whole worlds, atmospheres, and other good stuff that still have people buying them today, to a type of fiction that is heavy in irony, exploiting hypocrisy, and other qualities that I can't write as well as Wallace. 

I am still a young reader, but this essay really would have throttled my brain if I read it in high school. A possible reason I can come up with is that maybe they tried it in some high school and Johny Briefcase came home to Joe Briefcase and started handing out PSA announcements on the negative consequences of T.V. on U.S. fiction. Instead of looking past his son to a possible piece of literature worth reading, he sees his son as yelling ""TV IS BAD"". At which point phone calls are made and complaints are given. ""Why isn't my kid being taught what I was taught in school? I'm not here to learn with him."" (which is a whole other issue)

Or maybe teachers are more concerned with teaching high schoolers how to read as opposed to what to read. If a high school english teacher answered this question that'd be exciting!

PS. I really enjoyed the passages from DeLillo's ""White Noise"" about the most photographed barn in the world. I know what I'll be reading this summer.

You've got Gibson on the cyberpunk end, Orwell in the adult/political sense, Fahrenheit in the YA set (technically), The Hunger Games (which has yet to prove its staying power, but IMO has potential).

Which provides the take on it you best relate to both as reader and lover of literature?

For me, Fahrenheit is my perennial fave because it takes something mundane (firefighters) and turns it into both an important point and statement of society. Bradbury's YA stuff is the best take on it for me. Because it often works with simple ideas and transforms them into something else entirely. Orwell (though I do like his stuff) doesn't translate as well to me, because it works with higher level or very specific things. *Animal Farm,* case in point. And to me, the same is true of Gibson. Love *Neuromancer,* but the fact is - it's not widely relatable, Gibson's style aside. It focuses on the dystopia of a time, not the dystopia that more feasibly could be (see 1984. It could well happen). 

To relate back to Fahrenheit specifically, the underlying thing with it is government reeducation and destruction of conflicting ideology. As far as how ""real"" it could be, in the way Bradbury does it, it could be. But as far as relation to the real world? Maybe not so much, especially how things are today (internet, etc). 

That said - I also read for escapism, so there's that. For my tastes, I don't like the hyperrealistic stuff when I'm trying to read in my downtime. And thus, not claiming my opinion as law.

Anton Chigurh is a killer. He’s ruthless, smart, meticulous, and poised; he doesn't show the slightest amount of remorse for his actions. As readers, we cannot help but be stunned by his relentless disregard for human life. Even his fellow hit men label him as a “goddamned psychopath”.  Despite this however, Chigurh evokes an inexplicable feeling of admiration, or at the very least a sense of awe—he seems to operate on a different level than most of us. There is a strange sense of order and consistency to Chigurh’s actions, and McCarthy paints his character as something more akin to a force of nature rather than a human being. It seems far fetched to think that someone who acts like little more than a killing machine could have anything even faintly resembling a moral code, yet the underlying order of Chigurh’s behaviors suggest that there are principles that he lives by that have shaped Chigurh into the character that he is.

I thought the book was depicting him doing all that subconsciously until I got to the last line. Bam! Either I'm totally off track, or Jake's completely aware of the dynamics in their relationship.

I couldn't help thinking, aside from the ludicrous gore, how near ""Pynchonesque"" Tarantino has become over the years. Especially with his foray into historical fiction, I think Tarantino would be absolutely perfect for adapting *Mason &amp; Dixon*, with its almost-too-clever dialogue and myriad absurdities. I'd even be fine with him throwing in random violence, I think, if he could keep the general feel of the novel.

I know Paul Thomas Anderson is filming the first adaptation of a Pynchon work next year (*Inherent Vice*, which I haven't read), so maybe that means Pynchon is relenting a bit and might be willing to let his more ambitious works get the Hollywood treatment, in the best way possible.

I've also started to think who might be capable of adapting my favorite novel, DeLillo's *Underworld*, and am having a bit more trouble. I thought about my favorite current director, David Fincher, but I think his super-clean style would be incongruous with the source material, though it'd be undoubtedly cool. Michael Haneke could handle the mood well, but maybe not the grand scope. Cronenberg proved himself fairly adept, but, again, *Underworld* is just so big. It might be too much to hope since he hasn't really been relevant in 20-30 years, but if Francis Ford Coppola could return to his *Godfather Part II*-era brilliance, he might be the only one I could imagine doing a good job.

1373495407.0,36,self.literature,1i1fvb,Let's talk about Ngugi wa Thiong'o,massdisasterblast,46,10,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/1i1fvb/lets_talk_about_ngugi_wa_thiongo/,"Ngugi is one of my favorite writers, and I was hoping to stimulate some discussion by briefly going over some of his works that I've read.  I will not discuss plot, because I'd rather not spoil anything, but instead I'll be touching on broad themes in a casual way (I'm on my phone, so I won't be quoting jargon or getting too turgid).  Here we go:

The Wizard of the Crow:  This is Ngugi's most recent novel, and it is a monster.  It combines fantasy, African politics, farce, and satire in a novel that is a (admittedly longwinded) distillation of the experience of postcolonial SubSaharan governance and, more broadly, life.  This book is hilarious, and you'll find humour in its pages that sees Ngugi in a more whimsical place than you're likely to see in his earlier books, which focus more on the problems of Kenyan independence and all the troubles brought by the Mau Mau Uprising and so forth (more on that below).  I really don't want to give too much away, but I'm confident in saying readers will like this novel even if they have no interest in East African life or circumstances.

Weep Not, Child:  This is Ngugi's first novel, and I dare say that it pales in comparison to his later works.  However, it is interesting to read if you have a fascination, like I do, in seeking out where an author finds their voice.  It is a story about the relationships between colonizer and colonized, labor, economics, and violence.  So, essentially, it is a Ngugi novel.  However, the characters are sparsely detailed and the settings briefly described.  Basically, this is Ngugi in ""minor mode,"" and everything from the plot to the thematic elements are sparsely sketched, almost as if the book could serve as an outline to Ngugi's more major works.

The River Between:  This is a book about change, and the relationship of two villages and their leaders amidst what I would broadly call ""colonial influence.""  It is a book of clashing cultures and ideologies, a look at how the amalgamation different ways of life can lead to conflict.  It is a book which should be required reading, because, like Chinua Achebe's famous Things Fall Apart, it seeks to describe in 150 pages the roots of discord in colonial African culture, and succeeds in a rare way.  It is a top down look at ""how we got to where we are"" in Kenya in the mid-twentieth century.

A Grain of Wheat:  In the most broad sense, this book is about the struggle for Uhuru during the Mau Mau uprising, not unlike Petals of Blood.  However, setting it apart Ngugi's earlier works, this book is much more about interpersonal relationships in a context which most of us will find alien, at least to a degree.  Once again we find themes of older East African modes of thought clashing with colonially-influenced, nascent ways of interpreting the world, but Ngugi here really delves into how these changing thought processes effect people on an individual level.  More required reading.

Petals of Blood:  In my (admittedly pretty worthless) opinion, this is Ngugi's  magnum opus, the jewel of his oeuvre.  Another book set in the Mau Mau Uprising, this one touches on Ngugi's familiar themes of education, isolation, and colonial influence on thought, while expanding his ideas on self-governance and the personal toll revolution, violence, and social change have on the individual.  This is not a long book, but it is expansive and encompassing.  If I had to point to one novel that most instructed the formation of my ideas on postcolonial Africa, it is this one.  Once again, I'm not going into details, but this is a must, must read.  This book is occasionally funny, sometimes mysterious, and always heartwrenching. 

I'm tired of typing with my thumbs but later I intend to edit in some information about Ngugi's biographical works, Dreams in a Time of War and In The House of the Interpreter.  I may also expand on my ideas and add some more specific and useful information when I am actually in front of a keyboard.",,False,,t5_2qhps,False,,,True,t3_1i1fvb,http://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/1i1fvb/lets_talk_about_ngugi_wa_thiongo/,

The largest suggestion of this is when the narrator's train of thought gets interrupted when something happens to Tom in the novel. I don't have the book with me at the moment, but I know that this happens several times throughout the course of the novel. One example that I can think of off the top of my head is when Tom is sitting in a train across from Dickie, contemplating killing him, when Dickie wakes up from his nap and sees Tom staring at him.  
  
The narrator is also extremely sympathetic to Tom's point of view. The most concrete evidence of this is that the narrator describes people very similarly to how Tom describes people. The narrator focuses on things like Marges shape and ugly hair, while paying close attention to the attractive features of Dickie. Of course, Highsmith gives the narrator parts of Tom's viewpoints in order to make it easier for the reader to sympathize with the antihero, but I believe this has a larger meaning.   
  
The third person narration would make sense in Tom Ripley's case because it emphasizes the detachment that Tom has from the rest of the world. Tom easily switches identities and can examine the identity of ""Tom"" through someones else's eyes with relative ease. When pretending to be Dickie, he even forgets for a moment ""how to act like Tom"", illustrating Tom's ability to look at his life from a third person perspective.

The color is never mentioned in the first act. Depends on how you look at it. 

   Vladimir hints to Estragon that Pozzo has drastically changed after what was supposedly their first encounter. The next time they see him, he is blind. That's another clue to my argument but it also leads me to believe that Pozzo's character (getting a little off track here) is the only kinetic force in their lives. Everything else is the same. The little boy, Estragon's boots, the tree, thoughts about suicide, waiting for Godot, etc.

   Everything is so routine that they lose complete track of time. At one point they even argue over whether the sun is setting or rising. Then there's the scene where Pozzo is checking his time and Vladimir tells him there's no use since ""time has stopped"".

3. Boys like complete round things and are terrified of menstruation. 

4. It has become more clear to me than ever that whether or not the author intended an insight doesn't matter.

5. His writing method keeps the reader on his toes.

6. The idea of revealing narrative through different voices.

7. Faulkner has taught me that you aren't always supposed to understand what you are reading.

8. Until reading Faulkner, I hadn't recognized the significance of the said and the un-said, who gets to speak and who doesn't.

9. The same act can be seen as either courage or cowardice.

10. Be careful of what gets you from one sunrise to the next, because whatever you may think is real may blind you to reality.

11. The Civil War caused fractures in Southern society that will never be fully healed. 

12. In a hunting story, we can actually make a connection with the beast that is being hunted.  

13. History is indebted to those who came before, but is revisable. 

14. I have finally realized how regressively obsessive the human mind can be.

15. I find that the “disturbing” aspects of character psychology exposed by Faulkner are more familiar than not, and it is comforting.

16. Always distrust your first reading, but always remember what you first thought.

17. Don’t have a family.  I have also learned the power of deliberately deferred meaning.

18. The tension between knowing your history so you can change it and dwelling upon it is treacherous and even fatal without the application of new thought.

19. Love, loss, and finding oneself.

20. Repetition with revision.  

21. The passage of time as something that digs down rather than moves forwards.

22. Memories are not always of the past but present with us every second.

23. I loved the juxtaposition of people and their narration.

24. History is cyclical and an always present reminder and influence, but we have the power to rewrite it.

25. While discovering true knowledge is a nearly unachievable task, what is important is to *try* and discover it.

**Backstory**: I recently read ""Notes from the Underground"" and, after generally liking it, decided to continue with Dostoyevsky. This decision was subconscious, kind of like, ""oh cool something to look forward to later at another time."" I don't know if NftU represents his writing as a whole but I thought it to be a great introduction to an otherwise daunting body of literature. 

Weeks pass. Little thought of Dostoyevsky. 

Then by happenstance I found myself rummaging through a box of free books on the street today and picked up ""The Possessed"" (love free boxes of books). I thought to myself, ""score! This is a better surprise than a good-tasting low-fat smoothie!"" 

Then I thought again - is there a suggested chronology to reading this man? Should I think more about this decision, jumping into ""The Possessed"" as an immediate second read? For anyone who is familiar with this particular work, there seems to be a political context embedded, of which I know little - would this prevent me from enjoying/understanding it? Is there a generally accpeted chronology suggested for reading his works, i.e. would reading work A before work B make work B more digestible/logical/worth the time?

*Sidenote*: I am concerned with this because I generally have a hard time putting down a book I begin. Sounds premeditated, I know, but sometimes it helps to see it through 'til the end.

**TL;DR** : Read ""Notes from the Underground"" first, would appreciate suggestions for second Dostoyevsky book with explanation.

So I'm having a massive crisis of memory. I remember back in college, we had to analyze story after story according to four or five different criteria. But, for the life of me, I cannot remember what these simple criteria were. And because I've been asked to help my brother in his university-exam about a book I have read and he hasn't had the time (Yeah, it's a student's life) to read, I suddenly find myself in the odd position to analyze a story again. So I ask you for help. Here's what I remember:

* One of the instruments was called ""The World"". This was used to describe the setting of the story and the world's functions. 
* If I am not entirely mistaken, Umberto Eco came up with these instruments.
* Other instruments dealt with the tenses used and grammar. I think.
* Two of the instruments were mostly identical, but usually ended up being diverse enough to matter.

So my question: What are these tools and what are they used for?

Thank you very much for your help! I just might try to get in contact with my old professor from waybackthen and ask him about it, because this has been bugging me a lot in the past few days.

Indeed, I can't readily find an essay that suggests they *are* the same. 

Much of *Moby Dick* is didactic, of course. The musings on the whale mammal, the color white, and even religious references are meant to ""teach"" the reader something (be it scientific, labor-oriented, spiritual, philosophical, whatever), or even to humor the reader with sarcasm and wit, but to what end? Does Melville-the-writer want to convey something specific about *his* perspective on life, or is he delivering varying meditations so as to give the reader something to think about? Sometimes Ishmael's message may overlap with that of Melville's, but I would not consider it a one-to-one match. 

The narrative point of view in *Moby Dick* is not consistent, toggling between first person perspective (Ishmael) to third person omniscient. This provides an opportunity for potentially conflicting opinions, though it does not prove that Ishmael is not the voice of Melville. Indeed, the separation may provide evidence that when Melville wanted to say something specific, he used Ishmael to do so, and when he wanted to step outside himself, he reverted to third person omniscient. Who is to say, though? 

Many scholars [here's one](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/25111433?uid=3739832&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102049168843) suggest that the switching back and forth between narration styles is a structural or modal conceit that Melville uses - a la Shakespeare - to manage the stage production of the novel, that one needs to pull back a take a broad look at the actors and action to get a better feel for context.

What say you, /r/literature? Are Melville and Ishmael synonymous?

However, there are many good editions and many bad ones. The difference is difficult to discern unless you know the text well. 

For example: Shakespeare's ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" is widely available online. Gutenberg project makes you download; not always useful. The MIT online should be reliable, but it is riddled with typos. I discovered this the hard way while teaching it. Another exemplum gratis: I prefer the ""In Search of Lost Time"" translation of Proust to ""Remembrance of Things Past.""

I was thinking that we could name an author of the day and contributors could help with wade through the multiple media and editions and give their best recommendations.

I was also thinking we could start a subreddit, like r/library.

The questions:
Is this a stupid idea? The wrong forum? Not Reddit's job?
Is it replicating Google Scholar, etc.?
Is there anyone here or perhaps in another subreddit that would be interested in such a project?

Towercity recommends we let the patron choose by including the merits of any editions that may exist. I think that is an interesting, if more intensive, labor. This seems like an informed ""amazon review"" option or a booksellers recommendation shelf. Educated and helpful.

There are a bunch of problems with the award itself, but a ton of people seem to be misinformed and think the award is more prejudiced/snobbish than it is.

1. Proust, Fitzgerald, etc. There are plenty of writers out there who were snubbed by the academy. These guys are not a part of that group. These guys died relatively young. Fitzgerald died at the age of 44 and hadn't published anything of much value in quite some years at the time of his death. Proust was 51, and he died before the last 3 volumes of In Search of Lost Time were published. His oeuvre wasn't exactly Nobel-worthy at the time of his death. And with the average age of literature laureates 63, these people died before they had had a decent shot at the prize. 

2. And even if the writer did live long enough to have had a lot of chances to win, that does not mean they are entitled to an award. Tastes change. Sinclair Lewis and Pearl S. Buck are hardly read anymore; Dickens was considered a pulpy writer during his life, or so I've heard. John Galsworthy was considered one of the greatest writers of his time, won the Nobel, but his work has lost its relevancy, and so his reputation has faded. Basically, just because some old author's work is still read a lot today does not mean he or she deserved the Nobel; there may have been better writers around the globe at the same time whose work is no longer quite as popular as it once was. And besides, the former author still has a big readership, and I think that's better than a Nobel.

3. There's been so much anti-American bias since the award's inception! No. Just no. That bias has only been there for the past few years. The USA has actually had 10 people win the prize (Sinclair Lewis, Eugene O'Neil, Pearl S. Buck, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck, Saul Bellow, Isaac Singer, Joseph Brodsky, and Toni Morrison) and that's a ton more than what other countries have won. Stop feeling like America needs to win the prize, there are plenty of other countries with Nobel worthy candidates, and no, just because you have not heard of them does not mean they are not worthy. True, it took 30 years for the USA to get its first Nobel literature prize, but within the first 50 years of the award, only 6 laureates were not European citizens, and 4 of those were from the USA.

Sorry for the rant, but there just seems to be so much misinformation going around about the prize/a lot of whining about why one author didn't win that I wanted to say something. Yes, there have been plenty of authors who were worthy of the award that didn't get it (Borges, Joyce), but there have been plenty of others who never had a shot, either due to other writers at the time being considered better or thanks to an early death.

I recently finished the ebook version (thankfully we didn't have to wait as long as we did for Harry Potter on ebook.)

I really enjoyed the novel. I'm not a regular mystery reader so I did come to this more out of curiosity about Rowling's writing than anything about the blurb capturing me. I'm really glad for that and sometimes I think readers need to be ""tricked"" into tasting something outside of their preferred flavor. 

It's a solid story told very well. In this it differers slightly to my opinion of Harry Potter which I feel was an incredible story told well. The basic plot of the book could probably be found in hundreds of detective novels but the characters and way they went about their work were infinitely more interesting than finding out ""whodunnit."" 

The book is narrated by two characters. The main protagonist Cormoran Strike is the detective and is a really interesting character. I'm not familiar enough with the genre to see if he's exceptionally cliched or not but I found him extremely well written and characterised. He has two figerative hooks. Firstly that [he is an amputee after a war injury which is kept from the reader for a few chapters and is shocking when you suddenly read in a brusque tone that he removes his prosthetic. Interestingly enough this is kept from the other narrator for much longer. This sort of created an interesting subplot as we're teased with information about the injury and we get to see a disabled character very intimately and how they deal with their injury and assimilating back into life. The internal monologue re. the disability and him debating on how to tell his assistant so that she doesn't pity him is probably some of Rowling's strongest writing to date for me.](/spoiler)

Strike's second ""hook"" is that [he's the illegitimate son of a famous musician. This again is something that colors people's perception of Strike. Especially as the investigation involves Strike meeting people who not only know of his father but actually know him. While not as interesting as the disability to the reader it adds some color and texture to the store and some of the interactions Strike has.](/spoiler)

The second narrator is Strike's temporary assistant, Robin, who largely serves as the reader's eyes. It does feel slightly tropish to have a naive optimistic sidekick to the gruff asocial detective but Robin feels very real and their relationship is an interesting one that grows over the book as Robin demonstrates more competence and Strike becomes more impressed. Thankfully there isn't a romantic spark between them, but rather Robin is enamoured with the thrill of investigating a case. 

The meat of the book is definitely when Strike manages to track down and interview witnesses. Every conversation feels extremely different, it's not just the same scene with different names. It feels dumb to say that but I feel like it's a rare skill for a writer to be able to flesh out so many different characters who have deep and varied motivations. Usually with mysteries I feel you expect the best part of the story to be some eureka Sherlock Holmes moment where the detective has everyone gather around to hear exactly how the murder happened.    

Rowling touches on her favorite theme of classism quite often through the novel. In investigating the suicide of a supermodel, Strike, is frequently interacting with a number of wealthy individuals so there's a lot of ""so that's how the rich live"" moments. 

Oddly enough Rowling frequently mentions Gordon Brown which dates the story slightly and you'd think with her politics if she was trashing any PM it'd be Cameron. 

A couple of negatives that I had were that Rowling attempts to phonetically write accents which is something I feel never works well. She chooses to do this primarily with black or low class characters which feels uncomfortable at times. 

The flow of narration shifts quite abruptly between Robin and Strike which can be jarring because you're not quite sure in places where Strike's narration ends and Robin begins. 

I really look forward to Rowling's next books as I feel like the genre has gotten extremely lazy and more sensationalistic and is ready for someone like Rowling to enter the market and produce quality work that doesn't need to rely on some flashy crime or deep religious conspiracy to catch interest. Unfortunately it does prove that success in the genre is probably more based on name recognition than quality but when you have both in a writer like Rowling we as readers win. More people reading good books is always great. 

This is a huge wall of text I'm afraid. I'd be happy to answer questions on the book for people who haven't read it. 

Discussion topics for readers who have finished the book I think could include [Strike's disability](/spoiler), race/class issues, where next for the series? How balls awesome Strike &amp; Robin are.

He refuses to do what his boss tells him and eventually refuses to do any work at all.

I also hated the narrator who, to me, was simply too weak-willed and filled with misplaced, unfounded upper-class guilt to eject this belligerent transient from his property. He has an entire philosophical and religious crisis about some guy who wants to freeload. And yes I understand how and why he's supposed to represent depression and poverty and all that. 

The story actually amused me as a satire at first because I thought it was mocking the guilt and platonic charity of people like the narrator when faced with poverty and grief-stricken people like Bartleby. The narrator had all of this sorrow and guilt in trying to think about how he should help Bartleby and in return Bartleby just freeloads and smugly refuses to do anything.

I am also interested to hear people's insights into the different themes of the novel.

I think this is showcased in the idea of ""you are always killed by a women, and she becomes your mother in your next life"" idea that is mentioned a few times in the novel.  I don't take the women part literally; Gately was 'killed' by his addiction, but his out of this death came a new life where he acts in a motherly way towards others who are addicted (protecting them, guiding them).  I also saw this theme mirrored in the concavity/convexity trash heap.  It is said that when a section of the waste is turned into energy the land becomes hyper fertile and grows a forest in a few days, kind of showcasing the out of death and waste new life can flourish idea.  

I was wondering if anyone had insight into the themes about communication and silence.  Gately is most in demand when he is unable to respond; Lenz likes walking with the other guy back from meetings because the other guy stays silent and lets him talk the whole time.  Hal goes from being able to communicate but being emotionally dead to being emotionally alive and unable to communicate.  CT communicates everything, but comes negatively in the book.  Lyle sits in silence most of the day, and is in high demand.  I was just wondering what people thought DFW was trying to say with this theme.

I also thought that there was a theme that reversed the common literary theme that physical deformity meant moral deformity.  In this book it seems to be the opposite.  Mario is the most deformed character, and is the pillar of morality (shaking the hands of the homeless who no one else would touch).  Gately is left deformed after standing up and fighting for his beliefs.  Joelle goes from being the PGOAT to being deformed, and also seems to become one of the more moral characters in the novel.

While I often have a vague sense that his work has depth, it seems few discussions touch on much besides the broader arc of his style -- the hysterical realism, the cartoonish characters, the self-reference, and the moralizing. The problem here is that none of these things are particularly unique or interesting in and of themselves -- DFW is almost a Pynchon plagiarist at points (it was extremely eerie reading Crying of Lot 49 after Infinite Jest). But because these are the most easily perceptible parts of his writing, they dominate conversation, which makes it extremely difficult to parse what actually makes his work unique or powerful.

My working theory basically has something to do with biographical pathos -- how the depression and mania that haunts the DFW-author-persona is used to create a sometimes touching meta-narrative and how his experimentation and (maybe frequent) failures in using certain techniques also elicits reader sympathy.

The most obvious example of the latter would be Octet, which is like John Barth qua Clingy Girlfriend -- and I don't mean that wholly pejoratively. The author-persona in that story all but bows to and kisses the feet of the reader, and it comes off as both totally insane and incredibly touching, depending on the reader’s mood, much like how The Depressed Person can be both comedic and tragic.

But this pathos can be traced in his other, more popular, work as well. A big indictment against DFW is that his characters are neither lovable nor themselves love anyone in any substantive, non-narcissistic way (thinking of James Wood’s and Jon Franzen’s criticisms, mainly). But this in itself contributes to the tragic narrative of the author-persona; the man who could not connect with others, who was deeply troubled by a self-obsession so complete as to amount to solipsism.

The reason this doesn't just make for bad fiction is probably the sheer amount of effort and technical skill he dazzles us with. You can practically see the muscular tissue of his sentences straining to lift the meaning they never or are only rarely able to. He’s like a wannabe Atlas, constantly trying and failing to lift the world. But damn if he doesn’t give us a great show in the meantime: he picks up and casts aside literary techniques like a junkyard scavenger. Reading his oeuvre is like drinking the last 60 years of literature out of blender. DFW was always searching and never finding. And maybe that’s the cruel, infinite joke.

Note 1: I've got no illusions about how interesting the question of whether or not DFW is my thing or not is (that is to say, it isn't), so I beg you not to misunderstand the purpose of this post as such. While I'm not going to pretend I don't have opinions, they aren't the endpoint in mind here. I'm not trying to either destroy an idol or apotheosize a writer. I did used to be a huge DFW fan, and can certainly see the appeal of many of the techniques that I might now condemn. For example, I used to believe Everything Is Green to be a beautiful snapshot, a pure expression of extreme aching offered up without catharsis. Now I think it's sort of an amateur lit-experiment. But either way, this isn't about what I ultimately approve or disapprove of so much as it's about understanding the guy's work.

Note 2: I'm talking about the author and his biographical details as a character that is NOT meant to be the ""actual"" David Foster Wallace so much as the David Foster Wallace that lives in his audience's heads, and I imagine that saying that persona is important isn't too controversial. It's difficult to make the argument that what we know about the making of a work doesn't or shouldn't affect how we read the text. An understanding Milton is all but impossible without at the very least a working knowledge of Christian Theology.

I have a question in regarding F. Scott Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby.* 
  
 I have read several people's opinions about the abundance of Fitzgerald's symbolism in the book. I have seen several people interpret Owl Eyes as a metaphor for God. However, I have seen little explanation as to why this is. I do agree to some extent, but I feel like I'm missing something. 

  If I'm correct, Fitzgerald is arguing that Owl Eyes represents a spectating, but inactive God. This is a thought similar to that of the billboard. The only difference I can infer between Owl Eyes and Dr. T.J. Eckleburg is that Owl Eyes was with Gatsby at his funeral. I also recall reading something abut Nick telling how Owl Eyes resembled the billboard, but can not find it in the book.

  Of the people's opinions I've read, John Green's is what makes me ask this. I have a high respect for him, I would love an explanation from the man himself, but this is unlikely. Here's a video of Mr. Green explaining the various eyes in *The Great Gatsby*

Based on his left leaning philosophy I might guess is that it is more a satire of people who were irrationally fearful of socialism and over all I lean more towards this explanation.  I think the end of the story is somewhat in line with this.  The guy becoming a super man and then getting shot is a pretty big exaggeration.

On the other hand,  you could be a socialist while still disliking the idea of ""handicapping"" as Vonnegut put it.  The first part of the story seems like it could be consistent with this.

Thank you all for the great suggestions. I'm really looking forward into delving into the deep end now.  
**/EDIT**

In high school, our English teacher tested the class one day. We were given a passage to read and were told to write about it. The passage described a boatman attempting to travel upstream to reach his destination (there was more to the story but I’ve forgotten now). The next day we were told that the exercise served to test our metaphorical thinking. We were scored on a scale between 1 and 3; 1 if you simply summarised the story, 2 if you provided some insight and 3 if you successfully understood that the story was a metaphor for the moment of conception (the boatman representing a sperm, etc.). I scored 1.5.

The test was an eye-opener for me. It was alarming to realize that I may be going through life while only scratching the surface of the world around me. My English grades where always mediocre at school and I never really understood the enthusiasm many of my teachers and peers felt for the works of Shakespeare and other authors.

High school was several years ago and I still haven’t resolved this dilemma. As a typical geek, working in I.T., most of my reading has consisted of technical books and science fiction. I would like to improve but I don’t know where to get started; I could just start reading more classical literature but I’m afraid that the deeper meanings might always fly over my head.

Can anyone recommend books or methods to improve metaphorical thinking?

1. Discussion of individual stories is welcome either as standalone works or as part of the collection as a whole.

2. What do you think was Joyce's main idea/overall agenda in this collection? 

3. It has been said that Joyce paid little or no attention to the literary fads of the time. Does that allow the work to hold up better over time?

4. What are your opinions on the cyclic nature of the collection (life cycle)?

5. Do you feel that their were any contextual reasons for the repeating themes in the collection?

6. The stories seem to have a complex relationship with religion. What do you feel was the overall consensus on the subject?

7. Discussions on a specific theme or idea (such as disillusionment, poverty, death, ect.) are fair game.

8. When reading Joyce do you feel a need to understand all of the cultural references or are you content with the basic idea?

I'm very much on the fence between the two, but now I'm able to see Stephen's youthful flaws of idealistic passion and naivety, whereas before I only saw his towering intellect. Simultaneously I'm realizing that Bloom, for all his foibles and weaknesses (both real and perceived), is genuinely a good, caring person who's both able to put aside his ego and stand up to injustice when called upon.

This makes me a touch sad, because I realize my youth is fading, because I'm now better able to sense the remarkable pathos Joyce instilled in this everyday hero, and because I know that these qualities are often unrecognized, both in Bloom and in people in real life.

I think the problem with many of the adaptations is the liberties they take with the text, often cutting out huge chunks in order to be able to make the film a certain length. However, i feel that sometimes it's good to forget about the source material and 'staying true' to it, and just to enjoy the film for what it is, and the artistic direction the director takes it in.

I'm biased towards Macbeth and will give my favourite version of that play only:

Macbeth (1971) - Polinski adaptation which really expands on the character of Ross in an interesting way (has him as the 3rd murderer, active conspirator in the murder of innocents, a bit of an arse-licker) which i think adds some nice depth to the film. Also has a lot of shows of hyper-masculinity (rape and murder) and gore (murder of duncan, general battle scenes, murder of the innocents scene) much of which isn't in the original text, which I think may have stemmed from the murder of his wife and unborn child by Charles Manson's disciples and also his experiences as a child when his house was raided by the SS (he said his murder of the innocents scene was inspired by his experiences as a child.) I also liked the attempts at realism, changing the soliloquies to inner-monologues. 

Throne of Blood is also a great adaptation, whose cultural setting raises a lot more questions about the role of LM in the film and also the role of general masculinity and the idea o 'honour'

Another great version is the Shakespeare Re-Told version starring James McAvoy. I think the fact that it takes place in a restaurant works well to play with the idea of a clichéd feminine space (kitchen) with acts of clichéd masculinity (chopping up a pig.) I also think the Gordon Ramsey-esque King Duncan is a nice addition.

Anyways, what are your guys favourite adaptations of Shakespeare plays?

Originally I had plans of becoming an English major because I just love to read, analyze literature, etc. However, after 2 and a half years in my college's English program, I realized it just wasn't for me anymore.

I wanted a career path that would get me more involved in tech. However, I was also becoming very dissatisfied with the whole program in general at my college. The classes all seemed way too easy in the sense that you acquired new knowledge instead of building off existing stuff; what I mean is that I could walk into a 400 level English course and not need any prior English education, versus in something like math where if I took Algebra 2 I would need a foundation in Algebra 1 first.

I also didn't like how it was being taught. The majority of my classmates were hipsters who spent more time dropping acid and going to indie rock shows than actually reading the books, and they would constantly rattle off ridiculous theories that for some reason 99% of the professors would be afraid to refute, because they kind of had this whole ""painting in the dark"" mentality where the author just kind of farts out this book with no intentions, so basically any observation you made about the book could potentially be correct. I hated this. What the end result was that people would be talking about transgender struggles present in every literary work and the professor would simply nod and say ""that's a good point"" or something.

So now I'm in IT, but I want to continue my English education, even though I don't have time to take English courses anymore. What is the best way for me to keep learning about literature and poetry while not studying it in school? I want to have a objective perspective of literature, not the subjective one my school seemed to enforce where meaning was whatever you could back up with out-of-context quotes.

I find that this passage is far too important not to be shared, so here it is again, complete with analysis at end. From *Death in the Afternoon*, by Ernest Hemingway:
 
&gt;	After you go to the bullfights for a certain length of time, when you see what they can be, if finally they come to mean something to you, then sooner or later you are forced to take a definite position about them. Either you stand for the real bulls, the complete bullfight and hope that good bullfighters will develop who will know how to fight, as for instance Marcial Lalanda does, or that a great bullfighter will appear who can afford to break the rules as Belmonte did, or you accept the condition the fiesta is in now, you know the bullfighters, you see their point of view; there are, in life, always good and valid excuses for every failure; and you put yourself in the bullfighters' place, put up with their disasters on the bulls they fail with, and wait for the bull that they want. Once you do that you become as guilty as any of those that live off and destroy bullfighting and you are more guilty because you are paying to help destroy it. All right, but what are you to do? Should you stay away? You can but you cut your nose to spite your face that way. As long as you get any pleasure from the fiesta you have a right to go. You can protest, you can talk, you can convince others of what fools they are, but those are all fairly useless things to do, although protests are necessary and useful at the time in the ring. But there is one thing you can do and that is know what is good and what is bad, to appreciate the new but let nothing confuse your standards. You can continue to attend bullfights even when they are bad; but never applaud what is not good. You should, as a spectator, show your appreciation of the good and valuable work that is essential but not brilliant. You should appreciate the proper working and correct killing of a bull that it is impossible to be brilliant with. A bullfighter will not be better than his audience very long. If they prefer tricks to sincerity they soon get the tricks. If a really good bullfighter is to come and to remain honest, sincere, without tricks and mystifications there must be a nucleus of spectators that he can play for when he comes. If this sounds too much like a Christian Endeavor programme may I add that I believe firmly in the throwing of cushions of all weights, pieces of bread, oranges, vegetables, small dead animals of all sorts, including fish, and, if necessary, bottles provided they are not thrown at the bullfighters' heads, and the occasional setting fire to a bull ring if properly decorous protest has had no effect.
 
&gt;-Ernest Hemingway, Death in the Afternoon, p.142-3
 
I am a painter. I have just finished my first semester in an MFA program in New York City. While in the city, I went to a great number of shows at galleries in Chelsea and at museums. I propose that Mr. Hemingway is here not only speaking of bullfights specifically, but is actually making a statement that is applicable to any and all of the arts.
 
I have seen many bad shows, both at the museums and at the galleries. This has led me to wonder if it is even worth my time to go to these shows. Would I not be better off sticking to the established masters on show at MoMA or the Met? And I think Hemingway has made a pretty solid argument for continuing to go to those shows. It is important for me to know what is going on in the contemporary art world. I should continue to go to those shows. But I must stay true to myself and the standards I hold. I can never give into the pressure of following the crowd. Because the crowd likes a lot of fairly terrible art. Sometimes the crowd really likes good art. And that is where I can applaud.
 
I will go out on a limb here and say that the same thing can be said concerning music, dance, theatre, food, and everything in between. I would like to now open the floor for discussion, so feel free to speak your mind, disagree, agree, place qualifiers, whatever.

P.S.: I know that I may be in a vast minority here, but I do actually believe that painting can be said to be GOOD or BAD. I don't follow the notion that it is entirely subjective. In fact, I'd say that the history of art shows that it is pretty objective.

I remember it so vividly; I was in my 9th grade English Literature class during one of our ""silent"" reading days, rabidly (and tensely) immersed in Orwell's 1984, when I spied my teacher – an old, eccentric hippie who had claimed to have read the entire Russian literature section of the L.A. Public Library – walk over to his aged, tacky Ghettoblaster and turn it on. Suddenly, this chilling, hypnotic music flowed out of the speakers. I continued reading, and some forty minutes later, after the music had ended, I – and a good many of my peers – had no idea know what had just transpired or why. I only knew that I had loved it. That was the first time I had ever been exposed to Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon. God, I still get chills when I think about the first time I heard “Breathe.”

Anyway, I’m digressing. From that point on, I could not separate these two works of genius. They altered my nervous, impressionable, pubescent mind, but more so in tandem than not; the overall dramatic effect was so much more poignant when I saw them as a mirror reflection of each other across two different forms of media. I noticed a marriage of themes, a sort of agreement on the state of the human condition (if that makes any sense at all), and I find that this concurrent experiencing of both works enhanced both for me.

So, my question is: what are your favorite books, and if you’re a weirdo like me, what music do you think of when you think of these books?

OK, I just finished a little Murakami kick -- I read Norwegian Wood, Kafka on the Shore, and The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (in that order).

I enjoyed KotS the most and also thought it was the best of the three. It and WUBC both made ample use of ambiguity, suspense and unanswered questions, but I felt answers/meanings were at least suggested in KotS.  In WUBC, there were just too many things left completely outstanding: 

What happened to Creta and Malta and where did they go? Did Noburo kill Malta? 

Who was the 6-year-old who saw the men burying the heart outside his window? Who were those men? Was it Nutmeg's husband's heart? Why was Nutmeg's husband killed and who killed him? 

What was the connection between Nutmeg's father's mark on his cheek, Boris' Siberian bodyguard's mark and Toru's mark? If the mark signifies healing powers, why didn't we see any evidence that Nutmeg's father or the bodyguard possess them?

The faceless hotel employee is a friend for Toru, why? Who is he? 

If Kumiko aborted the kid because the Wataya family had some evil thing that kept passing down to generations (as Toru postulated), why didn't her father have it the way Noburu did?  Did Boris have this evil too, since he influenced people the way Noburo did and was seemingly unable to be shot at point blank range? 

Why didn't Cinnamon ever speak? What was the connection between Cinnamon being mute and the muteness of the 6-year-old who witnessed the two men burying the heart?

I could keep going, but you get the idea.  I feel like WUBC was a bit sloppy.  At the end I felt like Murakami had boxed himself in -- ""OK, I know I created a lot of mysterious characters and a lot of interesting plot lines, but I'm just gonna focus on wrapping up these couple main ones and leave the rest wherever they fall."" 

It's not unresolved plots that I have a problem with necessarily. (Infinite Jest is my favorite book, for Christ's sake.) An author can end a plot or a character arc in an uncertain place or without resolution, but still have had it communicate something meaningful or an intended point.  So many of WUBC's characters' stories just stopped without communicating anything.  To me, at least.

If there are other opinions on WUBC out there (dissenters especially welcome), please weigh in. Did they mean something to you?",,False,,t5_2qhps,False,,,True,t3_voozt,http://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/voozt/murakamis_windup_bird_chronicle_discussion/,

I've made it a habit over the past four years (since I was around 20) to read with a pen, so that I can mark or underline different passages. 

I'm just now realizing that I'd like to compile all of these in one centralized location.

So, any ideas? What do you guys/gals do? Do you even mark up your books?

So fellow r/literature redditors, what Faulkner novel should I read next?  I may be taking a Modern American Fiction class in the Fall (one of the books is Absalom, Absalom) i've been thinking As I Lay Dying for my next Faulkner book (my sister highly recommended me that and Absalom, Absalom) any suggestions/advice from you fine folks?
