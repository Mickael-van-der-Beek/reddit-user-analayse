I thought it was a very powerful scene in which Saul recited a prayer as he was surrounded by bodies, victims of a terrorist attack in the name of religion. To me it felt a bit ironic.

I know a lot of people can confuse Hebrew for Arabic, and their first reaction was to think Saul might be the mole.

Their story is a more innocent mirror of Brody and Walden. The parallels extend beyond what I can recall right now and what I have noticed but here I go. 

Dana grows fond of Finn as Brody loves his country. Dana and Finn get excited by the thrill of evading the SS and speeding as Brody goes to war. Finn commits the immoral act of hiting the woman without coming out and publicly taking responsibility as Walden commits the immoral act of killing dozens of people with the drone strike. 

Therefore:
(Dana)/(Brody) both (sympathize with)/(love) the (innocent pedestrian)/(Issa). 

Both Brodys feel both Waldens are to blame for murder. The obvious difference is the scale and importance, but the juxtapostion allows for other observations. These include how Finn, being otherwise innocent, is somewhat justified in his action or lack thereof, and how the Brodys both are very morally righteous, but both still must bend to the superior forces of (in Dana's case) the will of her father (CIA reasons) and the will of the Waldens (government reasons) and (in Brody's case) the CIA, Walden and Nasir (though the last 2 not so much). 

I feel that the writers' purpose was to compare these 2 events and foreshadow one with the other. Also, a little bit of relief from the colder world Brody is in coupled with the solid character developement goes a long way too.",,False,self,t5_2smlq,False,,,True,t3_1ahti5,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/1ahti5/why_dana_and_finns_sideplot_exists/,

1. Brody is still lying to Carrie about the Vice Presidents life, he only need to give Nazir the serial number to save Carrie, but he made sure the Vice President is dead. There is still hate towards the VP and CIA in Brody.

2. The show spend quite a few minutes for Brody's pray on the lake, the last time Brody pray was before he put on his bomb vest. He is still a very religious man. 

3. Brody officially ask Mike to take care of his family. Unlike the last time he tried bomb everybody, this time he makes sure his family is taken care of.

4. The conversation between Saul and Carrie, Saul clearly knows something Carrie don't. Why else he is so sure about Brody is a terrorist. Brody will always be a terrorist.

5. When Brody parked his car at the funeral, he has the keys in his hand, and the next scene is the handshake with an unknown person, next the key is gone. Maybe he put the keys in his pocket while he is walking? but this scene definitely means something. We will see in season 3.

6. Brody explained Nazir's master plan to Carrie after the explosion, the things he left out was who carried out this plan for Nazir. Who else on this show would do this for Nazir? Brody is still the key player for Nazir's plan.

7. This final episode's sequence somehow reminds me of the first season. The Cabin on the lake, Brody praying, Brody go back home to change, talk to Dana, then Bomb! The difference is that this time the Bomb did go off.

Really excited about the next season. If I'm right about Brody, I would love to see how Carrie can be more crazier... ",,False,self,t5_2smlq,False,,,True,t3_151hoy,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/151hoy/why_i_think_brody_is_behind_the_attack/,

I. Expectations

Anyone who's watched a fair amount of television will attest to the fact that most of what's on air is fairly formulaic. Some shows are blatantly so - crime and law procedurals have such a well defined set of rules that most viewers have a pretty good idea of what's going to happen within the first few minutes of an episode. Sitcoms have their own trove of set pieces that writers seem to draw from all the time. Even serialized shows come with a set of expectations and for the most part stay within them. 

This is not necessarily a bad thing. The Wire is easily one of the best shows ever made, but once you watched a season of the Wire, you had a pretty good idea of how things would go down by the end of every following one. You may not have known the specifics of how every character would turn out but there was a basic framework of Baltimore that Simon and Co. could be expected to stick to. It didn't matter how much effort Daniels and his team put in, the city would be city. It didn't matter because the character stories were so rich and the ending so truly reflective of world we live in that just following the narrative path to a foregone conclusion was enough to create great television. 

I bring up the patterns of television because Homeland does not operate in a vacuum. When we watch Homeland we're looking for similarities to things we've seen before and we do see some similarities we make assumptions about what those similarities means based on previous experiences. What has set apart Homeland and makes it such a great example of television is how its able to organically break past those assumptions and surprise us at every turn even though we're expecting it to do exactly that. I'm sure many, including myself, when reaching the halfway point of S02E04 expected the show to settle into a Wire like groove of following, tracking and unraveling leads. Instead in the final minutes of the episode we witnessed a development that in the hands of lesser writers would have been saved for a season finale. 

While this ability to buck expectations is one of the show's key strengths, it's important to note that this episode didn't feature much of that. Brody being turned into a CIA asset has been predicted as early as the pilot so to most fans this development did not come as a surprise. As I mention before however, truly great shows will make even the most expected situations  compelling. The twenty minutes or so we get of Brody and Carrie just sitting and talking and looking into each other's eye while Brody sinks lower and lower and then starts crying are just that. I've always wondered if Homeland would be as intense if we already knew what was going to happen, and I'm happy to have had my concerns blown away because those moments were the most riveting Homeland has ever been.

II. Carrie and Brody

Part of the reason Brody's shift to becoming a CIA asset was inevitable of course was because it was what needed to happen for the story to go on. This development however is almost impossible to do in a convincing manner because as Carrie rightly says, Brody was completely destroyed and rebuilt during his time in captivity. For Brody to truly be turned, it would have be done by someone who understood him more than he did himself. It would have to be someone who cared and loved him despite knowing who he was. Carrie was that person and because she saw him as someone far more complex than just a terrorist, she was able to lay out infront of him what he couldn't see so that he could make a more informed decision. 

Which brings me to the point that the heart of this show isn't the drama or tension. It's the undeniable connection that these two broken people share and can't help but acknowledge to each other. Even without Carrie and Brody interacting the past few episodes have been pretty good, but it's telling that the first great episode of this season comes when these two people just get to sit and talk. 

The situation that they find themselves in now gives them ample opportunity to do just that over the rest of the season and I look forward to seeing what comes of it.

III. Delivery

The thing is, the writers can try as hard as they want to make beautiful scenes like the interrogation ones tonight happen, but number of actors who can deliver that calibre of performance are few and far between. Homeland has somehow managed to snag Damien Lewis and Claire Danes who are not only incredibly talented individually but are completely able to sell the bond Carrie and Brody have. 

Danes is having what is probably the best season long performance ever by a female actress and has been nothing short of incredible every episode to date but tonight she was totally upstaged by Lewis' face as she interrogated him. If there isn't another Emmy double in store for them I'll be very surprised.

Also notable is Morgan Saylor's turn as Dana. She manages to be the moody teenager while in no way being annoying as most of these kinds of characters tends to be but it's really her moments with Brody that stand out with even the unspoken glances speaking volumes.

IV. War on Terror

It's easy to get so swept in the character moments that you forget to notice the other points the show is trying to make but I again have to commend Homeland for its unflinching willingness to continue to ask questions about the morality of the actions taken by both sides in the War on Terror. 

I think Carrie raises a pretty interesting point when she compares Abu Nazir and VP Walden. One is of course wildly different from the other. The former intentionally targets innocent civilians while the other just happens to kill them in the process of doing other things. But what Carrie projects to Brody is that their willingness to sacrifice innocent lives to achieve their goals is equally despicable. I wonder if others got the same read of the line as I did but I thought it was worth pointing out nonetheless. 

TL;DR I know this is really long but I encourage you to read it if you're looking for a more in depth discussion of Homeland. Disagreements with my take are welcome and would be appreciated in the comments.",,False,self,t5_2smlq,False,,,True,t3_129lyx,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/129lyx/thoughts_on_s02e05_qa/,

It is pretty safe to assume that Nasr and this official knew the damaging content of the drive- Brody's confession tape- which is why it was the only piece of intel being sought out that Saul was carrying.  

It follows that Nasr thus knows that the CIA knows about Brody (I feel like Rumsfeld). If the writers followed this reasoning to its logical conclusion, then Nasr et al have been operating with the specific knowledge that Brody is now, at the very least, under constant surveillance by the CIA, and has possibly been turned.  If this is true, then they are supplying counterintelligence to the CIA through the journalist lady, etc.  

That, or the writers are ignoring what happened for reasons of continuity or convenience.  Right?

**1.) What is with the mole talk?  How do we know there is a mole?**

The mole is an ongoing mystery that has not been solved. They even highlight it in [this season 2 trailer.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoEz38T1uo)

We know there is a mole that is responsible for the following things:

* Someone tipped off the couple (Aileen and Middle Eastern professor) living in the house with the roof by the airport that Tom Walker had visited. They were actually likely tipped off twice. The first time if you remember the professor was being followed home by Carrie and Galvez, and Aileen receives a call letting her know something was up, at which point she hangs a flag out of the window and the professor knows to keep driving to not let them know where he lives. And the second (implied warning) is how they knew to leave the house when the CIA were coming to take them in for questioning. Then of course the professor is shot dead in the motel room and Aileen is apprehended getting off of the bus in Mexico, but it is likely that they were tipped off to leave the house by the mole who knew the CIA were coming.

* Someone warned Tom Walker that the CIA had ""turned"" the Saudi Ambassador. That is how Walker knew to give the briefcase bomb to a homeless man to hand to the ambassador instead of showing up himself. That's what Saul is talking about with Carrie in the hospital bed after she got blown up in the above video.

* We also know so far from season 2 events that the mole is still active because someone had to give the female reporter the codes to David Estes' safe which she in turn passed on to Brody to get some kind of possible attack locations.

* This one is less important, and actually might not be the mole's doing at all, but someone may have passed a razor blade to the prisoner they had in interrogation who killed himself. There is of course also the possibility that Brody did it off camera since we know he cheated the polygraph, or that the guy had it in the sole of his shoe like they suggested, but it may have been the mole. This particular mystery will most likely never be solved at this point, but it is another event which points to possibility of their being a mole that the CIA knows about. That's why in the above video after the ""who is the mole"" text flashes on screen they show the dead prisoner's body.

The writer's themselves have commented on the mole and hinted that he/she might never be revealed because often times in real life situations the security leak is never discovered. That isn't to say it won't happen, just that it's a possibility we may never find out. 

**2.) Why isn't the CIA taking more action to discover the mole or why isn't it discussed more often?**

The mole was mentioned by Saul and Carrie a few times in season 1, and has played a role so far in season 2, but hasn't been overtly stated. It's implied that they are mindful of the mole through certain actions like Saul personally carrying the SD card with Brody's confession on the plane and delivering it to Estes, and them maintaining a small operation off-campus to deal with Brody among other things.  Mostly the mole just serves the purpose of making the plot feasible.  It is possible that it will play a larger role in a future episode, or might otherwise not be revisited.

**3.)  Is Saul the mole?  Saul is definitely the mole right?**

No, Saul is not the mole.  Well... anything is possible, but the vast majority of the events to date largely conflict with the possibility that Saul is working against the CIA.  There have been numerous instances where Saul has had the opportunity to suppress information, or act in a manner which would be beneficial to Abu Nazir's operation.  In every circumstance he has acted according to what you would expect from a dedicated CIA employee.  

One of the most significant examples of this was outlined by u/robdag2 [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/12nol2/alright_who_is_the_mole_spoilers/c6wpwsu)

&gt;It can't be Saul.  He was the one who discovered the Brody tape. If he was the mole, he would've just destroyed it.

The only event which points to the possibility of Saul being a mole, or working against what you would expect from a CIA employee occurs when he initially fails his polygraph is season 1.  This can be attributed to his personal difficulties at home, and he passed the second time around.  The writers themselves have addressed the audience's perceptions that Saul might be the mole to which they stated that was never the intention.  That interview excerpt can be seen in a post from u/lalib [HERE.](http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/12nol2/alright_who_is_the_mole_spoilers/c6wx6gc)


**4.)  Damian Lewis has been signed on to play Brody for 5 more years.  Does that mean he is guaranteed to be alive and/or an active character for 5 more seasons?**

[Source](http://seriable.com/homeland-damian-lewis-5-seasons/)

No, this is just a common industry practice to sign important actors to extended contracts as insurance for the production.  This way, there is a guarantee you have the actors needed to continue with the show who might otherwise be busy during production season with other projects.  The show might not last 5 more seasons, or it might last 10 more.  Brody may survive this whole time, be killed next week and never seen again, or a combination where he only appears in flashbacks.  Anything is possible; nothing is certain.

**5.)  Why does Jessica call her husband by his last name (Brody)**

There are numerous possible reasons/explanations for this.  The general consensus is that while it is not terribly common, it is not terribly uncommon either.  Briefly, some of the likely explanations include:

* It's not specifically a military matter, although that could have contributed.
* Lots of men (and occasionally women) are referred to by their last names by close friends and colleagues in America; in case you are asking from a cultural perspective. 
* If she met him while he was in the military, sure she may have picked it up from hearing him being referred by Brody most often.
* Often times, when a couple is friends for a while before they become romantically involved, the woman will call him by whatever name everyone else does, and then when they begin dating the name just sticks.
* They may have met in high school, which is a time in life when a man is generally more commonly referred to by his last name more so than at any other age.",,False,self,t5_2smlq,1353391609.0,,,True,t3_13hovn,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/13hovn/rhomeland_show_basics_and_faq/,

We need new characters anyway since about 10 of them just blew up. I also think Brody murdering hundreds of people is way too big of a ""gotcha"" moment for an Emmy-winning TV show. He wouldn't just be betraying the other characters, he'd be betraying the audience. Even those who think he's still turned probably shouldn't buy such a drastic shift. All of his growth as a character would just be undone for what would be a considerably uninteresting twist. I think season 3 will bring us a new antagonist, fleshing out the mole story arch in the process, and introduce the president. 

Also, while Quinn will suspect Brody when he first returns, I predict he will back on Carrie's side by the end of the season, and will likely kill the mole himself, as we now know he really only gives a shit about killing bad guys, even if they're federal officials.",,False,self,t5_2smlq,False,,,True,t3_15gf8i,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/15gf8i/why_not_just_accept_the_mundane_possibility_that/,

* First off, she is technically a civilian as she no longer works for the CIA. Why would the SWAT team accept her commands without question and without formal authorization? Especially after she made such a hysteria the previous night.
* About that previous night, even if you're ""on your way to the hospital because your stitches tore"" you see sirens behind you. You aren't going to stop?
* Additionally, if they're supposed to work in pairs she isn't going to go off alone unarmed with one of the team members.
* Furthermore, that team is not going to go on ahead and leave them alone/out of eyesight/shouting distance.
* Once a 'secret passage' is discovered, you radio for your full swat team to come and assist you to clear it out. You don't walk in alone with an unarmed civilian woman standing next to you.
* When they do track down Nazir and finally shoot him, they continue to stand there without saying anything for a minute while they wait for the civilian woman to go and touch the body. No.
* They would've immediately been radioing to bring in additional teams, forensics, sweeps. They also wouldn't have wanted anyone, including Carrie, to touch the body because you don't know if it is booby trapped or strapped with a bomb as you saw him reach into his shirt.
* Afterwards, they continue to leave her alone with the body and are transporting it by van very casually. This is the World's #1 Most Wanted Terrorist. You aren't going to risk having a couple guys bring him in the back of a van somewhere.

Please hear me out.

1. He's the only one that we have any indication (The lie detector) passed the terrorist the means to kill himself, something he again does in Season 2 for Aileen.

2. The prayer he says at the end of Season 2, The Mourner's Kaddish. Uses the phrase ""He"" instead of God throughout, could this be Saul's way of praising Nazir's plan? [Link to Kaddish translation](http://www.jewfaq.org/prayer/kaddish.htm)

3. What if Nazir was #1, Saul is #2, Brody is #3, Galvez and Walker were #'s 4 and 5. I say Galvez because in the ambush at the tailor's shop he makes a phone call just before the ""swat"" team shows up and is not killed in the ambush.

4. Saul's smile at the very end of the Finale when he sees Carrie alive said to me that he then also knew Brody was still alive.

5. He attends the funeral of Nazir instead of the Vice President's, why? Couldn't anyone have done that?

6. He almost loses his job over confronting Estes on his plan to kill Brody, and looks very nervous/aggravated the entire time he's in captivity, something we hardly ever see from him.

7. All the things the mole is known to do, Saul had access to. Warning Aileen and Raquim of the drive by, the turned Saudi Ambassador, Roya knowing the code to Estes' safe.

I think the plan all along was to kill the VP, then severely hurt the CIA. Both of which have been completed and Brody has now been framed for them. Saul will most likely take over as head of the CIA and everyone on his team is now gone or being hunted.

1355862747.0,37,self.homeland,152ho2,Quinn and Saul cannot be moles.,littlepwny,48,11,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/152ho2/quinn_and_saul_cannot_be_moles/,"After the last episode I have seen many people say that Saul or Quinn are the CIA moles due to the fact that Quinn spared Brody, Saul is now in command, and bonus points for the fact that Galvez died in the explosion.

First of all, let's look at the reasons why Quinn cannot be the mole:

1. He joined the party way too late. The mole knew that Estes's safe contained an encryption key to a database of potential list of targets and also knew the code to the safe. In addition, throughout season one it is alluded that there is a mole. These all happened way before Quinn joined the task force or was in any way involved with the ""Brody""intelligence operation.

2. Gettysburg Address episode.During this episode, not only did he call for backup when Carrie said that the terrorists knew that they were checking the tailors shop, he was also shown to be actively searching for the explosives (He found them right before the raid started). Furthermore, he was shot and had to play dead in order to survive and only thanks to him pressuring Brody did Brody actually tell them that the tailor is actually dead.

3. Quinn's association with a notorious black ops commander gives him a lot of credibility.

4. Quinn was never guaranteed to be in the task force. Estes asked Dar Adhul for an assassin and Quinn was eventually sent. Quinn joining the group , assuming that he is a terrorist, would be completely luck based event or Dar Adhul, who seems like an old school person who cares about his country, would also have to be deeply involved.

5. Throughout his involvement with the team he has been shown to have flawless decision making, not once were his actions suspicious and not once did he actually stop Carrie from doing her crazy things. During the final episode, his arguments in favor of sparing Brody were actually quite correct. He stated that Brody had given them flawless intel and that since the VP has been killed, Brody's political career is officially over and hence he has become a non-threat to the nation and simply remains a threat to Estes because of the knowledge of the drone strike. The video, by the way, could have been released to the public regardless of whether Brody is alive or not. In fact Brody being dead would be more in line with the suicide style of attacks these terrorist organisations are accustomed to.

6. Both of the Brody kill sequences point Quinn towards the CIA side. In the limo scene he was shown to be ready to kill Brody and the stalking sequence/finger on the trigger would never have happened if he simply never intended for the trigger to be pulled.

7. Regardless of if Brody was killed or not, the bombing could have been blamed on Brody. The public does not care if Quinn had thrown Brody in a ditch, if Brody was in the building or if it was Brody's car. Bomb and confession video is all the public needs. The terrorists simply used Brody's car to frame him, Brody was never needed.With all this in mind I believe that Quinn has probably been cleared of all mole accusations, him being the mole would leave huge plotholes.

Let's look at Saul case.

1. He could have stopped Carrie's investigation on Brody.

2. He could have not released the video to Carrie. In fact he could have hidden the video from everyone.

3. He could have stopped the Abu Nazir assassination mission from happening or even sent a ""May 1st"" message to protect his cover.

4. Aileen knew nothing about the terrorist cell, so Saul giving her the tool to kill herself was simply a mistake from his part.

5. He failed the lie detector because he was in distress because of his home situation.

6. He did not want Brody to die because he considers himself a good person and mainly because it would destroy Carrie.

With all the above I believe it is clear that Saul cannot possibly be the mole. Also, Saul being a power-hungry CIA officer is completely out of character and however much he possibly hates Estes he is not the type that would kill hundreds of CIA agents just to rise in power. And as Dar Adhul said ""Still afraid of getting your hands dirty Saul"".

TL;DR: Neither Quinn nor Saul are moles.

1355137145.0,38,self.homeland,14ll6l,[spoilers] Why is Estes doing this? Finale and Season 3 speculations. ,BallisticGE0RGE,42,4,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/14ll6l/spoilers_why_is_estes_doing_this_finale_and/,"People are talking about things like ""how on earth will there be a season 3?"" and asking all sorts of questions about why Estes would want to have Brody killed.

I want to point out a scene between Saul and Estes from earlier this season. Saul reveals the tape of Brody confessing to being a terrorist, and Estes realizes right then and there, that he is up shit's creek. Arresting, and thereby revealing Brody as a terrorist ruins Este's career. After all, he's the CIA Director who let a terrorist become a congressman. He so much as says ""FML"" right then and there.

But then Saul offers an alternative, to let Brody keep his cover, and bring Carry and Saul in to monitor Brody, to get more intel on the Nazir and stop any future attacks.

The only problem with Saul's plan, is once Nazir is captured or killed, Brody is left as a loose end. He still needs to be arrested, still revealed as a terrorist, and it will still ruin the career of not only David Estes, but any other organization or operative who may have failed in revealing Brody as a terrorist, before becoming an elected official. The fallout from such a scandal would results in uncountable charges, loss of morale, reactionary budget cuts, and potential make America less safe.

Though, what if Brody is killed, possibly by terrorist no less? Well then, he's a martyr for the United States, a marine becoming a POW, coming home to become a congressman, struck down by terrorist? He'll be mourned, Estes will be given more funding, more support, strengthening the resolve of the agency and the United States.

So Estes is cleaning up lose ends, for what he feels is the greater good. This opens up a million possibilities for Homeland season 3. Forget about threats abroad, now we are dealing with domestic threats. People in the agency willing to kill to get their way. Using any means of cover up, deception and red tape to do it.

And where does that leave our characters? Well Brody, if still alive, cannot do much to help. He's a congressman, and former terrorist. Carry is a nut job, and Saul, well this past episode we see all the dirt they have on Saul. 

Very dramatic indeed, and it begs to question, what do we do for our homeland? When people from abroad attack, we retaliate, but what do we do when the threat, like Brody from season 1, is right here on our soil, when the threat is one of us. Or even scarier, when the threat is part of the agency we rely on for protection?

Just some thoughts.

**EDIT** - I also want to point out, this show being written by some of the same people from 24...government conspiracies and internal threats are nothing new to these guys.

(SPOILERS),jmose86,38,7,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/12a0j5/thoughts_on_mike_and_lauder_going_forward_spoilers/,"First I wanted to say I enjoyed how the scene played out from episode 4 (last week) with Mike and Lauder.  It would have been a ridiculous stretch for them to piece together the limited knowledge they have to figure out Brody was a terrorist.  So I really enjoyed how the writers used Lauder's and subsequently Mike's suspicions to have them piece together a conspiracy but of course the wrong one altogether.  Instead of letting Lauder's suspicions continue to go completely ignored by everyone, they get Mike to jump on the conspiracy train, and arguably like most conspiracy theories are in real life, the facts get all twisted to somehow fit whatever suspicion they have.

Anyway, as for the relevance to last night's episode and moving forward... Now that Brody actually *is* working for the CIA it stands as if their theory has been correct all along, and their inaccurate conclusion ties very neatly into Brody switching sides.  I have a feeling that it will play a significant role as Mike is observant of Brody's actions and takes notice how they fit perfectly with his theory.  Also, now that Jessica knows, I could possibly see Mike presenting his suspicion to her with a line of questioning or in a subtle manner that unintentionally results in her assuming he already knows about Brody's position and confirms it to him.  As for how it will affect Brody's cover and/or the overall plot remains to be seen.

Just some initial thoughts, and curious to see what anyone else thinks about what role this will play going forward..",,False,self,t5_2smlq,False,,,True,t3_12a0j5,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/12a0j5/thoughts_on_mike_and_lauder_going_forward_spoilers/,

* Abu Nazir will still remain alive and well meaning that Brody will be alive at the end of the season. I think this also will mean that Brody won't know about Quinn being hired to kill Brody after the mission has been completed.

* Roya will kill herself during her investigation. She won't reveal anything of use.

* While Brody won't know about Quinn, Saul will figure it out. Instead of getting just eyes on Quinn, he'll find a way to get ears on him and during one of his meetings he'll overhear about him killing Brody when they're done with him. Saul won't tell Carrie, but will try and convince Estes not to.

* We know that Abu Nazir knows about Brody's betrayal from next episode's previews (his threat to Brody). In retaliation, Nazir will have Brody's son either killed or kidnapped. Brody mentioned to Nazir how much his family means to him (more than he realized) and I think that's foreshadowing into this prediction. Nazir might also pass the message on to Brody that he didn't avenge his son's death so he's going to take his son.

* Not an exciting prediction, but Brody and Dana's relationship will continue to be strained and they will continue to grow apart.

* Brody will discover Jess &amp; Mike's affair and opt to be closer to Claire because of it.",,False,self,t5_2smlq,False,,,True,t3_13w198,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/13w198/remainder_of_season_2_predictions/,

1. No way in the real world a car gets that close to a federal building.  Just no way.  I can't get that close to the freaking county courthouse.  Is this a suspension of disbelief thing, or was someone in security working with the bombers?  

2. Carrie would have been gone for at least a whole day, probably more like 36 hours.  It isn't like Canada is just a hop, skip and jump from DC.  

3. Does Saul understand what it means that Carrie is alive?  I couldn't tell if he seemed happy, or sad.  I wonder if he has already put it together that Brody's body isn't there, and Carrie was MIA for a big chunk of time.  

4. Nick tells Mike he won't be around for awhile.  Abu Nazir told Nick earlier that if everything goes according to plan, they won't see each other again.  So many questions!

Since it seems that the chain of command is something along the lines of Quinn -&gt; Dar Adal ~= Estes -&gt; ??  Estes can't really be outranked except perhaps by the DNI (Director of Nat'l Intel which Homeland has never mentioned) and then consequently by the President.  It is hard to believe that killing Brody off would benefit Estes' immediate line of work, so there must be bigger issues/conspiracies at play.  Especially since Estes has kept key members of his own task force in the dark (Saul, Carrie).  

My best theory is that some authority wants to use Brody (and his death) as a catalyst to possibly segue into a war in galvanizing public anti-terrorism sentiments.  We know that Brody is highly regarded in the public's eye, so much so that even the cashier in Baltimore seemed to recognize him without associating a name with his fame.  To kill off a ""war hero"" could certainly serve as probable cause to trigger retaliation if the intent was to pin his death on a terrorist or even Nazir.  

The current President will not be up for re-election, so I fail to see how he might have greater interests at play.  I can only think that VP Walden is a key player in this conspiracy, especially since he is a former director of the CIA and seems to have a questionable ethos.  Perhaps Quinn has funneled information about Brody's suicide bombing attempt through Dar Adal's channels and Brody's past disgressions are not as hidden as we thought...  

**EDIT:** Just felt like clarifying my main post was not to show my surprise at them wanting to kill Brody, but more so doing it in that limo at that time.

He was in charge of the operation in season 2. He's led  interrogations. (or been trusted to lead them, even if Carrie goes ahead and fucks things up).

Yet a lot of the time when I see people talking about his scene with Estes in episode 12, it's said that he's just the guy who kills bad guys. But this doesn't strike me as true.

Quinn is obviously from the special activities side of things (given that we're told this explicitly), but that doesn't mean that he just kills people. It seems far more likely to me, given the supplementary information we're given about his skills and what he does on the show, that he's done a lot of work in humint. He finds and works sources. And he plans operations. And he also kills people. He's not just Jason Bourne, he's the whole of Treadstone, if that makes any sense. He's the guy who kills bad guys, but most of the time he doesn't do it himself, he plans how it happens.

In season 3 we'll find out that Quinn had rank. He wasn't just a grunt; he ordered grunts around.

Basically, they're upset with Brody not blowing up, they think that the entire assassination plot was a huge contrivance, they think that the bomb blowing up and the daughter calling was a deus ex machina, etc.

To quote Carrie here, I'm not crazy, right? The finale, and the season as a whole were *incredible*. The plot made sense to me, mostly, and didn't seem half as complicated as half the stuff that comes out of hollywood these days. The bomb-maker didn't screw up the vest, because we SAW the light on the vest go green. Then Brody got knocked down in the rush to get inside the building and the wires got disconnected or something. I felt like nothing was too contrived and the drama we did end up getting felt well-deserved. Maybe I'm just getting too worked up about people disagreeing with me on the internet. I know the general opinion of the community here.

To make up for my rant, here's a right-wing entertainment blogger reviewing the Homeland finale:

Just to take a random guess at my own question; I think it's possible he will serve one last purpose before finally dying in the hospital, but what that could be is a mystery.  Maybe he noticed something about one of the shooters during the Gettysburg shootout that will help identify another member of Nazir's organization.  Maybe the team will uncover new information about Nazir's organization that ties in with an operation Galvez worked on in the past and has first hand knowledge of that could help them now.

1359804361.0,20,self.homeland,17r03o,"Season 2 Finale ""The Choice"" Spoilers/ discussion",hozjo,29,9,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/17r03o/season_2_finale_the_choice_spoilers_discussion/,"So i got into this series late, well i watched the pilot 4-5 months ago and it didnt really stick, anyway i started up again on monday and have already powered through two seasons. I found this to be some of the best and most compelling television (shit its better than most movies) and it kept me engaged in a way a show has never done before.

That said looking at a calender and knowing I have to wait nearly 9 months is killing me. So much is left unknown/unsaid at the extremely shocking end to season two.

My main question is whether or not Brody planned/helped/knew about the bomb in his car or not. There are arguments to be made for both sides but I can't help but feel he was a part of it.

I personally feel he was involved in the final bombing plot. There is just too much going on for any rational skeptic to accept but he has exploited Carrie's irrationality. 

in semi-chronological order:

a.) he didnt make any contact whatsoever about her abduction, some would argue the CIA would only interfere but after being so close he knew the level which carrie trusted saul and that was one person he could have reached out to

b.) he not only helped kill the VP by giving the correct serial number, something he chose to do because he valued the memory of a dead boy more than a life, but he refused to help the VP and even took pleasure in his death, this implies that he isn't cured, that he still believes in vengeance over justice

c.) he still cared about his family, choosing carrie over them is another step that insulates them from his decision, once he has abandoned them the betrayal is not the same and will make them forget him faster

d.)he has shown the ability to fake love before, was he any more convincing or real than the first time he went to the cabin

e.)he knew he was still a target, this could have even played into his motivations, seeing the interrogator who was ready to, and tried to torture you appear unexpectedly would definitely throw you off

f.) carrie shows poor judgement after traumatic events,

g.)Carrie was always right, and I don't mean the current carrie who has been questioned and doubted so many times that she isn't sure of herself. I mean the one who made the call in the first place to put him under surveillance, the gut instinct that he was full of it all along. He can not simply change so easily.

h.) He has been hiding things, things that were incredibly relevant and helpful and not just at specific times, but at all stages, and not just to the CIA but to everyone and not all of them incriminating.

i.) he is a pathological liar, this is related to the former but it is just way too easy for him, he always takes a grain of truth (ie flat tire) and spins it into a web of lies, I know from firsthand experience how even the nicest person you have ever known would lie to you about both the most mundane details and spectacular plans and you are conditioned to want to believe them on both counts

j.) his time up at the cabin took attention off wherever he left his vehicle, they took carrie's car so nobody would be monitoring his car or the location he left it

k.) his identification of his car and the wording of it, i'm sorry, but what, the parking lot at langley has probably 8k employees on site, most of whom drive, he isn't a regular at langley and doesnt know what others might drive, how is just seeing a car from 10+ stories up the same make/color of yours a positive identification it was yours, it wasn't hey that car looks like mine, or does that car look like mine, it was someone moved my car closer, that whole ""someone"" is very suspicious too, it implies a mole which has been disproved on multiple occasions (although them knowing the safe code was odd), I can only think being in his shoes with those experiences I would say something more along the lines of ""why did you/they (both implying the CIA that has been controlling my life) move my car closer""

l.) the detentation method, it was too complex of a plan to just leave up to a timer so it must have been triggered which means whoever did it was nearby, what took so long for it to detonate, its too convenient for it to have happened after they were out of the blast radius

l.) brody loves fucking with carrie's head, his objective complete, what better way than to take her out of play again than set her up for another breakdown 

m.) for a guy who was supposedly turned, and gave up everything for a chance to be with carrie, his nonchalant attitude to whether it actually worked out was a little disconcerting, it always felt that she cared more about him

n.) it's just a better fucking story, we have seen the clear the name shit played out in dozens of other shows, what about the ""i've been duped, i fucked up and oh yeah, im bipolar"" we have the effects of that on carrie's psyche, her discovering and trying to hide that she unknowingly aided a terrorist, you have the ultimate confrontation with saul and how much he learns and how far he is willing to go to protect her, its just so much more interesting than just 10 more episodes of her being doubted and 2 episodes of vindication",,False,self,t5_2smlq,False,,,True,t3_17r03o,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/17r03o/season_2_finale_the_choice_spoilers_discussion/,

Here are my thoughts on the character, in his defense.

 Brody is a completely broken man. I don't believe he is a ""bad"" guy. He is not a cold, calculating person. The only exception was calling Estes on Carrie...that was pretty cold, but in his mind he had a reason and he was expecting to die soon and not deal with the guilt. Everything else he has done is completely out of desperation and a result of being completely screwed in the head by Abu Nazir. He has Stockholm syndrome, and Carrie broke it down for him very logically and correctly. Does that mean I think he's completely trustworthy from here on out? No. Is he still potentially dangerous? Yes. Someone that scrambled emotionally and psychologically is unpredictable at best. I expect him to waffle back and forth for awhile. However, I don't believe he truly wants to be a ""terrorist"", and he certainly doesn't want to hurt innocent people. When he did try to leave Nazir, he was clubbed over the head and tied to a chair in a hotel room. He really had little choice but to do what Nazir wanted. Even if the Stockholm syndrome wasn't messing with his head, if he didn't do as he was told, he and his family would be killed. 

Now Carrie and the CIA have given him an option he didn't have before. There is a small sliver of light, however dangerous if Nazir finds out. I expect he will cling to Carrie as a lifeline. Maybe not consistently (again, screwed up people are rarely consistent), but she most definitely broke through to him in that interrogation.  She weaved truth in there and used her feelings for him to reach him, and I believed it worked. That startled look on his face when she said ""I want you to leave your wife and kids and be with me"" was totally genuine. He may not know how he feels about Carrie yet, but I guarantee you that he felt calm, safe and a comforting solace up in that cabin that he hasn't felt in more than 8 years (certainly not with Jessica), and he will be craving that comfort again. Their love scenes were almost womb like, just like the fetal position assumes when Saul and Carrie try to help him up.

Am I the only Brody apologist out there?

(sorry forgot to add that to the title)


So this is my theory about Brody still being bad, hear me out. First of all, there is the scene many people seem to be pointing out about him handing off the keys to his car to some unknown person. 
There is the fact that him and Carrie suddenly get up and leave the ceremony, which I find a little suspicious. Yes, I know it is Carrie that first makes the ""lets get out of here"" gesture to Brody, but Brody looks uncomfortable due to the praising Walden and we don't know that he wouldn't have left regardless, or that he wouldn't have gestured to Carrie. After all, we can tell after the first season and not blowing himself up that he does still value his life.  Later, he conveniently notices his car being moved right before the explosion...this part may be a stretch, as he has reason to be concerned about this.
 I think the main questions regarding this theory are why would he have pointed out the car, and why would he have the confession tape released? To which I would say it is a ploy to get Carrie to believe him. As far as the rest of his family is concerned he might as well be done with them and they are all pretty sick of him, so why does it matter to him if they see his tape? There was the interrogation scene with Brody earlier in the season where they threaten to show it to his family and he says ""go ahead"". I think this signifies he doesn't really care that much if they see it. (it could be argued that this is just so that they can't use that as leverage against him...but since that point in the season he has only grown farther apart from his family.) What does matter to him is Carrie believing him because she is all he has left (as part of his own doing).

Thoughts? I saw somewhere in this subreddit where someone claimed that the writers of the show denied that Brody is still bad, but for now I'm just going to ignore that because I doubt the writers would even be giving away spoilers like that, or limiting themselves.",,False,self,t5_2smlq,False,,,True,t3_1fvus1,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/1fvus1/another_ridiculous_brody_theory/,

However, Nick was clearly 'promoted' to Gunnery Sergeant, what we usually call gunny if you're not a boot -new guy. Here we can see he is wearing the rank of a Gunnery Sergeant:[rank.](http://i.imgur.com/0nyCPh.jpg) And here he is wearing the rank of [Sergeant.](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02032/homeland_2032267c.jpg) The two 'rockers' below three stripes up indicate Gunnery Sergeant, which is one of the best ranks in the Marine Corps for an infantryman, or any Marine for that matter. I know Nick's a 'sniper' in the show, but he had to start out as a regular grunt, or at least go through Infantry Training Battalion -ITB. It's tough to explain why gunny is considered one of the best ranks. As a gunny you're usually the 'Company Gunny' of an infantry company. That means you're in charge of beans, bullets, and band aids. So you're basically the 'go to guy' for the Company Commander -God/CEO/- who will also go to you for strategic advice, since you've been around the block a couple times. It's not far fetched to assume that Nick was meritoriously promoted to Gunny from Sergeant. But he would not refer to himself as 'Sergeant,' i.e., when he was giving his good bye speech to the camera in the storage room, he said his rank was Sergeant. Rank is everything in the Corps, and when telling people your rank, you would give your SPECIFIC rank, not just say Sergeant. I'm just truly surprised that they got most of the little stuff correct, but the BIGGEST thing they could fuck up on, they did. Comic kind of [related](http://terminallance.com/2010/03/02/terminal-lance-17-the-stare/)    

TLDR; towards the end Nick wears Gunny chevrons, but still refers to himself as Sergeant. In the Marine Corps, Gunnery Sergeant != Sergeant.

That got me a little emotional, as did Brody's breakdown in the last 10 minutes:

&gt;""Because he offered me comfort. And I took it... I’m not made of that stuff. I’m no hero. I had nothing to give. I was broken, living in the dark for years. And a man walked in and he was kind to me. And I loved him.""

I haven't posted to this sub too much, but I have a strong suspicion of where this show is going. We know that Brody is basically here to stay as the face of the show based upon his contract. This, plus the fact that the CIA is waiting around to kill him makes me a bit suspicious of how they can keep the show going. I always like to think a few months down the road in a logical manner from where the show leaves off each episode. Of course, that usually isn't the best course of action with Homeland; however, I do have a feeling that Brody will inevitably become a ""homegrown terrorist"" ... if we can even call him that. 

First, we saw that his internal struggle primarily centered around his family, which is why he never killed Walden straight up with the bomb vest. This doesn't seem to be a paramount concern to him anymore considering his recent interactions with his family now that he has essentially removed himself from the picture.

Second, his reaction after Nazir died seemed to be more along the lines of sadness rather than relief. 

Third, he actually had empathy for Nazir's position.

Fourth, this empathy is predicated upon his belief in justice that we can see pretty clearly while Brody relishes Walden's impending death rather than pure vindication for the loss of Nazir's son. I think this point will be explored more.

So what does everyone think? Am I nuts, or does Brody become Nazir 2.0?",,False,self,t5_2smlq,False,,,True,t3_14u3ve,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/14u3ve/brody_becoming_nazir/,

I just did something similar on GAF, and I think it's time to do one here as well: a sweepstake on who the mole is.

I'm going to run through the options, list some evidence for / against each character, and then choose one (I already have chosen one actually, but anyway...) If we could get people choosing who they suspect as well, it'll be interesting to see who ends up being right. 

---

---

*Name who you suspect the most, with your reasons!*


---


---

**Carrie**

I'm only putting this on here because I saw a 'theory' on the AV Club that she has split personality and, without realising it, has been telling Nazir about the CIA's plans all this time. Frankly, there is 0% chance of this happening, primarily because she's the main character, but also because it's a stupid suggestion.

---
**Saul**

We've seen him fret about that rug, show undue respect for the suicidal terrorist (whose interrogation he was present for, and whose dead body he found), and conspicuously hand over all Walker-related operations to Carrie, all of which have gone wrong. He would also be aware that Galvez and Carrie were tailing Faizel and would know about the sting on Walker with the diplomat. In other words, he's in a position to have done everything the mole did...

...however, he has shown absolutely no signs of not being allied closely to the US. He has been working at the CIA his whole life, and his wife noted that he goes wherever they ask. He is dedicated to their cause, loves his work, and has no sympathy for those seeking to attack the US. It would be a frankly disgraceful betrayal of his character to reveal him as a mole for the sake of it.

In terms of the structure of the show going forward, he's a key component of it as the non-boss CIA confidant of Carrie. He's experienced, there's the loose end of his wife, and his back story is ripe for future conflicts and revelations. They won't waste his character on a twist as absurd as this.

---

**Estes**

Also probably in a position to have done everything the mole did, but note that he had no intention of going to the safe house to see the terrorist until Brody knocked on his door begging. Whether he's excluded as a possibility or not depends on whether or not the razor was one of the mole's actions, or whether it really was Brody trying to silence him / get him back for torturing him. Of course, it could still be David seizing on the opportunity to silence the terrorist, but I suspect that the removal of someone who could betray his cover like that would be his top priority, when instead he was congratulating Saul and Carrie on their interrogation.

He's also a career man through and through, more concerned with politics and prestige than any single cause. He's found a job he's good at, that he probably once loved for the work itself, and has stuck with it because it brings him success and respect. I don't think it's him.

---

**Galvez**

The least developed of the CIA agents we've actually spent some time with. His reaction when Faizel was revealed to be the one they were after (having cleared him earlier) seemed one of genuine frustration, but of course if he's survived that long he would be a good actor. In a position to have slipped the terrorist the razor blade, and to have sabotaged all Walker operations, but he was in the car with Carrie as they tailed Faizel, and the call Eileen received about the tail sounded urgent, as if it had just come through. If the writers value internal logic, which for now let's assume they do, it's impossible for him to have alerted Eileen about the CIA tail.

---

**Vice President**

We're assuming that the mole works for Abu Nazir. If Nazir has the VP, he has no use for Brody (unless his end game is, as I'm beginning to suspect, getting Walker to assassinate both Brody and the VP to completely destroy US morale). The VP is clearly a snaky character and shrewd political operative, but I doubt he's working with Nazir. For one thing, it's a ridiculously big gambit for the first season of a show like this. He's only on here because Gaines has also been suggested, and I thought I might as well touch on him briefly.

---

**Gaines (his aide)**

Bleh. This would just be silly, and considering season 2 probably sees Brody elected into a position of power, all the while with his ambiguous motives playing out in the background, Gaines probably has to come through unscathed. Like David, she seems far more concerned with the careers of those she works with than any silly terrorism plot, and there is actually zero evidence it could be her - it's just the old 24 suspicion making people suggest otherwise.

---

**Virgil**

Retired CIA agent who remains heavily involved in presumably classified operations (the raid on Faizel's house, the square ambush in the last episode, etc. Additionally, when setting up surveillance equipment in Brody's house, he opted not to cover the garage. This should set off alarm bells, but he wasn't in a position to slip the terrorist the razor blade, nor would he necessarily have been aware of the tail on Faizel. I don't think it could be him, and for the same reasons...

---

**Max**

...I don't think it could be his brother, Max. The only thing that makes me suspect Max is that his role so far has largely been to look weird. He still surveilled Brody for Carrie, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything. Plus, there was a line a few episodes back that sounded a bit clunky, where Virgil said of Max: ""sometimes, I don't know if he's half dumb, or just acting that way to piss me off"". Hm? But no, not very likely

---

**An un-named CIA agent**

This is definitely an option, and as I've already said in this thread, I hope it's the one they go with. Think of David Harewood's tweet on the mole: everything we need to identify him or her has already been on screen. This is intriguing - has one extra been in both the interrogation of the terrorist scenes and the sting on Walker scenes? I briefly rewatched the relevant scenes and couldn't find a match, but this is the route I hope (and suspect!) they'll go down.

HEY HOMELANDERS! Sorry I was late setting up the official discussion but many props to mediocre_genius for setting up the unofficial thread in my absence. 

Last week Reddit was going down and up during the original 10pm EST airing which led to no upvotes showing up until the next day and just all around confusion when it came to discussion. 

Which resulted in last weeks discussions being a bunch of random observations and one line zingers since people weren't watching along in real time and discussing events and asking questions. Which really makes these discussions enjoyable to me and hopefully to you as well.

We have the unofficial up but I was curious to see if anyone would be interested in watching it again during the encore. Notice things you missed the first time around and  now that you've taking it all in, have a better chance to discuss theories and thoughts about the shows development. (So gtfo CHRIS IS THE MOLE jokes!)

Early on, it seemed to me that Jessica was getting wrapped up in the attention and power of her rise in social status. She seemed to love being in the spotlight, and obsessed with appearances. Since Dana's confession, I have been impressed with how much she cares for her family, and I feel like I may have been wrong about the strength of her character. Carrie's relationship with Brody seems more honest than before, but her recklessness is due to trip her up again soon, because she has had too many lucky close calls.

Brody is seeing his world with new eyes, and almost seems like a new character. Especially after Carrie's dialogue about how Nazir was just as much of a monster as Walden, which obviously affected him deeply, Brody is now seeing Nazir not just as a father grieving for Issa, but as something more sinister. I've had a nagging feeling that Brody's love for and loss of Issa was orchestrated by Nazir, that it was all planned in order to emotionally manipulate him. I suspect Brody will come to discover that Nazir planned for Issa to die, and that Issa was not actually Nazir's son. With Brody wearing 'two hats' now, I wonder if he will use resources from both sides to his own ends, and enact his own plot for revenge against the people who have wronged him.

Anyways, this season has given us a lot of character development, and I am really hoping for a more in-depth look at Saul.

After hearing all the praise this show got last year and also being a sucker for spy/espionage drama, it was at the top of my list when I subscribed to Showtime.  I have to say, I am wildly impressed.  

First off, Claire Danes deserves all the praise she receives for how well she embodied the frantically disturbed genius that is Carrie Mathison.  At the end of the first season, you genuinely feel for her.  She wants to be right at all costs but is never sure what conviction to believe.

Secondly, the storytelling of Brody and his torn motivations is told brilliantly.  Not many will admit it but in my eyes he seems to be no where near the bad guy I envisioned he would be after the first couple episodes.  On one hand you are rooting for the CIA protagonists while sort of rooting against the political antagonists and are carefully watching to see what side Brody will ultimately take.  Formulaic this show is not!

I can’t wait for the show to come back in September and I really hope they find an arch to bring Carrie back into the fold of the CIA.  I also think from a story perspective they need to introduce another Tom Walker’ish character or villain.  I don’t think you can do 12 more episodes of Carrie flip-flopping whether or not Brody is good/bad without sounding more batshit crazy each time.

Anyways, I think that Brody is partly responsible for the bombing in the finale.  Granted, he did not move his car as he was inside the building.  He was acting all shifty during the eulogies, and the fact that he got up and left with Carrie so he wouldn't be directly killed by the explosion was convenient.  Sure he could have been killed by the explosion in the office, but I bet that was a risk he was willing to take now that he basically handed off his family to Mike. We also have to remember that Abu Nazir was willing to sacrifice himself and many of his people to achieve his long term goals.  I believe that he purposely pointed out his car outside to Carrie to deflect suspicion from him if they survived (since she's always been the one who was right about him, she would tell Saul and everyone else that he wasn't responsible).

Lastly, one of the producers or writers said that Brody wasn't responsible for the attack..but then another person with the show said that they're leaving open the possibility that he was responsible.

(NOT true spoilers, just a fan). The plan all along is based off of Brody letting Nazir know (not shown) about his involvement with Carrie. To me, the most implausible thing this season (amongst many) was that he would risk as much as he did to save Carrie. Second most implausible thing was him going directly to her house after, somewhat convincingly for a pathological liar, breaking up with his wife and losing his kids. 

My theory is that the after Brody got discovered by the CIA, he found a way to communicate that to Nazir. That lead to Nazir having that conversation with him in the warehouse, but it wasn't the way Brody described it. It was a full re-affirmation of Brody's participation in the original mission. At that discussion Nazir decided to make himself a sacrifice to get all of those people in one space to exterminate anyone near to the vice president. Brody's access to Carrie made pretty much everything possible and that is what saved his life. 

Is Brody complicated? Yes. But the second he told Mike to take care of his family, it was clear to me that he was prepared to die. He talked like he wasn't going to be able to do the job, loved his family, but had to go. Familiar tone to the first season. He isn't suicidal for the sake of dying, just willing to sacrifice his life for a bigger cause. Carrie even brings up ""you're talking in a past tense"" the last time she sees him. ""It's not goodbye"". He talks in exact suicide bomber terms. He's the guy behind the bomb, he's still distinctly dedicated to his initial cause despite internal conflict. ""Goodbye love""... suicide bomber terms. Brody is the enemy. Season 3 is about finding him.

In the preview, we see a stack of cash as well as a passport and an ID with Carrie's picture on it. Just before that, we see Brody getting his picture taken in a rather shady looking setting on a plain white background. That to me indicates that the two are getting fake IDs/passports and planning to go into hiding together (although I'd think Brody would be pretty recognizable to the public, so that might be an obstacle to that plan). 

Whether they succeed with this plan I'm not sure. I've heard a lot of people speculating that they might kill either Brody or Carrie, and while that could make sense from a narrative standpoint, much of the show's best television is a result of the dynamic between those two characters, so I don't know if they could just throw that away.

One thing that continues to strike me is the relative stasis of Saul's character. Through all the stresses of the first 1 and some seasons he's maintained almost complete composure, yet still there seems to be a frustration building in him, yet the boiling point never comes. 

Something's gotta give, I feel Saul will go through some sort of trauma this season that will tilt his approach to the ""at all costs"" that Carrie displays. His wife left him to go back to India. Could an Abu Nazir attack create an ill fate for Mira? We know she's going back to India to run some kind of slums project and they writers made it a point to make it known Nazir has no problem targeting innocents.

Midway through the season, Saul takes a polygraph test so they can figure out who slipped Brody's captor the razor blade. But he can't get his heart rate down as they're in the middle of tracking the rich white girl fleeing to Mexico.

Eventually the interviewer begins asking questions and when he asks about the razor blade it appears to catch him lying when he says ""no."" But the interviewer tells him he needs to relax and then Saul walks out.

I'm no polygraph expert and maybe I misread the chart, but why focus on the monitor after that question unless you want the audience to notice it?

Carrie unconventionally sparks a personal and sexual relationship to get the answers she wants, putting her emotions and possibly sanity on the line. She gets answers, but were they true? And even so, she ruins her relationship with Brody in the process. In the meantime, Saul gets Aileen to talk by using intelligence he found trying to find an opening that'll get her to talk. He therapeutically divulges enough his life to her to form a bond, and then when he talks about his marriage that's what gets her (because of her relationship with Faisel I suspect or maybe she just cares about Saul at that point).

* saul had the goods on the whole drone attack thing involving walden and estes, and definitely wanted estes' job.
* saul seemed to care WAY too much about the brody assassination plot, because, if it succeeded it would have ruined the plan to frame brody for the bomb at the funeral. 
* he invited her to join him on the ship for the abu nazir burial at sea.  he figured she's been chasing this guy for so long, she'd want to see this 'til the end, and she'd say yes - when she said no, he was taken aback.  during the subsequent convo about her choosing brody over the CIA, he was insistent that brody was once a terrorist, always a terrorist - almost like he knew something was up.

I refuse to believe in terrorists that take a publicly visible role, simply because it is virtually impossible to be that good of a sleeper agent. It hasn't happened in reality... ever, as far as I know.  If the show actually goes there and double confirms it, well that instantly pushes it into ""meh"" territory for me. Sure, great characters they have but what for? Now, implying that there is a mole *somewhere* in the CIA that is feeding terrorists data... sure, why not. Bradley Manning has shown us what is possible for an intelligence official with a USB stick and an internet connection. 

But a well-known journalist that converses with the head of the CIA while simultaneously being the cell leader for the number one enemy of the state? Yeah, no. I don't buy it one bit. I just can't. Not in a series like Homeland that fervently implies to be at least *somewhat* believable. I can't accept that she is in contact with Nazir directly. I can't accept that a terrorist black ops commando raids a store and kills 6 federal agents. I can't accept that they get the face of one of them but are incapable of finding out who he is when the CIA probably has a file on *every* Arab looking guy in his twenties and thirties that has any sort of that the training that guy has.

That's why by now I force myself to believe in some kind of false-flag attack, especially after last week's episode that saw the black ops commando, that was clearly militarily trained, raid the bomb maker's store. I don't know how that false-flag thing would work, I just tell myself that last season's plot really was coined by Abu Nazir but this season's plot is actually Walden in a long-con to get public and international support for attacking Iran. Somehow you could make it work and it's intriguing to think about it for a while. I mean they had a fucking fundraiser at a weapons manufacturer and Walden as a whole is basically characterized as a *darker* version of Dick Cheney by now. But if this is the plan,well then it's just plot holes from here on out, no matter how good they pull it off. Because if it comes down to it, the best way to do a false flag is eerily similar to all the thwarted FBI terror plots but thought through to the last step. Isolate susceptible individual, hand him *actual* bomb making stuff instead of fakes, go ahead and let him blow shit up. What is happening throughout this season though is so gigantic that it could come out at any second which is the exact opposite of what a false-flag should look like. And it makes a caricature of people like Dick Cheney who already are caricatures. Which pushes it into the ""meh"" category once again.

What I'm saying is they stretched this thing too far either way. Last season we had two turned US soldiers, two young Americans, an unkown alleged mole in an intelligence agency and an old immigrant that were the terrorists making up two, hell even three different sleeper cells - most of which didn't know shit about each other. It's certainly stretching belief but it still flies. Because it still operates in the basic framework of real Islamic terrorism. This time, it's a top journalist, a US congressman and a bunch of completely anonymous Arab black ops soldiers making up one big 24 style terror corporation.

Also, last season we had long scenes in a mosque, we had Aileen in the car with Saul and we had the many flashbacks to Abu Nazir, exploring at least to a tiny degree the complications of what the War on Terror actually is: a War of terror on Terror.

This year we have Dana in the school assembly opposing a war against Iran and two or three scenes with the Hamas wife in the first episode that constitute a down to Earth approach to what is *actually* happening in the world. Something that ties it to reality.

So whatever happens now, I have the deep fear that this show will fall into a ditch of nonrelevance. I'm not watching this show for Carrie, Brody and Saul if the world in which they are existing makes no sense anymore. Then it's just 24 with good characters and I don't really need that.

Hopefully the people running the show have a plan. Because I really don't want to see this go down the usual Showtime road that leads straight to the aforementioned ditch. I really really don't.

Is this all a big red herring? Or is it more than that? I think it's to show us that we, the viewers, are easily fooled. Think about it, our eyes through this has mostly been Carrie, an emotionally and mentally ill person. The show may reflect this. Maybe we're just looking at hints and analyzing them too much: heck, maybe this thread itself is over-analyzing.

[Spoilers],totzov,7,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/1f67fq/my_thoughts_about_homeland_just_after_ending_both/,"So I'm fresh after season 2 ending and I must admint I am impressed as hell by the quality of show. It literally made me say ""what the f..."" few times through most episodes and smiling to creators. They did brilliant job.

What I'm most interested in shows and movies are characters themselves and relationships between them. House, M.D. satisfied me the most, then Dexter but recently i felt like it has gotten worse there and now i regret that i delayed Homeland for so long. I have this bad habit to pigeonhole (i hope google translate did good job here, I've actually never seen this word used) people and after first episode I thought I already figured out who Carrie and Sauls were I see now how wrong I was. Carrie indeed is able to do a lot to get job done but she also has ""weaker"" side, she loves and wants to be loved while Saul isn't such a good old man as it seemed in the beggining and most of it doesn't look forced. I love it. I can't wait for third season to see how characters will develop, how whole show will.


But there's few things that are bothering me and i hope you will help me make things clear:

1. I think Carrie fell in love a little bit too fast in Brody. I really enjoyed this relationship but I felt like it happend in between two or three episodes.
2. Why didnt Walker shot Walden instead of Elizabeth and 1/2 SS men? I mean i know it was to made them all hide in one place so Brody could blow everyone but - he didn't do it and shooting vice president would end life of actually someone important without making it suspicious that such a good sniper missed.
3. I didn't have anything against Dana till i read somewhere here someones complaints about how she's so ""emo"" all the time and... i agreed. Now i think that it looked fine in the beggining but she stayed the same through full both season. I wish they will give her a reason to be happy next season.

And my prediction is that Brody isn't on Al-Qaeda side anymore, at least i hope he isn't, i wouldn't like it if it was all planned, everything, including Carrie helping him to run away, too unbelievable.

1350449425.0,6,self.homeland,11m5aj,What does 'Abu Nazir' _mean_ in Arabic?,abu_kursh,6,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/11m5aj/what_does_abu_nazir_mean_in_arabic/,"Greetings to my fellow Homeland enthusiasts. I thought some of you might be keen to know what the name ‘Abu Nazir’ actually means. As a (reasonably proficient) student of the Arabic language, I think I may be able to provide a little insight. 
As to the first word, ‘Abu’: more often than not the word, derived from the Semitic tri-consonantal formation [‘-b-o], means ‘father of’ (which is why Palestinian President Mahmoud ‘Abbas is sometimes alternatively referred to as Abu Mazen, i.e. ‘Mazen’s father’). However, outside of the teknonymic formation, ‘Abu’ is sometimes used in order to refer to a unique personal (somatic, character, etc) attribute which has no special genealogical significance (as with the title of Egyptian intellectual Yaqub Sanu’s famous satirical magazine “Abu Nizara Shamsiyya”, lit. “The Man with the Blue Glasses”, or my personal handle, which means ‘the man with the paunch’). This second sort of usage conforms more closely to the fictional Abu Nazir’s kunya (otherwise he would be ‘Abu ‘Isa’, which – I hope you’ll agree – doesn’t have quite the same menacing pop). 
The second word, ‘Nazir, is a bit trickier. This is due to the fact that, in colloquial pronunciation (which tends to be widely divergent at any rate), Arabic contains several different ‘z’ sounds (ز+ظ+ض+ذ). Without getting into too much wonky detail, I’ve decided that the form of ‘Nazir’ being discussed presently is نذير.  Here’s how the Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic (for all intents and purposes the go-to lexicon) defines the word: “consecrated to God; vowed; solemnly pledged; warner; herald, harbinger, forerunner; warning; alarm.” 
Bearing all of this in mind, the best translation I’ve come up with for ‘Abu Nazir’ is “the Harbinger.” CREEPY, right? I cannot speak to the question of whether or not the name hints at any future developments in the plot, I just thought you all might like to know (other Arabic speakers are free to offer correctives to my interpretation). Cheers everybody. Happy viewing!

Okay, time for me to read too deep into it...According to [the country code on the diplomatic plates](http://www.worldlicenceplates.com/usa/US_XCCX.html)(KV), the diplomat is from Saudi Arabia. If I recall correctly, the prince was also from Saudi Arabia. Having elements within the Saudi government support this plot really seems to increase the potential for damage. 
So it appears plausible that the timing of Rep. Dick Johnson's(lol) scandal was more than a coincidence. 

Shouldn't Walker having been turned somewhat undermine Brody's credibility from the perspective of CIA(sans Carrie and Saul) and even the general public? From their perspective, if one of the two snipers was turned, who is to say the other wasn't as well? Would they disregard thinking about the Manchurian candidate possibility?


One thing that bothered me was that Brody and Walker both knew the diplomat, and in fact the diplomat actually contacted Walker. Given the intricacy of the plot, this seems to be a pretty big risk. Is there something I'm missing? Given how much Al Qaeda despises the Saudi government, is it plausible that this was an intentional move by Nazir to make it look like the plot occurred with the full backing of the ruling family?",,False,self,t5_2smlq,False,,,True,t3_mjw5y,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/mjw5y/so_many_questions_about_the_plotspoilers/,

Carrie is playing Brody.  At first I was pissed thinking why is she f'ing things up getting intimate again but looking back at that scene I think she played him like a fiddle (no pun intended).  The whole plea prior to them going at it all came back to bringing down Nazir.  If we look back to season 1, the love of Carries life inst Brody, its stopping Nazir. Period.  

Does Brody know more?  He makes a comment that whatever the plan was they had for him has already changed and he has been replaced, he is sure of it.  I thought that might be important.  Its a pretty affirmative statement that leads me to believe he knows or may at least be able to correctly assume some things about the pending attack that he is holding back on. 

Lastly, why did Roya take her phone battery out of the phone after he called to apologize?  Does she think she can be tracked?  At this point, how much does she know about where he has been for the past 12 hours?  Maybe someone can explain the implied tech, because its the same thing she does with his phone when they are driving out to the meet.",,False,self,t5_2smlq,False,,,True,t3_13ilsj,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/13ilsj/ill_fly_away_second_watch_observations/,

1350085980.0,3,self.homeland,11e4hq,(spoiler) So I watched the first episode again...,YaoPau,3,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/11e4hq/spoiler_so_i_watched_the_first_episode_again/,"... because I had a hunch that Estes was the mole.  The first time watching the series, I'd assumed Estes was just playing the dumb boss role, being too by-the-book and stopping Cary time after time due to his own ignorance.

But in this season we find that Abu Nazir knows the combination to Estes's safe, and he was so sure that Estes would be out of his office long enough that he was willing to risk Brody's cover being blown for mere target codes.  And so I thought back to all the things Estes has done ... letting Brody speak to his guard ... having Galvez spy on Cary ... firing Cary ... passed the decision whether to attack Abu Nazir in Beirut off to Saul, when Saul had no more information than Estes had, and when it was clearly supposed to be Estes' call.

Yesterday I told my friend about Homeland and we watched the first episode together.  Below is every scene Estes is in.  Some parts of it may be nothing, but just tried to cover it all:

(1) The prisoner who was in contact with Cary, and eventually said ""an american pow has been turned"" had his jail sentence turned into an immediate death sentence, and we found that out while Cary was on the phone with Estes.  Estes did not have an answer for why, but just as Cary was getting close to getting intel, the prisoner suddenly had his sentence changed.  Estes then tells Cary to not meet with the prisoner.

(2) Estes was the one who revealed to the CIA agents that Brody had been saved.  When Cary stood up to leave the room, Estes gives her a bad look.

(3) When Brody comes back to the US and meets Mike for the first time, Mike tells him that ""Estes wants to get the CIA questioning out of the way as soon as possible"", so Brody has to come in the following day.

(4) Estes cuts off Cary's line of questioning during the debriefing.  When Cary tells Brody to ""look again"" at the picture of Abu Nazir, Estes is noticeably annoyed and looks away, then cuts off Cary a second time.  When Cary asks ""how didn't Abu Nazir meet with the only two POWs in the country?"" Estes answers the question himself, saying ""well, apparently he didn't.""

(5) Estes asks Saul if it was Saul's choice or Cary's for Cary to be in the debriefing.  Saul says ""I'm surprised you didn't bring her in yourself, since she was the only one of us who's been to Iraq"".

(6) More of Estes to Saul: ""She kept trying to connect Brody with Abu Nazir.  It's always Nazir with her!  What did I tell you when I agreed to give her one more chance?  I said it would end badly for both of you.""

It's hardly proof, but it was fascinating watching the first episode under the assumption that Estes is the mole... if that's true, then the writers weren't trying to hide it much, and I can't think of a single time in the rest of the season when they've blatantly tried to hide it.  While we see some too-obvious clues for Saul (lie detector) and Galvez (I'm Muslim), Estes is just playing the dumb boss role and doing what's best for Abu Nazir time after time.

Also, after re-watching the first episode I'm positive Saul isn't the mole.  It would've been so easy for him to kick Cary out of the CIA after her unauthorized bugging of Brody's place and subsequent come on to Saul ... but instead, Saul finds enough proof in Brody's finger twitching to not only keep Cary aboard, but to get a 4-week surveillance warrant to make the bugging semi-legal.",,False,self,t5_2smlq,False,,,True,t3_11e4hq,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/11e4hq/spoiler_so_i_watched_the_first_episode_again/,

So everyone (not a generalization since I know everyone on Earth) apparently thinks it was a bad idea for Carrie to hook-up with Brody, but when you watch that whole scene from the start-to-finish (inside her), consider this perspective: what if they're both playing each other? This show seems too smart to have one person be ""above"" the other at all times, they are both equally intelligent from what I see.

* From Carrie's perspective, getting close to Brody is her last option. She's spent way too much time watching him 24/7 to let this go. Throw in the fact that she's suffering from a mental disorder, and you've got an obsessed person who will do *anything* in prove that she's right even if it means having sex with the terrorist (her CIA asset did this with the prince, this is no different). This is a little girl who grew up watching her world be affected by terrorism. She's not put her job on the back burner for Brody. Notice the way she acted overly drunk?

* From Brody's perspective, this is a way for him to get intelligence on the aftermath of his terrorist plots and any plans the CIA has. Hearing that his captive was killed was apparently an aphrodisiac as well. Assuming he's not informed by a mole, she is really the only legitimate access into counterterrorism information. Continuing to talk to Estes or whatever would raise eyebrows. The look he gave at the end of the polygraph test suggested he knew Carrie was behind the glass and she would know the polygraph was bullshit. A message to her that the CIA is bullshit? Maybe he's looking to recruit for whatever plans he has? She seems to understand him, maybe she would understand his goal?

From both perspectives, these two are both damaged characters. Lonely, misunderstood, rejected from the world, they both have secrets. These two, if they weren't ostensibly on opposite sides of the coin would likely be in a relationship.

in their scenes together she just seems too self-confident, aware, and capable to simply be a stay-at-home wife. it would be a very cool twist if this is the case.

this theory is not fully flushed out, partly because we know next-to-nothing about her character.

seems to me that raqim serves as a pretty unimpeachable go-between with pakistan. he's an academic and goes there to lecture so few red flags *should* be raised.

but at the end of the day this is more of a hunch than anything...stacy really had some level of control over raqim when she was calming him down by saying 1) his tail didn't know anything, 2) if they did they would be tearing the house apart right now, and 3) get out there and keep up your normal routine.

[Spoilers],dylan78,5,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/17rmjo/any_recommendations_for_books_relating_to_the/,"Maybe like some others out there, I've always had the fantasy of becoming a ""Jason Bourne"" like chameleon, able to disappear at a moments notice and possessing a variety of skills and knowledge allowing me to be extremely resourceful and approach any situation with a large amount of versatility.  

When Carrie activated her ""emergency"" plan at the end of s2, going to the storage shed to retrieve money, cash, passports, meeting her contacts etc. for them to get the hell out of the country, it triggered my long interest in that fantasy aspect again.

Anyway, was just wondering if any of you out there have the same kind of fantasy and have read more into it.  I have read many non-fiction military and espionage books for pleasure, but have yet to find a really good book that serves well as a reference or guide to these kind of things.  I have read the book ""Emergency"" by Strauss but would not recommend it (all flash and no substance).  I was wondering if anyone out there could recommend any fiction or non-fiction books that talk about this kind of thing?  Maybe something about the Mexican drug cartels or the biography of a former KGB agent?  I don't know.

For anyone else out there with the same kind of fantasy, I've found a lot of ""prepper/survivalist"" material to be actually quite useful.  Many people in that community are former military or special forces so the information is quite legitimate.  There is however an overemphasis on guns and bushcraft (end of the world type stuff) I've found and an underemphasis on money, laws, travel (the world we live in today).

For the entire first season, the show existed in an approximation of the real world. Sure, characters and events were fictionalized, but not in a way that would break away from the reality of the show. All events were events that, as far as I am concerned, could have happened or currently be happening; the same way the Newsroom exists in the ""real world"".

Then the season opener started with Israel bombing Iran, a fictional world event that completely changed the sociopolitical landscape of their version of reality, into something not *radically* different, but different enough. Suddenly it became a very *fictional* show to me; no different, no less intense or worse at all, but definitely one more layer removed from where I was.

Where before it was fictional events happening in the real world, I suddenly had to create a fictional world in my head for these events to happen in. I actually had to pause it and take a second to rework it.

The links between Hezbollah and Abu Nazir have been revealed in Sunday's episode. 

Also, a few more things that point towards Galvez: 

1. It cannot be Saul. Sure Saul is a prominent character but revealing the him as the mole would simply ruin the show. Saul's character has been fleshed out enough so that we know he is patriotic enough to put his country before his family. Seems doubtful that he is the mole.

2. It would not create gaping plot holes. Galvez has been prominent enough so that people would easily recognize the character, but he hasn't been prominent enough to even justify his character being there.

It could (possibly) streamline Brody to the White House.

That theory is reaching, but I'm sticking to it until next week. This other theory is a little more plausible.


Brody is going to replace Abu Nazir. I wasn't sure until I saw the preview for next week, but I feel it coming. Brody may not be the mass killing type, but who's to say that killing is what the new plan is? There's going to be a new plan, there's going to be a new villain.

What if Saul is the sneakiest double agent of all time? Maybe he knew about Brody the whole time and is in cohoots and hence trying to stop Quinn from putting a bullet in Brody's computer? Or perhaps he's trying to get revenge on someone who killed someone close to him, prepare to die (poorly timed Princess Bride joke).

For serials though, what if Saul is double agent? Wow wa we wa right?

Willa Paskin gets into this at length in her [recap for Salon](http://www.salon.com/2012/12/03/homeland_recap_what_a_mess/#comments):

&gt;What does Abu Nazir know from Carrie Mathison??? Perhaps in a future episode we will learn that in his interrogation last week Nicholas Brody talked about Carrie Mathison for hours and hours. Maybe when Nazir asked about his change of heart, Brody said, “I can’t do your dirty work, Abu Nazir, not because I love my family, but because I have fallen in love with this loose cannon CIA agent — she really gets me! She likes having pounding sex on upright furniture and thinks it’s sweet when I curl up on the floor and have terror flashbacks! — and we are going to be together forever.” And maybe Nazir was like, “Tell me about this Carrie. What kind of car does she drive? And where does she live? And would you do anything for her? Oh, I only ask, because I would totally let you have your original corner of terror floor back, if you really wanted it.” But unless that happened, I am unclear on how Abu Nazir — who does not have, like, long cozy chats with Brody every few days because, among other things, Brody’s phone was tapped until this episode, when it magically wasn’t anymore — knows Brody will do whatever he wants because he has taken Carrie.

It's a fair question, and it kind of makes me believe all the conspiracy theories floating around that this is all part of a long con Nazir and Brody are playing on Carrie and the CIA.

EDIT: Just to clarify since multiple people have now made comments about Roya being Nazir's source, I wasn't asking about how Nazir knew of Carrie's existence. That's easy to answer. My question is about how Nazir knew that Carrie was so important to Brody that he'd be willing to do whatever Nazir asked once Nazir kidnapped Carrie. That's what Paskin is getting at too. As far as we know, Roya doesn't know that there's anything more than sex between Carrie and Brody.",,False,self,t5_2smlq,1354587072.0,,,True,t3_1484vt,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/1484vt/so_uh_how_did_nazir_know_about_carrie_spoilers/,

I just finished it 10 mins ago. I'm wondering:  

Would the microSD card play a role later on, It was never picked up after the ""tunnel scene"" and cuts to black before he leaves. 

What role can Carrie play after this, I know the whole programme is centred on her. But as she isn't in CIA any more, Would the centre role now move away to someone else?

Did anyone else want to watch brody get blown up -.- . Damn i wanted him to so Carrie could be proven right, But yes of course, it wouldn't of  helped a series 2 come.

Lastly i got to say, Well done to the creators. I don't normally watch drama's/thrillers what not. Yet even rarer for a good american programme *Cough. But this is the best thing i've watched in a long time, First thing I've actively watched like this since heroes. Its unlike other shows that can be in the same category, All the rest seem to have to go Sci-Fi with lots of it (from what i've seen) But this programme stays down to earth and realistic. Also great acting, I cant wait for the second season, But I bet its another year or longer till it will be shown here on TV.",,False,self,t5_2smlq,False,,,True,t3_tahie,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/tahie/just_finished_the_first_season_being_uk_and_all/,
