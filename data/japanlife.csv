1. When I first arrived in Japan, our boss took my girlfriend and I to a local onsen. It was a little embarrassing. Not because my privates were twenty feet longer than everyone elses, but because I accidentally ditched the guy when I got in there. First of all, sexes separated, presumably to avoid boner-issues. Then we went and undressed. When I had finished unravelling myself I couldn't locate the Japanese guy anymore. I wandered into the bath room and looked around. I saw a selection of old Japanese men, none of which I had come with, and a sphincter: some guy was bent over double pointing his right at me. ""huh,"" I thought, and sat down to wash facing the other direction. Well, it turns out the anus belonged to my boss. I guess I came across like a scared gaijin intimidated by naked nationals. To top it all after that I lost him again, so I went and got in the hot pool outside, only to find he'd gone and sat inside. Whatevs... He got fired 6 months later so never mind. That's life. 

2. When I stayed in Tokyo for a while I met a Japanese girl who confessed to being a ""mistress"" and tried to get me to lick her feet.

3. When I finally convinced my BoE to ""let"" me cycle to school, I got totally fucking lost. I didn't even have a phone. Head of teachers drove around the town looking for me.

He wasn't lost at school or anything, his parents just discovered him missing today and a note...

There's no 48 hours bullshit, no whispered rumors at school while the teachers just conduct class as normal. Everyone who is not in testing/mandatory classes is working on figuring out where he may be.  
  
I hope they find him alright.  I know psychiatry isn't big in Japan, but I hope this kid can get some help... I wonder what will happen to him.  
  
Currently sitting alone in the staff room, as I realize my low language ability would make me a hindrance.  I do wish I could do something to help.

I've had older/elderly neighbors for the whole time I've lived here. 

Apartment 1 - elderly mom would come over at 5am to clean her son's apartment, banging vacuum cleaner against floorboards, whining ""Yusuke, okite-yo"" repeatedly until her son would eventually get up. It'd be about 1 hour of activity, then it'd be silent. 

Apartment 2 - downstairs neighbor, 50something mother of 2 high-school aged boys. Would scream at her sons for all manner of studying transgressions until at least midnight, then start vacuuming at 4. EVERY DAY. 

House 1 - living with inlaws - My wife works at night and is usually wound up until midnight and can't sleep, but her (psychotic) mother insisted that there's no reason someone should be asleep past 5. Having no luck in reasoning this past my wife, she started cleaning the entryway or vacuuming - again, making as much fucking noise by banging against the floorboards as possible. EVERY DAY. 

House 2 - no longer living with psycho mother in law. Older house, so walls are fairly paper-thin. Neighbors also vacuum at 4am. 

The last straw today was this - it's August, so naturally everyone has every possible window in their place open, but some ignorant shit starts burning leaves and grass at 5am. The guy is loud, but I can't see where he is to yell at him. The whole neighborhood is choked with this acrid smoke.

Is this a phenomenon? Am I crazy? If it's a phenomenon, is there a Japanese word for it? I'd call it ""Morning-Passive-Aggression"" 朝の受動的攻撃行動 but maybe there's another word?

Please!,uberscheisse,24,8,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/1739j7/enduring_kafkaesque_jp_japan_postal_service/,"Okay, here's what is happening. 

We put together a package of birthday gifts for my niece and other silly stuff for family members. 

Inside the box was:

* A small digital camera (lithium ion battery inside)
* 2 Eco Kairo (USB rechargeable hand warmer, lithium ion battery inside)
* Snacks, a shirt, tea...

Now the mistake I made was not checking the regulations for mailing lithium ion batteries. I'd done it before, but before the regulations changed (in 2009 I'm told). 

So the package got returned to us, at a 5000+ yen loss, they tried to put together a deal where they open the package, send the battery stuff back to us, send the package and then give us credit (to be paid in postage stamps) but in the end the credit was ruled against by some pencil-pusher in Tokyo. 

So, we're sending a box with a shirt, some snacks and some tea FOR 5000 YEN. Our mistake, I know... but here's where it gets weird.

We live in Kashima, Ibaraki. The prefectural office for JP is in Mito, about 90 minutes north of here. After checking with 2 different information phone centers at JP, it turns out that, since January 1, 2013 you *can* mail lithium ion batteries. You just can't do it from individual cities. You have to actually physically *go* to the office in the prefectural capital. 

This is what boggles my mind. The regulations against shipping LI batteries is that they're dangerous for flight. So JP won't put them *in a van for 60 km* but they'll put them *on a plane to Canada if you go to the right place*.

Am I looking at this in the wrong way? It really just seems like bureaucratic stupidity. ",,False,self,t5_2rg2o,False,,,True,t3_1739j7,http://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/1739j7/enduring_kafkaesque_jp_japan_postal_service/,

I've been in Japan since late 2011, on a working holiday, and in late 2012 I got a permit for full time work. I've been working for my current employer since april 2012 (part time last year, switched to full time this January.)

I'm an eikaiwa teacher, but the company is a weird, small company that didn't have real eikaiwa lessons (with a textbook and so on) until I got here. the other 2 full-time teachers are Japanese. basically, my boss dicked around and didn't prepare for my full time employment well enough, so up until the end of last month I didn't have textbooks, curriculum, advertising campaign, or anything for my eikaiwa lessons. sometimes I seriously want to ask her what the fuck she was thinking. anyhow... so basically I have 3 students, two of whom are from last year. (plus a once a month children's class) 

about my pay, according to my employer and the immigration office it's not enough to make ends meet (although I know I could scrape by). so my employer is putting me up for a year in an apartment. she pays 30 thousand. the thing is I didn't know the living conditions (someone else is living here with me) beforehand and I have ended up very unhappy there. there was a contract, which I never saw, let alone sign. my boss signed it. and when I told her I no longer wanted to live here she said I would have to pay the remaining months' rent in order to move out. at the end of 1 year, the housing contract will be up (and I will also have to re-apply for a work permit). 

so, I desperately need to increase my pay in order to stay in japan. my employer said she would raise my current salary (very low; if I lived in the cheapest apartment possible, rent and utilities would take about half of my pay) if I got more students. the thing is, my current salary is the absolute lowest... it's what I would get if I had no students. so at 3 students it should be a bit higher, but nope. last year I also had 6 students at one time but my pay did not increase. later, I am going to talk to her about when I can expect a raise.

so, my questions are these. 1) I think the housing contract complication (I have to pay the remaining rent in order to move out early) is bullshit because I didn't sign the contract, she did. but I don't know my legal rights here. can I move out? wouldn't it be on her to pay? also, can I be fired if I do that? (in my work contract, it says I may be let go due to ""bad attitude"")

2) if things continue as they are (I hope not because I want to stay at this company (because my students paid a lot in 入会金, 月謝, and 管理費 and I don't want to let them down!)) I will have no choice than to quit and go somewhere else, or be let go due to the inability to extend my work permit. so what options are there for someone like me? I am hoping to get some extra qualifications in case I have to look for another job. right now I'm working on Kanji kentei (5) and Nihongo kentei (N1) but are there any other ""shikaku"" I would be able to study for? I'm willing to do any job, would rather get away from teaching, but wouldn't mind going to another eikaiwa as long as it keeps me in japan. by the end of this year I'll have had 2 years experience teaching eikaiwa.

What other options/resources are there for someone like me?

please and thank you. m(-_-)m

Edit: thank you to everyone who replied! I really appreciate it, I'm going to go to the shiyaku-sho on Monday and ask about the legal consultant, then talk with my boss about my salary and moving out. I'm going to aim to move out by June, hopefully I can make it that long :) and if she can't give me a raise, well I'll look for another job too!

I'm half New Zealander and half Japanese I was born in Japan but left the country before I was 5 so I really don't have much memory of this place. My mother forced me to speak in Japanese in the household so I wouldn't forget my language. Thanks to her I'm bilingual and can speak both English and Japanese fluently. 

I came back to Japan because I love Manga, Anime and the culture. 
I even went to Comiket that happend a week ago!

But the sad thing is.... even after living here for 1 and a half years... I have no friends....

It might be because I've been living overseas for most of my life... but  Japan's society is really good at making you feel like you don't belong. 
When you do something different people look at you like you're some kind of alien. When you ask what something is, or what that means, they look at you like you're some kind of idiot....

When I talk to people about anime, manga, culture. All they do is listen? and just nod their heads or agree and then tell me I have a different view of looking at things.... I just want to talk... :'(

I'm 20 and live in Tokyo. What should I do? 

(P.S I've tried going to bars and stuff... but everyone there is like 10 years older than me!!!!)

I'm not too fond of it, but with enough soy sauce I can eat it without complaint.

Anyway, we had a massive goya on the vine that started turning yellow.  My wife's friend said that means it's bad and we should throw it away, but I asked my elderly neighbors and they said it was fine - just not bitter anymore.  *Wha?!?*  Interesting.

So I cut it down and let it sit for about 2 days until it turned completely yellow and prepared it.  When you cut it open it looks like a murder scene inside - the seeds are all red and nasty looking.  Here's a pic:  http://i.imgur.com/34IMt.jpg

Scoop out that gunk, slice them up, and saute them in some bacon grease.  

It's a totally different experience.  It's softer and tastier than the hard, green, bitter goya that you know.

If you are growing goya and want to try something different (better), leave some on the vine to turn yellow.

Now I'm just scraped up (helmets are a good thing), but my bike is totaled. My japanese language abilities are about intermediate. When the police showed up, it was clear that I was getting the run around due to this, and what was eventually decided that, because I was on the right of the cab, both of us were at fault.

The problem with this is that the cab company is pulling the ""bygones will be bygones"" card and won't pay to replace my bike saying the scrapes to the side of the cab would need to be considered.

Is there any suggestions how to handle this outside of the usual lawyer up? I'm more or less broke, trying to pay off student loans (hence biking to work every day in lieu of the subway), and can't really afford to do so at the moment.

For my Japanese Language and Culture class at university my final research paper requires a primary research component.  To collect my first person data, I am conducting interviews.  My topic is Cars in Japan and the interviewing section relates to the portion of my paper about how Japanese culture relates to the way they drive, choose cars, treat cars, and any other similar aspect of the greater car culture.  


My teacher has asked me to speak with a Japan native, as I've already interviewed several Americans who have lived in Japan. My research has come up rather dry so far on the topic and I would really, really appreciate it if there was a native Japanese person out there who could help me out?  
EDIT: If you live in Japan or have lived there for an extended amount of time, yours answers are also gladly accepted. Especially those living in Japan right now, if in addition to answering my survey if you could direct a native Japanese friend here, too, that would be greatly appreciated. &lt;3




I'd like to show my appreciation for any response I can get.  As compensation for your time, if you live in a region with Amazon (US, Great Britain, Japan, etc) I'd like to ship you something of your choice from Amazon.  I can keep this offer only for a short time because my deadline is coming up, so if you respond before May 2 at 2am EST, I will message you for details. &lt;3

EDIT2:  If you are non-native, because of the unexpected number of responses in such a quiet sub-reddit, I'm setting the deadline for this group to an earlier time May 1 at 9am EST to shift the focus back to the originally intended demographic (native Japanese redditors) and to make sure this university student can afford to eat through the rest of the semester.

Also, because the required questions are considered personal info, if you do not want to post it please feel free to message me them.  For the sake of validity of the research portion of my paper and to help put your answers into perspective, I do have to ask these questions...)


*Name (real or fake is fine)?


*Age?


*EDIT3: Are you a native Japanese redditor? If not, what nationality would you identify yourself as?
(This question was formally Are you American or Japanese? from the original portion of my paper.)


*How long have you lived in Japan?


*Did you live in the city, suburb, or country side?


Did you drive? If so, why? If not, why?


For what occasions did you drive, if at all?


How would you describe Japanese driving etiquette?


How are cars advertised in Japan?


How do people decide on which car to buy (i.e. is there always a 
popular model, do people intentionally try to be individual, etc)?


What is the popular opinion about kei cars or other smart cars? (i.e. In America, people often laugh at small cars.)


Is carpooling popular in Japan? Why or why not would you say?


How do people view pedestrians or bicyclists in the street? (i.e. In America people frown at bicyclists and do not always pay attention to pedestrians.)


What is the popular opinion of motorcycles in Japan? (i.e. In America, they are viewed as too dangerous to ride or that only bad people ride them.)


Are there examples of driving etiquette that is the same as etiquette outside of the car? Are there cases where people act differently to other people while on the road?


What is the popular opinion of Japanese automobile industry?  (i.e. Are they respected, are there any criticisms, etc)


What is the popular opinion of the unions in the automobile industry?


Open ended: In my course we learned about many Japanese values such as omoiyari, amae, bun, jikai, etc.  Does the Japanese car culture reflect these values like the rest of Japanese culture does?  What are some examples of car culture reflecting a Japanese value?


Open ended: Based of the questions I asked, is there any other information you think would be useful for my paper?

Rant/Cry For Help post,uberscheisse,25,9,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/1c4o01/pretty_certain_im_working_with_a_preop/,"Here's the deal. I just got posted at a new elementary school. Pretty much everyone there is 50something except for myself, the 4th grade teacher and the 5th grade teacher.

The 5th grade teacher's name ends in 子. I don't know a single non-female Japanese person whose name ends with that kanji, neither does my wife. Physically (?), legally, sociopolitically, she is a woman. 

She looks like a man. Dresses like a man. Has a lower voice than most women, but also has residual delicate female features. Her suit, when doing official school functions, is a man's suit with a tie.

I was brought up in Canada, and I, like all modern normal people, DO NOT GIVE A SHIT about people's sexuality. However, I'm in this conundrum where I don't want to out her by being all supportive and saying ""Hey, I get it, I totally understand and I'm an ally"" but I'm also dealing with the burden of teaching English classes with her. 

Class starts with ""Good afternoon, (teacher) and Mr. Uberscheisse.""

Only it's a 5th grade class and not only are kids becoming aware of gender but they've also learned English male/female pronouns since grade 1. So half the class says ""Mr. Tanaka"" and the other half says ""Ms. Tanaka"" and I can't help but think that the teacher noticed the confusion. 

I REALLY don't want to make the situation weird, but I'm shy myself and don't have a clue on how to take the next step - especially when it seems that her students don't even know how she identifies herself. 

Clearly she's strong enough because she is who she is in one of the most conservative places on earth, but if there was any way I could possibly make the road smoother for her I'd do it.

Been here for about seven months, and it's been getting harder and harder to deal with the day-to-day. To the point where I wonder if maybe it's something wrong with me, and could possibly be remedied with medication.

backstory: i'd spent a year in Japan previously as an exchange student. I'm an ALT now, in an inaka corner of Okinawa. I've had bouts of depression for most of my life, but it's never been as bad as it has been since I came here. I've never been on medication before, mostly because it would involve admitting i have psychological issues to my parents, who were previously my only source of health insurance. 

I was just wondering about what the process was, here. Did you have to go see a psychologist specifically, or was a general doctor good enough? Did you just ask, or did they have to diagnose you somehow? Were your previous medical records required? What got prescribed? What sort of dosage, for what period of time, and for how much money? Did you get better? Was it something you were able to talk to Japanese people about?

I don't know what to do, guys. I've been down an awful long time. Any help would be sincerely appreciated.


[Update] Hey guys. I really thank everyone for all their comments, it's given me a lot to think about. I think the plan of action for now is to do this multi-pronged attack: Do more to actively attempt to meet new people (spend more time in bigger cities, find a karate class, use internet meetup groups), do more to be active on my own (stay longer at school, go to the gym, make concrete plans to skype with people back home), and seek out an english-speaking doctor (psychologist if i can find one) to attempt some cognitive behavior/talk therapy. Do this for the next three months. If things don't improve (which hopefully isn't the case), seriously consider spending some time back home to sort things out.

I am frequently on the phone via skype talking in a regular voice, maybe a little laughter here and there, but nothing out of the ordinary.
So I got a call last week from Leopalace telling me that someone complained about noise and to keep it down and whether I had company. I told them I was alone that I was only on the phone and I will keep it down.
Fast forward a week, and I get a ring at my door at around 10:30 pm, it's the police. They ask me if I am alone and that someone was complaining about noise. I had been on the phone prior to that, but I was alone, so I told him I was only on the phone. So he took my contact details down and then left.
The police officer was very, very nice, but I am still worried that this might get kind of out of hand with my neighbor.
What would be the best way to go about this? I am assuming the walls are very thin, but then maybe my neighbor just doesn't like gaijins?
I am thinking about getting a cake or something and presenting it to my neighbor tomorrow introducing myself to maybe lighten things, but I am unsure as I am not even remotely close to conversational in Japanese and I don't really want to run into a cultural misunderstanding type trap.
Do you guys have any ideas on what I could do? Keep in mind that my Japanese is absolutely minimal, I can only understand maybe a handful of words and articulate more with my hands and feet as with words right now...

EDIT: I am trying to reply to everyone (thanks for your ideas and support!), but to keep things concise, I will update here as well for those that don't want to read the same thing all over.

EDIT2: I am not sure who complained as last night there was no light in my neighbors apartment, but since it was already after 10 pm he/she could have been trying to sleep. Regardless, I will get some Krispy Kremes today and a note introducing myself and see how that goes.

Also, I am going to my embassy this morning to check with them about what I could do and get an emergency phone number just in case things ""escalate"" with the police. Better be safe than sorry.

I will also tell my language school about what happened and see what they have to say.

I will also stop by Leopalace and tell them what happened just to appear more proactive.

PS: I'd hate to be that gaijin guy that justifies anti-gaijin sentiments. So I really don't want to fight. I feel that I am a guest in this country, so I have to play by the rules here or gtfo. So if someone complains, even if it is something like this where I really feel that I wasn't noisy, then I feel automatically my host is in the right and it's my duty to sort things out instead of fighting and justifying how I didn't do anything wrong. After all, this is why lots of places don't seem to welcome gaijin, because there are always problems with them, so I want to be extra nice and careful.

EDIT3: so I went to the embassy this morning, but not much came of it. After I explained my situation and asking what I could do to improve things or stay out of trouble, the lady (Japanese) just shrugged and said ""Japan is different, isn't it"". I didn't expect much but she said I can call a number there at the embassy if things escalate, which I don't really expect. Nice to see the embassy and all the other embassies around, though.

After that, I got a call from Leopalace, but only in Japanese so I didn't understand anything, I am assuming they called about yesterday. That was on my way to Leopalace itself.

So I arrived at Leopalace, and explained my situation. This was in like the main office of Tokyo, during regular business hours, but the English staff was ""out"". This is why I love Japan, and I am not sarcastic when I say that. But the lady was super nice and after I tried to explain in simple words what I was here for, she called a translator via the phone so the entire conversation happened by passing the phone back and forth and smiling at each other which was interesting. Turns out, that apparently there are no complaints about my apartment on file. There was some noise, but apparently not from my apartment, which explains the letter which was put into every single letterbox. That doesn't really explain why I got two calls from Leopalace, one time on the night I was actually on the phone and could have been loud because it was my first call, and then the second time this morning. But I didn't insist. Second, they said that the cop probably checked out a few apartments in my complex and that I was probably not directly targeted, they just want to ""check up"" on gaijins to make sure everything is in order. Mind you that the translator was a foreigner herself, which is probably why she volunteered that information otherwise I imagine a Japanese person wouldn't have been so honest. The translator said she is foreign herself and got checked out before as well, so it sounds possible considering I had recently moved and since I registered my new address they surely new that a gaijin was in town and probably from that could have decided to pay a visit.
I still feel that something is a little fishy about this, so I asked if I could do the ""yoroshiku onegaishimasu"" thing regardless, and they said it is tricky, but if I wanted to risk it, then the weekend during the day would be best, so I suggested Saturday around 1-2pm which is when I will pay a visit to my neighbor next door and below me to treat them to a small cake thing or Krispy Kreme? and a little note leaving my phone number so they can text me unobtrusively out of the comfort of their home if I do end up being to loud.
My girlfriend, who is Japanese, says I shouldn't worry about it, but I think it doesn't hurt to be extra-nice, especially considering that I am a guest in this country and will naturally meet a little more resistence than otherwise. Plus I want to get to know the neighbors anyway. :)

Please note that I am writing in such detail because I think someone else might profit from this, if not at least for its entertainment value. I will probably delete this post in a few weeks anyway.

EDIT4: So I got another call from Leopalace just this morning (Saturday). This time, they said someone was complaining that I was listening to music too loud. What happened is I turned on the radio this morning waking up, and was listening to it at an absolutely normal volume. However, I did have the window open, so maybe that way it was heard and ""bothered"" someone. Unbelievable. Of course it sounded bad to admit I was listening to music, I mean if someone is complaining about that, then it had to have been loud, but I swear it was absolutely normal volume. I will still follow through with my gift-giving this afternoon and see how it turns out.

EDIT5: So I bought two small gifts this morning, one was a mini-towel wrapped up nicely as a gift and a small box of some kind of sweet candy from a bakery. I accompanied both gifts with an envelope containing a small message introducing myself and went back to my apartment. At first, I rang the bottom neighbor's bell, it was around 1 pm Saturday. Nobody opened. I decided to put the letter and the candybox in the letterbox and went upstairs to my next-door neighbor. I rang there as well, but he/she didn't seem to be home. So I left the mini-towel gift and the envelope in the letter box and left to run errands myself. So I returned at around 6pm, it was already dark, and the next-door neighbor had put my mini-towel gift along with the envelope back into my letterbox. Neither the letter nor the gift had been opened. Even though it was already dark, I figured I would ring the bell next door regardless, it was still early (6pm), and there was light so I figured it would be best to react while ""it's fresh"". But he/she didn't open, so I left again. This just happened, so I will go to the Leopalace again on Monday and talk to my school as well. I think it's my neighbor's right to ""refuse"" my gift, but not opening the letter, and then not opening the door tells me one thing for sure: direct communication is not an option. Any suggestions welcome.

EDIT6: My gf told me not to go to Leopalace as they won't do anything anyway and I think she is right. I stopped calling my friends altogether and switched to email. No music or TV for me either. Hopefully, my neighbor will realize I am not a monster and raise his/her sensitivity level. It sux, but such is life. Can't afford moving out at the moment, wouldn't win a fight in this situation so I will keep it low key and see what happens.",,False,self,t5_2rg2o,True,,,True,t3_l89k2,http://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/l89k2/first_police_encounter/,

Even if a gal's been married for only a few months, and kisses a guy (as in making out,) and wants to take things further... how does Japanese morality come into play? I declined to take things beyond that, despite my addmittedly-selfish manly urges (if you will,) but maybe it's OK here?

Just wondering if anyone has some experience with this situation...

I've lived here for about 4 years and for the first two I worked at a place that didn't offer shakai hoken. Last year I worked at a place which did provide shakai hoken so I was also enrolled in the pension system and payed into it for the year I was working there. 

This year my situation has changed, so once again I am paying health insurance by myself and don't want to pay into the pension. (I don't care about getting the money I have already payed into the pension back.)

The problem is that once you are in the pension system, they expect you to keep making payments. I went to city hall and they told me I can do some kind of written application for non-payment (免除申請書?)  but which is only applicable to people earning under a certain amount of money. I guess this is a thing for people who are unemployed and can't afford to pay etc. 

They were very reluctant to give me a direct answer. Basically they said that the pension office will send me a bill, which I can ignore... sounds a bit dodgy.

For my English essay, I have to write about Japan and how they treat women. The class had a discussion about women being treated in general, but no one really talked about how Japan views women since no one really knows much about Japan or has ever lived there.

I wanted to look up articles, but I think some may be a bit biased. I want to know from actual Japan life and how they are viewed and treated, rather than articles. For some reason, this English class doesn't require a works cited page and the teacher actually tells us not to do research because she wants our own opinion. Unfortunately, I can't have much of an opinion if I don't know anything about how Japan views women.

I ask of you people living in Japan. Are womens treated the same as men? Do they have independence or are they stuck with traditional roles? The prompt is something similar, but more towards our opinions on how women in Japan are viewed. 

I think women are treated lower than men for working (office work, secretary work, cashiers, help desks) and are expected to do the house chores and take care of the family. I think Japan is a traditional country, but with the advancement of the world I think women have some independence, but many still choose the traditional way (being a house wife?).

Thoughts?,BarneyKerbopple,17,5,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/11pk6h/life_in_japan_vs_life_in_korea_thoughts/,"I taught English for 2 years in South Korea. I'm thinking about possibly going to Japan to teach English for a few more years before coming back to the US to start a real career. I've visited Japan 4 times myself so I know what the country is like on the surface but I haven't lived there before so I can't say what life as a foreigner there is truly like. 

There were a couple things about life in Korea that nagged me enough to get me to leave after 2 years. I'm wondering if Japan will be any different. Some of the things that got to me the most: ultra nationalism, animosity towards Americans, animosity towards foreigners in general, institutionalized discrimination, lack of proper hygiene and dirty country (relatively speaking of course), lack of natural beauty, sameness and ugliness of cities, lack of subcultures, etc. I'll stop myself there. 

Now if any of you have spent time in Korea you are more than welcome to share your opinions. I don't expect Japan to be a land of unicorns and cotton candy. I'm just hoping that Japan won't be like a shinier version of Korea for me generally speaking. Like I said I've been there 4 times and it looked nicer, was cleaner, the people seemed kinder or at least a bit less xenophobic, there was more natural beauty, and the food was better. Apart from that I cannot say what it'll be like. I don't want another Korea. I should mention that I plan to live in the big cities only because I know people will be a bit more cosmopolitan there. 

If I get the impression that Japan won't be much different I think I'll start looking more seriously into working in Europe or South America. The only issues there are the difficult visas for Americans and the low pay. I'd rather not have to lose money to live abroad. That said, I'd prefer a happier life over more money any day and I know for a fact that I wouldn't run into as many cultural problems in Europe or SA.

Lastly, yes I know that I can't really know what it'll be like for me until I go there myself and give it a try.  But, I'd rather hear opinions from people living there first because I'd rather not waste my time and money when I can easily go somewhere better for me instead. So here is the loaded question: Will life in big cities in Japan be much different from Korea and how?

Please answer honestly and bluntly. I've spent 2 years living in Asia within the Confucian sphere so I know how things can go. Thanks for your help!

I'm not a native English speaker, and my University degree is useless (philosophy). My current online job pays $10/hour. 

We're weighing the options here. 

Option 1) We go to live in Japan. 

PLUS: She can get a job, I can keep my online job (we would have 2 paychecks). I could give some English lessons to kindergarden kids or something like that as well (even if I'm not native), in a smaller town? We don't care where we would have to live. Also, I already know decent conversational Japanese.

MINUS: Rent. Here in Europe, I live in an apartment owned by my parents and I don't pay any rent.

2) We stay in this small European country that currently has an abysmal economy.

PLUS: Cheap to live, no rent, but only one paycheck.  I'm a citizen so it's easier for her to get permission to live here. I don't know how I would get it for Japan, since she has only permission of residence as a Zainichi, and not citizenship (although she could get it at any times I suppose).

MINUS: The chances of her learning this arcane language are small. It's spoken by 2 million people only, but it's mandatory to find any job.  We both miss Japanese food. We miss many things from Japan. She misses them more, of course.

3) Go to a third place (like Canada, Australia, NZ?)

This is perhaps a solution since we both speak English, but it'd be a foreign country for both of us.

I'm moving to Tokyo in late September to study at Tokodai and I could use some tips on how to get everything sorted in the beginning and maybe get input on my current plans (is it ok, is it bad/far fetched etc.)

I declined to move into the dorms (too far away) and my plan is to get an apartment or mansion near Ookayama in Meguro. My plan right now is to move into a monthly apartment (oakhouse or sakura house or something like that - maybe you can recommend me one?) for a month and during that time look into renting something on the ""real"" market. How am I going to handle that though? My Japanese is almost non existent and all I know is from text books. What to do about the contract and so on? I was thinking to ask a future lab colleague for help or maybe club member or the student division at the University. Would that be too bothersome to ask of someone? 

I will have approximately 20 man per month, and my expenses have to cover: rent, utilities, food, phone and the occassional books/university stuff i need. So I was thinking to allocate 10 man per month for rent + housing utilities and use the remaining 10man for food and the other stuff - is that feasible for an apartment/mansion near Ookayama?

Are there any other tips you guys could give me that I might not know? I'm looking for whatever you guys can throw at me :)

I'm not an otaku or weebo whatever and don't have any obsession like that but I just fell in love with the country (media, food, ethics, lifestyle ect). It's been over 4 years now since I've been back and it pretty much kills me every time I think about my time spent there. I want to return so badly.  My problem is though that I'm currently married and my wife is not too keen on the whole thing.  My wife is South Korean, speaks fluent Japanese (our common language) and after graduating from uni in Japan, moved to the States to live with me. She doesn't speak English very well and currently doesn't have a job. Before moving to the States we talked about living in Japan but ultimately decided to live in the US so I could finish my degree, easily find a job and save up money, and possibly pursue a masters degree. I now have two bachelors and completed 18 hours(halfway) in a masters for TESOL but that's it. I recently got my certification as a DBA and have 5+ years working in the IT field.  While I was in Japan I taught English at a juku for a little over a year but found it very stressful and not very rewarding. I suppose I can always do that and complete my masters but it's more of a backup plan than anything else.  

We're currently at a deciding point in our lives. We're trying to decide on whether to buy a house here and settle down, have my wife take English lessons and maybe try for a part time job,  or look for other employment in a larger city (current residence population is 37K) where she might have better job prospects once she learns more English (working for a foreign company or something), or pursue a job/lifestyle in Japan (or Korea I guess but I don't know any Korean) where we both would possibly be able to find decent employment. She is concerned about acquiring a visa, higher expenses, and difficulty of a family living in a completely foreign country but I'm more of the opinion that Japan is my dream place to live and since we are young, can still afford to kind of feel things out (if it doesn't work, move back to the States and start over). 
Stats on us:  25/m, 2 BA's (Anthro &amp; Global Studies) 18hours toward MA, DBA cert, 5+ years in IT doing troubleshooting (general hardware/software), 1+ year English teaching exp, JLPT 3kyu passed in 2006. 28/f, 1 BA in Japanese Education, 2 years exp working department store, 3+ years waitress exp, 1+ year Korean teaching exp, JLPT 1kyu passed. 

So reddit, what are the downsides or reasons why I shouldn't pursue living in Japan? What problems should I know about or experiences you've had that would help me get better insight?

But where do people take general classes that meet a couple days a week? A math class or a basic astronomy course for example.

Thanks!

I'm missing information on some details.,dude324,14,5,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/1gcpkf/moving_to_japan_at_the_end_of_the_summer_im/,"I have visas, pet quarantine, and rental agent stuff figured out, I think. I'll be in school, husband will be teaching English.

Banking - I figure I will probably be transferring some money from my US savings account to any Japanese checking account I get, especially at first with setting up home and stuff. I don't even know what sort of fees I should be looking for to find a good account, other than the foreign transfer fee, and I also figure I'll be paying rent through bank transfer but have no idea how to do that. I do probably 98% of my US banking online, through BofA. I would guess that's not nearly as big in Japan, or am I wrong?

Vet - We are bringing our two cats and ferret with us. I've got the quarantine stuff done (holy shit is it easier to get a ferret into Japan than a cat!), but I will need an English speaking vet because one of our cats needs an Rx food for a condition he's got. The brand we use is sold in Japan, so I just need to find a vet who stocks it or is willing to order it for me. I figure my Japanese won't be good enough to communicate this at first.

Phones - Is it a smarter idea for me to buy phones off Amazon or Ebay and get sim cards when I get to Japan, or sign up for a plan once I'm there? We'll be there for two years, and I would like to save as much on this as I can. In the states we generally use our smartphones for data more than calling, and I don't think that will change in Japan, especially with a train commute. What is everyone's favorite VOIP app? Skype?

Landing pad - I am almost certain that I will need about a week after we land to look at apartments, no matter how much pre-selection I do over the internet with my agency before I get there. I plan on using Agharta, so someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I figure there's no way I can land, head to their office, and pick up my keys. There's a couple of pet friendly hotels in Tokyo I have found, but only one is somewhat reasonably priced and it's out by Narita. That is not looking like a fun commute to go look at apartments everyday. Does anyone know of a pet friendly hotel, with rates of around 10000 yen a night closer in?

Finally - am I forgetting anything important I should have figured out before I go?

Will I need my physical diploma with me? Or will a transcript saying I've completed my degree be enough? Is this really checked?

I've browsed sites like GaijinPot, and most of the ones require you to be in Japan before applying.

That was back in October and November. 

I've heard of people collecting unemployment, and seeing as I quit I also was told that I had to wait 3 months to start collecting. 

It's now been almost 6 months of no work, and I want to try and collect. Since all I'm going on is anecdotal stories from friends, I want to know if anyone here has actually gone through the process and can give me a heads up on anything I should know before going back into Hello Work.

I also, have a 3 year Humanities Visa, with 2 years left on it. Will not working for so long have any adverse effects on my status?

UPDATE (2013/4/5): Met with lawyers today, asked them:
1. What happens to the 2 years left on my visa since I haven't worked in 6 month?
and 2. What do I need for an investors visa?

They said that without work it's not legal to stay here (didn't tell me a time frame), but if I found work I would be fine. I mentioned that I was leaving the country for a vacation next week and asked if I would have a problem with customs/immigration at the airport, to which they very unsurely replied, ""maybe."" They told me to carry my Hello Work in the case that they did ask me anything, to show that I'm at least looking for work. And you have to be working for a year to collect unemployment.

For an investor visa, they said I need to show ¥5million to invest into the company OR (not ""and,"" just ""or"") 2 Japanese employees. Also TWO addresses, business and personal. It can be one house that been divided into two levels, using one level as a business. You also need a detailed business plan that goes out 3 years. Once you have a rental agreement, the business plan, and the money you can apply for the visa. Also if you have a Japanese business partner you can skip the ¥5million.

My three year old iPhone 4 (bought on Softbank when I previously lived in Japan) is failing. I have hardly any battery life left, and the home button doesn't work much. 


In Europe, I was using my unlocked GSM Galaxy Nexus. I know that to use it with my Softbank SIM, I need to set up the APN (which I believe I have done correctly) to use the correct pakehoudai plan, and then use the SoftBank Mail application from the Android store.

**My question is..**

*If* I have done this incorrectly, I will be paying a high bill, as it will charge me for every data package. I do not want this to happen. Is there a way for me to put in the SIM card, use it for a day, and then check my bill - or do I have to wait for the next bill to arrive?

I just do not want to end up with one of those 500.000 yen bills due to a bad setup. SoftBank is not very helpful in setting this up, as they won't support it.



Any thoughts, experiences, advice? I'd like to use my better device, but don't want to pay half a million yen for a mistake if I make one.

My understanding is that the expiry date on the actual visa isn't my length of stay, but instead indicates how long I have to use that Visa to come to Japan. I'm guessing this is correct, as the date of issue is the day they actually issued me the Visa, and not the day I left to come to Japan.

So I've been in Japan what is nearing one year, and I can't figure out exactly what date is for expiry. 

Is it 12 months(so the full year, 2*6 months) from the day I entered Japan?
Is it the date my new residency card expires?
Am I totally wrong, and it's the date on my WHV? (much sooner than expected).

I'm looking through my passport right now, and I'm not sure which date to trust as they are all different. When I first came here I got a landing sticker permit for 6 months, and it gave the information very clearly. I extended that, but I can't find where the information for the following 6 months are.

Thanks, Hope this makes sense.

EDIT: Turns out all is OK. For anyone interested, I went to the Immigration Office of my city and they informed me that the final day of my stay in Japan is indicated on my new Residence Card.

I posted in /r/Osaka last year about my plans to move to Osaka, and my hopes of finding a job before going there. I have managed no such thing, and am now planning to move there on the 20th of February (one month from now, I have the ticket).

&gt; My plan is to:

* Enter on my UK passport with a on-entry 90 day tourist visa.
* Get my Alien Registration card.
* Try to get a job (where someone should hopefully sponsor me a visa).
* Stay at a monthly guest -house like [JF House Osaka](http://www.jafnet.co.jp/plaza/en/?action_obj=Estate&amp;action=detail&amp;estate_code=6&amp;room_code=1).
* Get help from Japanese girlfriend (that lives in Osaka) with job search-

On a UK passport I can extend my holiday visa for a further 90 days leaving me with 6 months to accomplish this. I have money enough to last me for that long, but it would be stretching it a bit.



&gt; About me:

* I have taken Working Holiday visa
* I speak native Danish + English
* I have attended a danish ""college"" (kind of, but closer to upper secondary education) with high grades.
* I have worked 3 years in a restaurant, 2 years as a lifeguard, 2 in a shop (part time)
* I am 22 years old.
* I speak near fluent Japanese, not so great at the reading/writing.




&gt; I have a few questions:

* Am I allowed to go down to the foreigner job office in Osaka and ask  for advise, or would this get me in trouble because I have no visa?
* Anyone know a good place for me to try searching around? 

My girlfriend (Japanese) will help me search jobs as well.

I wish to try to get settled so I can live there for a few years (for starters), but do** NOT** wish to marry my girlfriend yet - we are not getting married for a visa, we will do that when the time is right (and we are older and wiser).


Any help or pointers you can give me would be highly appreciated!

* study Japanese in Japan for up to a year on student visa (likely aim for passing JLPT N2) and then look for a job

Hello there, I have a bunch of questions regarding life in Japan. As mentioned earlier, I will be leaving in just over three months to study in Shinjuku, Tokyo. I've been to Japan previously, but it was nothing like this. Staying there for 9-10 months is amazing and I can't wait, but there are many things I must find out. So please, if you are willing to answer to the best of your knowledge I would much appreciate it. Couple of questions right off the bat (these are in no particular order): 1. I will have a budget whilst being in Japan. I've been saving and will be until I depart, but I would like to know just how expensive Japan is. I will be there for nine months. I will be in a dorm and all of that jazz, meals and such included. I was told that $1.5k would be great, but I don't know how true that is. I have a goal of $5k for the whole nine months, I realize it all depends on the person, but would this amount be sufficient for a guy who knows how to limit himself?

I think one is good too start. I will read everything and anything you are willing to share with me SO GO NUTS!!! I'm majoring in Japanese (2 years in) and know a fair amount about the culture, but I am always open to learn more.

I am also new to reddit, I was previously a 4chan user only. That being said, the prospect of asking for some answers and not receiving a nude picture, is a nice thought. So yes, I'm a new guy. BE GENTLE.
Thank you for your time.

Question #2: I realize that this is quite different for everyone, so feel free to share you experiences; how quickly do you pick up Japanese while you are there? 
As mentioned earlier I just finished my second year at UW Milwaukee and have taken Japanese both years. I know a few hundred Kanji and can read and write fine. Comprehension and speaking is obviously what I'm looking to improve. I just wonder how much I will actually get to use outside of school. I'll possibly be with a family, which is great in terms of learning converstional Japanese, BUT even outside of that, will most people just be speaking to me in English? I'd rather they not ecourage non-Japanese speaking and I don't blame them thinking ""this blonde kid has no idea how to speak Japanese. I'll save the headache and speak in English."" I'm just looking for experiences and perhaps some ideas of what I can do to push this whole speaking Japanese full time thing along.

I was also looking for a few gaishikeis for entry-level positions.  However, I won't be needing to go with those options for now.  Thanks everybody for the great advice and encouragements!

**edit:**  Wow, didn't expect so many replies so quickly!  Great advice and encouragements!  Keep them coming!

Hey guys,

The 2011 JET Program announcements came out and I've been placed as an alternate.  That means I have a chance to teach in Japan if somebody drops out of the program.  However, I'm a pessimist and don't think it will happen to me.  For some reason, I feel like JET was my only chance to get to Japan, even though I had planned to go through private teaching companies if I didn't get it.  I've spent six months in Japan a few years ago after being laid off at my previous job (they filed for bankruptcy and laid off 30 of the newest hires nationwide).  That experience opened my eyes and Japan has been a huge passion for me ever since.  But with this possible rejection from the JET Program, I feel like I'll never be able to return to Japan.


  My plan B was to get to Japan through another teaching company.  I've looked into JoyTalk and PeppyKidsClub, but I'm not really sold on either of them so far.  I've read far too many instances of somebody being screwed over by their contracting organization, which is a bit daunting, considering I'll be in a foreign country.


  A little background about myself: I don't like anime and I don't play many video games.  I know that Japan is much more than that.  I don't understand much of the language (I can read and write hiragana, katakana, and some kanji; reading and listening comprehension is very low), but I am actively studying.  


  So Reddit, I'm at your mercy.  I would love to hear some of your sage advice and encouragements.  Anything you can advise me on will be VERY much appreciated!  Thanks everyone!


  TL;DR:  Might not get into JET Program and feels bad.  Wants to go through private teaching company but doesn't know which one is good.  Advice and encouragements are appreciated!

For the past year, I've been working at an after school (national chain) kids conversation school. My initial contract, as is standard for the company, was 13 months and my initial Specialist in Humanities/International Services Visa was for 1 year. Earlier this year, I decided not to renew my contract and look for work somewhere else. Everyone I talked to seemed to think that this would not be a problem, and that I would be able to renew for another year when my current visa expired.

Several weeks ago, I applied to renew my visa so that I could complete my contract. When I initially submitted to my local immigration office, they called me up and the person behind the counter started grilling me about if I had a contract for my new job. After I told him I didn't have one lined up jet, he accusing me of lying on some of the paperwork that my current employer filled out, but eventually accepted my application.

About a week later, I received a letter in the mail requesting some additional documents form my current employer as well as the contract for the new position that I don't have yet. After forwarding the letter to my employer's HR department, they said that nothing like this had happened before, and that they would send the documents and a letter explaining the situation directly to immigration.

A couple of days ago, I received a post card telling me to come and pick up my new visa. I assumed this meant that things had been straightened out and I would be getting a one year extension. WRONG. All I got for my 4000 yen was a sticker in my passport that says ""Extension Permit Status: Specialist in Humanities/International Services Period: 3 months"" and hole punched through my ARC (old type). When I asked the officer if I was going to get a new card, he said something along the lines of ""3 months, no card.""

Everyone I've talked to about this today has said that they've never heard of something like this happening to anyone.

In addition to feeling like I've been screwed pretty screwed over, I currently have several questions:

1) Does anyone have any information on this 3 month working visa extension? Everything I can find online seems to say that the minimum renewal is 1 year.

2) Did I just loose my status as a resident of Japan? If so, what are the tax and other implications? Am I still eligible for National Health Insurance?

3) Is there any way I can appeal this or at least get a new ARC?

Here's my problem:
I've applied for MEXT and to my university last year, and recently received a letter that I'm accepted and can begin my studies this april. In the academic schedule it is said that I should undergo medical examination at the beginning of the academic year. 

The last time I had such examination was about a year ago when I applied for MEXT, and when I applied to university a bit later, I've just copied info from my MEXT examination. 

Since the last year has been very stressful for me, I've gained some weight, my vision slightly deteriorated, and probably some other stats have changed in a bad way. It's not something really critical (I don't have tuberculosis and my vision is not so bad that I can't read anything farther than my hand), and my field is not even distantly related to physical activities, but the main point is that my current medical stats are quite different compared to what I've previously sent in application documents.

**My concern is: would that difference in stats be considered as cheating?** 

I might be overreacting, but losing such once-in-a-lifetime chance to study because of some papers would be rather depressing. 

I'd be happy to hear any advice regarding my issue

My second question:
This one is regarding my national health insurance but pretty much the same question. If I leave without paying the remainder of this year's insurance premiums would it be a problem upon return? Should I speak to someone about this as well? Or would they simply see that I was paid up until the time I left?

- Will I be able to find more imported products / brands from the US than in the bigger supermarkets in central Tokyo?
- i.e. is Costco Japan more like a wholesaler for Japanese brands with a few US imports, or more like a wholesaler for import / foreign goods with a selection of regular local product? What's the ratio like? 
- Are the prices more affordable than those in the regular supermarkets. I know Costco sells wholesale / bulk, but how about the price per unit?
- How big are the bulks, in general?

- Pepsodent tooth paste
- Skippy Peanut butter
- Quaker Oats (quick)
- Peanut butter cups - you see, I like peanut butter :-)

For some time I have been working on a personal project, I own the project in its entirety. On the side I have also had a partial employment with fixed hours for another organization. Now, the problem is this, we have carried out a major project that we informally have worked far more on than my actual work hours. The project has also become mixed with my personal project and now the legality is becoming a bit messed up. It is clear both between me and my employer that I have put down time that is so to say, ""my private time"" and I have never signed anything to hand over any copyright either.

My question is this, can they claim the whole project as theirs? Even though it is tightly coupled with my private project and from the logs it is apparent that I put down time that clearly was my own and belonged to my own private company. Nothing is signed apart from the fixed hour employment contract and I am far from an expert in Japanese intellectual property law. Anyone more experienced with lawyering than me?

**Edit:** I am reading up, [this](http://www.cric.or.jp/cric_e/clj/cl2_1.html#cl2_1+A15) clearly states that the employer owns what I produce ""in the course of [my] duties"", now it becomes even more hairy since the duties are very poorly defined and never written down, as well as only part-time.

Usually the best way to find a new job is through your personal network, but unfortunately I'm presently at a job that pretty much everyone in my personal network is involved in either as an employee, investor, or client. No matter who I talk to, it's bound to get back to someone in my company.

I'm looking for something different because the project for which I joined the company was cancelled, and the company and the work to be done are moving in a different direction than I want. 

I am also starting to think that for career reasons I should be in an English-speaking environment where I can stand out rather than get by. I've been working in Japanese-only companies for about 8 years now.

-----
Following are excerpts from an off-the-record lecture given by Kevin Maher, who heads the Office of Japan Affairs at the U.S. State Department, as written down and compiled by a group of students in December at the request of American University before they took a trip to Okinawa. Kyodo News obtained a copy of the memo from students who attended the lecture. Under the road map, Japan will provide money for the relocation and it is a sign of a tangible effort from Japan. The DPJ government has delayed implementation, but I am confident that the government will implement the existing plan. Tokyo needs to tell the Okinawan governor, ""If you want money, sign it (agree to the relocation plan)."" There is nowhere else to base U.S. Marines. The DPJ suggested a replacement facility in mainland Japan, but there is no place in mainland Japan for the U.S. military. Japanese culture is a culture of ""wa"" (harmony) that is based on consensus. Consensus-building is important in Japanese culture. While the Japanese would call this ""consensus,"" they mean ""extortion"" and use this culture of consensus as a means of ""extortion."" By pretending to seek consensus, people try to get as much money as possible. Okinawans are masters of ""manipulation"" and ""extortion"" of Tokyo.

Here we go, my little description of what I have learnt over the last few months.

First off, where to look. I tried the web for a little while, it was not a big hit and every single thing you find is essentially taken or a lie to make you call the agency. Instead, go to an agency, preferably in the area you are looking since to my experience the retailers know their area but are close to utterly useless at even neighbouring areas. Some of them will treat you badly, some of them won't. Choose the ones that you get along with.

If you are looking for an apartment of your own I am assuming you have by now understood that at most times English is a no-go, here it is just as much so. Make sure you have a vocabulary to describe houses in general, know the area damn well and have a clear goal. In my experience, it pays off to be picky and only be flexible with what you really can tolerate to change. Bad deals will come your way, especially if you like me have a limited budget and is looking in central Tokyo.

Okay, the buildings themselves. Japan is an earthquake-prone country. Also, people don't want old apartments in general (not a surprise, but, well). There has been a series of building reforms in Japan in order to make sure that buildings won't kill you, these are the ones I know of 1979, June 1981 and 2000. I heard there was also one after the Great Hanshin Quake (Kobe) in 1995, but I have not been able to verify it. Let's move on to building materials.

The quality of the houses is generally not on par with what I as a European considers good (mind you, it does remind me a bit about the buildings I saw the interior of in California). One would expect buildings in Tokyo to at least withstand a part of the winter, but, no. Get a heater. Single glass windows and wind that moves your curtains even when closed can be expected. The materials used are primarily wood, steel and concrete.

Wood, the first picture I got into my head about wood buildings are these charming old houses you see in Kyoto. This is not always the case. It is common to have a wood frame and then cover it in something else, plaster for example. It is thus quite difficult to judge just by looking so ask. There can be nice wood buildings so don't rule them out, but remember that they are ranked as bad when it comes to earthquake safety and you could end up hearing your neighbours as if you lived with them and the traffic as if you lived on the street.

Steel, our second contender. Steel is slightly safer than wood and usually comes with a nicer set of walls. I was fooled a couple of times thinking it actually was concrete when it was steel (so, ask and read the darn sheets properly I guess...).

Concrete, there are two kinds of it, reinforced with steel and without any reinforcement. I am yet to find something I really hate about a concrete building so do help me out here (apart from some of them looking horrible).

Even after all this, you can still end up with a building that is not very good because of the contractors trying to save money and cutting corners. You will not know for sure, so place your bets. There is a scale of safety, all I got from the real estate agents when asking was smiles or laughter, they never knew about it for the houses in my price range and nor did the owners.

So, key money, a little surprise for us westerners. When you move in you generally pay at least one month of rent (I have seen up to three) as a gift to the owner (there are places where you will not, but then the place is usually a bit shady and they are desperate to let it go). This is just another custom that we all have to get used to. You will also pay a deposit of roughly the same size, and don't be fooled by the name, you are not all that likely to get it back when you move. On top of this you need to pay one month of rent to the real estate agency as a thank you to them. All in all, have savings ready to cover this.

There are things to add, but this will have to do for now. I will try to get back with the actual moving experience, there is more to tell.",,False,self,t5_2rg2o,True,,,True,t3_e256o,http://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/e256o/experiences_from_finding_an_apartment/,

It can be one house that been divided into two levels, using one level as a business. You also need a detailed business plan that goes out 3 years.

In the USA, for example, we would expect foreigners to adopt the pattern we use, but I have realized that Japan doesn't seem to expect gaijin to write their last names first. Being an American, I have a desire to try to assimilate (which makes me more gaijin-y even while attempting to behave according to Japanese standards...  oops.) so I am more than willing to be called by my last name (my highschool gym teacher always called me by it, I don't find it strange).

The beef I have here is that in my Japanese language classes I (as well as my fellow students) was taught to write my name in Japanese order in katakana. However, if I try to write in Japanese order when I'm actually in Japan it just confuses everyone/ they rewrite it in the ""correct"" order.

So, why do they teach us to write our names that way if it doesn't really fly in Japan?

I know they feel the need to teach us that Japanese people write their family names first, so I guess I can understand the role-playing aspect of it, but in that case I think it's important to talk about how you should write things when you're actually in Japan.

Anyone have similar experiences/ woes? I think the obvious answer is that to avoid confusion I should just give in to writing it ""first name ・ last name.""

I am currently in my final year of Mechatronics Engineering, and want to specialize in Biorobotics in Japan, with the ultimate goal of starting an R&amp;D company for prosthetics.

Warning: long post. Also, first post on reddit. [edit: cross-posted [here](http://redd.it/zz8jk)]

**Background**

I have looked at various labs, and currently have a shortlist of 20 in 17 universities across Japan. They are slowly dwindling based on emails with the profs. I have no preference on location, as long as I get to do what I want to do.

I graduate in April, and planning to come to Japan to see the labs for myself and talk to the profs face to face. This should be enough for me to decide on a couple (or maybe even one; entrance exams are on the same day for most unis). I have already met some of the profs in person when they were doing guest lectures at my university.

In June I will go back for a couple of weeks for convocation, and then back to Japan for entrance exam practice/tourism/waiting for entrance exam/interviews time. These take place in August in most universities for October admission. I am a Canadian citizen, and can stay for 90 days at a time. [1]

**N.B.** My marks in University are not great (~60-70% in a very tough program, which is the average), but they should hopefully go up to high 70s to 80s by the time I graduate, now that I can pick courses that interest me. I was told by those profs on separate occasions that, so long as I have a prof backing me, all I need is to do the entrance exam and interview. I am not sure if the grade matters for a scholarship... [2]

The Masters program would take two years to complete. Some universities, such as 東北大学, actually offer Biorobotics in English. After Masters, I will (assuming I have the knowledge I need) start my own company in researching myoelectric prosthetics (or something else that might be interesting me then). [3,4]

[edit] As part of my university studies, I have worked in three very different countries, moving each time. Two jobs were in medium companies, two jobs were in small companies, and two were in research labs at universities. Also, I always pack light (everything fits in one suitcase/on the back of my bicycle), and can get along just fine in small spaces as long as I have something to do during the day, and internet at home.

**About me**

From lurking in this and the /r/japan subreddit, some info about me: 21 years old, Male, White, and I speak seven languages, English being one of my four native languages. I have no dependents. Also, I have never been to Japan.

**Japanese ability**

I speak Japanese fluently for the most part, and am still learning Kanji by seeing them. (Comfortable for most of what I see, and can usually infer the rest). Handwriting I learned from seeing samples from male friends, so it doesn't look too pretty. I also have lots of Japanese friends in Japan. (99%+ of them I met when they were in Canada on exchange or tourism), and I think I would be able to rely on a few of them.

I learned the language primarily on my own over the past three years. I learn like a baby as opposed to formally, and my ""default"" accent (sentence structure/words/intonation etc) is Ise-ben (伊勢弁), though I can speak Hyoujungo as well. I can change my intonation to match the accent for the most part. I don't know Keigo properly yet (aside from 丁寧語 and some substitutions I picked up on), but hoping to do that in Winter, when I will be having the opportunity. I was given a Japanese name since no-one could pronounce my name without completely butchering it.

As for technical Japanese, I read some robotics papers in Japanese, but unfortunately not much else. I am currently mentoring a Japanese Chemical Engineering Masters exchange student, and we are translating the assignments from English and doing them in Japanese (just ODEs/Calculus for now, but at least I am getting math practice). [5]

**Questions from the above**

The questions I am asking here is because literally everyone I know in Japan is Japanese, and is not sure how this relates to whites.

[1] If I get accepted, could I get an educational visa from within Japan? The mofa website seemed vague on that.

[2] What scholarship should/could I get, if any? Would the grade have any effect?

[3] Is opening a company realistic for me as a foreigner? What challenges/benefits are there. Are there any requirements (Japanese ownership etc)? What would I need?

[4] Is it usually allowed to build on lab research when opening a company? Or would it be better/possible to just work in said lab? I am planning on open-sourcing my designs (mechanical, electrical, software, system), but that is another discussion.

[5] How can I improve my technical Japanese?

**Other Questions**

* What else should I do to prepare?
* What should I do when I get here?
* What can I expect for overall costs?
* I have three passports. What would it take to get Japanese nationality?
* [edit] Should I bring my bicycle with me or should I buy/rent one here? If so, when? Would it be a practical mode of transportation? I normally bike every day of the year, even in -40°C weather.

Summer is near and it when it was time to turn on my airconditioner I could feel a stench akin to wet socks. I did a bit of reading, mainly on american sites, and my best guess would be that some [mildew](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildew) has decided to make a home somewhere in there.

Some advice I found was:

* Clean your filter
* Run it on a high temperature for some time to try to kill of the pest

I did both of the above, I hope that three hours on 30 degrees celsius would be enough because my unit can't go higher than that. But it barely made things better.

What I didn't find, not even in the manufacturers manuals, was how to clean more thoroughly than the superficial filter. Has anyone else had to clean their airconditioner thoroughly? I know that at least on older trains this smell seems to be fairly standard during the summer due to their airconditioning system, but I simply refuse to believe that there isn't anything/anyone I can't do/buy/hire to get rid of this problem.

He's korean but raised in an English-speaking country, and has been together with a Japanese woman (in Japan) for 4 years, I'm not sure how long they have been married, but they just had a daughter last month. They were only making about 45万円 between the two of them, living at a house her parents owned so they didn't have to pay rent, she handled the finances and living costs etc. Before the baby was born, he brought up that if they moved to xxxxx (other country where his family lives, not Korea), he could make 100万円 a month at his parents company, and they would have a much easier time getting by.  When he said this, she said ""No, I don't want to be separated from my family"", he responded with ""I know, but you can go back to Japan as much as you want, if I can make that much money I will pay for your tickets, go be with them for as long as you need to be"" but apparently that wasn't alright.  Also, his parents came out and met her parents, helped take care of the wife before she gave birth, but it ended in the wife's mom screaming in Japanese at my friends mom (who doesnt speak japanese) ""go home, we dont need you or want you here"" and then shoving her across the room.  Obviously she understood the tone of voice, and my friend's parents are back home. Once everyone's parents were gone, he brought up moving a few days later and said ""It all depends on the baby. if she wants to move to canada, then we can go.""  After that, she asks him for ５万円 for ""baby costs"", never mind that she manages the finances and since there aren't joint accounts in Japan all the savings are in her name. He says ""Hold on, we need to talk about this, maybe tomorrow, i dont have 5万 on me right now."" This made her furious, and she started following him around the house, screaming. Then, her parents came and got her and the baby, wouldn't tell him where they went (this happened a little over a week ago); she also told him ""we are married, you have to either live with me in Japan or get a divorce!""

Every day, they have been going into the house while he is at work and taking things. first was all her clothes, then the TV / chairs in the living room, then the rice cooker and the power cord to the refrigerator. Finally, they called the fuel company and had the propane tank taken away.  He just got a call from the electric company and they are going to shut off the power soon as well. 


My friend is coming to me for advice, but I have no clue what to tell him. Do any of you have similar stories or advice for us? Does he have any sort of a case against her?

EDIT: also, do you think there is any chance for reconciliation in this situation? That was my best advice, ""she is still crazy over just having the baby, maybe tell her 「lets not talk with each other for 2 weeks, give this a break」.  The father-in-law also told my friends (long before) that they were as close as family  and to not be afraid to ask for anything. Now, the FIL is threatening to call the police on him.

I'm doing a study abroad in Japan, but I've noticed some things that are definitely different from home.  I've met many boys in my study abroad program that are Japanese, but their English isn't necessarily fantastic, but it's okay.   They're very, very nice, but they say some things that I'm not really used to.

For example...they notice when I change my hairstyle and comment on how much they like it.   Now I'm not really talking about cutting off a few inches of my hair, I'm talking about changing what hair accessories I have in my hair.

They'll also say really complimentary things, like that the outfit I'm wearing is very cute or that I look very cute on a given day.   

It's all very flattering, but I guess I'm not really used to men my age saying something like that to me.     

Random people will help me on the street, offer me free things, etc. and so on...Is this normal?  I mean, I don't look Japanese at all...so...i guess I stand out...but is this normal?   For coworkers to call one another cute/pretty on a daily basis?  It's normal for girls to say that to other girls, but for males to say that to females, is a little different than what I'm used to...

(Original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/1brozk/new_religions_that_use_taiko_for_worship/)

I originally thought it was taiko. One of my students helped me contact the city's noise control department, and through an investigation there, they discovered the noise is coming from a steel factory that's quite far away. I had written down the times the noise happened, and they matched the factory's work logs. The factory said they would ""try"" to reduce the noise. It happens less frequently now... but now happens primarily between 1am and 6am, the exact times I asked them NOT to run this machinery. It's awful, particularly because we need to keep the windows open at night in the warmer weather.

The noise control department said to contact them again if it continues to be a problem, but I'm wondering if that's really the best way to go about it. The land that the factory sits on has no noise control laws. 

I found an English website for the company that runs the factory, and I'm wondering which approach would be better:

1. Contact the parent company in English and make a complaint. I can do this by myself.

2. Try to get some other residents together to make a complaint in Japanese. This requires assistance from a native speaker, time, &amp; (probably many) meetings. 

But I feel like I should choose one or the other. I think that if I do both, I risk coming off as crazy and irritating to this company... and I want them to take me seriously, because it's really affecting me and my husband.

I am going to go to Kyoto in May to start as a researcher in one of the labs. I am looking to go into Masters, and the resources have found online have given this situation:

* There is an exam that all students have to take in August
* There is also an exam that foreigners can take in February
* There are several English-language programs, but mine is not included in that

What I am trying to find out is whether or not it is possible to take the August exam, and then take the February exam if I do not pass? Also, can I take either (or both) of the exams in Japanese?

I will be studying for the exams, and I was wondering whether I should work on improving my technical vocab in Japanese, or simply reviewing the concepts.

Thanks

edit: The prof finally replied today. All the problems are in Japanese. The August exam is just problems, and the February exam is problems with a check for knowledge of English keywords. He did not mention the existence of an interview.

Thanks everyone for your responses.

What should I do to get service back?,phuzybuny,8,4,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/194dz6/internet_service_disconnected_after_1_late/,"I am in Osaka with NTT/Yahoo BB Hikari internet. My payment for January's internet service was about 2 weeks late and my internet stopped working at around 14:00 on February 12. Since then, service has not returned and I have received February's bill as well (which I promptly paid on the day that I received it - Feb 20). I am not sure what to do, at this point, to regain service as my Japanese is not yet strong enough to call the Japanese-only help line. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? What should I do?

Note: I am fairly certain that it is not a hardware issue as I have reset the modem, router, and my laptop numerous times as well having reconnected all the cables.

EDIT: I have regained internet! It was not due to the late payment (which I would have been given ample warning for) rather a ""cancelled"" router. 

I called the Yahoo BB English support line as indicated by /u/cowhead but unfortunately they could only refer me to the Japanese-only technical support line. With my intermediate Japanese I found out that the contract changes I made early January had rendered my SoftBank router ineffective as of February. Hence, service was disconnected to the router. The modem however, could serve as a router and it would need to be ""setup"" by an NTT employee or I would have to go through another call with a Japanese NTT worker to walk me through the setup procedures. 

From the Yahoo BB technical support staff, I was able to understand that my ""User Name"" and ""Password"" were necessary to setup the NTT router/modem. Being fairly familiar with routers, I dug around and got access to the NTT router/modem (turns out, the fairly standard http://192.168.1.1 user/user were the defaults). I found the page for setting up the internet connection along with the ""User Name"" and ""Password"" blanks and punched mine in. Apply. And internet is back.

- Java/C++ software developer in late 20's.
- Chinese American, wife is from Osaka, qualify for spousal visa.
- Business level Chinese (if it matters), I worked for a Taiwanese company for a few years.
- Basic conversational Japanese. Decent reading skills.
- I can small talk about everyday stuff, can't discuss politics or debate technical details, etc. I would need to take classes to reinforce kanji reading and speaking skills.

My wife wants to move back to Osaka to take care of her parents. I enjoy Japan and can see myself living there easily. However I'm a bit hesitant for career reasons.

Hello,

I'd love some advice from someone with Japan labor law / visa experience.

I have an offer from a US company to work as a software engineer in Japan.
They have no branch office in Japan yet so are asking me to go as an independent contractor (自営業 - jieigyou) and work from home.

I guess this is a similar situation to the following gaijinpot post (tried to post there but account confirmation email never came):
http://forum.gaijinpot.com/showthread.php?86822-Working-for-a-US-company-in-Japan
except that in my case my wife is native Japanese so I will get a spouse visa.
And the company is suggesting jieigyou.

If I go jieigyou, I will incur a self-employment tax of 15% on top of income and local tax.
Is there another sort of arrangement where I could file as an employee of the US company even if they have no branch in Japan so that I can avoid paying self-employment tax?
I suppose its doubtful, but I thought maybe the spouse visa was a bit more lenient on what kind of work is allowed.

Thanks so much for any advice.

I am sort of frugal, so I like a financial institution that cares about me and my money (i'm at a credit union here in canada) if possible, I'd like to have an additional savings account similar to ING direct... ie, high interest and the ability to deposit/withdraw in a day or two, with no or low fees.

as for the phone plan, i'm bringing my iphone with me (yeah, not frugal, but hey..) so... au or softbank? I like skiing and travelling to remote areas so a company that has good reception would be good.

finally, thank you again to everyone who responded to my post 3 months back and gave visa, etc. advice.

About two years ago I obtained my BS in Computer Science (technically the degree is called Real Time Interactive Simulation, but it's effectively a CS degree with some fluff) at an American university. Realistically, I still have about two or three years left before I've finished making payments, but I figure now is the best time to start making long-term plans to pursue this goal.

I'd like to study in Japan, instead of here in the States. To be honest, I'm more interested in the experience of living and studying abroad than in the degree itself. I've considered the JET program, but I'd much rather spend my time studying than teaching, and a Masters in CS would be way more relevant to my field than a year of experience as an English teacher in Japan.

I have a few questions that hopefully someone can help me answer...

1. For a CS degree, are all classes taught in Japanese? I'm still unclear about this because I've heard that some classes are taught in English/Japanese and some are straight up Nihongo. I'm not at the JLPT-2 level yet, but like I said, I've got a few years before this could become a reality.
2. Assuming I could obtain a scholarship for said degree, would this pretty much cover all of my living costs? On average, graduate students receive ~150,000¥ monthly stipend, which I think would be quite enough for me to get by on.
3. Does anyone have any recommendations for Universities that are accommodating of foreign students? Ideally, I'd like to study/live in Tokyo since I have some family there and well...it's a really cool city.

so basically... I want to know how you go about paying your credit cards. my credit cards are through a nationwide bank, but my chequing account from which I used to pay my bills is with a small local credit union, so it may be hard to transfer.

My wife and I are Americans with two children and would like to move to Japan. We've been a few times and loved it.

If I were to bother applying to be an ALT, would they sponsor visas for my family in addition to myself? If not, do I have any other way of bringing the family unit over without exploiting tourist visa timeframes?

I am looking to take my motorcycle driving license next week (if possible).
In researching this, a few questions came up. Most could be answered by /r/rideitjapan, but not all.

**TL;DR: I have a Japanese CAR driving license, meaning I don't need to take theory tests. I can just go to the test center and take the test.**

However, before this I wish to ""practice"" on a test center course.



What I am searching is this:


Information on how and where I can go to a ""driving school"" and rent out 3-6 hours of track time on a driving course like the one at the license testing centre _without_ already having even a 125cc motorcycle license. If possible, a place where I can ask for advice, or alternately just a place where I can drive on a course like the one I need. Bike rental should be possible.

I am living in Mie Prefecture, within the vicinity of Yokkaichi, so around that area would be nice, but I have a car so can go further if there are others around.

1.  I hear you can go to Fuchu (or any driving test course) and do a practice run on the weekends.

Do I just show up at the Fuchu Driving Center on Saturday and line up and take the test?  Is this something I need to pre-arrange?

2.  What's the general lead time between passing the written exam and scheduling the practical exam?  Is this like a month wait, or a week or so?

I'm an American who's been living in Nagoya, Japan on a Tourist Visa for the past month and a half. I've been looking for a job teaching English, so I could apply for a work visa and stick around. I've been living with my girlfriend, who is also American, but has a job and a work visa already. 

I've got a BA in Communications, two years of experience as an English tutor, and I've worked freelance as a guitar and voice teacher for a while. I figured this would make me a shoe-in for being a kids' English teacher at the places that don't necessarily demand certifications in various things. 

Now here we are, a month and a half later. I've spent half my tourist visa already, and have no job to show for it. I've had one job interview and two job offers (no, I didn't miscount there), but they couldn't sponsor my work visa, so I couldn't take them. I figure that with needing (at least) a month to let a work visa process, I've got two weeks left to secure a job (if that). 

Every day I scour job sites like GaijinPot and the like, make calls, bang on doors, but it seems I'm no closer than when I started. Now that August is ending, the amount of new job openings posted gets smaller and smaller every day. 

I'm from the midwest of America -- I left for a reason. I don't want to go back anytime soon. Money isn't really a concern for me right now, as I saved up plenty before I came to Japan. I just need a work visa so I can avoid being deported.

1314867202.0,6,self.japanlife,k14pq,Planning to expatriate in t-3.5 months and looking for advice... can anyone help?,skier69,7,1,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/k14pq/planning_to_expatriate_in_t35_months_and_looking/,"So here's my story... if anyone has any advice or answers for me I would be very grateful. m(-_-)m

I've been planning to move permanently to japan since I was about 17, (so around 8 years) don't ask why. I've put a lot of time and effort into learning how to do this including reading everything on japanese culture (no culture shock the first time I went there!), how to get japanese visas and citizenship, and getting my BA in japanese language and culture. (now I'm between JLPT 2 and 1 level) I've had all sorts of people along the way doubt me and my abilities/dedication but I ignored them and pushed on.

I've finally got the chance to go there and will be shipping out around dec. 15; I have a job and homestay lined up at a NPO english conversation school run by a Tenrikyo woman I know and she has agreed to let me work there and stay for a year. I will be getting a working holiday visa and she has signed a guarantor form for me.

during my year there I'm planning to do some job hunting all around japan for a full time job, but I would prefer to get a job in nagano or the nagano area. I have my sights set on Ogasaka ski, which makes all its skis in japan. I think I'd be a good candidate because I ski/am a ski instructor, am/will be fluent in japanese and english (and speak french) and have worked at several factories.  

1) I do not have my jlpt 1kyuu yet, but am considering cramming and taking it in december before i leave. in any case i'll take it in august while in japan, but that will be probably too late to put on my resume for job hunting. without my 1kyuu would I be at a severe disadvantage in getting an office job, or is my BA a sufficient credential? do you think a company like ogasaka ski would consider me for some sort of ""foreign correspondent"" or *any* office position and sponsor me in the long term? I would definitely be a lowly OL if it meant I could stay in japan.

1b.) in case I can't find an office job, I'll definitely settle for teaching english in the meantime, either privately or at a school (middle/high school or cram school) how do I go about applying for this? I don't have any teaching certification, but I will have a year's worth of experience at two private schools (the conversation one and another non-NPO school, both part time jobs) and a BA from a canadian university. is that enough?

1c.) is it advantageous to write your resume and cover letter in japanese when applying to either job (english teacher or OL)

2) I heard that there are 3 income tax categories, and one is for people who will be in japan longer than 5 years, who are in the ""permanent residency"" category.. needless to say I plan to die there so hopefully that's longer than 5 years. how exactly should I go about applying for permanent residency? do i apply before or after 5 years?

(a side note, when my 1-year visa is up I plan to leave japan (either to korea or back to canada) for a very short period to apply for my work visa and then return... this is possible right? should I do this the day before my visa expires or weeks before so they can process my work visa or something?)

2b.) health insurance. do most employers have a plan? if not how do I get it as a foreigner? (I'll get travel insurance for my first year)

3) what should I do for housing in (assuming I get a job there) nagano? how did you find your housing and what were the obstacles in finding/renting/moving in?

I'm sorry if this is stupid/too long or if there are too many posts like this. I have so many questions swimming around in my head.

Where can I work?  I don't expect to make the same as I did in the U.S. but I would like to make a decent living until I learn Japanese.

What is the best way to learn Japanese?  I'm not in a rush (as the move is permanent) but soon is better than later.

Are there any American sports bars in Osaka?

Came here because I was studying Japanese and because I wanted to try my hand at surfing. I'd been skateboarding and snowboarding since I was just a tot and as I near 40 my knees are starting to feel the damage... so I chose a lower-impact alternative. 

So here's some links I have been using. Feel free to peruse and to add whatever you feel necessary/helpful. 

[Tide Forecast](http://www.tide-forecast.com/locations/Kasima-Ibaraki-Japan/tides/latest) - suppose you could use this for any location in the world, but here it is centered on my town.

[magicseaweed](http://magicseaweed.com/), again, mostly accurate all over the world, but I use it daily to read swell and wind charts. 

[Paiaka](http://paiaka.blogspot.com/) was a blog that my former co-worker did while he lived here (Ibaraki-Ken, Kashima-Shi). Really dedicated guy, surfed 365 days a year if he could. The blog is an archive of his daily early-morning shots of the beaches near his house, with maps to spots around our area.

[Facebook Japan Surfing Group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2607416120) - pretty self-explanatory.

[Murasaki Sports](http://www.murasaki.co.jp/) Is a (very overpriced) mall store much like Hot Topic or West 49 (in Canada) that I'd avoid but you can often find sales on out of season wetsuits and stuff. 

[Yahoo Auctions](http://auctions.yahoo.co.jp/) is a good place to buy NOS (new old stock) gear, used boards, etc. Most people will ship via 宅急便 Takkyuubin and you can pay COD. 

WonderRex - Formerly HARD-OFF - is a used shop that almost always has surfing gear. Currently the one near my house has 3 longboards and about 5 shorties, and there are usually 3x that in the spring and summer. No web link, sorry. Hard-Off used to have an official website, but they have since been bought out by (yes, you heard it, WonderGoo) so you have to go to the [WonderGoo] (http://www.wonder.co.jp/) website to access Wonder Rex for your area. 

That's all I can think of at this point. If you're in Ibaraki, look for a big pink guy in the lineup riding a ridiculous 9' board - that's me.

I recently changed jobs only to find that the position's scope was not as advertised and the project that motivated me to join is still awaiting budget approval, and delayed at least into next year.

So instead of leading the project I was hired to do, I've been asked to bide my time, doing some lower-level maintenance work on existing systems while waiting for the promised work to materialize.

It was a bit of bait-and-switch, though unintentional on their part. It was more a case of hiring too early in preparation for something that didn't materialize.

Doing the work I'm doing now, my skills and talents are going to waste, and the company isn't going to see much benefit from having me here and not working on the project they had wanted me to do.

So, I think we'll both be better off if I find something else more suitable, and I'm starting to look. I've found most of my previous positions by recommendations from friends and co-workers, but I'd like to widen the search a bit more.

Where's the best place to look these days? Any job search services or headhunters that someone can recommend? Job fairs?

Any pointers?

We got told recently that ""because it's now tied to visa renewal"" the company will be withholding city tax from our paychecks. The company worked it out with city hall - without even asking us about it, all that. 

I remember when I worked at one of the major eikaiwa, they OFFERED to withhold money for city tax, but if you wanted them to do so, you had to sign a paper acknowledging the request. My present employer has just outright decided they are going to do it and not even asked teachers if they would like it done. 

Granted, it's a hassle out of the way, etc. etc. but I can't help but feeling it's a little shifty. To be honest, I know more than a few teachers who left in the past few years without having paid their tax. Since the company probably sponsored their visas, doesn't their leaving make the company responsible for unpaid tax? If so, I am guessing that's what happened and now the company is pissed and doesn't want that to happen again. 

Whether it is right or wrong to leave without paying is not up for debate - I am just offering semi-relevant backstory. :)  

I just want to know if it is actually legal for the company to just outright decide what they are going to withhold and simply announce it, rather than ask if teachers want them to do it.

I'm Joël, 19 years old, male and currently living with my parents in the Netherlands. I very much want to go to Japan to live there for a year or longer but I need some good advice. I'm basically looking for the best way for me to get to Japan. I will birefly explain who I am and what my situation is and I'm hoping some of you guys can try to give me some advice.

I don't like to say it but I'm 'smart'. Ever since I was little school was no challenge for me and this lead to some major problems. By the end of high school I got depressed and felt disconnected from other teenagers and even from my friends. Because I really never had to do my best for anything I never learned to do my best and this led to some motivational problems I'm currently still dealing with. 

I graduated from high school two years ago and I also got a Cambridge English diploma. I started studying at a university but I just couldn't motivate myself to work for it. I quit and worked a bit for the rest of the school year. I started studying again this september but it's still not working out. I've been improving a lot over the past year but I've decided that I want to quit studying again and see what my options are for going to Japan. 

I've always done things because they we're expected off me by my parents or the society in general. I started studying because my parents and everyone around me always told me how smart I was and because it is just the normal thing to do here.

Now I've finally found something I really want to do because I want it myself. Going to Japan. Right now I'm basically looking for the best way I can get to Japan and actually do something there. I've been looking into studying Japanese in Japan and I've just now discovered [Go Go Nihon](http://gogonihon.com). They seem to have some good options but I'm wondering if there are any other possibilities.

I do not have a lot of money but I'm taking a job this week and I want to safe everything up for Japan. I've started studying Japanese a bit and am currently looking for classes in my neighbourhood.

* *Is it better to start studying at a university again and aim for something like an exchange year or a major in Japan*?
* *Is it possible to do any kind of wildlife or captive animal care in Japan like working for some animal park or a zoo*?

I'm basically stuck with all these questions which most likely do not have clear answers which is why I'm asking for some general advice. Maybe you can share your own experiences with me. Naturally I want to go as soon as possible. 

If you need any information or have any questions please ask. Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

Joël

Anyway, I'm full Asian: Japanese on my dad's side and Taiwanese on my mom's ([here, look!](http://i.imgur.com/tvONdju.jpg)). So, like the title asks, will I be perceived differently because of some social ""expectation"" that an English-speaker has to ""look"" like the prototypical English-speaking person? Is there a difference in the level of respect Asians or Caucasians (or any other race/ethnic group) get as English teachers?

And as for miscellaneous stuff:



Is my career/life plan way too simple? I.E. am I being too naive about how easy it's going to be? I do have teaching in Korea as a back-up plan (since I'm under the thinking that it's easier to get admitted there than it is to Japan through JET), but my passion really is with Japan (and I'm not sure the Korea thing is much of a back-up plan tbh). And I'm one of those people who can't study something he's not interested in/passionate about, so I can't just tack on another degree in something like business or computer sciences or whatever.  

_

And I am fortunate in that I have family in Japan who, though I'd rather not, could maybe help me financially if things got rough. So there's that... 

_

I also have a real knack for Japanese language. I don't know whether it's only because I've been learning the simple stuff up until this point, or 'cause it's genuine talent (lol), but it comes really easily to me. I also have the benefit of having a native-like accent (I spent all of my childhood summer vacations in Japan). Tone of voice, too, and other nuances I've also got! But can these actually be disadvantages when interviewing with JET (since they want ""fresh"" people who've never experienced Japan)?

_

And I don't really have any idea how extreme Japan is with appearance, but can piercing wounds (on my ears) be a problem? I used to have eleven going up the outer edge of ear at one point, and those scars are permanent. I'd imagine that it'd depend on the city/region/whatever, but maybe not?

_

And is there any miscellaneous info/tips you have for me regarding JET? Is teaching English as fun as I think it is?

For those who are curious, I uploaded a short voice recording to SoundCloud. Sorry for the shitty audio quality.

I'll get straight to the point. I have been contacted by Interac and have an interview with them on the 19th. In preparation for the interview I've been doing a lot of research on the company just to understand what to expect from them and what the full extent of my possible job responsibilities would be. However I've come across some information that is disconcerting about Interac.

Most of what I've found has been pretty polarizing. Some people seem to love the company and have had an overall good experience. Others seem to say that the company is horrible and exploitative. Additional research I've done seems to say that technically a dispatch company working with a local school is illegal due to the fact that there is a worker there who does not answer to the principal. The work in this case being the Interac employee.

I've also heard rumors of paychecks being mishandled and hidden fees cropping up, but I haven't found and solid proof of that.

Last month I was stupid enough to let it slide without too much of a fight (I did contact them through my guarantor company though), so they just deducted the amount automatically from my account as usual.

I just received a new bill for the same amount (15,120yen). So this time I actually researched stuff and found out that the Tokyo Gas rates for January 2011 are about 141 yen/m3 (+ basic fee 724 yen) [PDF source](http://www.tokyo-gas.co.jp/Press_e/20101129-01e.pdf). Assuming a similar basic fee, my usage rate works out to almost exactly 1800 yen/m3.

I contacted my guarantor company again but as they failed to spot the obvious scam last month I have no high hopes for this time either. They were supposed to contact me today but didn't.

Is calling my bank and revoking their auto-deduct access while we figure this out a good idea or would it somehow work against me? Can I actually even do that?

I would like to talk to my neighbors (who are all Japanese by the way) and compare bills.. but would it be too rude/personal?

FYI the company is not Tokyo Gas. I live in a mansion and this company handles the gas business in the mansion.

Advice?

**edit:**

As it turns out, it's not actually gas. It's 8 cubic meters of 60 celsius hot water. This building is a bit special in that instead of the standard on-demand gas burner (Japan norm), they have a huge hot water tank somewhere under the building. I still find it very difficult to believe that I used 8 tons of 60 degree water, and will follow the meter very closely from now on to make sure that it doesn't make dishonest jumps near the meter reading day. So far it looks like this month my usage will drop to less than half of the previous month's reading.

Anyway, I did the math (and had it checked). With the same hot water usage but with an on-demand gas burner - including the gas fees to heat 8m3 of water from 10 celsius to 60 celsius, basic gas fees, water fees and with extremely generous rounding to their benefit - my bill would have been roughly 7000 yen.

Your posts were relevant, you should not have been there in the first place. I will do my best to see to it that this won't happen again.

On a related note, it is a good idea to get [verified by email](http://reddit.com/verify?reason=submit) to dodge the reddit spam filter (you also get a cool award on your user page). To my knowledge this is not really advertised by the reddit admins.

Of all the plugs that my computer can plug into, it happens to be the one in the room that isn't grounded (i.e. only 2 prongs--no screw to attach the pigtail).

I have two options:  install a grounded plug (I own the place, so I don't mind making improvements), but I'm no electrician.  The other option is easier:  a GFCI plug or power strip that will internally trip if there's an issue where ground is needed.

(Unfortunately the easier option 3 of moving the computer or a really long extender from the grounded outlets won't work--at least for now).

Does anyone know where to find a GFCI adapter or power strip in Japan?  Or the proper term for it to search?

This is a pretty long story but I will do my best to explain myself. Please bare with me as I know some of these kinds of these things can get complicated.

So I applied for a work visa (to teach English) on May 21st, but the immigration office in Shinagawa told me they didn't think it would arrive before my tourist visa would expire on June 3rd. They told me on this day that it would be a matter of me leaving Japan and returning on a new tourist visa several days or a week later. I heard in my old topic that many people just choose to get their 90-day visa extended until they get the work visa. This is not an option for me as I am an American citizen and this service is not available to us for some reason. 

Sure enough, June 3rd was coming up quickly and I didn't receive the visa yet. I booked a flight to South Korea and at the airport leaving Narita the guy was quite confused and wasn't sure if I would actually be able to come back on a new tourist visa. (it seems he thought I had already applied for the Change of Status of Residence instead of only just the CoE, which means he thought all of my applications would be cancelled and was trying to tell me that I cannot leave Japan at this point.) 

So, I'm here in Seoul now just hanging out and travelling around for 6 days. On Thursday I will return to Japan, I have the paper that immigration gave me saying my CoE has been applied for and whatnot. What else should I have prepared and what might they want to see and ask me? Has anyone here had to do this before? Also, do I need to do anything at the embassy while I am here like in years past? 

The reason I'm semi-worried is because it seems this is a similar situation to what happened with the [""Gaijin gulag"" guy](http://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2012/01/japans-immigration-control), but we all remember the controversy about the validity of his articles. What he was apparently told by immigration is the same thing, that he would need to leave Japan and return on a new tourist visa. 

I would really appreciate the help. I'm sorry if it's a long story, but it is quite important so it would be cool if anyone has dealt with this in the past and can offer some advice. I'm sure this kind of thing happens all the time in Japan, I'm obviously not the first person to do this ever. It's just that like with many things dealing with immigration in Japan, it's not so clear-cut or well-explained in the first place.

I've been looking at houses in our town (Kashima, Ibaraki) and am pretty dead set on getting a detached house with at least some semblance of a yard in our next place. 

Thing is, my last 2 places were through a rental company. The 社長 of the company I was using (that I liked quite a bit) passed away, and I guess he sold his holdings to this company that is doing its best to corner the rental referrals market in our town... and they're the most inept, bumbling people I've ever dealt with.

Another friend recently got a tip from a Japanese friend about a house for rent and was granted a small house for less money than his current apartment, in a better neighborhood, with a small yard - and no key/thank you money. 

I also know that big rental sites like [賃貸 Chintai](http://www.chintai.net) and others let you search by 礼金なし・敷金なし and that is one route I'm thinking of taking.

But one thing I would really like to bypass is these companies altogether and just rent from some old couple who have an extra house. Which leads me to my question - is there such thing as a network that cuts out these middlemen altogether? Sounds like a pipe dream, but I'm imagining that there's a Craigslist-like website that helps landlords find renters. I'm probably imagining wrong, but it's worth checking. 

I have seen signs around my town (usually at the wrong time and/or in neighborhoods that aren't desirable for my wife and I) that advertise ""house for rent"" scrawled in graffiti-like writing to know that it's something that is done, perhaps not in any grand capacity however.

So... for the TL;DR crew, and with the understanding that my Japanese is at about N3 level...

1. Want to bypass the dipshit rental companies in my town
2. Would like to not pay 礼金・敷金
3. Would like to deal with only a single person or family face to face rather than go to an office
4. Would maybe just like to know how to say ""For rent by owner"" in natural Japanese to find if ""For rent by owner"" is enough of a phenom in Japan that I'd be able to google it for my own town.

Now, selecting options etc. with a Japanese salesman was scary to say the least, but I managed well enough and soon I had a man from NTT in my home installing a modem and handing me a box from SoftBank BB. In the end I had a modem from NTT and some sort of an WiFi Access Point (AP) from SoftBank BB. I disliked the AP since it was not very configurable so I simply by-passed (DMZ for the geeky among us) it into my own AP and was browsing away.

During the first months it annoyed me that I no longer could call home using VoIP from my cellphone over the WiFi. I had no idea as to why, the signal would get through but the actual voice traffic would be dropped. I blamed the application developers and called from my work instead.

When you sign up for a connection you need to sign up for all these stupid bonus programs, support and so on in order to receive a cheque of a couple of 万 (Man (10'000 JPY)), these programs were free for two months, then they would cost a significant amount of money for things I did not want. So I called SoftBank BB and wanted to cancel them. What shocked me was that they started asking me ""Are you using WiFi?"", it had never occurred to me that there was actually an option for that. I initially pondered if people just happily admitted to be using the WiFi and paid for it, for how could they control if I was using WiFi? I also found out that I was paying a monthly fee for that blasted AP and told them to cancel it, so that my service would only include what I actually wanted, an internet connection.

A couple of weeks later, my internet connection was dead. I pretty soon figured out that I had been cut off from the AP so I accessed it and navigated through the configuration interface. To my surprise I found that the WiFi option that I had previously had unchecked could not be enabled, instead you were faced by a message saying ""Please contact SoftBank BB to enable this option for your subscription"".

Now, at this point I was dead certain. What at first had looked like a pretty benign AP from SoftBank BB was in fact controlled by them remotely. They had shut down the login process which would require me to plug in and configure my other AP instead which was done in a jiffy. Personally, I became rather upset since it felt rather intrusive to have SoftBank BB controlling a device in my home. Also, the VoIP traffic got through all of the sudden, which made me even more upset.

So, to anyone else out there. Rid yourself of these pieces of crap and get a WiFi-AP from your local electronics store and free yourself from the monthly fees and this intrusion on your privacy.

tl;dr: WiFi Access Points from SoftBank BB are controlled remotely, so if you care about who controls what devices in your home, through it out.

Maybe it's just me who has this luck? I'd like to know if anyone else has had this problem meeting only weird foreigners in Japan? Also, if you want you can go ahead and tell me if you've got those weirdos in your Japanese classes in whatever country you're in.

While I was in the US and taking Japanese classes, my class was filled with those obsessed with anime and were 100% weeaboos. Constantly they'd bring up memes in real life, talk about anime, and their behavior  was just mind-boggling. They were grown ass people acting like little kids. Many of the guys indeed did have neckbeards and sported fedoras. Now, some were heavy, but I didn't care about that. The girls spoke in that high-pitched baby voice when speaking in English and Japanese...

Ugh, I just had to get that off my chest. I'm frustrated and just wish most people didn't act like that. I know I came off as a prick or a douche, and I apologize. I don't mean to offend anyone.

Ohashi has an English menu (though there were some food entries excluded on that menu) so I didn't read too closely, but eventually I realized I very much liked one of the sake selections that was listed as something like ""[Kikukoma](http://www.kikukoma.com/):  Rich and delicious cold sake.""

I know enough about sake to know that I don't know much, but it seemed to be a gentle, slightly more viscous, non-fruity and non-acidic sake.

I eventually learned that ""Kikukoma"" was the name of the company that makes the sake.  Alas, by then I was living six hours away instead of only one, and I never got back there to take a picture of the label on the bottle.

Now I live in the US again and I despair of opportunities to return.

I seek the data I need to special order this (a picture of the label would be favorite) I'd be very grateful.

I also think they make more than the four varieties their website lists, but I may just order all four of those if I can) or anything that pleased my palate as much as I think it did.

(Before any jumps in with ""Pipe Dream"", I've already worked across Europe and the US in the Games industry for several years).

So my questions are:

1: I'm from the UK, so I'm able to get a working Holiday Visa for a year, there appears, from what I've read, to be no limit on the hours worked, but I'd like to confirm this as I don't want to get in trouble from overworking (as its a working HOLIDAY, not a working...working...)

2:Working Visas, I know working visas are split into sections, entertainment, education etc. How easy is it, time and paperwork wise, to switch from Entertainment to education, as I imagine I'll likely have to survive on Eikaiwa whilst searching for game industry work.

3: Working Visa Sponsor, now I know I need a COE (Certificate of Eligability), but it doesn't appear as if I need to be sponsored by a company, and can instead have a good (and reliable) friend as a Guaranter. Am I correct in understanding this is all I need, as it sounds far too simple

General Info:
I speak Japanese generally well, however I don't have a JLPT Level, I'm sure if I took the test I could get level 4 or possibly 3, and still answer some questions that exist in levels 1 and 2 (my knowledge base is a tad random, some really advanced medical phrases in there for example).

Whilst I know I can apply for Jobs whilst still in the UK, not having a working Visa is a huge issue, most companies might be happy to hire me if I can start in 2 weeks, but not if they'll need to do all the paperwork from the beginning, wheras they're much more likely to hire someone if they only need to transfer the visa sponsorship information, thats a a lot less paperwork for them.

Most of the power transformer I find here are rated for inputs between 110 and 240, and seems like they are designed to convert from the North American system. I'm wondering if they can handle safely 100V as it seems to be standard in japan.

2) People from a country where electric power is 110-120 V : can you use safely a 110V-rated appliance on the japanese electrical system (besides the obvious cell phone, laptop and everything with an integrated transformer).

So I recently got a job close to Tokyo which starts in the beginning of September. I'm heading over early because my original plan was to look for a job there, however I lucked out and was offered one before leaving. I'll arrive on a tourist visa and switch over sometime after I'm there. I'm staying at a cheap hostel in Shinjuku so accommodation is taken care of until my job sets me up with an apartment.

I've already packed and gone through lists of what to bring. I've been to Japan twice before (for two weeks vacation and a semester abroad) so I have some experience. 

I think it's common to have a feeling like you're forgetting something, or haven't accounted for everything. I have copies of my resume for future job hunts, business cards, transcripts, diploma copies, medical records, prescription information, and I think that's about it. 

I'm not too sure what to do for a cell phone either. I won't have a work visa when I arrive so I'll need something in the interim. Anyone have any experience with [econnect](http://www.econnectjapan.com/products/sim/300k-microsim)? I have a Samsung Galaxy SIII (AT&amp;T model, the 747 iirc) and still need to look into getting that unlocked, however that doesn't seem to be a problem. This is probably my biggest concern at the moment. I just need something to text my friends over there and to be able to check e-mail while I'm out. Having internet access wouldn't hurt either so I could check hyperdia for train information.

I have some kind of allergy to cigarette smoke (eyes and top part of the nose burns, sneezing, hard to breathe, hard to see, eyes get teary; the effects start before I notice the smell). Before coming to Japan, I was in Canada (absolutely no smoking indoors in public locations), so I don't have experience with the kinds of situations here.

Most restaurants/bars/everything I have seen have full smoking seats (i.e. it is okay to smoke wherever), and most of those that have separated seating do not have any containment of the smoking area, meaning it doesn't make any difference.

The way I am dealing with it now is eating at university during the day, (smoking only allowed in ventilated enclosed rooms, usually one per building), and buying groceries at a non-smoking store and/or 7-eleven, and eating at a few restaurants (McDonalds and some other chains come to mind; occasionally, an individual restaurant too) that do not allow smoking.

I know that Japan does not ban smoking in public spaces, but, apart from avoiding most places, is there anything that can be done to widen where I can go? For example, is it acceptable to ask someone not to smoke if they are not with you?

I am hoping this would be useful to others as well, regardless of the reason why they don't want to be breathing other people's smoke.",,False,self,t5_2rg2o,1373215877.0,,,True,t3_1ht3ys,http://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/1ht3ys/regarding_smoking_in_public_places/,

My S/O and I are planning to move to Japan within the next year. We are both looking for jobs as we both have Bachelor's degrees, but most jobs that we feel would be best suited for us have been difficult to get an interview in with us being out of the country and all. I have done a bit of freelance work with a few Japanese companies that were hiring, but the projects I was temporarily hired on have fallen through.    
     
So, I'm thinking of going to Japan under a student visa and going to college again to learn Japanese as a second language. My question is: What will happen to my S/O? Will he have to get a dependent visa? Will he be able to work? I have looked into student visas and it looks like I would only be allowed a certain amount of hours to work- but what about him? I hope to switch my student visa into a work visa eventually. I hope getting a certificate in Japanese will only springboard my career there and will make my daily life easier.

We are very down to earth people and we have been doing an overwhelming amount of research for more than 4 years on what to expect. We know there will be ups and there will be downs. There will be culture shock, breakdowns, and times we get lost and stressed. We have done so many things to prepare ourselves. Most of our dinners are Japanese recipes, we use public transportation only and sometimes try to get lost and then un-lost, and we try to watch/read/listen to things we don't fully understand to get used to how to pick up the language. So, despite the many many warnings we get, we still plan on going. We both love being outside of our comfort zone and trying new things. We genuinely love the language, food, and culture. We love to walk for hours on end, to travel down streets we aren't familiar with.

To get right to the point; I want to make videos. But before I delve into the world of making videos (most likely for YouTube) I wanted to know what are the things people want to see. What are are things you would like to know more about or see more of? 


Some ideas I have include:

* A series on asking people of different ages what they remember about going to school in elementary, junior high school, and high school (and higher education, should it be applicable). 

* A series on life in the ""bed towns"" of Tokyo. I see many (lots) of videos on YouTube about the big life in the big cities so I thought it would bring some good contrast to what most people see in Japan. 

* A series on topics related to the current research activities of Professors and specialized researchers (I have the opportunity to start off in one specific field of research, and sorry, I am not willing to share which one just yet.)

* No way I can do this alone and keep it fresh but a number of parodies on things that irk me about Japanese television, all done in English. A good example would be the food shows with everyone undoubtedly saying an over-the-top version of ”うまっ！！マヂうまいッスよ！” or whatever variation you like. 


I have more ideas but before I do anything, I should probably see what people *want* to see not just what I can make. If you have any ideas that you feel comfortable to share, I would love to know what they are.

Background:

I will graduate with a 4-year uni degree in about 1 year. Upon graduation I 'plan on’ moving to Japan and becoming an English teacher ...monkey.. I currently work teaching conversational English at my university; in doing this, I have come to realize how valuable the ability to 'instantly translate' words/phrases is. I can imagine that having this ability (as well as map apps) will save my life in Japan ~ thus I will need a 'smart' phone with data.

Part2 of the story:

I am in dire need of a new phone, my current one is beginning to ""glitch-out"" (it's a 4-yr-old-dumb' phone). Optimally, I'd like to purchase a decent phone in the US and take it to Japan (I've read of the associated difficulties - and would go with an Iphone or Galaxy s3). Though I could just use a cheap phone for a year here and buy a cheap (""""less smart"""" phone) once in Japan, but I would prefer to get a high quality phone that I will be able to use for some time (meaning both places). - So I'd prefer not to do this..

Appreciate feedback. x-post /r/LearnJapanese,thinkingofjapan,1,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/ygwxz/27yr_old_wants_to_study_japanese_in_japan/,"Hi guys, I've been studying Japanese for 1 1/2 yr but still not enough. I've been thinking of my next move in life, and I've been exploring moving to Japan to work. I've got a couple of interviews because of my experience but all of them require me to have a decent amount of Japanese. Looking around I saw another option of studying in Japan for a year through gogonihon.com (I know there are others but this seems to be convenient). I'm from the Philippines, native English and Filipino, JLPT4 level.

5 years in a big IT comp in Singapore and my primary role is business development with startups and a bit of international experience. This does help a lot in getting those interviews but after that first interest, it usually dies out because they still require Japanese skills.

I want to get feedback from the experienced guys here on this type of decision. What do Japanese learners my age usually end up as? I'm not really keen on teaching English. I called the gogonihon guys and their usual customers are fresh out of HS (gap year) or out of university exploring other countries which makes my situation a bit different.
My questions are

* What do you think of this jump considering Japans economy? There are growing industries like GREE and DeNA which I've tried but still need Japanese skills. Rakuten is exciting with their Englishnization but the jobs are not fit for me. Startups expanding to Japan are exciting and there are a lot. I do have a number of contacts there too, but most of them do require Japanese skills.
* If I do make the jump I've computed the cost to be around 20k USD for a year, with spending money of 16K if I spend 3k yen a day. How much do part time people usually make and is 3kyen a day realistic? I've been to Japan three times for the past year and it's not really a good measure since I'm on holidays.
Any other tips or feedback you can give to somebody of similar situation?
Thanks a lot. I'm 2 months old in reddit but using a throwaway account.

The ANA ground staff is on the verge of tears. She tells me i have two minutes to decide: get on the plane or stay in Japan and sort it out. I ask the immigration officer about flying out and returning on a tourist visa to sort it out. He says I could try it, but then I'd need to void the last few days of my visa and hand back my gaijin card. Time's up. I decide to do that.

Now I'm in the US and need to know how to play it. Is it possible to arrange a new work visa in two weeks, which is the return date on my non-changeable ticket? Or should I fly back in on a tourist visa and sort it out then, which would require a wait in Japan and then an international visa run?

GF in Japan contacted immigration and they said I could reenter on a tourist visa. Company contacted immigration and they advised that I line up a visa in the US first. And will I even be able to get back in on a tourist visa, with a freshly voided work visa and many years of renewed work visas? 

Any thoughts or experiences?

The rationale for the dictionary (Casio XD-A10000) is grad school after I get back, but would it be a better use of my money to buy a simple one now and the pricey one later if the chance of theft/loss in Japan is too high?

There was an emergency while she was in HK and she had to make several local calls and send a bunch of Facebook messages. She knew she was data roaming, but wasn't able to keep track of how many 1KB packets were involved in the whole thing. The phone currently says that she has sent 235MB, but we don't know if that includes all data since her last billing or what. (I don't use Softbank, so I have no idea either.) In any case, it looks like she's going to be hit with a bill of nearly 482,000JPY, since overseas data roaming is 2,010JPY per 1MB. There's no way she'll have that much money by the time her next bill arrives.

I guess the question is this... Would Softbank somehow allow her to pay the bill off in installments, or is she boned? What can she do to lessen the damage?

Thanks for any advice you can provide.

Typed out by my mom, hence the non-metric measurements. Google can help you out with other systems.

6 eggs, separated
1 cup granulated sugar
1 pint table cream (18% milk fat)
1 pint whole milk (I usually just use 2%, though)
12 oz. good Canadian rye whiskey
2 - 3 oz. white rum
dash of nutmeg (optional)
 
Separate eggs. Beat egg whites until frothy. 

Gradually add 1/4 cup sugar to egg whites, and continue beating until soft peaks form.

Refrigerate beaten egg whites.

In a large bowl, beat egg yolks with 3/4 cup sugar. Beat yolks until they are lemon coloured and quite fluffy.

Add milk and cream to egg yolk mixture and blend together.

Add rye and 2 oz. of rum to egg, cream, milk mixture, and mix well. Taste. IF you can still distinguish the rye from the rum, add a little more rum. (The secret of this recipe is to blend the liquor so that neither is distinguishable. When we use Canadian Club Rye and Bacardi Rum, I seldom use more than 2 oz. of rum. You can use amber or dark rum, but you have to start tasting before adding all of the rum. Even a small amount of dark rum can quickly overpower the rye.)

BUT I am a good smoker and we all heard about the crazy laws about weed in Japan and I was wondering...is it really THAT bad?

I heard all kind of stories like people who go caught with less than a gram and got like 5 years of prison for it. Is it true or it's all rumors?

And if laws are really so strict...do people smoke weed anyway or it's a rare thing?

WTF?,,14,16,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/1gyagg/i_need_to_vent_a_friend_of_mine_has_had_close_to/,"I have been in Japan for awhile and I ""know the deal"" but in the past few months I am finding the whole thing annoying. More so I am finding some Japanese women's mentality annoying. Who knows, maybe it's jealousy on my part because women don't throw themselves at me but I doubt it. I do just fine with meeting women and I kind of have high standards but that's another story.

It's not only this one friend either but a few buddies of mine have just been bringing home girls left and right. It's gotten to the point where I'd rather hangout with Japanese friends because it feels ""normal"". Obviously they are on the prowl too but the nannpa is within the bounds of reason. 

Now, I have to be honest. I question whether or not I would be doing the same thing as my motteiru friends if I could. You see, I am not the typical looking foreigner so I don't get the same attention my tall-skinny white friends do. 

When we do go out for drinks and end up talking to girls, a majority of the time, the girls aren't really interested in me. It eventually becomes apparent they want to just talk to the tall white dudes while me and the Japanese guys give the ""Mata...?!"" look to each other and go on having our own fun. On the rare occasion there might be a girl who is into ""black music"", which is cool if I am in the mood to be objectified (which is pretty much never). And even rarer we meet a group of girls who sees us as people and treats us that way. This is the best scenario because we all just have fun. It's also nice to see one of our moteki friends crash an burn when their ""Hello, my name is ~. Let's go to back to my place."" pick up line doesn't work so well.

I don't know. It's just becoming predictable and boring. It's like we can't go out and chill without some girls creaming their pants at my friends. On one hand I want them to take advantage of the situation but on the other I just want to kick it with my homeboys. 

Sorry.

This project is about the xenophobia one might experience in Japan. The absence of something as familiar as a warm face in a crowd of people whom, by most means, are incredibly cautious of you is the essence of the shoot. The photos can be taken any time of the day, preferably on weekends. I'd love to have a small interview about your experiences, but it is not necessary. All in all, this will all take about one hour, if you can spare the time (Less if the interview is done through e-mail).

About Me:

I am an American-born Photography student living in Kanagawa. After coming to Japan, I witnessed this somewhat xenophobic behavior first hand when doing something as trivial as walking down the street or ordering food at a restaurant.
When walking, children and adults alike would stare and whisper ""Gaijin"" (among many other things) to each other, or on their phones.
I've heard stories of people approached by people asking if they can touch them. The reasoning being ""I've never seen a foreigner before""
When ordering food, one may speak in fluent Japanese, but only receive English responses.
I seek to document how we, being Gaikokujin; being real people, feel as a result. There is a certain feeling of isolation and racial tension that is tied to the word ""Gaijin"". Though there ARE perks to being labeled Gaijin, at its core the perks are simply because you are not, and possibly in our lifetime never will be, Japanese.

The shoot can be in the streets nearest your homestation, and I can come to you, if you prefer. If you have a bustling busy zone in your particular area not far from the station, I'd like to experience it or perhaps photograph you there. This is a volunteer position, so I can't compensate, I'm sorry.",,False,self,t5_2rg2o,False,,,True,t3_14jobi,http://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/14jobi/howdy_would_anyone_like_to_help_me_with_a_shoot/,

I also understand that most feature phones might come with a variety of actually useful features.

But why have smartphones been so slow to pick up in popularity in Japan?
I mean what's crazier than a phone with a TOUCHSCREEN? That's some futuristic shit. Especially 7 years ago.
And with the multitude of actually useful apps released across almost all major smartphones, why hasn't Japan jumped on these things?

I just don't get it.
