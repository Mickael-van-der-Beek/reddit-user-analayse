Will edit this post to include all words and phrases, and will include alternatives (Like, 'b-roll' and 'cutaway').

Could discuss with the mods setting up the wiki feature for this subreddit, would be much easier that way.

Starting:
***
**Importing:** *Taking all of your sources (Video clips, audio clips, picture files etc.) and getting them into the video editing software project. Most editing software does not copy the files to the project file, it merely links them together in the file directory.*

**Exporting:** *Taking the finished piece from the timeline/sequence, rendering it and then encoding it to a finished file.*
***
**Video clips:** *The video source files that you're using to cut together.*

**Footage:** *Derived from having feet of film, this is almost synonymous with 'video clips'.*
***
**Rough cut:** *A simple assembly of the clips available to get an idea of what the finished piece will be like. It doesn't need to be perfectly neat, it is only a 'draft' copy. It can be accompanied with placeholders, such as music that gives a feel but you're not allowed to broadcast, this must be changed before the final piece.*
***
**A-Roll**: *This is a rough cut that usually has soundbites, voice overs and sometimes music, but not covered by video yet. Helps timing and feel before editor invests time into b-roll.*

**B-Roll/cutaway**: *(noun) The alternate footage used to cut from the main shots (verb) adding these shots to your timeline.*
***
**J and L cuts:** *In a J-cut, the sound of the next scene precedes the picture, and in an L-cut, the picture changes but the audio continues.*
***
**2-pop/2-beep:** *In a countdown the 2-pop is when the first frame of the ""two"" is displayed simultaneously with 1 frame of 1K tone. Then the countdown goes to black for the remaining 1 sec and 29 frames (in NTSC non-drop frame) before the program material starts.*
***
**Letterboxing:** *Decreasing the number of used vertical pixel lines by adding black borders above and below the actual footage, thus creating a wider effective aspect ratio.*
***
**Submaster/Generics**: *A final version of your spot of your with graphics/text/legals removed. often submitted with the along master for spots going out for broadcast.  Will be used if the spot is ever going to be reused in the future/rebroadcast in a new market with updated legals/offers.*
***
**Handles**: *When sending an when rendering out a project to send to the next stage in the workflow, specifies the ammount of extra frames attached to a clip on either side of the actual footage used in the timeline (this allows for wiggle room if someone decides a shot needs to be extended a few frames and will save you from having to send new footage back to color). Standard length for handles in my experience unless otherwise specified is 48 frames for video (going to finishing or color) and 72 when going to audio mix.* 
***
**Offline**: *Editing workflow in which the footage is ingested and transcoded down to a smaller proxy size. This small footage is then used to cut until picture lock.* 

**Online:** *After picture is locked, the original full size footage is reconnected to the timeline and is used for the mastering process.*

*This process helps constrain file sizes and allows for faster working in the editing stage. It also appears to be becoming less common as computers become more capable of cutting with full size media.*
***
**Finishing**: *The stage at which all assets of a piece are brought together. Colored Online footage, gfx, and audio mix are all integrated and any final tweaks to the cut, gfx color, or audio are made. Your output from this stage will be your masters/submasters.* 
***
**Pipeline**: *A word to throw into discussions about workflow to make everything sound really complicated and intimidating.* 
***
**SOT - Sound on Tape:** *A term used for journalism or news-based scripts to indicate a cut away from an interview, usually lasting 5-20 seconds, usually accompanied by some kind of voice over (SOTVO).*

**VO - Voice Over:** *Announcer/anchor voice covered by video*

**NATVO:** *Natural sound on tape, followed by a VO.* 

**Natural Sound:** *Sound that is captured on the scene.  Could be the ambient sound of being in a forest, to an explosion, to cars on the road.*

**MOS:** *Without sound.*
***
**Pull-up:** *Tightening the interview dialogue, pulling out the ""um's"", and in general make it sound more natural and coherent.*
***
**Smash Cut:** *A jarring cut where you go from one scene to the next without any transition, with vastly different tension levels within the scenes.*
***
**Cut to clock:** *Making sure your show hits all the timing marks for the intended network, ie, acts are as long as they are supposed to be, graphics hit in windows when they are allowed to hit, black breaks are the determined length, etc.*
***
**Snap-ins:** *Content provided at the end of a show reel (ie, tape) for international versions of said show to hit their clock. Provided with a timecode insert point on original edit for reversion editors to drop them in.*
***
**WOO list:** *This may be Discovery specific, but it stands for Windows of Opportunity. This list is provided by the network once they have your final timings, and specifies blocks of time where your show must have no graphics in order to allow the network's crazy graphics space to advertise other shows. The WOO list is a slate added to the preroll slates, and it's often the job of the online conform editor to make sure that video space is clear. NB, the network will deliver pixel specs that need to be clear for the WOO list, but even though you obey them, they often bleed over, so unless it's a required subtitle, have nothing on the screen :P*
***
**Clean covers:** *At the end of your show (on tape or timeline, if you're exporting a digital file), you provide clean versions of bits of video covered by graphics.*
***
**Frankenbite/Frankenbiting/Franken-Grab/Jenna Jamesoning:** *The act of cutting up dialogue or interviews to make the person say something they never said. We do this a lot in reality.*
***
**Zazz/Sizzle/Pop:** *Usually added to a rough cut. Often at the suggestion of a producer/client, who has no idea how to go about adding it. The worse the footage, the more likely the editor will hear these terms. Also see,* **Making Shit Shine**.
***
**Hairy Armpit/Blue Boating:** *An intentionally inserted bad shot, to give the producer something to change, so they don't ask to change the good stuff.*
***
**Rendering:** *The time in which the software will composite the source files into a single file so that it can be played back at the correct framerate. In this time, you should relax, go on Reddit, YouTube and Vimeo.*
***
**Pillarboxing/Wings:** *Filling either side of footage with a narrower display aspect ratio than the presentation aspect ratio.*

**Letterboxing:** *Reverse of pillarboxing; filling top and bottom of footage.*
***
**BITC - Burned in time code:** *When the timecode of the edit/master is embedded as a view-able element in the media. usually for screening/review purposed. This is also known as timecode ""in a window"".*
***
**Videoscope:** *A set of diagnostic meters that visually relay colour and chroma information to the editor.*
***
**Fish Fryer/Degausser:** *A magnetization device for bulk wiping tape media. Degaussing also applies to removing unwanted magnetic fields in a CRT to decrease distortion.*
***
**3:2 pulldown:** *A method of displaying 24fps media at 30fps (29.97) by repeating fields in a 3:2 pattern.*
***
**Action safe:** *A region of the screen where things are sure to be visible on older CRT televisions.*

**Title safe:** *Similar to action safe, but slightly smaller and applies to titling.*
***
**Stem:** A separate audio output for a specific group of tracks - such as dialog only, or music only.
***
**M+E:** A music and effects only audio track commonly used for international delivery where a foreign language dialog track will be added.
***
**Mickey Rooney:** *Adding a little creep. ""Let's Mickey Rooney this shot to add some tension.""*
***
**Ingest:** *Digitizing video off tape into an editing suite like Avid or FCP.*
***
**Transcode:** *Converting a digital file to another digital file format. This usually involves audio and video compression.*
***
**Standards conversion:** *Converting between standards like PAL, NTSC, 1080p 25, 1080i 59.94, and 1080p 23.98.*
***
**Inverse Telecine:** *A way to remove 3:2 pulldown in order to return a 29.97 video to its original 23.98 or 24 fps format.*
***
**Frame banging:** *Finding two frames, which when alternated between rapidly look really funny. This is trademarked by me.*
***
**Radio edit/Stringout:** *In reality/doc/corporate video, to assemble a script with just the a-roll/interviews to see if it's working before roughing it out with b-roll, music, etc.*
***
**Jump Cut:** *A cut in which two sequential shots of the same subject are taken from camera positions that vary only slightly.*
***
**Match Cut:** *A cut in which action matched from one camera angle to the next.*
***
**Smash Cut:** *A technique where one scene abruptly cuts to another without transition, usually meant to startle the audience.*
***
**Countdown Leader:** *The leader with descending numbers at the beginning of films.  Also called an Academy Leader and SMPTE Universal Leader.*
***
**Aspect Ratio:** *The film/video frame's width-to-height relationship (e.g.: 16:9 or 4:3).*",,False,,t5_2qpkc,1369944250.0,,,True,t3_1f5e24,http://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/1f5e24/list_of_video_editing_terminology/,

Calling me burned out would be quite the understatement.  I take no joy in something I used to pour hundreds of hours of my own time into doing and that is the saddest thing of all. I managed to turn what was a highly enjoyable hobby into a career and now it's the thing I detest.  At this point I'd be happy to never touch another NLE, but editing is the only thing I know how to do professionally and the only ""real"" job I've ever held.

I'm just so tired of being treated like a tool, like an emotionless android expected to follow the directives and whims of those who have no idea what they're doing. They wipe their asses with my recommendations, even though I've shown time and time again that I know what I'm doing.  They blame me when their ideas fail and take credit for the highly praised projects, typically the product of those rare times I'm allowed creative freedom.

My somewhat decent salary is my prison, just high enough to allow my wife to stay home with the kids but preventing me from walking out in fear that I won't be able to support my family. Promotions and raises have been promised like a dangling carrot, but I've given up hope that they'll ever happen.  Editing positions in my industry at my pay scale are few and far between. Even with relocation being an option, I've been looking for years now. My biggest fear is that I'll look back in twenty years and have nothing of real substance to show for it, nothing that contributes to the advancement of us as a species.

I'm pretty sure I have depression but I question whether drugs and/or therapy will bring back the joy and veritable high I used to get finding the story in a mountain of footage.  

God this sounds so pathetic and that is so not who I am at my core.  I've always been the rock, providing the foundation for the structure that is my family... yet I feel like I'm being crushed and I don't know how to stop it. I can't fail them.",,False,,t5_2qpkc,False,,,True,t3_1keiku,http://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/1keiku/i_dont_think_i_can_do_this_anymore/,

1376258925.0,45,self.editors,1k61my,In addition to “The problem with our industry.”,agent42b,53,8,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/1k61my/in_addition_to_the_problem_with_our_industry/,"[The recent post was a very good one](http://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/1k18zy/the_problem_with_our_industry_and_most_other/), and highlighted some important points about the high-end industry versus, well, everything else.  I’m not going to counter that post, because I think it was pretty spot on, but I think it’s missing the perspective from someone on the other side of the fence.  I'll generalize with terms ""high end"" and ""low end"" industry, although I'm aware that it's richer than that.  

I work in the television industry, usually by definition meaning ""high end industry,"" on shows that average 2-6 million dollar budgets.  I’m not at the top of the post industry, and haven’t won any awards, but I’ve worked with several “big names,” and currently edit a prime time show that’s running it’s 10th season -- so I guess you could say I’m semi qualified to give a “problem with our industry” perspective from the other direction.  

It’s true:  there’s a swath of young adults who, for better or for worse, are cheapening the cost of editing.  But the real truth that there is no sudden cheapening of the industry;  it’s been going on since the 1930s, and at one point I, just like the newer generation, was at the forefront of grinding down the barriers to entry.  It’s that age old symptom where every generation think they’ve encountered a sudden urgency... but it’s the same “urgency” that every generation has faced, and it’s not actually that urgent after all.  

***“All in all these industries are just like the telecoms some of us work for, trying to hang on to dated ideals and concepts because they're more profitable instead of moving with the times and accepting certain things are worth less to the customer.”***

This is where the low end and high end industries start to take vastly different turns.  If you run your own video business, any special gains by cutting workflow processes, or making things faster, means more money in your own pocket.  The big difference is that in high-end industry... 

1) It’s NOT about the editor:  The majority of the high-end post industry does NOT exist to serve editors -- it is largely to serve the needs of all those around the editor:  people who don’t know how to use editing software but want to control it anyway.  Avid’s ‘money maker products’ aren’t Media Composer or even Symphony, they are Interplay and ISIS.  These products can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars when fully implemented, and yet what do they do?  They largely allow non-editors to interface with footage and edits, without having to sit next to an editor.  Yes, that’s how important it is!   

So, to the low end industry editor whizzing by on FCPX, peering into a high-end Avid workflow must seem bananas.  So much wasted time: logging, ingesting, transcoding, limited software specs, limited job descriptions, etc.  But at the end of the day the Avid workflow is democratizing the editing process onto the masses (the crew: story editors, producers, etc) -- kind of backwards to think of Avid doing such forward-thinking, isn’t it?


2) Competitive people like to work with other competitive people:  High-end industry is filled with type-A personalities in leadership positions.  They are competitive by nature, and respect editors who demand competitive rates (up until a point, of course).  They feel more comfortable working with competitive peers, and may even distrust you if you quote them too low.  


3) Editing in high-end industry is actually harder than it used to be, not easier, contrary to what’s happening at the low-end industry:  The technical demands can be staggering, and simply knowing the right equipment to use becomes a frequent “off the clock” research duty.  Digital cinema is driving up the cost of post production, more than making up for any savings on the software itself.  Ask any production house in the last 10 years:  are your costs going down because of cheaper computers and software?  Nope, they are sky rocketing because of RAW formats, reality television’s staggering shooting ratios, and desire to have everyone “on a server.”  Add into the mix that most broadcasters are giving less time to actually produce the content, and that means more physical bodies behind the keyboards as well.  The fact is that these post houses can’t hire the cheapest editor on the block.  Even for assistant editing duties, a lot of knowledge and experience is required.   

To conclude, both low and high end industry are going to continue to co-exist and remain relatively stable.  What distorts this picture is the constantly higher volume of novices joining the workforce.  It’s true that they will affect both sectors to a degree, but probably no more than the last 10 years, and then the decade before that.

I'm tired of sitting alone in a dark bay for hours and hours editing shows that I would never in a million years watch. It's become about the money for me, not about making things that I like. 

I feel like I need to do something else, but I don't know what to do or where to start. Maybe I need to go back to school.

",20_Eyes,34,3,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/196jsj/what_are_the_top_3_or_5_or_10_things_a_good_video/,"I'm relatively new to video editing. I was introduced to it in journalism school, and I've really started to run with it for the past year or so. Video's storytelling possibilities really blew me away, and I've done my own short projects, produced a lot of very simple videos for a news site, and done a couple of basic promo videos for nonprofits.

Although I was given a good intro to video editing through an outstanding professor, I'd like to go deeper. I've taught myself through trial and error, and being forced to learn on the job sometimes. I think I have a good handle on the basic principles and practices of producing a good web video, but I realize I probably have some pretty significant skill gaps. In your opinion, what are some of the most critical skills to concentrate on? Codecs, for example, are a mystery to me. Multi-camera editing is also something I feel like would be useful to master. 

To wrap up, I'd appreciate any guidance on what I should hone in on. In your experience, what are the foundation skills that you really consider essential? Thanks a bunch in advance.

*UPDATE*: Thanks for everyone's input, this helps a lot. Sounds like staying organized, and just putting in the hours (like with anything else) will be crucial. I'm also taking away the fact that developing a sense of pacing is important. Web journalism has to grab the viewer, keep them interested, and tell a story clearly. As a consequence, I'm always conscious of keeping the video punchy and coherent. It's even affected how I talk with friends now, I can't help but try to find that balance between telling the story fully, but also trying to keep the story tight and engaging.
I'd be interested to know more about the ""boring technical info"" that one poster mentioned. Codecs, file types, aspect ratios, are pretty unexplored terrain for me.

I upgraded to CC because of one key feature, the audio sync for multicamera edits. That's really the only major thing I cared about. Yeah there are some other cool features in the entire suite but the main reason was the audio sync. 

Over the last week or so I spent a ton of time creating sequences of multi-camera edits. Everything looked great, everything stayed in sync, I loved it. I was raving about how great it was to other editors. 

Then, I went to render the video. 

For those of you who don't know, there is a HUGE bug in Premiere CC. For some reason, the multicamera edits don't always work right. So about half way though the sequences, they just stop remembering what they were supposed to do. Every time it goes to a new shot, it restarts the clip from the head. The audio stays in sync, so that feature works. But the video is totally useless. 

I called Adobe. They know about the bug. They're going to release a patch ""within a few months."" 

CC is not backwards compatible with CS6. So, I have to re-do every single thing related to this project. NOTHING carries over. They had no sympathy for me. It was literally ""sorry, that's a known bug. We'll get it fixed."" I asked for a credit of some kind, they're gonna get back to me. 

I'm sorry for the rant, but you'd think they'd notify people of this, or disable the feature...afterall, it is a cloud. 

(by the way, if anyone knows a way to get CC files to open in CS6, I'll give you Reddit Gold if it works. I know there was a way to get CS5.5 to open in 5 and 4 by editing the project files in text editor or whatnot, but that doesn't seem to be the case with CC.)

I was one of the attendee at the last Reddit Entertainment Mixer. A great idea that went around at the end of the night was that we sign up for an email list with our specialties in hopes of gathering together to put our talents together and form a Reddit Film Production crew.

I am definitely all for it! To my recollection, nothing has been done about it thus far. Please, no one take offence to this, I am not trying to step on anyone's toes or accuse anyone of anything. I am merely stepping up and saying that I want something to happen and I am serious about putting my talents to use with the other amazingly talented and driven people of our niche group. I definitely met some awesome characters that night and overheard many great stories.

I am serious about this. I am willing to put all of my free time and talents on the line to see this thing through! I can edit/act/write/direct and I will use everything at my disposal to help build this group up.

I would much rather prefer to work with Redditors because that sense of humor and understanding is shared more so commonly us and we could very easily create new content in brainstorming sessions.

My vision for all of this is to not settle for some small time production. I believe that we could build up to having a legit run business that can stand on its own! Some of you have great connections to the entertainment industry that could help us produce, fund, get us in the room with executives. We can tackle this two fold, buy creating content and uploading it to our youtube channel and build a fan base, while also taking scripts and pilots to agents/producers/execs to help give us an edge to get our foot in.

To put this straight out, I'm just a kid that believes in something far bigger than settling for mediocre, I just have lots of crazy ideas that need to burst out of my head, and I know a lot of you do too. Judging my some of the posts and comments, we are in no short supply of wit and humor and insightful thoughts. All I have right now are my talents, ideas, and time, and drive. And I am looking for those few that are willing to put in their passion as well and see this through. It does take WORK, but no one says we can't make it fun as well.

I also know we need to come together as a group, share our ideas, agree and disagree on them collectively and respectfully as adults for things to work out, and I am all for that!

I have NO clue yet as to where this meet up will take place or when. I just wanted to throw this out here to see how many of you are serious enough to make this happen! Then we can proceed and schedule a fun meet and greet, nothing strict at first, and from there we get an email list with everyone’s talents listed so we can schedule the first real brainstorming sessions. I have a pilot for a tv show that I have in mind, but we need lots more content and ideas to see where we can take this.

So to end my rant, I know there is a HUGE potential here, and I for one want to see it manifest. We need writers, actors, camera men, singers, comedians, producers, directors, artists of all sorts, and Jewish people. The whole gambit!

Please let me know of any thoughts/concerns/late night drive by t-bagging stories and let’s make this happen!

I will also be submitting this same post and link to this meetup to several of Reddit's entertainment subreddits to see the responses.

Thank you all! Cheers

* Have you ever been asked to edit in a way that made something look better or worse than it really was?

* Have you ever edited in a way that altered the truth to make it look false, or vice versa?
* Did you have any personal objections to anything you have edited? And if so how did you deal with the situation?
* Are you told to edit in a way to portray things in a certain way as demanded by superiors and clients?
* Have you ever felt backlash by superiors or clients by editing something in a particular way?

I understand there frustrations, but I also feel that some need to realize a small but important truth.

**In today's world, it doesn't require much of anything to learn how to edit video.**

I will say from the beginning that editing requires more than knowing you to use the software and equipment, it requires a creative personality and a serious interest. These are things that cannot be taught, so it doesn't mean *anyone* can become an editor. But those who have those personality traits can do so much easier than ever before. This is something I said in my comments, but everyone seemed to ignore that just to jump on me about saying editing is easy.

So what does that mean for the industry? Well, all of you who complain about people taking cheap jobs need to accept that these new-to-the-industry editors spent a whole lot less time and money to learn the same basic skill set you have, so they charge less. If you're still working on projects that newcomers can get a hold of, you need to find a way to sell your skills. If clients can't be sold on your skills over the newcomer, then you'll have to lower your rates, or lose lots of business.

I work in a small Midwest area where this industry is extremely small, and the need for high end video production is small if not non-existent. I accept that I cannot charge as much for my skill set as I could in other areas because of this. If I had the mindset of some of the editors I have spoken to about pricing and what skills are worth, I'd be out of business because there's no demand for a skill set like mine unless the price is low.

Even in areas where the industry is big, the threat of newcomers lowering rates is still high, especially for the self employed. The advantage is that with the need for higher quality work, as long as someone is good at selling there skill set, the threat becomes much smaller.

This problem is the same in every creative industry. Graphic design, Photography, anything you can think of that at one time was only expensive because the equipment and schooling was expensive is now something that is much easier to learn and to do.

And I'll say it again, all of the industries I've mentioned require the right personality and interest. But the total investment of time and money to learn the skills to do these jobs is much much less than it used to be, which is going to affect what the skill is really worth. None of these industries are ever going to turn into minimum wage burger flipping jobs, but they're not always going to be what they are now.

Another issue that I've seen in all of these creative digital industries is the lack of communication between professionals and people who are starting out. Newcomers are usually bullied into thinking they don't have the skills to do the job, even though they've only just begun. People are reluctant to share there rates, equipment, and workflow with people they don't know because they're afraid of someone charging less than them. In the end others charge less because no one in the industry will honestly tell them what they are worth.

All in all these industries are just like the telecoms some of us work for, trying to hang on to dated ideals and concepts because they're more profitable instead of moving with the times and accepting certain things are worth less to the customer.

I know many of you will be upset by this post, but it's just an honest truth. Times have changed and it something we all need to accept and find out how to work with it. The only thing that will never change in this industry is that to be an editor requires a creative passion to tell stories, and that is something you can never buy from the store, or learn from a YouTube video.",,False,,t5_2qpkc,False,,,True,t3_1k18zy,http://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/1k18zy/the_problem_with_our_industry_and_most_other/,

I've been dabbling with Premier for bit but I see so many want ads for Avid editors that it makes me think that it's the only way to go. I'm not thrilled with the prospect of learning it and I know it's just a different flavor of NLE. But any feedback is very much welcome. Thanks in advance.

Well, she just sent me an email, and told me she has 2 options, one person that works with Final Cut, and another with Premiere. And that an mp4 (quoting) both compressed and uncompressed will suffice.

And here I am, facepalming that I said no to doing the coloring myself, because I'm not confident I can work with SpeedGrade CS6, and thinking After Effects might kill my computer. Is this common practice, working off of FC or PP? Are there some wizard plug-ins other than Magic Bullet that colorists are using? Because it doesn't sound too professional to me.

Am I going about this correctly? Or is there a hidden reason I am just not seeing for me to stay on Mac?

I last reached out to you in December about our website, and wanted to see if you think we've made some good progress.  

We've done some studies that show &gt;20% time savings on the process of generating and collecting feedback, and have built out some great tools to help you manage your projects even more effectively.

**Updates**

- We now support marker export into AVID, Final Cut 7 &amp; X, and Adobe Premier.  That means you can take the markers from your clients/collaborators and export them directly into your editing software.
- Vastly improved interface for managing projects - invite viewers with a customizable e-mail
- HTTPS encryption 
- Password protection on viewing rooms
- Review comments and assign edits to specific editors in your project
- Upload videos to Dropbox (we already support YT, Vimeo, BrightCove)

For anyone who doesn't know about us:

First Cut Pro is a Workflow management tool for video Post-Production.  We simplify the process of collecting feedback from video stakholders, help you manage that feedback, and then export that information directly into your editing software.

If you have any questions, send me an e-mail (scott@firstcutpro.com) or sign-up for a free account and I can help get you more familiar with our product.

1351792280.0,18,self.editors,12guux,How to restore videos trimmed in QT Pro...,urbanplowboy,18,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/12guux/how_to_restore_videos_trimmed_in_qt_pro/,"So, I finally figured this out (with no help at all from the internet... ) and thought I’d share the info in case you ever have this come up.

As you probably know, you can trim videos in Quicktime by adding In and Out points and performing a Trim to Selection command. After doing this, you can either Save As... which will create a new copy, or Save... which will overwrite your original.

If you’ve ever noticed, when you overwrite the original file with a trimmed file the file size doesn’t change, though, which led me to believe that the complete video information is still there, it’s just flagged off by the QT metadata somehow. Knowing that, I thought there must be a way to restore that information even after the file is saved and the Undo option is no longer available in QT, which could be useful if you saved by accident and did not mean to overwrite the file, or just need to restore it for some other reason.

So I searched around and found that there is a way to “unlock” that trimmed content. Well, at least this worked for me. Here is what I did:

1. First, this method includes editing the hex data (the actual 1s and 0s) of the file, so any minor mistake will render the file useless. Therefore, make a copy of the file you want to work on and keep it tucked away somewhere in case the file you’re working on gets compromised.
2. Download an app called Hex Fiend (sorry, this app is OSX only, but I’m sure there’s a Windows equivalent out there). It’s free and can be found here: http://ridiculousfish.com/hexfiend/
3. After downloading, open the Hex Fiend app. Go to File&gt;Open File... and choose the video file you want to restore. Once opened, you’ll see a bunch of text show up in the Hex Fiend window. Do not click on or change any of this data as this is the actual code for the video and it’s kind of important.
4. On the keyboard press Command+F to open the Find and Replace tool. Make sure the Text option is selected on the left. In the Find field type “free” (without the quotes). In the Replace field type “moov” (without the quotes).
5. Click Replace All. This will scan the code and replace every instance of “free” with “moov” which should remove all the previous trim commands using various combinations of wizardry and vacuum tubes.
6. After the scanning has completed, go to File&gt;Save... You can also perform a Save As... if you don’t want to overwrite your file. Once saved, the complete untrimmed content of your original video should play back in QT.

This should work even in the file has been trimmed and overwritten multiple times.

This worked for me and I hope if works for you if you should ever need it.",,False,,t5_2qpkc,False,,,True,t3_12guux,http://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/12guux/how_to_restore_videos_trimmed_in_qt_pro/,

TL;DR: Does anyone have any links or mind explaining the basics of transcoding.

I have a great passion for editing and enjoy doing it. My problem is, while i have a basic-novice understanding of editing, I lack an understanding of digital video particularly in transcoding. Learning more about this and what I would guess would be more of an Assistant Editors job to me will help me along with my skills and really I just like learning and understanding how everything work. So, looking for how to transcode but also why do we transcode and how digital video works (progression vs interlacing kind of topics).

Any help would be great, thanks.

There are 20 clips that range from 30 seconds to 3 minutes.

My problem is that I cant seem to get the 3 minute clip lower than 21mb.

I have just been directly exporting these clips from FCP 7 (where the file size for the 3 minute clips is 837.9mb) and then exporting them as .flvs in Quicktime Pro.

My FCP sequence is 1024 x 576, square pixel, and the compressor is Apple Pro Res LT.

In quicktime I'm exporting .flvs with the settings: 480 x 270, On2 VP6, Max data rate 412, 48 kbps (mono) audio.

If I lower the data rate any more it becomes unwatchable and I can't make the dimensions any smaller. 

I think that getting a 837mb video to 21mb while still being watchable is a pretty damn good effort. I am literally at my wits end and I can't see how I can get it any smaller. If these cunts tell me ""there must be a way to make it smaller"" one more time, I am going to quit and break everything as I leave.

Someone in this endless chain of emails suggested I output as .avi and use 3rd party software to convert it. Is this actually a viable solution? Or is this person retarded...

Need some career advice. I've been an assistant editor for about a year and before that I was a digitizer/media manager for a reality company, also for a year. 

As I'm going from company to company on a ""perma-lance"" basis, I find the transition into an AE role in a new company to be a very bumpy ride. **As a self critique, I'm finding that I'm not great at applying my skills: syncing, grouping, etc., to new projects.** I lean too heavily on the workflows that I learned on other shows and try to apply them to anything new that I start up. I've found that workflows don't translate well, and I'm often struggling to get my head above water on these new projects. I'm told that workflows should be devised by the coordinators, but in my last two jobs, I wasn't given any direction other than just ""well you know how to group, right? do it your way."" I'm under the impression that workflows need to be specifically devised to the project and shooting requirements. It's difficult to ""just do it my way"" if my way was specifically tailored to a completely different show. Incidenally, I learned to group on a show, where one of the lead AEs specifically sat down with me and the other AEs on the show and gave us a lengthy tutorial. 

So my questions are:

* **Am I shitty AE? Be honest, I can take it.** I've been struggling to get back on my feet ever since I life my ""first"" job on a show that I'll absolutely admit was pretty easy because it was only shot one-cam. I'm wrestling with the idea of transitioning to another role in production because of these experiences. 

and the second:

* In the esteemed opinion of the reddit/r/editor community, what concepts and which corresponding workflows should I have absolutely down pat, 100%, crack shot, as I move from company to company? In other words, how do I become a **bulletproof AE?**

So sometime next year I plan on building a computer for my own editing suite. I know if I had all the money in the world, I could build the perfect computer... but thats just not happening.

Was wondering if I could have some advice. What do you guys think if mandatory for a complete editing suite, and where should I pay the extra cash/ where can I save it?

The screens are very important to me, Im used to using a top of the line editing suit, so what screens out there have you had the best experience with?

---

Besides my main editing gig, I shoot on the side for this guy. He asked me if I wanted to edit this project for him since he was swamped. It's one 22 min episode, and it seemed fairly straightforward, so I agreed to do it. He said he already had half the project set up, so I figured it'd be easy to take over. 

Unfortunately, I agreed to do this before I had a look at the project (my fault). Now I'm stuck here working on this project with zero bin structure, no synced sequences, and no script other than a rough outline (titles of the 13 segments). 

On top of that, instead of taking any log notes in FCP, the log notes are in a separate Word document that is a running log of everything shot on that trip, not just for that episode. It's 191 pages long. Why this wasn't logged in the spaces provided in the NLE is beyond me. I've also been told to maintain the current organizational structure... but now I'm like, ""what structure?""

I've already been paid, so there's no backing out, so looks like I'm just gonna have to power through it. All in all, it's my fault, though for agreeing to do it.

Lesson learned: don't commit to a project without thoroughly thinking it through.

&gt;Magnetic signals recorded on a hard disk are designed to be refreshed periodically. If your hard disks stay on, this happens automatically. However, if you store your projects to a removable hard drive, then store that hard drive on a shelf, unattached to a computer, those magnetic signals will fade over time… essentially, evaporating.

&gt;According to what I’ve been told, the life-span of a magnetic signal on a hard disk is between a year and a year and a half. The issue is complex, as you’ll see, but this is a MUCH shorter shelf-life than I was expecting. 

&gt;The way to keep the files on your hard disks safe is to connect the hard drive to your computer every six months or so and, ideally, copy all the files from one drive to another. Failing that, use a program like Micromat’s TechTool Pro, or ProSoft’s Drive Genius, to do a complete scan of your hard drive. Doing so will replenish any magnetic signals that are starting to fade.

Is this still a concern? My cursory research suggests that this remains a recommended practice.

Where can I learn more about editing theory? how to effect pace? how to create suspense? how to make something exciting? 

Why would you use a GV, what sort of editing styles suit what type of genre/need for the time? 

Like is there something like, if you need to get someone interested in the next segment, and you show a quick refresh (like a previously in...), is there a type of style that suits that better?

These are videos with live performances of public domain compositions.  I just disputed a claim of a piece composed by Bach.  The guy has been dead for over 250 years.  All his music is in the public domain by a century or two.  (Yes, you can copyright your performance of this piece, but you can't claim ownership on the composition, or claim ownership over my performance).

I've also had a couple claims on videos that contain music loops from Apple.  These are the campy loops that come with SoundTrack Pro when you purchase Final Cut Studio.  Apple [says](http://www.apple.com/legal/sla/soundtrack.html) users can use this music in nearly any shape or manner (ie you can't re-sell the loops as a package on their own, but feel free to use the campy music in a Hollywood movie).

WTF?  Who are these people claiming ownership on public domain compositions &amp; royalty free music?  Why do I have to spend my time fighting these?

Today, as calmly as I could, let him know he was behind and by how much. How I needed some stability in my pay, etc etc. He has said many times that he will do this or do that to help accommodate me. But usually it ends up falling flat.

I have come in on a feature as DIT for a bit, after doing a fairly large amount of 'data wrangling' and generally looking after footage on set occasionally over the past couple of years.

So far I am not instigating or setting up the workflow as it's been either simple (SxS) or more advanced where someone has already set the camera up with the settings appropriate for the job.

I want to push on with this as it's a great supplementary income source, but I want to take it to the next level, and there are always 'gotchas' that I don't want to fuck up without realising. For instance, false clips on the Red Epic are scary if the next clip is a new slate, as I don't know if there was a shot before that which is corrupt, or if it is just a false clip. I know the issue now and can take steps to check things but this is a good example of those little things that I know I will figure out with more experience, but it wouldn't hurt to learn as much as I can about it.

On this current job I am backing up (with checksums) to 2 drives vie eSata over thunderbolt, working with R3D and checking the image for exposure issues and generally flagging things up to the DOP. I am then backing up to a shuttle drive every other day to send the rushes to the post house. I am also generating checksum reports from the backup software (YoYotta ID) and metadata reports for each card to send on for post.

It seems that there is more to it than this in terms of working out the workflow beforehand with RED, which I would love some tips on so I can approach this with more confidence. I would also love to get more into the Arri/Codex workflow which I have not worked with.

Any resources or general breakdowns other DITs may have would be really helpful, if anyone has suggestions.

increases? Insisting on the same rate at 8 hours? Something else?

Whether they ""forgot"" or made a mistake, I do not think I should be the one who pays for it. They were looking to hire in a hurry b/c their last AE, according to them, just could not do the work.

Also, note that on all my new hire forms I filled out the information in accordance with my belief that I was working 8 hours for the rate we agreed to.

I'd really like to keep doing this work but this has really left a sour taste in my mouth. 

What do you guys think?

I am currently working with a very hard-to-please director who also just happens to be a close personal friend. (How many editor-problems and hurt feelings start along these lines?) This director happens to have a tendency for slave-driving; normally I would have no problem with this because I see this tendency as an offshoot of his strict work-ethic and in that regard we understand each other.

However, I am working with C-grade footage and trying to fit it into his A+ aesthetic. He has a lack of self-awareness when it comes to his weaknesses as a director and as such often asks for unreasonable, impossible to provide cuts. It's driving me crazy! And planting a seed of dissatisfaction in our working relationship and friendship (on my end---he seems oblivious.)

I just wanted to vent and I figured some of you guys may be going through something similar. Feel free to share here!

We're going to address some questions that may come up below:

**Q: What are bitcoins?**

**A:**  _[Bitcoin](http://www.weusecoins.com/)  is new online money that's open-source, decentralized, and potentially anonymous. This is the local currency of the internet. You can exchange it for your own country's local currency, or you can spend it directly on sites that natively accept it. At the time of writing, a bitcoin is worth about [$47](http://preev.com/)._

**Q: What good are they?**

**A:** _Bitcoins can be used as an [investment](https://mtgox.com/), [barter currency](http://www.reddit.com/r/bitmarket), to [purchase products](https://www.bitspend.net/index.html) (Wordpress, Reddit, 4chan, Wikileaks, and many others accept bitcoins natively), or just to convert to regular currency._

**Q: How do I tip bitcoins? How do I receive my tip?**

**A:** _[Check out this handy infographic](http://imgur.com/kvGk6). Once you've got that down, you can check out the [bitcointipbot documentation](http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcointip/comments/13iykn/bitcointipdocumentation/) for more detail._

_If you want to make the process even easier, you can install the [Bitcointip User Script](http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcointip/comments/14pfp3/_greasemonkeyuserscriptforbitcointip) which lets you easily tip without having to type out the bitcointip syntax. It also displays your bitcointip balance, so you can easily see if you have enough funds before tipping._

**Q:** _TL;DR?_

**A:** [Bitcoins](/r/Bitcoin) are internet currency. If you have bitcoins, you can tip them to people in /r/editors by commenting ""+bitcointip Username Amount"" provided you have set up [your account](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=bitcointip&amp;subject=Sign%20Up&amp;message=SIGN%20UP).

Please bear with me, I'm not fluent in the lingo.

My son is a junior in high school and recently expressed interest in going to college for some kind of major or concentration in editing videos. He's not exactly clear on the whole college thing yet, nor is he too far along in that process. I'm a boring finance guy who knows nothing about editing, but I'm trying to meet him halfway on this. Normally I'd be inclined to steer him away from a liberal arts major, but I the fact that at least this would primarily involve him working on a computer. After I prodded him a little, he showed me some videos he and his friends made in their free time. His brother has been (behind my back) buying him software and equipment to edit high-quality videos and I have to admit, I came away kind of impressed with what he's been able to do so far.

Like I said, I don't have much knowledge on this subject.

Pretty straight forward question from a film student (who isn't getting many answers at uni about editing software):
  
Firstly, I'm aware that there's a million different cameras and a million different codecs that they record with, but I don't quite understand why or in what form my footage should be encoded in to maximse quality during post-production (one moves through so many pieces of software). Typically at my uni, we'll shoot basic footage on -say- an EX3, encoded in some form of 'mpeg2' compression and then simply select 'HDV 1080p' in final cut and plod our way through editing and colour and export as a .mov file. Nothing fancy at all.  
  
My recently realised concern is that I have no idea what is happening and how my footage is changing when I run it though Final Cut, PremPro or AVID. At some point (when I start to work with better camera systems) I'll need to be savvy with what Alexas, REDs and CineAltas record and how to maintain their output quality all the way through post. What do you work with and what works best for you? What do the pros work with?

Here's some initial thoughts:  
-we're currently working on pretty stock standard 2010-11 mac workstations. They'd sooner explode than deal with raw 2K or 3.5K etc..  
-I have read about apple Prores and DNxHD codec what I believe is some kind of intermediate codec for use in most NLEs, but I don't know if what you export is precisely the same as the RAW data you capture from your camera system. Are you actually changing your footage to an ""equally as  uncompressed"" codec when you work in these computer-based formats?  
-seeing as though the expense is quite inhibiting, the university will probably move to DSLR cameras after the manufacturers work out some of the major remaining kinks. Do you treat lower end footage (i.e.: not R3D or ARRIRAW etc.) differently than larger, more detailed compression standards? Do you convert to a high quality ProRes format after shooting with Canon in lower quality h.264? 

Thanks guys! Getting to know the back end is producing more and more questions for me.",,False,,t5_2qpkc,False,,,True,t3_r9yhg,http://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/r9yhg/what_sort_of_compression_do_you_use_for_video/,

There's not really a good way of asking this question without giving you all the details so hear goes:

My client shoots their own talking head interviews for their website. Currently they shoot them on HDV but in the future they'll be moving to XDCAM. For the most part, everything they do is intended for a web-based outlet, but they want to leave open the possibility of broadcast outlets using their footage. All of their footage has to be shipped out of house to freelance editors, and they have *lots* of footage and will only continue growing their library. For practicality reasons, we need to keep the footage as high quality as we can, but as low a file size as we can.

Against all my previous experience as a video editor, I'm leaning towards having them encode everything at a higher bitrate H264, something like 10Mbps or 15Mbps for 1080p 29.97 video, and attempting to edit that format natively and then export back to H264 at the same bitrate which they will used as an archive file.

I know H264 is historically a delivery format and not intended or optimized for direct editing. I do believe that a higher bitrate H264 would be able to maintain all reasonable *visual* quality of the clips, but I am concerned about how editing software will behave when working with these clips and the latitude that we'll have when working on them. However, these clips are mostly talking heads and will not require extensive color correction or complex editing beyond straight cuts and dissolves for the most part.

On a scale of 1-10, how bad is this idea of an all H264 workflow?

Also, I've been told that Premiere handles H264 well (I've been using FCP for years). Is this true?

Anyways, I'm having some trouble with the footage our ""videographer"" is producing and expecting me to edit. Namely, none of it is organized or, for that matter, very good. He will shoot 20 minute videos (the max time his camera will allow per single shot) and provide me with no script, no description of what each shot entails, etc. I find myself watching 20 minutes of video to find about 20 seconds of usable footage, and then having no idea what exactly to do with what I do have. He doesn't allow for enough time between takes, doesn't direct the people he's interviewing or filming to speak slowly and clearly, and frequently thinks that one take is enough, even if the subject slurred his way through the line.  

As professional editors, I am curious as to where you draw the line and just say ""I'm sorry, but you didn't provide me with much usable video/audio and I really can't do anything with this."" Also, I'm wondering if it's too much to expect this guy to cut up scenes into shots/ask him to provide me with a list of shots, and a general notation about which shots were usable/unusable?

Now, I'm looking into relocating to a new city and am in the process of putting all my credential together for finding new work. A friend of mine who's trying to refer me to a company in that city asked me to put together an editor reel for him to pass on. 

I can't really understand the function of an editor reel and amy trying to wrap my head around the best way to make and use it. For something like camerawork, I get how to construct a reel: show your technical prowess and compositional abilities as well as demonstrate the type of work you produce. Now, most of my work in my current city is editing, and when I'm meeting with a new client or auditioning for a new post, I just show them one of my pieces.  For editing, how do you format a reel to best show your work? 

 The bulk of what I do, and what I'm aiming to do in this new city, is reality tv editing. What marks a good editor in this genre usually comes from how well they draw out episode-long arcs in the footage and create a layered story. How do you do that in a 2 minute reel? Yes, I have done my fare share of montages and pulling off a powerful 30 second tv spot is certainly difficult in and of itself, but how do you showcase editing skill and experience in regards elements like story construction or narrative arcs? I imagine anyone who works with documentaries also deals with this. Any tips?

I realize I likely could just show someone an episode I cut, but I'd hate to miss out on work because that seems to long to watch.

I use all of the typical shortcuts (add edit, close gap, next edit, fast forward - reverse, etc.) - but I still find myself gravitating to the mouse. What sort of methodology do you guys recommend so I can become more of a ""mouse-less"" editor? Does anyone have any reading or tutorials online that they recommend regarding this specific topic? What are the steps you use in particular for different editing functions that you find to be the best method?

P.S. - I guess I'm generally talking about FCP (which includes Premiere, since their keyboard combines are the same for me). 

P.S.S. I have a WACOM tablet and I've seen a lot of editors use that. I have no understanding how this is helpful at all, but if anyone were to explain how it would work as a better editing tool (or maybe provide a reading link and/or video?), that would be grand.

1317519278.0,11,self.editors,kxzaa,3 things that Adobe needs to copy from Avid,agent42b,12,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/kxzaa/3_things_that_adobe_needs_to_copy_from_avid/,"(disclaimer - this is just a personal opinion rant, so feel free to disagree or share your take on it):

With the recent purchases and partnerships with automatic duck, it seems obvious that Adobe is hell bent on capitalizing on Apple's FCPX blunder.

In my circles of television, however, Avid is eating up the gap that FCP7 has left. Don't get me wrong - I like Avid. But I'm not too happy about a future where Avid once again enjoys a huge lead in the professional market. I want healthy competition. It's ironic because I feel that Premiere Pro is finally entering an era where it truly has some edge.

I'm going to present some of the features (which are strictly opinion) that keep producers and editors running back to Avid, no matter what new bling Adobe throws into the next build of Premiere. There's a few baseline features that somehow got left behind and it's time they got some attention:

1) A Native Codec

Adobe prides itself on being ""native everything"" and probably spends a lot of time fine tuning this aspect of their software. However, what about graphic files? Animation? Stuff that's rendered on a computer and not shot on a camera? What if studios want all of their finished edits in 1 codec, ensuring future compatibility and consistency? Apple has ProRes. Avid has DNxHD. Hell, even Grassvalley Edius has HQX. Adobe has? Maybe they should have also bought cineform before it was bought by GoPro.

2) A Better Timecode Generator

Television and Film productions need something much better than Adobe's current timecode generator. What if you're editing in 23.98p (non-drop timecode), but need to see the 29.97 drop-frame timecode equivalent? Premiere can't do it, and it's annoying as hell. Avid's timecode generator not only allows you to see the equivalent timecode of multiple formats at the same time, it can also display things such as the filename of what's on screen (or the audio filename of what's being heard), and even the source timecode of that file too.

3) A ""Secure Mode"" of media management

Avid is trusted for large projects because everything, and that means everything, is always copied into the AvidMediaFiles/MXF folder (AMA exempted). Files are even automatically renamed to avoid collisions. Large productions don't care so much for complex folder structures of their media. They just want know it's there. Avid does that. Premiere's flexibility with media is actually a disadvantage here, allowing too much diversion which stagnates a complex post-production workflow. Premiere should come with a such an option and, when turned on, every imported file is actually duplicated and placed into a designated folder, ensuring that every piece of media is always contained in that folder. No straggler files needed here!

In conclusion, Avid isn't resting much either. They are undergoing aggressive beta testing of Media Composer 6 (their first 64bit rewrite) which is bound to once again make Premiere a less favorable option. If Adobe wants to truly capitalize on FCPX it needs to address these above issues before adding the next ""gee wiz"" feature.

Well.. at least that's my opinion anyway...

I'm going into my third and final year at University where I study Film, I spend the majority of time focusing on the practical side of filmmaking.

I've applied to internships but I've been unsuccessful, however I fairly frequently get emailed about paid editing starter positions going and my aim is to have a workable showreel by May of next year. So here are my question:

1: How do you put together a showreel that shows off your editing capabilities? 

2: What programs should I get to know better?

3: Is there anywhere I can go to find stock footage that I can edit together?

1. Why do you need input? Input from where? As in, capturing from tapes? If so, wouldn't that just be pulling the data off the tape using the deck? 

2. Why would a box like this be the only option for output? Why not simple HDMI over a regular graphics card?

Audio mixing became unreliable. The mixer seems a bit sluggish; audio values are sometimes not updated in real-time but rather after repositioning the timeline indicator.

However, next week I have an interview for an assistant editor position at a much larger post-production house that seems to do similar work. Coming off $26k a year (and as a private contractor, so I pay my own taxes with no benefits) I would be happy to get anything around $30k, especially if it is accompanied by benefits, but I do not want to either lowball myself or ask for a ridiculous amount.

I have been dabbling with video editing / storytelling for years, but never considered it a viable money-making enterprise. 

However, a few things I have done have started to get noticed and I've started to take on some paying jobs, which means I probably should upgrade my very basic setup.
 
For now I'm doing things like short videos with stock footage for presentations and stuff, so I will not be doing broadcast-quality stuff for now. But I want it to look slick. 

I've been thinking that an iMac 3.4 running FCPX would be the most cost-effective solution for right now. I know it has its limitations, but the costly jump to a MacPro seems unjustified at this point. I just don't want to shoot myself in the foot with something unsuitable for the job.

Also, what's the view on FCPX vs Adobe Premiere or the like? I know most pro's fear and hate FCPX, but for my needs it seems like the most user-friendly editing tool around. 

Again, I'm doing this as a side-line and I prefer to keep my edits simple and let the story do the work so I'm not looking to do fancy video effects at the moment. 

I just want something that will give me a bit more scope without breaking the bank.

In the last two weeks I have heard through various outlets that friends and acquaintances of mine have landed jobs in the industry with little to no experience.  Yet I busted my ass trying to find opportunity and work for the last 6 years to only be where I am now, unemployed and going back to school.  I think I developed a resume to be proud of, a collection of edits I actually don't mind sharing with people.  But at the end of the day I still seem to fall short some where when it comes to finding legitimate work for decent pay.  Maybe this is my own pity party.  Maybe my work really isn't worth shit.  Although I see plenty of work out there on major networks that isnt all that special or all that good. I dont really know.

I guess Im really looking for some kind of guidance or words of encouragement.  If someone would like to see a copy of my resume or collection of work I will gladly pass it along. Thanks for your time

Great company and have a great relationship with the editors and producers here, but I'm a bit of a self-starter and would like to work for myself. I enjoy the hustle and think I can make a bit better wage, control my hours, maybe go to the gym (haha) if freelance. I do feel I'm overqualified where I'm at for my pay grade. I know the advertising community well enough and have heard from other freelance AE's that there is work to be had there at other commercial shops, but I would be interested in branching out - TV, features, documentary, etc. I do a fare amount of billing on the side, but I'd like to make it my main thing.

My am fully proficient in: Avid, FCP, After Effects, Resolve, etc. with lots of experience managing large scale projects through finish. 

It's a bit intimidating right now to consider dropping a full time wage for a more uncertain path, and I'd love to hear anyone's advice on the freelance thing. Have you made the transition? How did you find freelance success? What avenues can I consider that might not be staring me in the face? Thanks for your time, any thoughts are appreciated.

Thanks in advance! :)

I've recently come across the ""fan edit"" of Promethius. Basically, someone cut in the deleted scenes and bonus material to flesh out the film. Arguably, this edit is an improvement on the original.

I find this extremely intriguing. I'm sure we all have movies that we watch and go ""I wish this wasn't in there."" or ""I wish they had said that.""

My question is, ignoring legal and ethical implications for the sake of discussion, what's stopping us? What's stopping us from taking a movie that could be better and MAKING it better?

I'm not saying we should go and gut Citizen Kane, but what if very simple alterations can be made to mediocre films that could transform them into great ones, if only for our own, personal satisfaction?

---

On a strictly educational level, this type of re-hashing existing material may be an excellent exercise in storytelling. It brings to mind the story of Hunter S. Thompson re-writing The Great Gatsby just to get the feeling of writing a great novel under his fingertips.

Additionally, while this re-editing may technically be piracy, would it not help the film industry? Surely more people would buy films directly from the source in order to ensure the version they're watching is the true original and not a re-edit.

For example, I watched Back To The Future again recently and I was struck by how many long takes Zemekis used, and how he used camera movement to suggest point of view, rather than editing.

A useful thought experiment is to take a long take that we know (for example, the famous one-take steadicam shot in Goodfellas) and imagine it as a series of cuts / shots. What's interesting is that the information is just as clear, but the experience is different.

1339126290.0,11,self.editors,uqzvx,I'm a student with a question about online/offline workflows in the various NLEs.,ApricotPlantation,11,0,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/uqzvx/im_a_student_with_a_question_about_onlineoffline/,"Was hoping someone with some experience could help me understand this.

The concept of online/offline workflows makes perfect sense, I'm just a little confused about how it's implemented. In After Effects, for example, you can just click one of the clips in your bin, then choose ""Create Proxy"" and create the proxy you'll edit with -- but it doesn't create a new entry in your bins. Instead, it adds a little checkbox next to the original name -- checked means you're using a proxy, unchecked means you're using the original files. So when you're done creating your motion graphics, you uncheck all the boxes and then render/export.

I'm learning to use Avid MC6 and Premiere CS6, but neither seem to include identical functionality. What is the correct workflow for creating proxies and then replacing them with originals in these programs? Currently I've just been transcoding upon import (Avid) or with AME before import (Premiere), editing with those, and then rightclicking in the bins and choosing Replace Footage, then finding the original camera files.

Is that the way we're *supposed* to do it? There's no huge problem with it, I just want to be sure that that's the standard workflow and I'm not missing something. I wouldn't even question it really, had I not encountered the quite elegant and simple After Effects alternative. 

**tldr: what is the *correct* way to replace your intermediates/proxies with original camera files at the end of an Avid or Premiere edit?**

Bonus side-question: I understand that the upper-level DNXHD formats are considered 'perceptually lossless'. How often do you pro editors just transcode to say, DNXHD 175 @ 1080p24 and throw away the original camera files, just exporting from DNXHD instead?

However I did my research and the ten videos I cut in the span of one month where all given to the client as is.  So they liked me enough to use my rough cuts as final cuts.


I'm having a hard time letting this go because I never got one bit of negative feedback from them. I was supposed to work for a month at 10 an hour as a trial and then get a decent raise and come on as a finisher. They dangled the carrot in front of me till my month was up, giving me encouraging words and pumping up my ego and then boom. I was let go.


I feel like the job was a scam of some sort. Find an editor with a good reel (like I had) promise them a full time position at the end of a one month minimum wage trial....and then let them go and move onto the next poor sucker.



Is there a watchdog agency out there I can report them to? What rights do those of is who work freelance have?

Example: I have a workstation and a laptop. With big projects they can only fit on the workstation because it has lots of disk space. But... with this command I can edit from my laptop, while the media sits on the workstation. Handy trick when I feel like editing lazy-style on the couch.

Versions are the videofiles you upload. You can password protect the version. You send the link and password to your client which can then leave comments on the video with the timecode. In the backend, you can mark these comments as done so you know what you’ve revised. All comments done? Upload a new version and repeat until approved.

I'm doing vfx for a short film, and there's plenty of aesthetic work I'm doing in two shots: Two characters talking across from one another, and the camera whip-pans between them between every shot. It looks better than it sounds!

My problem? Three of the shots are missing the physical camera whip-pan. 

What the editor did for a temporary fix was use the clip without the pan, then cut to another identical angle with a whip pan DURING the whip... it looks good, except you can see the character's position shift slightly between the shots.

Is there an easier way to fake a whip pan than stitching together a shot that has it and the shot that needs it? I want to figure out what I should do so that I know what part of the clips I need to do VFX on- there's blinking lights so timing is critical!

Anyway, I've also been told that it could be the video card being used. The machine's are HP and have the right spec and we're using a blackmagic running 9.7.1 driver (latest). The faults are that audio gets mixed down to stereo regardless of settings and it doesn't respect in and out points. This means you just cant trust it for outputting things to tape. On another system we're running AJA Kona 3G and this is taking through VITC and has a bad signal on the monitor and not the system. I have a feeling this will be the video card and not Premiere.

I've spent the past two years shooting a documentary and am just beginning the editing process. From browsing /r/editors I think I am everything you guys loathe. I'm basically [this guy](http://i.imgur.com/EmwTz.gif), but rather than asking someone to edit my film for free, I'm willing to invest the time and energy to learn how to do it myself. 

The film is about a network of adolescent drug abuse program that is often accused of being a cult. It's a personal story in that I was a member of this organization for five years. [Here's a pitch trailer](http://youtu.be/dVnvg78Sv1s) that was made at the beginning of the project as part of an ultimately failed crowdfunding campaign. 

I do have some experience in this area. I studied filmmaking in college and after graduating, worked for Apple. Part of my work with Apple was conducting FCP training, albiet very entry-level type stuff. And I've done a couple short films. However, that was many years ago and I still feel like I'm completely out of my league in sitting down and trying to edit a feature-length doc. 

I'm editing in FCPX (I know, I know, but I like it), and have hundred of hours of footage shot and collected. I've done the Lynda.com FCPX training and just purchased the Apple Pro Video Series from Ripple Training. So, I'm starting to know my way around the software, but still have a lot of unorganized footage and am struggling with how to construct a narrative. 

Any suggestions for learning more about editing and storytelling? Any advice for an admitted amateur on avoiding amateur mistakes? Is there a good place online for learning about editing techniques that goes beyond just the software.

I didn't cut the thing, I'm just here to make it work. What I need to do is get this sequence out of Final Cut 7 and into something our audio guy can work with in Pro Tools. Ordinarily my go-to tool for such a task is reliable old Automatic Duck Pro Exporter, but there's just *something* about this stupid thing that doesn't want to play nice, and it's nor for lack of effort (eight hours later of working on *just* this problem...).

The editor cut the show in one sequence per act, and it's about 32 minutes all put together. Duck doesn't like that. And even if I just export by act, Duck doesn't like that either. It'll just spit out cryptic error codes that their FAQ doesn't address (except 0:123, which isn't applicable because there are no illegal characters in my XML, I checked three different ways). If I can get it to run through the whole sequence to produce the XML it feeds the OMF generator, the whole thing throws up its arms and says that it can't find any audio or video tracks, and quits. From there on out I'll simply get critical errors if I try and use the exporter again. 

The Final Cut OMF exporter does alright, but it doesn't give me timecoded WAVs, which would be preferable since we have a *lot* of timecoded audio that would be helpful to match back to, if at all possible. It also doesn't help that the FCP OMFs are flat-24FPS (and not 23.98), which has us a bit leery about it actually matching the picture.

My third alternative has been *really* ugly. I do a Send-to-Soundtrack, then use Soundtrack to generate an AAF. My problem here, besides how roundabout it is, is that Soundtrack keeps generating 29.97 AAFs, and this is a 23.98 project. Soundtrack sees it as 23.98 on the way in, but when it spits the file out on the other end, it becomes 29.97, which is super weird since we don't have *any* 29.97 media in this project at all (there's some AIFF music files in there, but they don't have any native timecode...).

edit: ALRIGHT! SO I GOT IT!

I don't know what had the final effect because I've done so many things over the last 24 hours but:

-Made a new sequence and set the aspect ration to custom. I did this first but I think it gets worse if you have it set to HDTV 1080i

-Made sure the field dominance was set to none. This was shortly thereafter and seemed to help as well, but I was also using new captures from Camtasia so that might have to do with it.

-Used MPEG Streamclip to convert all mp4s (or avis, if I used the incredibly laggy uncompressed setting in Camtasia) to Apple ProRes. Also made sure ""Interlaced Scaling"" was unchecked in MPEG Streamclip. I'm not sure if this has any effect because my converts were unscaled but whatever. 

-Changed the Render Settings in FCP to render the sequence as Apple ProRes instead of ""Use Sequence Settings""

-Made sure every clip had an EVEN NUMBER zoom. No 110.24%. Also, if I sped it up it got worse as well as flickered. Don't speed that shit up.

-Added a sharpen filter (I'm not sure if it's Boris's sharpen or magic bullets. I have both installed. All I know is it ISN'T FCP's standard.

I'm a director who happens to be fairly good at editing and sometimes works on my own projects on Avid Media Composer 6 on my laptop. Most of the time I'll just drop the auto correction options in the color correction workspace just to clean up what I shot. 

(obviously anything that I'm really getting paid to do, I let a finisher do the color correction on his symphony suite at work - this is more of a question regarding my own small projects) 

I stumbled across the technicolor Color Assist Looks, and while I know I can't use their software with Avid, I really like the look of those ""Looks"" and was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction to get a similar look out of Avid's color correction tool. 

I'm not looking for a full out lesson (though I'd accept it if someone wanted to give me a detailed description), just a starting point because I don't really know what I'm doing with that tool - I've never really gotten any training with color correction.

This is not my usual Reddit account because I don't want it associated with my real name.  I know a lot of you are reality TV editors so [my new program](http://www.mediafire.com/?fz6cr7ozncupc26) may be of use to you. After a lot of frustrating experiences working on shows which do not have great solutions for easily searching transcripts I decided to write my own program to do just that.  Mine is not the only program ever written to accomplish this, nor is it the best, but it is lightweight, effective, and easy to use.  

As you all know, Avid now offers the paid tool ""Script Sync"" and the ""Find"" option now supports searching through scripts within your project since 5.5.  If you are using one or both of those tools right now Transcript Search Tool won't seem very exciting, however,  both of those options require importing the transcripts into your Avid project and Transcript Search Tool automatically begins searching new transcripts the instant the transcriber saves them to the network.  Transcript Search Tool will also be invaluable for story producers and assists who don't have their own Avid system to work on.

Feel free to play with it and pass it around to others.  I'd appreciate if you would tell me features you would like to see added as well as report bugs and elements that bother you.

I'm sure I'm not the only person who's in this boat, so I'll maintain a list here as long as new suggestions come in. Come on editors of Reddit, let's help each other out!

",slidinglight,10,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/ibc9w/is_my_internship_worth_it/,"Hey there fellow (r)editors. I am a film major in a big city in the USA, interning at a smallish post-production house. They do color correction, transfers, and editing for clients small and biggish, as well as indie and student films. My duties as intern so far have been basic office bitch duties, restock the fridge, make the coffee, fetch lunch...etc.  This is also an unpaid internship. The deal with those type of things as that, I, as a student, am getting something back. 

They have a trailer competition where we cut a film and change it's genre. The editors here will have some sessions with you and give notes. That is kind of cool, I still have to start, but I feel I can get something out of that...maybe. We are also encouraged to sit in on edit sessions. 

However, the people here, while nice, are definitely not welcoming. They don't ever remember to ask us if we want lunch when they order, they just tell us to fetch it. The only person I've really managed to have a decent conversation with, started the place, and the sitting in sessions are mighty dull. One of the editors here is from the same foreign country as I am, and I could barely get a reaction out of him. ""We both speak the same language dude, one that almost nobody else does"", I wanted to yell at his tempered response. 

We are the interns, we come in, and then we leave, and then, I guess, they forget about us. I do know how to edit, and I don't feel like I am gaining much by just watching, (they also only use FCP, I am more of an AVID guy).

I asked one of the guys working here ""so what do you truly expect from us?"". He continued to respond the patter of our duties ""wipe the counter, wash the sinks."" He must of saw my expression, because he then added ""you get what you put into it."" 

I am not sure if I can really get that much out of this place. It's my third day here, I come in twice a week on mornings, and I am thinking I might try and find somewhere else where I can truly be a part of things, not just free concierge labor.

Am I exaggerating? Are my expectations too high? Am I just part of the generation that expects everything handed to them and a degrading job sends my entitled head into a tizzy?

My parents have agreed to help me with this endeavour, and we've all agreed that the first thing I need right now is a machine that can handle the software I have (I have a gopro hero 3 black edition that works for what I'm filming right now, I will upgrade to a different camera later).  Seeing as I'm going to college in 2 years, I want a laptop (also, I tend to work alot in odd places, my room, a coffee shop, the park, friends houses).

**STEREO C, L, R, Cs** (makes four tracks)

* Mac Pro (8-core, 2.26ghz, 16GB RAM, no SSD, 4 years old)
* 2 Acer 22"" monitors
* Black Magic Intensity Pro (enables me to record from the cable box [I work for the cable company], as well as monitor on an HDTV via composite, and record app walkthroughs from an iPad via HDMI)
* Sony U1 XDCAM deck for capturing
* Not doing much in terms of scoping (I know...cutting for TV and no scoping? Shame on me!)


**What I'm thinking for my new job, which is mostly web, but may include some DVD/Blu-ray authoring (I'm not entirely sure yet, but will have more info this week):**

* Mac Pro (Probably 12 core with at least 1 SSD for my applications and a RAID 0 setup for speed, 16GB RAM)
* 2 monitor setup (need better monitors than before since I'm producing for web)
* Thinking about a Black Magic UltraScope card for scopes
* Not sure on what deck they have, but if they use the camera for capturing I will quickly change that part of the existing workflow.
* **edit:** A pair of KRK 6"" studio monitors.


**Notes:**

* Will be the sole videographer/video editor in-house.
* Will be on Adobe CS6 using Premiere and After Effects, plus whatever else I might need.
* Will be ingesting HDV from a Canon XH A1, and HD video from Canon 7D/5DMkiii.
* Really want to start focusing on scopes and color correction, but not sure how to approach it. Do I need more software? A third monitor? Not sure where to go from here.

Here's the workflow:  1) Exporting from Avid (6.5 generation) to After Effects CS6, rendering, then compressing that file via h.264 delivery, which seems to be the standard now.

I *used* to think I got consistent results from DNX export @ 709&gt; Import AE add color profile HDTV 16-235, work in HDTV color space (not 16-235) and export using Prores 422.  I could add an HDTV color profile using automator (add color profile) and send that to compressor and I'd be pretty pleased with the h.264 result..

I actually sent a bitch email to Steve Jobs a few years ago about how bad color management was right after Snow Leopard and got a call back from a ""sr. apple color engineer"" who discussed in depth managed color profiles in QTX and apologized that they didn't document it anywhere.. 

(He was pretty unapologetic about the gamma shift in RGB non-color managed encodes (such as Animation codec) which I found annoying.. Although they would later address this somewhat with a prores RGB codec)

Avid and Adobe still don't really utilize color managed quicktimes, I assume if I was using FCP X this would be marginally easier..

In any case, since CS6/ Avid 6.5 this seems to be really hinkey.  My blacks just don't look right and the color gamut seems jacked.  Before I waste a few days pulling my hair out, I'm wondering if any of you have any insights...or are experiencing any problems.. 

What the stations do with my spot after the fact is another story completely.. I was wondering if any of you were experiencing any issues before I dive into this further on my own.

This is my second or third post in this sub but I wanted to get everyones opinions on this topic. 

I own a small but profitable production company in Mexico. I am in serious need of a rebuild on my post production suite. 

I just hired 2 new employees to handle coloring/grading and the editing. I have a huge contract coming up in the next few months and am ready to get started. 

I mostly have all the tech ready to go and am primarily concerned with the layout. Here is a run down on the Tech.

I have 3 computers, one is a custom computer I built last year that runs a i7 extreme editing, 16gb of ram, 180gb SSD that contains the OS, 2 2TB Internal drives, 2 Nvidia 1550's in SLI and all the other regular goodies. The PC will be for Coloring and Grading. Most likely it will run Resolve though I have not tested it yet. 

The other Computer is a i7 Mac Pro 2012 edition running the Adobe Suite and various basic audio programes for audio clean up. 

I have a 46 Inch Samsung 1080p TV as the main monitor, a 23inch Samsung LED monitor as a secondary monitor and am waiting on a third samsung as a pallet monitor. This computer will handle all the editing and encoding. (I know a Projector or larger LED might be better but those will come later) 

Attached to the Mac pro is a Cintiq Graphics tablet, a Matrox MXO2 LE MAX to handle encoding, a contour Shuttle Pro V2 for premier control and several Thunderbolt drives to handle backup. I also have some awesome keyboards for controlling Premier. 

I am in the process of having an app designed for the Ipad so my editor can control the whole editing system from the Ipad, which I will try and distribute free to reddit for a limited time before submitting to the apple store. 

for a sound system I am running two KRK systems Rokit 5's and a KRK systems 10S Sub. They are fed into a 15 channel balanced mixer for a clean audio signal. 

I am also sporting a 2011 edition Macbook Pro i5 with 16Gb Ram. This is used on shoots to make dailies and for DIT data management.

Now to the cool stuff, I am having a custom workstation built for the editor and colorist so they can work in comfort and generally look bad ass hahah. 

I really have no idea for design which is kind of where you guys come in. I need some Ideas for how to incorporate all this tech so it looks nice and is very functional. I am having the desk built out of wood and money really in no object at this point though I would like to spend under 5K if possible. 

Does anyone have any ideas on how to make a great functional desk, or anywhere I can find pictures of other post production suites?

Also did I leave any tech out that you can recommend? I need to be able to work fast and comfortably. Up until now I have been doing the editing and coloring myself as well as the shooting so it is new for me to step back a little and let others handle it. 

The room is quite small, about 16 feet left to right and 20 feet front to back. I dont need schematics just Ideas like speaker stands built in, hidden drawers for cables and mixers, slide outs for keyboards and mouses. Under areas for the computers and anything ells you can come up with. 

I will for sure be posting pictures as the build starts and finishes. Most of the Tech is not hooked up yet as its way too much clutter to have on a regular desk like I have now.  I am also waiting on the TV to be flush mounted to the wall and to have cable storage built into the walls so it looks clean.

Anyway Enough babbling, hopefully you can help me out with this. I figured /R/Editors would love a chance to see a dream suite come together. (at least its a dream to me haha)

Thanks in advance.

P.S Sorry for my grammer and spelling, it was never a strong suit of mine.

We shot a 7 minute video at 1080 30p on a HPX-170. Nothing particularly intensive, a ""talking head"" video. I pulled the raw footage in to After Effects for some basic correcting and output a lossless file that came in at a staggering 25gigs.

Final Cut did not want to play well with a file that large so I exported a ProRes 422 (proxy) to edit with.

This is where I'm at now. My questions would be:

* Can anybody suggest, or point me in a good direction of, a basic proxy workflow?

* Do I just drag the ProRes files in to a new sequence to edit? If so, how do I reconnect these files with the higher quality, lossless files for export?

However, as I'm sure some of you have experienced, once you're in one specific section of the entertainment industry (like reality TV), you tend to stay there. So I'm just curious about ways to get in the door for post-production for animation. I would even be happy to go back to assistant editor level and work my way up again.

I've recently come across an assistant editing gig and I've run into a bit of trouble setting up the project file. Apparently the project, which was shot on the Alexa, had a series of LUTs created from the camera when they shot.

I've just been given the hard drive and I see absolutely nothing on there except for the rushes (.mov ProRes 4444 files) and .mxf files of the clips for Avid. I'm having trouble seeing if the LUTs have already been applied to these files but according to one of the producers they haven't. 

Are LUTs standalone files or are they applied to the clips straight from the camera? I've never worked with Alexa footage before as this is one of my first gigs. If any of you have any experience with working with LUTs and could give me some advice it would GREATLY appreciated!

Probably a bit off topic for r/editors. But I would like to know if you have any suggestions.

My work wants to build a very basic low budget studio (under 20k). It will be 2-3 hd cameras cutting live, two mics, 3 point lighting, green screen and an input to a laptop for vision mixing, audio and live outputting. The videos are made for the web. Usually it will contain an interviewer, interviewee and probably a two shot with a green screen background. 

As an editor, I know little about studio work but I was looking at wirecast: http://www.telestream.net/wire-cast/overview.htm

Has anyone used this? What program do you recommend that can cut live through a laptop? Can you achieve the same things as you would if you were in a TV studio with a mixing desk? Do you have any recommendations for cheap HD cameras that have the right output connections to a laptop?

(from an Avid guy)",agent42b,8,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/1jk6vq/yet_another_how_do_i_do_that_in_premiere_from_an/,"Warning: this is a long wall of text. It reads more like a blog post.  However, I figured since we all waste a lot of time rendering, you can enjoy this little indulgence of thoughts :-)

Yesterday, yet again I had the chance to edit a TV promo trailer, with my own choice of NLE. ""Oh great I can finally try premiere Pro CC,"" I thought.  It was the perfect setup: all of my source footage was DSLR H264, and I really didn't feel like transcoding it all for Avid.  

Then… Sigh… As usually happens, I get frustrated with the little nuances of premiere, and realized that the overall process [despite not having quite the speed advantage with DSLR footage] would be faster in Avid.  Funny enough though -- I really did fret over this decision.    

So… This leaves me with a few puzzling items in premiere Pro CC, that ultimately caused me to stumble enough to make me switch back to Avid.  

Here are my issues with Premiere CC.  I'm not officially claiming them to be 'problems,' but more so my ignorance revealing itself.  I'm hoping someone more experienced can shed some light on these:

1)  I'm trying to skim through all of my clips quickly, looking at multiple takes, etc. I switch to the video thumbnail mode, which seems to have a similar ""hover scrub"" feature like FCPX.  That's fine and all, but I don't want to use the mouse!  If I use my arrow keys to jump to the next clip, and hit ENTER, the video's text gets unlighted as if I want to rename the clip.  Arg, no, I just want to load the next clip into the source monitor!  Perhaps I just hit spacebar to make the clip play?  Nope.   This means I actually need to hold the mouse, whether I 'hover scrub' through the clips, or double-click them one at a time?  Unacceptable. 

2) Time remapping: while I'm appreciative of the fact that premiere Pro CC now allows me to time remap directly inside the app [instead of only aftereffects] it seems rather pointless to me because there are no frame interpolation options.  I can time remap clips, have them look choppy as hell when it is slow-motion, and then open up the clip inside a new aftereffects composition -- then I turn on my desired frame interpolation mode, save and exit.  This produces the desired results back inside my premiere Pro CC timeline, but it seems like a huge waste of time -- turning my time-remapped shot into an AfterFX comp, with all the sluggishness and forced-rendering that comes with it.  I know Adobe promotes the hell out of this feature... but no thanks.  

So there you have it… For a quick promo that relies heavily on skimming and doing lots of slow-motion ramping, these two [lack of] features convinced me that enough time would be lost that I would be better off just doing it in Avid.  If anyone is wondering ... switching the Avid bins into script mode allows me to use arrow keys and simply hit space-bar to play any clip (doesn't even need to load into the source monitor)... and as for the frame interpolation issue -- Avid's Fluidmotion still provides results that are just as good as AfterFX's time remapping in most cases.  Maybe it just wasn't meant to be?  Oh, and to my surprise, the AMA DSLR footage actually plays nicely in MC7 ... performance was quite adequate that I didn't need to transcode after all.

The problem is that I've never worked with r3d files. What I'm trying to figure out is what the best workflow would be for bringing those files into after effects, and potentially photoshop, as I can't seem to do any RAW image adjustments in After Effects. I plan on handing this off to a colourist sometime later this month, but I can't figure out whether I should:

* Do the RAW file adjustments myself (mostly brightness and contrast, potentially in RedCine-X or Premiere Pro),
* Do VFX in After Effects,
* Export an uncompressed video file,
* Give the colourist my Premiere Pro timeline.

Or alternatively:

* Wait until the colourist does his work (including RAW file adjustments),
* *Then* do VFX in After Effects.

It's about that time I need to send DPX files to the graphics guys of the short I'm working on. When I was an assistant I never had to deal with this kind of workflow so it's all new to me, and I'm excited about gaining some new knowledge.

When I started the project I AMA linked to the RedONE footage and transcoded to DNxHD. Now I have finished I have exported an EDL using this workflow:

http://www.kvibe.com/2012/03/27/redcine-x-pro-and-avid-media-composer-6-mc6-workflow-documentation-by-www-kvibe-com/

Basically it's decomposing sequence, outputting a File_16 EDL and then importing into Red Cine X.

When I imported a CM3600 EDL RCX loaded clips into a bin but they were all offline and I couldn't relink them. With the File_16 EDL the clips load in RCX bin and are online. Now when I change the import option to ''timeline''.... the clips load into a timeline in RCX but the timeline is only about 3 seconds long, each clip representing a frame?? Is this normal?

Either way I exported one of the R3D files in the RCX bin to a 2K DPX file (file sequence) as a test but have no way of checking what it exported. It is only 1.16GB and I think maybe this is too small. I tried importing into Premiere but the bit depth wasn't supported.

We don't need any features, other then say being able to hook up external 3.0 drives would be nice for just easy sharing of footage. And DLNA so we can pull renders onto any of the smart TVs around the studio or on our phones. But we don't have enough works and we aren't 24/7 so I don't need hot swaping, cloud features or any of that stuff. 

I already did some research and I think the DS412+ has what we need.  I figure we'll do 3TB as a Raid 5, (as backup is obviously important and I figure it would run faster than just a raid 1 across 4 drives, if that's even possible)

However, my experience if fairly limited and I'd really love some advice on how best to market myself. Essentially, I have only cut 2 very small projects (both for class). One is a [5 minute short film](https://vimeo.com/62753905) (password = uscp1) that I directed, shot, produced, edited (and sound designed), etc., and a 2 minute segment that was cut from actual dailies of on old *ER* episode. Both of the projects were cut on Avid although back in undergrad I also worked on Final Cut a bit. Both of these projects were held up in the class by the professors as fairly exceptional work (given my lack of experience). I'm not saying that here just to brag, only to point out that I've had some people objectively confirm that I have developed an eye for editing (spending 6 years studying film on an academic/theory based level will do that too you), and it's something I genuinely love doing. 

Where I am at disadvantage is learning more of the technical side of things. At the moment, I basically follow a checklist provided by my professor for how to set up my project/workflow when starting a new project in Avid and know very little about formats, importing data, linking files, etc. etc. (You can see [here a recent post I made in r/videoediting](http://www.reddit.com/r/VideoEditing/comments/1bbnpg/media_offline_trying_to_open_a_project_on_a_new/) explaining the difficulties I've had after installing Avid on my own computer and trying to open one of my projects on this new machine)

Graduating in May (in Los Angeles), I realize it will be very hard for me to find work in a hands-on editing position right off the bat. I'm trying to be realistic and want to aim for an assistant editing position to help me get up to speed on the technical front and begin learning more about workflows etc. 

In terms of past work experience, my resume is pretty heavily slanted towards writing (both as a technical writer, and as a film critic). In my cover letter I'm planning to play up the similarities of film editing with that of writing (on a conceptual level). 

So, I've basically got a weird mix of things here and I'm just trying to figure out how best to market myself to future employers. 

* Education = film related degree (but not production) has given me an eye for recognizing skillful editing

* My film clips/reel = limited in scope but (hopefully) shows promise? 

* Past work = writing background

What does r/editors recommend??

I've read up that CS6 can handle AVCHD without any conversion necessary, but now I'm trying to edit and am having issues of the timeline not playing the video for more than a few frames and then stopping. Is this an AVCHD problem or a Premiere issue?

While working towards becoming a post PA, I landed a job as a promo producer/editor for a syndicated standard def station. I've had a lot of fun and creative freedom, but after a year and low pay, I want to develop more of a plan and actively work towards it.

My life interests include all things creative. I mostly thrive with project based work. Traveling is a necessity. And of course I love directing/editing.

I know nothing about what's required of me to edit for a living. I've been told by a couple of seasoned guild editors that I need to get out to LA. I have no interest in editing bad television in the long run, although I'd probably have fun with some reality type stuff (MTVs Made). 

My questions are:

What are the possibilities of freelancing as an editor in a small town?

If LA is the answer for feature film editing, what would be the best thing to plan before moving (saving money, first jobs, etc.)?

I'm 30 years old, how would I start as an editor right away instead of assist 5-10 years or get pigeon-holed in reality TV?

It would have been nice to have a tech spec talk with all of these people before shooting, but sadly, that was not the case with this project.


What is the best workflow when working with overcranked footage and mixed frame rates? 


The one solution I have come up with so far is interpreting the overcranked footage to either 59.94 or 120fps so it is not slow motion and reviewing at normal speed, but then I am left with even more framerates to deal with. I want the option to time remap the alexa 120fps footage at certain action moments, but other times where I just want it to play out at normal speed.

I've been editing an episode for a web series on Premiere Pro CS6. The footage was shot on 5D Mark II and I haven't encoded the footage to anything else, so it's still h264.

When I'm finished, I send the sequence to Media Encoder but the exporting process slows to a crawl. I check the Performance tab and it seems like my computer isn't maxing out my processor, instead only using a little bit. When I exit, my computer will continue to lag until I restart.

I don't have the problem - and it's a lot faster - when I export straight from Premiere.

So I'd be curious to know your opinions' on the difference between proficiency on an editing interface (avid/premiere/fcp etc) and actually 'good editing.'

An example of 'good editing' I'd offer is the gas station scene in No Country For Old Men.  We have the hapless gas station attendant in conversation with the psychopathic hit man, Anton Chigurh.  Simple back and forth with mounting tension as the attendant begins to realize this guy is very bad news.  At one point Mr. Chigurh crumbles up the cellophane snack wrapper and places it on the counter between the two men.  We go to a close up of this wrapper slowly re-expanding.  VOILA! Dramatic Tension!  I thought this was an excellent choice for a cutaway.  

Do you guys have a definition of 'good editing,' and/or maybe some fun examples?  

I got to thinking about this after fcpX came out and many people seemed to be focused more on being prideful that they know Avid or hysterically panicked that they don't. I kinda feel like you either know how to edit or you don't, and then the interface should be secondary.

College student here, color correcting a fellow student's film. Unfortunately, I've never had a chance to familiarize myself with any program other than Apple Color (DaVinci Resolve is in my crosshairs, probably over winter break). The film was shot on 16mm film, and digitized at Fotokem.

The trouble I'm having is with pulling keys. The film is a noir-style, so they shot a lot of things dark, and ended up underexposing a lot of stuff. Some of it is on purpose, so I just have to deepen the blacks and shadows, but with other stuff, the grain on the film is so extreme I can't figure out how to get an effective key. It's tough, because at times, there are problems that I have to pull a key to fix.

Ex: There was a scene shot in a parking garage, and so the fluorescents made everything green. During the TeleCine, they overcorrected for it and so now the man's suit is magenta. I could easily fix that right up but I can't key out the purple because the noise is so heavy. Not to mention the fact that there is a distracting amount of noise on the project.

*  **Background Rendering/Transcoding/Consolidating:**. Seriously fuck you Avid for making me pay $2,499.00 to sit watching hours of footage come in (some in real time if you are doing a file based AMA workflow) rather than actually ""Assisting"" an editor.

* **Develop your own Encoding Engine:** From Avid Manual - ""Highly compressed
codecs such as H.264 will exhibit minimal real-time performance.""...Yeah because when you use QT7's encoding engine you missing out  on Multi-Threaded Preformance on your processors. And as to why they are relying on another company's product for such a vital part of the program is beyond me. Oh and by the way, [good luck to anyone who wants to import a clip in Avid 6 and above](http://community.avid.com/forums/t/112059.aspx).

* **The ability to create a [Render Farm](http://community.avid.com/forums/p/67400/377373.aspx):** Now that it's a 64bit NLE, I should be able to create a Cluster to increase the speed for rendering. Compressor had this ability with Shake years ago.

* **Setting a Source to Clips that has a different frame rate from your project:** Do I honestly have to explain why this is a pain in the ass. Also, the need to fix the 23.976 NTSC Project settings, the timelines you create in that project sets the time base to 30i...major oversight IMO. Also Avids 14:1 codec is set to a HD pixel aspect ratio when it should be SD...might want to fix that as well.

* **Batch re-linking to Volume based media:** I have a major problem in general with the AMA Uprez workflow. We should be able to create a database with all the AMA files already linked up, maybe even do this in a program outside of Media Composer...like Avid FX for example. As of now the only way to do this is to store all the clips in a "" AMA"" bin, and we all know what happens when a bin exceeds a certain file size, it become extremely sluggish. Also when a clip losses it's link after setting a source it freaks the fuck out every time you try an open that bin.

* **Batch renaming AMA Volume based media:** Right now I am changing the Meta Data names one by one. When working with tape you will get a .01, .02., .03 at the end of each clip when you capture. We have nothing like this when transcoding Volume based media. The only solution now is to write a Macro in a program like [Quick Keys](http://startly.com/products/quickeys/mac/4/).

* **Create More applications for the LOVE OF GOD!:** Honestly, when FCP Studio 7 came out, I was hoping AVID would start providing other applications bundled when you bought Media Composer. This has still not changed. As of now I use the following Programs along side AVID MC: [Compressor](http://www.apple.com/finalcutpro/compressor/), [Toast Titanium](http://www.roxio.com/enu/products/toast/titanium/overview.html), [Wave Agent](http://www.sounddevices.com/products/waveagent/), [QtChange v2.18](http://www.videotoolshed.com/product/42/qtchange), [Magic Bullet Grinder v1.5](http://www.redgiantsoftware.com/products/all/magic-bullet-grinder/), [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/), [QtkitTimecode](http://www.iboostup.com/app/com.apple.dts.samplecode.qtkittimecode), [Logmein](https://secure.logmein.com/), [Clip Wrap](http://www.divergentmedia.com/clipwrap), [File Renamer](http://www.filerenamer.com/), [XDCAM Transfer](http://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/micro-xdcam/resource.downloads.bbsccms-assets-micro-xdcam-downloads-XDCAMSoftwareDownload.shtml#apps), FCP 7 (RIP), PluralEyes2, [Toki TC](http://www.tokitest.fr/english/tokitc.html), [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html), and good ole [MPEG Stream Clip](http://www.squared5.com/).....just to name a few. 
Some of the programs aforementioned are vital to my workflow, and I happily give these companies my money. Now I don't expect Avid to come out with everything I want and need, I understand the cost involved in developing programs such as these. But they have to do better.

The shoot will last anywhere between *14-17 days*.

Assuming the totals for the very least *(14 days at 2 hours a day = 28hours)* and the very most *(17 days at 6 hours a day = 102hours)* amount of footage that will be shot over this time period, *how much drive space should he be looking to secure for the shoot?* 

And with this amount in mind, does anyone have *any suggestions for large and reliable RAID setups?*

1345066395.0,5,self.editors,ya80f,Future of Post-Production on the Mac and FCP X (re-posted from r/AppleHelp),Ebobster,8,3,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/editors/comments/ya80f/future_of_postproduction_on_the_mac_and_fcp_x/,"I wrote that late last night as my sanity escaped me but all that did to my writing was making it slightly more animated--the sentiment, curiosity, and interest it hopefully conveyed is 100% genuine. Would love to hear thoughts. Was hoping such an ambiguously, philosophical, juicy apple topic would be ignite some debate but thus far not what I had hoped for. Any legitimately insightful remarks are much appreciated as always. A i bear no shame not taking out my silly introductory remarks for the new r/editors audience.
If the typos are too bad and my diction sucks just downvote me.

I'm an conscientious and savvy mac enthusiast. I love and hate apple for so many reasons. I have a 6' x 4' poster on my wall of this photo: http://osxdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/steve-jobs-ibm-finger.jpg. The prior sentences serve to accredit myself in the eyes of likeminded apple lemmings interested in intelligent discussion. Now for my question:

I advise people on apple hardware and software for a living among other things and am currently trying to help a small production company with a significant hardware purchase and have come to realize that the status quo in apple's video editing products is about to change markedly. I am by no means expert in this field which is why i seek advice.

FCP X appears to be moribund software. Xsan already is. Xraid too. At the time these product lines were relevant and supported unwaveringly and amounted in my eyes to effective albeit exspensive solutions for video editing. Then came RED cameras and native 5K resolution and the demand for faster everything. If you want to survive in this industry you need performance but apple can no longer offer a reasonable setup for a small studio in need of a file server for 6 desktops. Please object if this is not the case, but the damn FibreSAN card alone would dent my budget noticably.

So I think the best approach to be very cautious and recommend a highly upgradable and expandable setup. That's ideal, but in reality, i feel otherwise since such a setup would be in the high $20K+ range.

The studio seems intent on moving to CS6 and I think thats wise since Adobe has a devotion to the professional media user base. 

My main interest is in hearing the thoughts you might have about what you think professional video editing is going to look like on a mac in 5-10 years and whether or not a rock solid file server and some highly tuned iMacs will be useful down the road. I'm aware that the mac pro line has been promised a noticeable revamping in the months, and barring an a-hole move by apple that solders every god damn piece of hardware to the mac pro, that would be the more cost effective route to go as you can start small and go pretty big with those machines. 

Is that the prudent and wise route to go for professional grade performance that won't be choking on the video file of the future that is presumably larger? 

How much can one completely tuned up model year iMac handle at once? I ask solely because I know what they can theoretically do but the temperature of their 2010 iMacs at capacity is borderline unsafe. My temp gun showed 165F on one of their machines. This leads me to believe that you they'll longer running at much less than their capacity. 

So just tell me what you would do if you were a indie-type studio looking to get the most bang for your buck on a mac. Or if you would scrap this idea altogether and build Hackint0sh boxes from scratch with a hardware selection geared solely for video editing.

Much obliged,

Hopefully this is a short and easy answer for someone new to compressor. Usually, I would just export my film in H.264 with FCP7, but learned that I should be using compressor instead. So, I hypothetically if I have exported a self contained movie in ProRes, what settings should I be using in Compressor to put the video online? From my messing around, it seems that the audio and video are always separate, with AAC and H.264. Is there a way to export them together so I can upload to Vimeo or YouTube? Thanks in advance, you all inspire me beyond belief!
