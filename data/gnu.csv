## Five steps to DRM activism

1. Go to http://dayagainstdrm.org and pledge to take action.
2. Send the link to all your friends on your social networks.
3. Go to the [LibrePlanet wiki page and list an event you'd like to run](http://libreplanet.org/wiki/Group:DefectiveByDesign/Day_Against_DRM_2012#Events) (see below for ideas)
4. Email us at the FSF -- campaigns@fsf.org -- an address (in the US and Canada for sure, overseas we'll do our best to get something out)
5. Plan your event on campus or in your local area, FSF materials will be sent ASAP.

## Some ideas for events

* Have a pizza party in your dorm room -- ask people to make their pledge on the http://dayagainstdrm.org website to sign up.

* Throw a frisbee around for an hour. Afterwards, drink and talk about DRM.

* Ask your school's library to sign a pledge against DRM-ebooks and DRM-textbooks.

I've already had this gone over by the PC-building enthusiasts at /r/buildapc for technical compatibility, but now I'd like to have some freedom enthusiasts check it over for free driver support / other tips.

Some notes:

* I know that the CPU has an AGPU in it, and I'd be kind of wasting that power by using a dedicated graphics card, but it's kind of my only option given that I have to stick with the F2A85-M motherboard for coreboot support.
* I already have my own mouse and monitor, which is why they're not on the parts list.
* The Asus F2A85-M motherboard was chosen because, as far as I can tell, it's the only relatively recent motherboard that's still sold that supports coreboot (the free BIOS replacement); see &lt;http://www.coreboot.org/Supported_Motherboards&gt; and &lt;http://www.coreboot.org/ASUS_F2A85-M&gt;.
* The GTX 660 Ti GPU was chosen because, as far as I can tell, both 2D and 3D graphics acceleration is supported with the free nouveau driver; see &lt;http://h-node.org/videocards/view/en/1001/&gt; and &lt;http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/HardwareStatus/&gt;.

And my questions for you guys:

* Does the AGPU on the AMD CPU pose a freedom issue? Are binary drivers or firmware required for it to work?
* Is the 3D / 2D acceleration using the nouveau driver for the GTX 660 Ti GPU too unstable to be usable?
* From this page: &lt;http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/FeatureMatrix/&gt; It seems that video decoding using my graphics card would require binary firmware? Is my assumption true? How important *is* video decoding?
* Are there any parts in this build that pose a freedom issue? Would Richard Stallman use this computer?

They will match contributions 3 times over.  Their new charity is the Free Software Foundation.  This is a great opportunity to support the FSF.  I think you have to be a Dreamhost user to take advantage though.  

Here is the Charity section from the Dreamhost September 2012 Newsletter (released 9/14):


&gt; New Charity: The Free Software Foundation
&gt;
&gt; June through August we solicited donations for ""StoryCorps,"" an independent nonprofit whose mission is to provide Americans of all backgrounds and beliefs with the opportunity to record, share, and preserve the stories of their lives.
&gt;
&gt;  http://storycorps.org
&gt;
&gt;15 of you - a whopping 0.0045% of our total customer base - donated to the cause, bringing in a total of $375.10, which we then TRIPLE MATCHED! This week we submitted a donation to StoryCorps for $1500.40 and we feel pretty good about it.
&gt;
&gt;Our next donation target is the Free Software Foundation.
&gt;
&gt;  http://www.fsf.org/
&gt;
&gt;The ""FSF"" works to secure freedom for computer users by promoting the development and use of free (as in freedom) software and documentation- particularly the GNU operating system - and by campaigning against threats to computer user freedom like Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) and software patents.
&gt;
&gt;So, okay, that description kind of makes them sound like the very definition of an Internet troll.  Truth is they do a lot more than just type in all caps and grow out their head hair.  Whether you realize it or not the Free Software Foundation is on YOUR side, fighting to - among other things - put full control of the devices that you already *own* in YOUR hands, and not in the hands of the people that made them.
&gt;
&gt; You can submit donations to the Free Software Foundation (which we'll then ultimately quadruple, as always!) from the ""Give to Charity"" section of your account control panel:
&gt;
&gt;  https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=home.charity
&gt;
&gt; I can't force you to donate, but I *can* send you a dead fish in the mail.  Consider that.",,False,,t5_2qh3i,False,,,True,t3_zwj3x,http://www.reddit.com/r/gnu/comments/zwj3x/quadruple_match_x3_donations_to_the_free_software/,

I traveled the world for 15 years, showing it to tens of thousands of people at computer shows and restaurant shows. Today GUIs descended, derived and copied from it are generally described as point of sale software and are found virtually everywhere.  In 1995 the software was rewritten in C and raw Xlib for UNIX and, in 1996, launched on Linux.   It is sometimes described as an application specific X Window Manager, indeed, a POS Window Manager.  It works nicely for many remote users in collaboration by making use of ssh and X forwarding, especially on tablets, (originally on the Hitachi VisionPlate with the Midori distribution that Linus created when he first arrived in the USA and was working at Transmeta).  

It is, alas, proprietary software but I would like to propose that the presentation layer, the touchscreen widgets and framework, be separated from the point of sale engine and released under GPL.  The benefits of this are many and I am willing to allow this to be done if there is anyone who is interested in doing this.  My web site is [here](http://www.viewtouch.com) and contact information is on my web site.

This is an ideal project for someone who is experienced in C, C++, Xlib and HTML5.  The end result I would like to see would be making available a very versatile touchscreen widget toolkit/layer and a rapid development application template for collaborative touchscreen applications of every kind for the free software community.",,False,,t5_2qh3i,False,,,True,t3_lgc4x,http://www.reddit.com/r/gnu/comments/lgc4x/a_call_for_assistance/,

Why does Stallman think Debian does not fit his rules for freedom? Just because there are nonfree packages in the repository doesn't mean Debian is nonfree -- it's up to the user to stay responsible and not download those said packages. It's completely possible for one to avoid those packages and keep Debian as clean as Trisquel or gNewSense -- especially with the help of vrms to make sure said person didn't do anything wrong by accident.

 What I'm trying to say here is that, when it comes to Debian, it's the user that is nonfree and not the operating system. So why isn't Debian on the list of free OSes?

But, we’ve entered into a strange sort of reversal of what is common on desktops. In the desktop OS world FOSS apps on non-free OSes are common. For example, Firefox on Windows. Android, however, is a FOSS OS with a glut of non-free apps. The applications I use on a regular basis are non-free, and I’m not particularly happy about that.

What we need now is what GNU did in the 80s but for Android. We need a project that sponsers and develops all of the tools people would want as their Android userland: a microblogging client, a music player, a video player, an IM client, widgets, a mail client, etc. We essentially need what GNOME does but without the desktop, OS, or APIs (well a GNUdroid launcher could be cool.)

It would be important that the entire set of apps share a design language and can inter-operate well. I don’t know if this idea has come up before but I think there’d be a real place for a meta-project like this. If I could replace all of the non-free software on my phone and tablet with a unified FOSS app collection I’d be a very happy man.

tl;dr Android's FOSS but most apps that people use on Android are not. We need a project like GNU or GNOME to develop and sponsor a collection of free apps for Android that can replace the non-free apps people use every day.

I do love Trisquel, but as someone who's barely computer literate, it is hard for me at times and really is a labour of love). 

With the recent ubuntu community issues, it seems many of it's users may be looking for a new 'home'. One of the things that has always bugged me about ubuntu is, while repeating the phrase 'Free software"" over and over like some sort of marketing benefit, they've never actually taught its users about Free software or what it is (the social movement behind it nor philosophy). In a way, they've actually coopted the term 'free software"" to mean ""open source"" in a lot of peoples minds (i.e. the belief that there's nothing wrong with TPM software, if it meets the four freedoms than it's Free software). 

Of course, ubuntu is not solely responsible for all of  the misinformation out there. However, I've already seen people who feel they've been disrespected say they are going to switch to Debian in comments and they're likely going to do it soon...all at once (yes, I've seen many say the same about mint, etc. but I haven't seen anything similar to a social contract or debians history from them). I think this may just be because those users feel slighted right now, but I also see an opportunity to teach too. As far as my understanding, Debian has always valued Freedom and has had goals that did not end with simply obtaining marketshare but I'm afraid the existing community may find themselves somewhat overwhelmed if they want to convey values to new users as well as welcoming them. Maybe, maybe not; Half of the reason for this post is to ask your thoughts on that?

What can we do to help out Debian if this current ubuntu community  situation does turn out to be a diaspora? I had a feeling something was up (and to be honest, I'm quite glad we haven't seen marketshare vultures from proprietary OS' yet :)), so about a week ago [I asked people not enticed by Freedom why they ran GNU/Linux](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/19985t/question_if_not_for_gnu_freedom_why_are_you/) .

Let me back up and be a bit more concrete. My younger brother is currently in college with an eye on law school. He loves technology but is rather technically ignorant. I've tried to explain the importance of free software to him (as it might be important for future law workers,) but to no avail; there's just too much background information.

Earlier this very evening, I started reading Free Software, Free Society. (I had previously read portions and snippets.) I was hoping to give a copy to my brother, that it would explain everything. But it doesn't. It throws out a lot of technical terms with little in the way of explanation. It's all very understandable to me, but I have a computer science degree and have been using free software for years (and some would say drinking the free software kool-aid.)

So I want a good introduction to free software for the computer illiterate, preferably in easily-loanable book form. A book about free software for people who don't know what source code is. For people who don't know why they should care, because they're just going to buy a computer with Windows/Mac OS preinstalled anyway. For people who can't distinguish between ""computer"" and ""operating system"" in the first place.

Nothing I've read fits the bill. Does anyone know of such a document?",,False,,t5_2qh3i,False,,,True,t3_fgm66,http://www.reddit.com/r/gnu/comments/fgm66/gnu_and_free_software_for_the_computer_illiterate/,

RMS was visiting my university, and I was the guy responsible for the website with informations and registration. One of the things requested was compatibility with librejs: http://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/ . And I think it's a little bit… impractical.

First of, I think we should think about minified javascript as we think about binaries of a program. Correct me if I'm wrong: Free programs can be distributed as binaries, as long as they have two things attached:
1. license
2. information how the user can get the source code.

Binary versions of almost all free software are available. That's convinient for the end user, and doesn't take from his freedom - he can always get the source if he wants.

Instead of taking this path and requiring some comment of specific format with a link to the sources and the license, libre.js decided that the programs have to be actually used in a source form. Which is less convenient for a user - pages are slower, in many cases that means making multiple requests (because concatenation of js files is often done as a step in minification process).

The option would be much harder to adopt for a companies. Even if the company would like to endorse freedom, it probably won't if it means additional meaningful costs in terms of transfer.

My proposed solution: in free javascript set some global variable, eg:
window.librejs = {license: ""GNU General Public License v2.0"", source: ""http://some_source_repository""}

What do you think? Could we think of minified javascript as binaries? Or do you think that what libre.js is doing right now is a proper solution?

I am a newly converted FLOSS user and are trying to find out ways to contribute to the cause of free software and/or the GNU Project. I am no expert in coding and the few things I have coded have been small scripts updating web pages and such, so I am trying to find new ways to contribute to the community.

I have done translations in the past, reddit.com among others, and currently the FSFE.org website. But now I want to try something new, so I thought of documentation writer. It seems like a somewhat unwanted position but I like to write so it might be fun. I learned the basics of Texinfo to get me started as it seems like the best choice. 

My questions is as following: 

How do I start out? Where do I find projects that seek documentation writers? If I do get ""hired"" to do the writing, how do I interact with the developers? Should I be this annoying bug that bothers everyone or should I mostly just try and figure stuff out for myself?

And tips, adviced, experiences or feedback would be greatly appreciated!

I'm currently a student worker with the IT department at my university who is working on a GPL'd project that was picked up from another University. The original developers of the project (those from the other University) had the code copyrighted by their University. I'm unaware of whether my university owns the copyright to my code or not, as my involvement in the project is rather complicated. In the event that they do, and all work I do on this GPL'd project is copyrighted by them, do I still retain the right to create a derivative work that while remaining GPL'd also provides a commercial (though still Libre) element?

The project is a web application, which I have almost completely rewritten from the original project. It's licensed under the GPL version 2 or above. I've been thinking about the future of the project and after completing what is requested by me from my employer, I want to spin it off as a separate GPL'd project using most of the code I've written for them and provide my own hosted, SaaS-like solution in which I can sell hosting and support. If my university does own the copyright on my code, is this still allowed?

It's my understanding that since it is GPL'd, they're not able to prevent myself from assuming the same kinds of rights and thus it must remain GPL'd.",,False,,t5_2qh3i,False,,,True,t3_1576q1,http://www.reddit.com/r/gnu/comments/1576q1/gpl_copyright_ownership_question_please_see_post/,

If something like that were done, I think it would be nice to have copies of GNU/Linux people could take home to run live, or install. The issue I see is the completely libre systems would likely not give the smoothest experience for a non-technical user, and something like Ubuntu would somewhat run counter to the free software message.  

The intricacies of the situation could be explained at a seminar, but at an outdoor, quickly moving event things need to be more succinct. How can one extol the virtues of free software, but give people semi-free software to use?

They found that functionality in a plugin, but the plugin required hefty license fees. I decided it would be far cheaper for me to rewrite the desired functionality of the plugin myself (from scratch) than to pay for licenses for the entire company. Long story short, it works.

So, my question is, can I release my sourcecode? It's probably not widely-needed functionality, but the need existed in my company at least, and a paid plugin exists, so someone must be using it. It is, however, functionality taken directly from an existing plugin, I don't claim any kind of creativity in the matter at all. Even the user interface is basically identical (it was just a Windows Form), and although I could rearrange the buttons and sections and whatnot, my company didn't need any more or any less functionality than what's in the original plugin, so both plugins have the same buttons.

Any advice?

So then this DRM technology is introduced so that they can still base their business models on scarcity - if something is rare you can get a lot of money for it. This is done by having a ""black box"" computer program that only grants you certain types of access to the files/games and also enables the company certain types of privileges (e.g. upgrading or deleting it). [N.B. those old games that required the CD to play aren't considered DRM]

And I think what you described as optimal is possible: They could build a system that restricted certain actions (like copying the files to another computer or over the internet, or skipping adverts, for example) by technological rather than legal means while still doing everything just as the consumer wants.. but my view is that's not the end of it. There's still something I care about that's being threatened: freedom. If it becomes mandatory of have black boxes on your computer it'll be the end of computers being a tool we use, but instead we'll be at the mercy of computers.

My ideal would be that people distribute freedom-respecting software and put legal restrictions on it (like make it illegal to distribute it over the internet). [analogy warning] DRM to me seems like doing a retina scan on anyone that wants to drive a car, and confirming it with some third party organisation before letting the engine go. My biggest worry is that instead of putting legal restrictions on the files they distribute they start to put legal restrictions on the technology we use. Being able to use your computer freely for things like writing your own programs or running an operating system that you're able to check the source code of could become outlawed.

**explanation** I've been trying for a long time to explain my view on DRM in a simple way (it necessarily demands technical understanding, so this is difficult) and also without sounding patronizing or anything like that. I'll be grateful for any objections and amendments if you have any!

* the majority of companies ask you to sign a non-disclosure agreement if you are to develop software for them

* the definition of in-house software can mean that the organization holds the copyright over that software and you will violate their copyright if you copy it for other projects.

I love GPL because it strongly encourages people to contribute back to the community. I do, however, recognize that a library I'm designing would be more widely used if it were released under a more permissive license and would likely be better accepted by the community I'm designing it for. 

**Now for the crux of the question**: In one of my previous GPL projects, I co-authored a script to automate unit testing. If I obtain the permission of my co-author, can I re-license that particular script (it will remain GPL in the other projects we use it in) to be usable in this other project?

From what I understand, if I were to use an MIT or BSD license (for example), I could not incorporate GPL'd code in that project. So if I understand what I've read correctly, I think I can re-license that code so long as a (previous) version remains GPL'd.

Well, less-than half, if you include that one would want it to work on windows too.

I know GNU is about libre software but:

* Nonlibre software is a fact of life anyway in most installations of linux. Why not allow payed-for nonlibre software too.

* You could make payment/donation for libre software optional.

* It is also about freedom to use your computer, if someone wants to use nonfree software, so be it.

* If organized properly, EFF can be trusted to be inpartial in dealing with it. Unlike Apple(evidently!) or Steam(haven't seen any yet.)

While we're at it, perhaps make a wiki(+little forum?) for every entry in apt-get/whichever system we're talking about.

Edit: Nowhere is it implied they take over repos. Obviously they'd make the system libre, and then host one themselves.",,False,,t5_2qh3i,True,,,True,t3_cmucv,http://www.reddit.com/r/gnu/comments/cmucv/why_doesnt_gnueff_make_an_appstore/,
