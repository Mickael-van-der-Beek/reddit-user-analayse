I have ~1000rating on chess.com.

When I was in my ""athlete"" days, I would pride myself on how I would use my brain to get through a game. In baseball, I always seemed to know what pitch was coming, and in football, I had a knack for knowing what the opposition was trying to do. I probably was a better player than I should have been, because I had almost no real athletic ability, but I managed to do pretty well. I learned to listen to pros am college coaches on (for lack of a better term) ""how the pros mind works"". For example, what goes through a major league baseball players mind
during an at bat? Once I learned to think like that, I became a much more effective player, given my lack of the size, speed, strength.

So my broad question is...what went through Fischer or Kasporavs mind during a match? How did they think their way through a game? Another question would be, how does a master process a game vs a grandmaster or even a noob (like me)?

I feel like if I can figure out how good players think, it may give me an easier road to improving my game.  Perhaps there is no good answer, showing my naïveté, but I figured I'd see what r/chess had to say.",,False,self,t5_2qhr7,False,,,True,t3_1j8lzu,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1j8lzu/how_does_a_master_think_his_way_through_a_game/,

Completely self-taught (no coach). I'm willing to answer anything about chess, chess improvement, chess openings, chess books and software, the world of master level chess tournaments, chess psychology, USCF, FIDE, etc.... anything you could think of chess related.

Edit 1: While answering questions I have realized how important having a community of other chess players around has been in my development. By playing in a handful of clubs, at a Starbucks in my area where people gamble on blitz, and a lot of USCF tournaments has given me the opportunity to ask lots of questions to strong players. I guess I never really thought about it too much before, but this is where I got a lot of book recommendations, opening advice, general tournament advice, etc.

Edit 2: Links, etc. I will add to this list as I remember stuff.

1. Develop knights before bishops.

""I was playing in a tournament in germany one year when a man approached me. Thinking he just wanted an autograph, I reached for my pen, when the man made a startling announcement. 'I've solved chess!' I sensibly started to back away, in case the man was dangerous as well as insane, but the man continued: 'I'll bet you 1000 marks that if you come back to my hotel room I can prove it to you.' Well, 1000 marks was 1000 marks, so I humored the fellow and accompanied him to his room.""

""Back at the room, we sat down at his chess board. 'I've worked it all out, white mates in 12 no matter what.' I played black with perhaps a bit incautiously, but I found to my horror that white's pieces coordinated very strangely, and that I was going to be mated on the 12th move!""

""I tried again, and I played a completely different opening that couldn't possibly result in such a position, but after a series of very queer-looking moves, once again I found my king surrounded, with mate to fall on the 12th move. I asked the man to wait while I ran downstairs and fetched Emmanuel Lasker, who was world champion before me. He was extremely skeptical, but agreed to at least come and play. Along the way we snagged Alekhine, who was then world champion, and the three of us ran back up to the room.""

""Lasker took no chances, but played as cautiously as could be, yet after a bizarre, pointless-looking series of maneuvers, found himself hemmed in a mating net from which there was no escape. Alekhine tried his hand, too, but all to no avail.""

""It was awful! Here we were, the finest players in the world, men who had devoted our very lives to the game, and it was all over! The tournaments, the matches, everything - chess had been solved, white wins.""

About this time Capa's friends would break in, saying ""Wait a minute, I never heard anything about all this! What happened?""

""Why, we killed him, of course.""",,False,self,t5_2qhr7,False,,,True,t3_lk72l,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/lk72l/a_rare_chess_joke/,

If you answer 1.Nf3 with e5 because you didn't notice your pawn could be taken then don't post your shitty game. Use some damn quality control.

Chess players would rather see a game you lost but played well than some godawful game where you won by stumbling into a mate.

Analyze your games with an engine before you submit them. See faq for free engines and interfaces. That way you won't ask for critiques of games where you failed to notice the guy had his queen hanging for 3 moves and you didn't take it.

Chess players like helping other players but some of you are wearing out the goodwill of the good players by asking them to review games that everyone including you should forget ever happened.

He remained a strong player as he got older and was still giving simul tours in his 80s. He played in the London blitz tournament aged 88.

In 1949, when he was 84, he played an exhibition game against a master from the Netherlands, van Foreest, who was 86.

After the game, which he won, he announced to the gallery:

""Youth has triumphed!""

Learned the game two months ago:  
&gt; *If I play Qb3, then he'll take on e4 with his queen.  I better play something else.  Maybe I should attack his bishop with my pawn.*

1400:  
&gt; *I better protect e4 so I can play Qb3.*

1600:  
&gt; *I want to play Qb3.  Is anything hanging?  Ah yeah, e4.  Wait, Qxe4 isn't possible due to Re1.  Qb3 it is.*

1800: 
&gt; *I want to play Qb3.  Looks like e4 isn't really hanging, but then he'll double my pawns with Bxf3.  I better chase him away first.*

2100: 
&gt; *Qb3 Qxe4 Re1 done, Qb3 Bxf3 gxf3 is fine, Qb3 b6 c5 is more than fine, okay what else does he have.  Wait, Qb3 Bxf3 gxf3 h5, then Bh6 in lines... uh.  No, he doesn't have time for that, I'll just push c5.  He'll probably just finish transferring that bishop.  Last check, Qb3 Bxf3 gxf3 h5 c5 Bh6 Kh1 Rg8 Rg1, okay yeah that's fine.  Qb3 it is.*

FM: 
&gt; *Well, Qb3 is standard here, but I wonder if the inclusion of f2-f4 and f7-f6 changes anything.  Maybe I should play the prophylactic Kh1 first, seeing as both the g1-a7 diagonal and the g file might become important soon.  Yeah, I remember seeing that before.  Kh1.*

IM: 
&gt; *Now what the hell did Vityugov play here at the Aeroflot Open... or was it the Russian Higher League... something.  Was it Qb3 first and then Kh1, or Kh1 first... no, I think Kh1 can wait, let him figure out what he's doing with that bishop first.  Right, Qb3 Bh6 Kh1 is what he played, and Black had problems along the c file.  Okay, Qb3.*

A Reddit chess tournament"" Tournament. 

I have condensed the title for ease of typing to: 1st Official Reddit Chess Tournament. 

But the real name is the 1st Official (but 3rd in reality) Reddit /r/chess Tournament aka ""Three horse sized pawns or one pawn sized horse? A Reddit chess tournament"" Tournament. Do not forget that. Ever. 

Here is how it works: 

1. Be a reddit member. If you are not, go away and signup for reddit.com. Then after you have marinated in reddit.com for several months and consider yourself a legit redditor, you will then feel worthy to join future tournaments. In the future. Not today. 

2. Sign up. If you aren't a Chess.com member, signup for free here: www.chess.com/register.  Then choose your correct tournament section from this list:

&lt;1199        http://www.chess.com/tournament/1st-official-reddit-tournament-1199

1200-1399   http://www.chess.com/tournament/1st-official-reddit-tournament-1200-1399

1400-1599   http://www.chess.com/tournament/1st-official-reddit-tournament-1400-1599

1600-1799   http://www.chess.com/tournament/1st-official-reddit-tournament-1600-1799

1800+        http://www.chess.com/tournament/1st-official-reddit-tournament-1800

If you aren't yet a Chess.com member, you will be put in the 1200-1399 section (1200 is our default starting rating). 

Games are all rated with 3 days per move. You will be in groups of 6, and play all games at once (so, 10 games at a time). 

3. Post your reddit name in the tournament comments. That way we know who to make fun of when we see you on reddit. Or severely shame if we catch you cheating (see below). 

4. Don't Cheat. That means: don't get help from friends. Don't use computers. If you think the biggest chess site doesn't know when you are cheating, you are in for a jolly surprise. Not only will your Chess.com account get closed, but we will post a list of cheaters in /r/chess with their reddit names. Plus, http://i.qkme.me/3u6c0m.jpg

5. Win Prizes. Each section has the following prizes:
- 1st Place: 1 year Reddit Gold, 1 hour lesson with Grandmaster Coach, 1 year Chess.com Diamond Membership
- 2nd Place: 1 year Diamond Membership
- 3rd Place: 1 year Chess.com Gold Membership

Again, signup here: http://www.chess.com/register and get started!

Alright, this channel is massive. With more than 2500 videos it is easily the largest chess channel on youtube. It is run by Tryfone Gavriel, english player and owner of chessworld.net. His videos fall into 6 categories

1: Analysis of master games (all your heart could desire, from Morphy to Carlsen)

2: Analysis of his own personal games

3: Evolution of Chess Style (a series where he looks a different games throughout history and shows how the style of play has evolved)

4: Blitz-chess with live commentary (Tryfone is a strong blitzplayer and has crushed many GMs and IMs on the ICC. His lucid and humorous live-annotation is always great fun to watch)
Here is a link to what I consider his best and/or most entertaining live-commentary games:

* http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL993A3DFEFEF27206&amp;feature=mh_lolz

5: Warzone Tournaments with live commentary (the Warzone is a relatively new concept originated by chesscube.com - the idea is to pair players against new opponents immediately after their game is over. The player who has scored the most points after the alloted time is over will win the tournament. Time controls are usually 1 minute and the videos are usually about 30 min to 1 hour in length.

6: Opening-videos (explaining how different openings work)

So what is good about this channel? Well, Tryfone Gavriel aka KingsCrusher has a soothing and pleasant voice which he uses to provide insightful and entertaining commentary and analysis. Also there is a growing community revolving around the channel and his website.

This is the Chess Channel of Christof Sielecki. He is a german International Master with an Elo Rating of 2402 (July 2012).

Presents various chess videos, ranging from online blitz videos with commentary to personal games, classic games, sparring matches with Kingscrusher and much more. Christof is a very strong player but he somehow seems to have a ""beginners mind"" - he descripes positions from scratch instead of assuming a lot of knowledge by the viewer.

* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhnDzk9IVAA&amp;feature=channel_video_title

A very interesting documentary covering the match between world champion Garry Kasparov and the supercomputer Deep Thought (which later evolved into Deep Blue).

This is not a link to a channel, since ""twistedlot"" who uploaded the video keeps a lot of unrelated videos on his channel. Therefore I have posted the direct link to part 1 of the video - you should be able to find part 2 and 3 in the youtube sidebar.

A documentary where we get a close look at a young Garry Kasparov as he takes on 6 of the best american junior players in a clock simul.

There's nothing wrong with playing blitz, and there's nothing wrong with being a weak player trying to get better, but most of the time there's really nothing in it for you or for commentators when you post offhand, low-quality blitz games. Often the poster feels that there's an interesting special feature in the game that justifies it, but usually it's obscured by the entire game being just garbage tactically. A winning queen sacrifice isn't very cool if it was really just a trivial blunder in a game where the evaluation swings wildly from side to side as neither player is bothering to pay attention.

Do yourself a favour and play a long game, look at it yourself, and *then* post it here for others to critique. That's the way to really come to enjoy chess, and to get stronger.

I guess the point I'm trying to get to is, are there any other players who would like to see some more detailed discussions? For instance, we could talk about openings or in depth looks at grandmaster events, etc. ",,False,self,t5_2qhr7,False,,,True,t3_slwq7,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/slwq7/content_on_rchess/,

1366815378.0,68,self.chess,1d0gbv,Always wanted to post my way of picturing just how big a game chess is. Finally got around to writing it.,iglookid,77,9,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1d0gbv/always_wanted_to_post_my_way_of_picturing_just/,"Just [came across](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1cz41n/what_is_the_most_unbelievable_fact_you_have_ever/c9lexyk) a mention of the fact that the number possible chess games is larger than the number of stars in the universe. However, things are obviously *way* crazier and I outline below a way to get a feel for the large numbers. I find this interesting because this makes it clear to me that even though computers have beaten humans at chess, they will never be able to solve it, at least with currently used forms of computation.

Imagine this:

- Take a computer which can generate *10 million billion* unique chess games (or outcomes) per second. The [fastest civilian computer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(supercomputer\)) today should be able to achieve this.
- Replace *all the atoms in the known universe*, each with such a computer.
- Have all of these computers run in parallel *since the beginning of the universe* till today!

If you somehow arrange things so that only unique outcomes are generated between all the computers, then you will *still fall short by a factor of 10 million*! In other words, only if you had replaced each of the atoms in the universe *by 10 million such computers*, and have them run continuously since the big bang, would you have exhausted all the possible chess outcomes.

Even if you managed to generate all these outcomes, where would you store them? If the entire universe was your hard disk, you would have to store 10,000 trillion trillion trillion games per atom to be able to store your entire database.

References:

- Number of chess outcomes: Roughly [10^120](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number).
- Number of atoms in the known universe: Roughly [10^80](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe#Matter_content).
- Age of universe in seconds: Roughly [10^17 seconds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe).
- Speed of current fastest civilian supercomputer: Over [10 petaFLOPs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(supercomputer\)) (or 10^15 FLOPs).

Note that I've used only order-of-magnitude calculations here. This is perfectly justified, because many of the numbers are rough estimates. For example, a note in the [Shannon number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number) Wikipedia article states that someone has estimated the complexity of chess to be not less than 10^(123). This would mean that the above calculations would be off by a factor of 1000, and you would need to replace each atom by 10 **b**illion supercomputers!

If you're interested, here is how I imagine the size of [Go](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(board_game\)). If you consider *only the humanly-playable* Go games, you end up with a game-tree complexity of around [10^700](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_and_mathematics#Game_tree_complexity). To achieve that number, you would have to take all of the atoms of our universe, and *replace each one of them with a universe like ours*! Then collect all of the atoms from all of these universe, and *replace all of them with a universe like ours*! Wait, we aren't done yet! Repeat this atom-universe replacement once more, and once more, and once more... roughly *seven times* in all! After that you will have to then go through the above thing of replacing all those atoms with supercomputers, yadda-yadda, to achieve Go complexity!

But, wait!

This was only humanly-playable Go games! By this I mean Go games as they are commonly encountered between humans, which end when the humans decide to end the game (if I understand it correctly). If you consider all theoretically possible Go games, which can go on for much longer, the lower limit for the complexity is 10^10^48, and the upper limit is 10^(10^171). If we take the more conservative estimate, 10^(10^48), then we are talking about doing the atom-universe replacements 10^46 times! That is a little short of the number of atoms that make up earth (10^(50)).

That's all, and thank you for reading, if you made it till here :) I may have made mistakes (especially in Go), do mention if you spot any.

He got there just ahead of Raymundo, Stean, Nunn and others.

He said he did not have a style, he just made moves. He was a strong tournament player, his best results being in Tilburg 1984 and 1985 (the latter which, due to a bad back, he played mostly on a [massage table] (http://imgur.com/wLOhw). )

He [famously beat](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1068157) Karpov, the then champ, with 1...a6 in reply to Karpov's 1.e4.

Miles, like Rubinstein, was troubled by mental illness, but recovered. He died too young as a result of complications from diabetes.

He was well read in chess history and a good writer. He wrote many articles and reviews for Kingpin and NIC. He is the author of the most famous chess book review in history.

1296499294.0,63,self.chess,fcj1k,Chess FAQ for beginners,shmageggy,65,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/fcj1k/chess_faq_for_beginners/,"This FAQ is for the beginning player who probably recognizes the beatuy and complexity of chess, but is unsure how to go about learning the game and making sense of the myriad resources available. It assumes you know the rules of the game but not much else, have an internet connection, and are motivated to improve on your own.

* **Q. What is the best way to improve my game?**

* **A.** In short, learn and practice tactics. Knowledge of openings, complex endgames, positional considerations, etc are all essential, but for a beginner nothing will better your game as rapidly as improving your tactical ability.  When you tire of tactics and want to play, focus on slow time control games so you have an opportunity to analyze each move rather than just playing reflexively.  You should also be aware of how to win basic endgames such as K+P vs K and K+R vs K.

* **Q. How can I improve my tactics?**
* **A.** Learn the basic tactical motifs and then practice, practice, practice. Learn the motifs on websites like [chesstactics.org](http://www.chesstactics.org/) or with books like [Yasser Sierawan's Winning Chess Tactics](http://www.amazon.com/Winning-Chess-Tactics-Yasser-Seirawan/dp/1857443330). Practice by going through tactical exercises with a computer program like CT-ART or online at sites like [chesstempo.com](http://chesstempo.com/) or [chess.emrald.net](http://chess.emrald.net/).

* **Q. What are some useful chess websites.** 
* **A.** [chesscafe.com](http://www.chesscafe.com/) has lots of articles and essays and links, with the [Novice Nook](http://www.chesscafe.com/heisman/heisman.htm) section being particularly helpful for beginners.  [chessgames.com](http://www.chessgames.com/) is an online database of nearly every high level game in history, many with comments or annotation.

* **Q. How can I play chess online?**
* **A.** You can play on a chess server like [FICS](http://www.freechess.org/) (free) or [ICC](http://www.chessclub.com/) (paid). You can also play in your browser on websites like [lichess.org](http://lichess.org/) or [chess.com](http://www.chess.com/).

* **Q. What are some recommended books?**
* **A.** There are thousands upon thousands of chess books, but the most helpful to me was Yasser Seirawan's Winning Chess series.

* **Q. How can I use a computer program to improve?**
* **A.** The most common use of computer programs is to analyze your games. This helps you find tactical shots you or your opponent missed. You can also play games against certain engines that have a limited strength mode such as Shredder.  Some programs include helpful lessons and tutorials, such as [Chessmaster](http://www.chessmaster.com/), and most have some sort of database function where you can store your games.

* **Q. What computer programs are available?**
* **A.** You will need a GUI (graphical user interface) and a chess engine. The most popular GUIs are [Fritz](http://www.chessbase-shop.com/en/categories/49) (paid), [Aquarium](http://chessok.com/?page_id=29) (paid), and [Arena](http://www.playwitharena.com/) (free). They typically come with at least one engine but many engines are available online. Free engines, which are just as strong as commercial ones for all practical purposes, include [Crafty](http://www.craftychess.com/) and [Stockfish](http://www.stockfishchess.com/). Paid engines include [Rybka](http://www.rybkachess.com/) and [Shredder](http://www.shredderchess.com/).",,False,self,t5_2qhr7,True,,,True,t3_fcj1k,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/fcj1k/chess_faq_for_beginners/,

I did a wee bit of research and found that out of our seven mods, only *one* appears to be even slightly active within the subreddit. And what of the other *six* you might ask? Well those other six have a combined total of ONE SINGLE COMMENT in the past year, maybe more, on this subreddit.

Now I'm not on a witch hunt here or anything, I wont name any names, but seeing as how my popular request to simply update the sidebar has been entirely ignored so far by the mods, I think the community needs to take its own action. Simply put, we need new moderators who care about the community. I mean think about it. How often do you see a post that can be easily answered by the FAQ, or a comment that is nothing but rude and offtopic, or a game that is posted in clear violation of the posting guidelines. These bad posts detract from the quality of the subreddit in general, and isn't it the mods' jobs to deal with these things that are clearly laid out as against the rules? It would be nice if the current mods could chime in on what exactly it is they do here.

Perhaps I am wrong here though. Maybe the mods do plenty of things behind the scenes. After all, when a mod does his job right, you wouldn't know he's done anything at all.

1317075286.0,60,self.chess,ks9r6,Just realized a neat trick for calculating knight moves (for beginners and veterans alike),BaconMaker,62,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/ks9r6/just_realized_a_neat_trick_for_calculating_knight/,"***Semi-long read, but worth it if you want to calculate faster and deeper!*** *(And who doesn't want that?)*

So I got to thinking about the pattern knights move in, and I realized I can only easily visualize the squares that a knight can land on after one move. Therefore I have to re-visualize the position after each move, which can detract from my ability to look deeply into positions.  I thought it would be beneficial to be able to visualize the squares that are two, three, or even four moves away, without any calculating, and after some thinking, I figured out an easy way to do so. Here it goes, I'll try to use pictures whenever I can:

* 
[First, here is an optimally placed knight.](http://i.imgur.com/0xydk.png)

* 
[Second, here are the squares an optimally placed knight can land on after one move, marked in red (for extreme danger). Simple stuff.  This is probably what most of you visualize when looking at knight moves, no?](http://i.imgur.com/ismF2.png)

* 
[Next, let's add the squares you can land on after two moves, marked in yellow (for caution).  Notice how many more squares you can choose from. Notice also that these comprise almost all of the white squares except for five.](http://i.imgur.com/oAXqU.png)

* [Going even further, let's add all the squares that are 3 moves away, marked in blue (for slight safety). These fill up all remaining black squares.](http://i.imgur.com/OE95u.png)


* [Lastly, there are 5 squares, marked in green \(for very safe\), that despite looking close, actually take four moves to land on.](http://i.imgur.com/97SEf.png)


Now this all looks very colorful and pretty, but so what? Well let's look at the pattern. In particular, I'm going to look at the [5x5 square surrounding the knight,](http://i.imgur.com/uGkeS.png) because knights are primarily close quarters combatants compared to their counterpart, the bishop.

As you can see, the closer a square is to a knight, the longer it takes to move there. This is useful to know because instead of this: 

1. looking at the original 8 squares the knight can land on and choosing one

2. looking at the next 8 squares the knight can land on from that new location and choosing a new square to go to

3. looking at another 8 squares that the knight can land on from this 3rd position and seeing if it lands on the square you originally wanted to land on.

... you can just do this:

1. Is the square I want to go to on the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd ring? (going from the outer ring first to the inner ring third)

2. Know that the nth ring take n moves to reach (with the exception of the corners, which take four moves).

Seems a lot easier, doesn't it? With practice, I'm sure you can visualize this 5x5 square pattern just as easily as you visualize the first 8 squares a knight can land on, if not then easier.  Once you master that, then you could even go so far as to memorize the pattern outside of the 5x5 box, but I feel like that might be too much to start out with, and frankly not as useful.

Alright, so now that you can easily find out how many moves it takes to get to a square within your 5x5 box, finding a possible route is easy. You just have to keep the pattern visualized, and then jump (**EDIT** For clarity, you are making knight moves in this stage, not just any jump to a different color. The jump has to be a legal knight move) BACKWARDS from green (if applicable) to blue (if applicable) to yellow to red.

**EDIT/**: But, what if that route you find is already occupied by one or more of your pieces, or is otherwise in-traversable? Well the solution according to my idea requires a tad more mental hoops to jump through, but it is still doable. Say you want to get 1 square to the left in [this position.](http://i.imgur.com/qhZz4.png)  Well we immediately know that square takes three moves minimum to arrive at because it is blue when we overlay our new diamond pattern. The process is similar to before, you just have to eliminate certain squares as you jump from from blue to yellow to red. So we look at our blue square and determine that [these](http://i.imgur.com/132Z8.png) are the only yellow squares that you have to choose from due to the black pawns. Next, you look at which of these yellow squares can be reached in one move from the red squares, and you get [this.](http://i.imgur.com/5bQiy.png) A little more thinking can tell you that the top left yellow square is actually falsely yellow despite there not being a black pawn there, because it falls on the corner of our 5x5 square (something you could have noticed immediately). I'll admit this method becomes more difficult on a crowded board, but with practice, you should be able to apply these geometric principles as easily as any other chess concept.**/EDIT**

I haven't found a foolproof way to calculate a move order that works the first time every time, but in general, this seems to work for me.  It is similar to how a maze is often easier if you start at the end and work backwards to the beginning. I think it might have something to do with *reducing* the amount of possible moves as you work backward as compared to *increasing* the amount of possible moves as you move forward, but that's just a guess.

So there you have it. Maybe some of you already knew this, but I just figured it out on my own and I'm excited about that. There might even be ways to improve on this method, but as of now, I can't find any improvements. Let me know if it helps!",,False,self,t5_2qhr7,True,,,True,t3_ks9r6,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/ks9r6/just_realized_a_neat_trick_for_calculating_knight/,

If you spend time on one thing, even if it's productive, it's a waste if you could be doing something better.

2. **Keep your eye on the prize**. No matter how much material you win along the way, if your actions are not moving you toward your goals, they're pointless.

3. **Everything you choose means sacrificing something**. Every moment is a choice between many options and each option is a compromise. The goal is to choose the best one.

4. **Don’t be afraid to lose**. If you’re scared of exposing a weakness, you’ll never take the steps required to reach your goals. Face your fear, find the correct choice as quickly as possible, and trust your judgement. It may not work out, but you’ll have a better chance to gain something, if only experience.

5. **Don't count on fate**. Don't assume that your opponent is going to make a mistake or anything in life is going to go your way even if it's illogical. Hope for the best, but plan for the worst. 

6. **Adapt**. Everything changes every moment and every move. Have a plan, but be ready to walk away from it at a moment's notice when the evidence is against it or a better opportunity shows up.

7. **Never assume that everything is lost**. Things work out in funny ways, weird stuff happens, and your opponents make mistakes, especially when they're overconfident.

8. **Be prepared to walk away**. Even if there’s always a chance, sometimes it’s just not worth it. Rather than wasting time on a lost cause out of pride or inertia, take the loss and sunk costs, and move on to a more worthwhile pursuit.

9. **Horses can jump over stuff better than people**. Not really true. World records for horse and human high jumps are about the same.

1.c4 c5 2.Nc3 g6 3.g3 Bg7 4.Bg2 Nc6 5.Nf3 d6 6.O-O Qd7 $5 
    {This is an idea of Bent Larsen which I've seen labelled as 
    interesting but also passive. That might be so, but it's also quite 
    difficult to play against.}
7.d3 b6 8.Rb1 Bb7 9.Bd2 
    {A sensible precaution as in some cases Black can play Bxc3 to double 
    White's pawn on the c-file.}
9...Nh6 
    {Avoids blocking the long diagonal and prepares Nf5 to gain a strong 
    grip on d4.}
10.a3 Nf5 11.b4 
    {White plays a standard pawn advance on the Queenside. However Black's
    queenside doesn't present any obvious weaknesses to exploit.}
11...O-O 12.b5 
    {I think this is a mistake. White fixes the pawn structure and gains 
    space on the queenside but invites exchanges which usually favour the 
    side with less space.}
12...Ncd4 13.Nxd4 Nxd4 14.e3 Bxg2 15.Kxg2 Qb7+ 
    {Black controls both long diagonals and takes over the initiative.}
16.e4 
    {White blocks the long diagonal and takes control of d5 but gives 
    Black an outposts on d4. }
    ( 16.f3 {Simply forcing Black to move his Knight.} )
16...f5 
    {Black uses pin on the long diagonal to attack and weaken Whites 
    center.}
17.f3 fxe4 18.dxe4 Rf7 
    {Prepares to double on the f-file to target White's backward f3 pawn 
    which supports e4.}
19.Nd5 Raf8 20.f4 
    {White is forced to weaken e4.}
20...e6 $1 
    {Kicks the knight from d5, opens the 7th rank allowing Black's Queen 
    to slide across to the King-side, re-establishes the pin of e4 on the 
    long diagonal and weakens f4 by removing a defender.}
21.Nc3 g5 
    {Exploits the pin on the f-file and e pawn to attack and further 
    weaken White's center.}
22.Qh5 gxf4 23.Bxf4 Nf5 
    {Again, using the pin on the long diagonal, Black creates a discovered
    attack on Nc3 which is now the sole defender of e4.}
24.Qg4 
    {White pins the g7 Bishop and defends the e pawn laterally}
24...Kh8 25.Bd2 Bd4 
    {e3 and f2 look very weak. Black has threats like Ne3+, forking King, 
    Queen and Rook or Nh4+ Qxh4 Rf2+ attacking the King and Bishop.}
26.Rbe1 Be3 
    {Here I looked at pretty much every legal move available including Ne3
    and Nxg3 which I probably would've ended up playing in a live game. 
    However, I worked out that White could swap off most Blacks pieces and
    I didn't fancy playing an endgame where my King was so far from the 
    center. Instead I decided to just swap White's active Bishop and wait 
    and see what White does after Nd4.}
27.Qe2 Bxd2 28.Qxd2 Nd4 
    {Black has every piece homing in on the f3 square.}
29.Qd3 Qe7 
    {I didn't like moving my Queen off the long diagonal, but I couldn't 
    see anything better and thought I might be able to take control of the
    other long diagonal instead.}
30.Ne2 
    {This looks terrible since it removes 2 defenders of the e4 square, 
    the Knight c3 and the Rook e1. }
30...Nf3 
    {I saw this move instantly and had to stop myself from playing it 
    while I worked through the variations.}
31.Rd1 Ne5 32.Qc3 Qb7 
    {Blacks Queen returns to the long diagonal}
33.Qc2 Ng4 34.Qc3+ Kg8 
    {Finally the e4 pawn falls, and White decides to call it a day.}
0-1

After the game has concluded, you are able to watch the pieces fly across space, whether it is in your mind or a screen, and you see each piece moving with a purpose.

This is my vote for the missing content. A while ago I found my old folder of score sheets and decided to annotate a few of them. Because this is what I'd like you to do also. I'd like to see:

* Games that are intense. One-sided crushing victories are not interesting.
* Human analysis, not engine lines revealing subtle mistakes nobody could figure out in real situations. A move is good if it's too difficult to refute. Against human, against a computer.
* Feedback in comments. Nobody wants to publish to a graveyard.
* A local nerd feeding this into a computer anyway and posting the mathematical truth.

I'll start with this very flawed, very intense game, between equally rated opponents. The Finnish rating is close to Elo, maybe 50-100 points lower that equal USCF. If you don't have the reddit inline PGN viewer, install it now from the right panel.

{ This is one of my most intense games. In a 5 round with 2HR/game sudden death 
time control, I got everything I wanted and then blew it in one move. After that 
the real excitement started. }
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 
{The old Nimzo line in Sicilian has been an old time favorite of mine. 
The ultra sharp 3 e5 lines require extensive opening knowledge, and are 
impossible to play without extensive preparation. I have a great surplus 
of points from those lines, one victim was 1987 Finnish Champion Mika Ebeling. 
The quiet moves go to Kings-Indian attack, which I'm happy to meet }
3. d3 Nc6 4. g3 d5 5. Nbd2 e5 6. Bg2 Be7 
7. O-O O-O 8. c3  h6 
{ Questionable move. The idea is right, I'm going to play Be6 and I need 
to prevent Ng5, but move order is wrong. I have no intention to play d5-d4 
and get mated a tempo faster than in KID, so I was planning to play either 
d5xe4, or wait for e4xd5 and create reversed Maroczy bind. The exd4 felt too early. 
Now the most principled move is exd5! Nxd5 Re1 and 
the normal support move f7-f6 leaves h6 look just silly. White has dangerous
tactical chances in the center. In the game continuation it just loses a tempo. }
9. Qb3 {?} dxe4 {!} 10. dxe4 Qc7 11. Re1 Be6 12. Qc2 b5 
{ I have managed win a tempo, making this just reversed 
exchange Kings Indian. }
13. Nf1 Rad8 14. Ne3 c4 15.  Nh4 Rfe8 16. Nef5 Bf8 
{ So far White has played logically. Since I'm obviously better in the queen side,
he plays for an attack too. I'm not afraid. I like the style of Steinitz and 
Korchnoi, slight inconvenience is well justified if the reward is permanent 
superiority. The next move is just a horrific blunder. The move a2-a4 would be 
good if white could force axb5, opening a file for his rook. But this just 
weakens b4, creates weak pawn on a4, loses a tempo, and does absolutely nothing
for white. Any other would be better. }
17. a4 {??} b4 {Of course. cxb4 Nxb4 is totally crushing. White now starts again
logically, but I'm a move ahead what I should be. }
18. h3 Rd7 19. g4 Red8 
{Red8?? and the tide turns. I made this natural move fast, confident that my total
control of the center and queen side will just play itself. Except, that I didn't 
look look what the 100% obvious reply is...}
20. g5 hxg5 21. Bxg5
{ I intentionality avoid all the four letter words in my analysis, although 
unfortunately this time I find no replacements. This pin is deadly. Korchnoi looks 
with disgust and Steinitz turns in his grave. My safe bomb shelter will be 
permanently opened and that's that. So far I was ahead in clock, but now it was
time to take that sarcastic Russian trainer advice, ""When you already have a miserable
position, then start to think!"". What can I do? I could sac an exchange with 
Nh5-Nf4, but that's just desperate. I have no real threats, and whites rooks will 
soon dominate queen side. The alternative was to allow Bxf6 and live with the 
doubled pawns. So now I spent a long time, too long time, estimating whites 
threats in the king side. I should have just hoped for the best and go for it, 
since I had no real alternative anyway, and the clock became a crucial factor in the end. }

{ Qe2! Just so. White abandons the whole queen side and goes to all and out king hunt.
Now I don't know what's actually happening here, but I decided to simplify just to 
make my defensive calculations easier. Unfortunately, the same makes his attacking 
calculations easier. A move that's good against a computer is not necessarily the 
best against a human. }

but so is the weakness at c3 real. An intense race starts here. }

30. Rf1 Kh7 
{ This move is one of the sweaty moments. Of course I cannot allow h5 winning the 
knight, but all the tactical possibilities with the f5 square for the knight made 
me kind of desperate. To be honest, I did not expect to survive this anymore. Now of course 
Qh5+ just blocks the h-pawn, but better moves exist. Besides, we are both in time trouble. }
31. Nd5 {! I'm losing the f6 pawn with check. Can I really survive this? } 
Qb2 32. Nxf6+ Kg7 33. Nd5 c3 { It would be totally satisfying to play like this 
if your king was safe. } 34. h5 c2 
35. Qg5 { ! Facing moves like this with seconds in your clock is not pleasant. } 
Rd6 36. Ne3 { ! Another fork to annoy me. I thought I'd win a rook. } Rc6 37. Nxc2 Qxc2 38. hxg6 Rxg6 
39. Qxe5+ f6 40. Qd5
{ I got my hopes up at this point, but with flag about to fall and I had to skip thinking. 
The best tries for black are Bc5 or Rg5, forget the material and try to get active. 
I don't know what would happen, white is better but the position has counter chances. Notice, 
that the white queen needs to guard e4, because Bg2 is pinned. }
 Qxa4 {?} 41. Rb1 {! The material is even, but white has a deadly attack. My attempt to stop 
Rb7+ is the final time trouble blunder. } Bb4 {?? I would have lost on time with any reasonable expectations. }

1353896348.0,45,self.chess,13sgdl,A few tips for fellow chess players at 1000-1500 who would like to improve their elo!,SavingPrivateParts,55,10,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/13sgdl/a_few_tips_for_fellow_chess_players_at_10001500/,"I've been on this subreddit for many months now and I've noticed a few reoccurring patterns being posted on games. I can tell that many of the games are on the mentioned elo purely by common mistakes in the early game which, if payed attention more to would drastically improve your gameplay. This might seem a bit more obvious to others, you may even know these ideas. However, many of your games just don't follow through, so I'll put this out there and hopefully can put it to active use!

ALSO: I am not a high elo player. I'm 1800s on online play and currently 1720 FIDE who has recently gone up from 1300 level just by following a few basic ideas.

1) Development. Most of these games fall back behind simple concepts. **you do not need to know GM opening theory to win your games** , you don't need to even think about any theories at all, you're wasting your time and not enjoying chess, stop it -.-. you need to follow basic concepts:

* Put your minor pieces to contest the center. Controlling the center gives the most options for attack.
* Try not to move pawns. Sure there are plenty of openings with a lot of pawn movements, but they try to achieve the other two points. Remember pawns never go backwards, if you don't move them early you don't regret it later. If you move your minor pieces you create more winning options.
* Slow opponent development. If you ever see the opponent give you a chance to achieve one of the other points while slowing theirs, you will be winning the game. 

occasionally when i get a match up with somebody who's under 1400, i win majority of my games just by following those rules and waiting for mistakes. It doesn't matter what opening you chose, at all, they all must follow those principles. 

2) look for tactics when pieces interact. you have a knight that can take a bishop or a pawn? give it a thought. there are always tactics that you will find even when calculating moves that seem strange at first. Even if nothing comes of it, you'll see the general nature of the game and be able to react to an opponent's move which has changed something in the prior calculation. Don't calculate every possible move on the game, it's a waste of time. Just calculate interactions and changes if you want to look for tactics. Obviously the extent of this depends on your time control. 

3) and finally, the most important difference between a bad and a good player is having a plan, and working out your opponents. Sometimes i play vs. people who just move pieces and wait for something to happen (or look for tactics). Against somebody who has a plan this will never work, except maybe in 1min chess. Once you've achieved the development of pieces start working on a strategy. There is no strategical vs. tactical player in chess, to win you need both. Sit back, and invest time on working on your plan, this is the most critical part of the game, don't just move a piece for the sake of it. The way i like to put it is that every move is worth a pawn, moving something for the sake of it is as good as giving your opponent free material. 

hope this helps somebody. i'm not saying take everything to heart, and there are exceptions to every rule in chess. However, it is very important to keep these ideas in mind as the players that understands these concepts and have practice them can see those exceptions better and find new ways of improving their gameplay. good luck on your games

I get white in one, and he gets white in another. I start with e4, as does he, and then he waits for my response as black. I've been working on my Scandinavian defense, so I reply with d5. In the game he plays back, he does the same, and after about 10 moves, it is clear that he is simply copying each move I make as black and following up with each move I make as white in both opposing games. I'm tempted to make a blunder-type move to really test him, but then he might not follow that and I run the risk of losing both games. Considering that I will win one and lose one (or tie both) at best, is there anything I can do? Under both scenarios, I stand to lose more points to my ranking considering the differential, and regardless, I don't enjoy playing myself so both games feel tedious to play.

The inner-troll in me admires this guy for his ingenuity, but the competitor in me is kind of pissed off. Is this an accepted tactic? Or should I just never play two games against the same opponent in the future (I normally like to, as I think it's fair that both sides get a go at white).",,False,self,t5_2qhr7,False,,,True,t3_16k2su,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/16k2su/correspondence_game_is_this_considering_cheating/,

**The Grünfeld Defence**


&gt; 1.d4 Nf6

&gt; 2.c4 g6

&gt; 3.Nc3 d5 

http://i.imgur.com/OwV0IRH.jpg

The opening relies on one of the main principles of the hypermodern school, which was coming to the fore in the 1920s—that a large pawn centre could be a liability rather than an asset.

The first instance of this opening is in an 1855 game by Moheschunder Bannerjee, an Indian player who had transitioned from Indian chess rules, playing Black against John Cochrane in Calcutta, in May 1855:

&gt; 1.d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. e3 Bg7 5. Nf3 O-O 6. cxd5 Nxd5 7. Be2 Nxc3 8. bxc3 c5 9. O-O cxd4 10. cxd4 Nc6 11. Bb2 Bg4 12. Rc1 Rc8 13. Ba3 Qa5 14. Qb3 Rfe8 15. Rc5 Qb6 16. Rb5 Qd8 17. Ng5 Bxe2 18. Nxf7 Na5 
and White mates in three 19.Nh6+ double check Kh8 20.Qg8+ Rxg8 21.Nf7# 1-0. 

*([Link to game](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1336349), also displayed later in post)*

It gained popularity after Ernst Grünfeld introduced it into international play at Vienna 1922, where, in his first game with the defense, he defeated future world champion Alexander Alekhine. Grünfeld usually employed a very classical style. The defence was later adopted by a number of prominent players, including Vasily Smyslov, Viktor Korchnoi, Leonid Stein, and Bobby Fischer. Garry Kasparov often used the defence, including in his World Championship matches against Anatoly Karpov in 1986, 1987 and 1990, and Vladimir Kramnik in 2000. Currently active notable players who employ the opening include Loek van Wely, Peter Svidler, Peter Leko, Viswanathan Anand, Luke McShane and Gata Kamsky. Anand employed it twice in the World Chess Championship 2010. In the World Chess Championship 2012 between Anand and Boris Gelfand, each player used the Grünfeld once with both games ending in draws.

The Game of the Century between Donald Byrne and 13-year old Bobby Fischer on October 17, 1956, featured this opening, although arriving in the Grünfeld via a transposition of moves (using 1.Nf3 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.d4 0-0 5.Bf4 d5).

Have some decency, update the sidebar once every now and again with some useful information and aesthetic style. Sure, the FAQ has nearly all the info you need but it wouldn't hurt to bring some of the more important info and common issues into plain sight for everyone to see and be reminded of. For a subreddit of this size, we are definitely lacking in the sidebar department IMO.

So often people complain about one thing or another regarding the state of this subreddit, yet nobody ever takes any meaningful action. The sidebar is a great place to start. Who's with me?

What kind of things should be in the sidebar?

Now I'm just spitballin' ideas here:

* Posting rules such as if you post a game for review it *must* be self analyzed

* Mandatory PGN viewer addon with detailed instruction how to use it (OR maybe it's possible to incorporate the PGN viewer directly to the subreddit somehow so the addon isn't needed? I don't know about that kind of thing...)

* Perhaps a tagging system for games such as ""novice"", ""amateur"", ""master"" etc.

1370701159.0,36,self.chess,1fxd3s,How to set up and use an engine,milikom,45,9,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1fxd3s/how_to_set_up_and_use_an_engine/,"One question that is often asked on this sub is how to set up an engine.  It's really quite simple so here goes.

*****

[Go here.](http://www.playwitharena.com/?Download:Arena_3.0)  Arena is not an engine or a database (although it nicely comes pre-installed with both).  Instead it is GUI which makes it easy to use and hook up extra engines/databases as per your liking.  There are other GUIs but seeing as I use Arena, that's the only thing I can teach you.

You have two choices at this point - whether to download the zip which doesn't include a way to install Arena (but does allow you to run it as a stand-alone program) or whether to download the setup. Either way, download and run 'Arena' if you chose the first option and the setup for the second.

*****

Once that's done the program is now working but there are some ways to tweak it if you want.  For example, I get rid of the clocks by right-clicking on them and unchecking Clocks and Large Icons (these might well be useful if you want to use ICC or something similar online but I'm not a member so I don't bother).  Anything you remove can be got back later by going to Options &gt; Appearance &gt; Main window &gt; View.  You can manually set a lot in the Appearance menu but I just go for the presets under Options &gt; Colour scheme.  Now that you're happy with the way it looks, let's find out about how to add to it.

*****

Let's try to add an engine eg. Stockfish.  Find their website and download the appropriate version.  Then go to Arena and under Engines choose 'Install engine' (it's as if they were making it idiot-proof!).  Once you've found it (there may well be different versions depending on your computer hardware so watch out) it will ask whether it uses the UCI or Winboard protocol.  You should be able to find out this info through their website but if you get it wrong, just change to the other one by going to Engines &gt; Management and that should fix it.  Now let's look at some functionality.

*****

To play a game against the engine, just start moving pieces.  The engine will think about it, churning out possible variations and their evaluations at the bottom before settling on a move.  If there is too much info for you in the evaluation box, you can right click somewhere in the box and go to Configure Engine Analysis Output &gt; Mainlines.  I normally untick everything except the moves and the evaluation.  If you don't want to the computer to make a move, make sure the 'Edit' button is highlighted.  This will prevent the engine from changing the board in any way and is the main way I analyse my games.

One important aspect of using the engine is its level.  By going to Levels &gt; Adjust you can change how the engine behaves.  Obviously if you only give it 1sec to make a move it will be less accurate than if you give it 30 (but that might give you a chance of beating it).  I only really use the engine for analysing games so I have it set on infinite and just stop it working after I'm satisfied it's not suddenly going to find a new best move.

The last major thing to know is how to set up a position.  This can be done in several ways.  If you have a PNG or an EPD, you can open them under their respective menus.  Otherwise, go to Position and either grab a copied FEN or go to Set Up a Position and do just that.

Additionally, I get no karma from a self post. This post will get you a basic setup for analysis. There are many other possible setups out there.

I finally figured out how to use computer analysis yesterday and holy SHIT did my game play improve. I completely changed my playstyle in one game, and all of a sudden all of my games have been really really one sided in my favour. I think I've gone something like 9-2 since I started it. USE COMP ANALYSIS!!!

For those who don't know how to I'll write a short, basic guide using my current setup:

* download Arena GUI

http://www.playwitharena.de/downloads/arena_3.0.zip

* download the last free Houdini

http://www.cruxis.com/download/Houdini_15a.zip and pick the one for your computer(i.e if you have 32 bit get the 32 bit and same for 64 bit)

* Follow the instructions given by Arena in order to install Houdini into it(under the engines tab).

After doing this you will end up with Arena with Houdini in it.

A basic overview of using the program:

save your PGNs from your games to a certain folder.

In Arena click on the PGN tab, then on Open and click the PGN you want. Wander along the move list until you get to a point where you weren't sure if you did the right move. Click analyze and the comp. will show you what it thinks the best move was. You can also do stuff like playing computer vs. itself, etc. 

Any suggestions let me know, I just started using this yesterday and figured I'd help people avoid my pitfalls.

Oh, and a very good video to watch in regards to general chess: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmJcUI_wSy8

EDIT: Oh, crap, I can't believe I forgot to mention it. When you analyze a position it'll tell you what your chances are. For example, if it gives you a rating of -1.00 you are behind by a pawn. If behind by -0.05 it means you have a slightly worse position or move set. This analyzes the chances of the REPLIES. For example, if you do e4, it'll tell you something like -0.27 which means that black is behind by around a quarter of a pawn.

It will tell you this number in the bar beneath the playing area. It is the only section that has numbers like -0.05.",,False,self,t5_2qhr7,1338518163.0,,,True,t3_uer59,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/uer59/how_to_start_with_computer_analysis/,

probably forget this.} 5. Bd3 Nf6 6. Be3 {Apparenly book was to simply castle 
here. I was a little afraid of queen coming out to b6 harassing a couple of 
things, but felt Nb3 with a discovery should be fine. Qa5 I thought was met 
with Nc3 maybe followed by Nb3 decently enough. At this point, I still had 
not really developed a plan beyond getting the pieces out.} Nc6 7. O-O 
{Taking knight looks like it might have been best. I felt I had the edge in 
development and was hoping he would start taking some of my pieces to further 
my development and that my bishops would start giving him some concern both 
being pointed at the kingside i.e.: 1. ...Nxd4 2. Bxd4 however, I think the 
main problem I missed is Ne5 hitting my bishop which is certainly 
uncomfortable.} Qc7 8. c3 {I felt c3 did a couple of things for me.  It adds 
to the support of the knight, in case of things like Bc5, and gives a nice 
hole for the light-squared bishop in case of Ne5.} d5 9. Nd2 {Here I 
continued standing my ground, continuing to develop and hoping to force my 
opponent to initiate some trades, thereby developing my pieces further. In 
hindsight, taking the pawn might have been better as it opens the position up 
a bit with his king still in the middle of the board. I did not believe that 
I would be winning through tactics or blitz attacks against a much higher 
rated player though, and was instead depending/hoping on better development 
with a strong position.} Be7 10. f4 {Here I thought I was either forcing him 
to take the pawn finally, and if he did not, then playing e5 locking in his 
light squared bishop for a while and harassing the knight. I felt my 
dark-squared bishop provided adequate protection to the hole I was creating 
to my king. He quickly showed the fallacies in my logic.} dxe4 11. Nxe4 
{Succcess in my mind! Pieces are well developed, queen can comes to f3. The 
rooks have great spots on e1 &amp; d1. After the game, he told me I did have good 
development, but there were simply no threats being created. I agreed that I 
was playing somewhat passively.} Nd5 {Ouch! I certainly overlooked this. The 
knight invades already and my pawn looks very silly out there as a target. I 
did not want to give up the bishop pair even though, again in hindsight, he 
was threatening to take the worse of my 2 bishops. Queen up was probably 
best.} 12. Bd2 Qb6 {Ouch ouch! My opening has fallen apart at this point in 
my mind. I thought for a long time here considering simply Kh1 and 
surrendering the pawn. I finally saw a slight improvement.} 13. Qb3 Qa7 
{Actually got him thinking for a bit! I had probably used up 1/2 hour already 
and he had used around 5 minutes. I knew I was playing slow, but I wanted to 
give him as good a game as possible. Currently that appears to have been 
amounting to losing material. I looked for a long time at 1. Qc4, but I felt 
after ...b5 My queen had simply wasted a move. 2. Qxc6 seemed to trap the 
queen after Bd7. So I finally surrendered the pawn feeling like I still had 
decent development for compensation.} 14. Kh1 (14. Qc4 b5 15. Qxc6+ Bd7 16.

taking c file, but it doesn't seem like that really does me any good. I have 
been keeping an eye on the possibility of moves like Ng5 but didn't feel good 
about it yet.} Qa7 {Here I saw that his light-squared bishop was still out of 
play, and that his queen was also a bit out of the battle. I thought, how 
about I reposition the queen to h5! Now that Ng5 move looks pretty good. I 
thought that 1...Bxg5 2. fxg5 and now the rook could swing over to h4 at some 
point, start making some things happen.} (17. ... Qb6 {He later said that he 
probably should have just played here.} ) 18. Qd1 Bd7 19. Qh5 f5 {Luckily my 
confidence in my attack concerened him enough or something and he did not 
play Bb5.} (19. ... Bb5 {I thought this move was met with} 20. Qxh7+ Kxh7 21. 
Ng5+ {This is just horribly losing though. In my brain, I believed he was 
forced to go to h8, the pawn for some reason was not on f4, my rook can come 
to h4 for check, then bishop can come back and forth to h7 with check forcing 
perpetual.} ) 20. Ng5 Nf6 {did not expect this move. I looked for a long time 
at Qh4 and Qh3 for a long time keeping the mate threat alive if only to 
provide a distraction and uneasiness for my opponent. Qh4 seeemed to get me 
into some trouble after Ng4 and now the knight is pinned and he's threatening 
Nf2+ winning the exchange or smother mating me, so I finally discarded that 
idea. I had almost settled on Qh3 when I finally looked at Qe2. Not only am I 
hitting the pawn twice I thought! I see a great sac of the bishop winning my 
pawn back!} 21. Qe2 {He later told me, he felt this was a pretty good move. I 
happily accepted the compliment. (: This was the first point in the game I 
actually saw him think for more than a couple of seconds/minutes.} b5 22. Rc2 
Qb6 {Getting protection to his pawn finally and one of his reason why he felt 
he should have just played Qb6 much earlier.} 23. Bxf5 {Yay! Certainly far 
from winning or anything. But I felt this was a huge milestone in re-earning 
the draw with this guy after I felt like I was completely lost. Not only is 
it winning the pawn back, this will leave us with bishops of opposite 
colors.} exf5 24. Qxe7 Rae8 {Again I thought for a long time here. I only 
have a few choices, one of them swaps the queens off, getting closer to what 
I was hoping was a draw. The other 2 (Qa3 and Qb4) just didn't really seem to 
do much of anything but let his rooks come in. Looking at it now, it does 
seem like I might be threatening something like Qb3+ with threats of 
smothered mate of my own! Instead...} 25. Qc5 {I went for the draw. I knew 
after he took, his rook would be invading to e2, but I felt like taking the 
biggest threat out of the game, even if I dropped a pawn, the opposite 
colored bishops should hold for a draw if I can find a way to swap off the 
knight and rooks.} Qxc5 {He happily took} 26. Rxc5 Re2 {and just as happily 
brought the rook to e2. Again I though for a long time.} 27. Rd1 {The move I 
finally settled on after looking at some alternatives I'll list. I felt like 
getting my rook into the game with a potential discovered attack on the 
bishop was strongest. My bishops and knight could work together to hold e1 if 
need be.} (27. Bc3 h6 28. Nf3 Ne4 {This greatly concerned me. If knight takes 
bishop and rook recaptures, his rook will be a monster against my queenside 
pawns.} 29. Rc7 Nxc3 30. bxc3 Be8 {I might have still been ok here with Ra1 
or something, but I feel far from comfortable having my pawns split up and 
both being targets.} 31. a3 {what the computer suggests, and then bringing 
the f rook to d1. certainly gets my rooks active but at the cost of a passed 
a pawn. Didn't even consider it.} ) ({another move i considered, but I was 
concerned about...} 27. Bc1 Rfe8 {but I suppose I was fine after...} 28. Nf3 
{so maybe that would have been ok as well, though I felt like my bishop was 
out of play a bit.} ) Ng4 {However, this move seemed to dash all of my hopes 
at a draw again. I had just given my opponent a huge gigantic fork 
opportunity!! I had no idea what to do. Kg1 just seemed to allow the knight 
to come in anyway. And after the rook moved the bishops falls. (Had i looked 
closer, I had moves like Kf1 threatening to win the rook back, or even Rf1 
counterattacking the knight to consider.} 28. Nh3 {I sadly settled on this, 
totally removing my knight from play. Hoping my slightly more active rooks 
and bishop could create some havoc on g7.} Be6 29. Bc3 {Giving up the a pawn 
but hopefully for some counterplay. He also had a nice fork trick on e3 after 
1...Rxg2 2. Kxg2. That would still probably hold for a draw as a single pawn 
difference would not matter in the opposite colored bishop endgame.} Ne3 30. 
Re1 {I thought for a bit about this move as well, I saw a chance to trade off 
more material and ended up going for it} Rxe1+ 31. Bxe1 Bxa2 32. Ng5 Nd5 33. 
g3 Re8 {I saw this and felt the knight coming back to protect it was strong. 
If he didn't invade with the rook, I would lock it out with Ne5. If he did 
invade, then I had some counter play which is what happens.} 34. Nf3 Re3 35. 
Rc8+ Kf7 36. Ne5+ Kf6 {He again thought for a while before deciding on this 
move.} 37. Bf2 {Jumping at the chance to play Bd4 which protects the pawn and 
gives some chances at double checking. Those are usually quite strong, but in 
this case I couldn't find anything to follow it up with.} Re2 38. Bd4 Ne7 
{Ignoring the double check/discovery threats, the knight can't seem to 
threaten anything with it's free move from the center of the board, at such a 
fine outpost. Unbelieveable!} 39. Rc7 Bd5+ 40. Kg1 Ke6 {finally breaking the 
discovered check} (40. ... Rg2+ 41. Kf1 Rxh2 {fails to...} 42. Ng4+ ) 41. Ra7 
{winning back the pawn yet again!} Be4 42. Rxa6+ Kd5 43. Bc3 Rg2+ 44. Kf1 
{With 5 minutes on the clock, I confidently offered a draw to my opponent.}

They showed a grid or whatever you call the representation of the board:

http://i.imgur.com/Ad2wteo.jpg

Thinking it might be significant because the writer of this particular comic is not the kind of person to include this lightly, I (a fairly poor player) closely studied the board. And I was pleased to see that subsequent panels did represent that same state of the game. 

My conclusion was that if it was black's turn, black wins easily, by moving that rook down to h1. Red's only option would be to block with the queen to g1, then black takes the queen h1-&gt;g1, and that's checkmate. 

If it was red's turn, I could think of no other way to prevent black from doing that than to take the rook at h4 with the queen, knowing it would be taken by the knight. And then the game would be fairly evenly matched, or at least no immediate checkmate came to mind.

It turned out to be red's move:

http://i.imgur.com/KZaAobc.jpg

Confusingly moving the rook at b5 to b2 to take a pawn. So black's victory was assured, right? Wrong:

http://i.imgur.com/SbqdRPX.jpg

This move makes no sense to me. You take the queen instead of forcing the obvious check that leads to checkmate. And 

It being a Batman comic, and the antagonist of this particular story being a woman dressed in red, the metaphorical significance of the black knight taking the red queen is obvious. But why not create I scenario where that would be, like, the smart move? I'm a little baffled. 

But anyway, since I spent so much time thinking about it, I figured I'd ask people who are better at chess than me if I missed something. And it would make me feel better about the comic (but worse about my chess game) if I did in fact miss something, and that move by the black knight is a smart and game-changing move.",,False,self,t5_2qhr7,False,,,True,t3_1d33aj,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1d33aj/a_chess_match_from_a_batman_comic/,

The mods have been talking, and we've decided to make a couple of changes. Naturally, not everyone constantly monitors the sidebar for updates, so I've made this post to summarize the changes that we've made.

It has been the case that when people post analysis with their games, the quality of the thread goes up. For examples, see [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/19blir/my_first_ranked_game_ever/) and then compare it to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/198g7w/surely_mistakes_were_made_but_overall_happy_with/).

Hence, we came up with a new rule:

* If you post a game for analysis, please include your own thoughts.

So what does this mean?

* Hopefully people read the sidebar, and give their thoughts along with their game.
* The moderators will not be removing posts that do not have analysis. This is open for discussion and if you guys want us to, we can.

tl;dr We'd like to improve the quality of the subreddit. If you have suggestions on how to do so, we're listening.

    1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. c4 Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 
{This was the second time in my life that I played this variation, and the first time was in the second round of the same tournament. I hadn't even tried it out in blitz. I was starting to dislike my usual e6/Be7 stuff, and had no access to databases because my computer had died just before the tournament. This move lets me draw a bit on my knowledge of Accelerated Panov positions, which I felt should be sufficient to at least get out of the opening.} 

    6. cxd5 Bg7 7. Qa4+ 

{This move turned out to have been played numerous times, but I don't particularly understand it: the knight was going to d7 anyway. My first game in this variation was against an IM who played Bc4 here, after which I obtained an okay position but made two horrible decisions in a row.} 

    Nbd7 

{White of course realizes that he won't be able to hang on to d5, and attempts to give back the pawn under the best possible conditions.}     

    8. d6 O-O 

{It's obvious that Black gets monstrous compensation for the pawn, so I only spent about 30 seconds on this move. Originally, a search on my somewhat culled database suggested that this is a novelty, but then d_ahura found a game between an unrated player and a 2300 in this line. I still believe that this is by far the best move here.} 

    9. dxe7 Qxe7+ 10. Be2 Nb6 11. Qd1 

{I was mostly concerned about 11.Qa3, but decided that I prefer my position after all the exchanges, e.g.} 

    (11. Qa3 Qxa3 12.bxa3 Re8 13. Nf3 Nfd5 14. Nxd5 Nxd5 15. Ne5 Bxe5 16. dxe5 Rxe5 17. Bb2 Re8 18. Kf1 Bf5 

{and even though White has the bishop pair, Black's piece activity should prove decisive.}) 

    11. .. Nfd5 

{Maintaining pressure. Black must act decisively or he risks losing his advantage. Simple ""developing"" moves allow White to consolidate:} (11. .. Bf5 12. Nf3 Rac8 13. O-O Nbd5
14. Nxd5 Nxd5 15. Bd3) 

    12. Kf1 

{During the game, I thought that this might be too early, and was happy to see it. It seems that this move had to be played sooner or later, though:} (12. Nf3 Re8 13. Nxd5 (13. O-O 13. .. Nxc3
14. bxc3 Qxe2) (13. Ne5 Nxc3 14. bxc3 Bxe5 15. dxe5 Qxe5) 13. .. Nxd5 14.Kf1) 

    12. .. Bf5 

{Really not sure about this decision. The bishop is going to c6, but first I wanted to provoke Bd3. The point is that on d3, the bishop has a shorter range, it takes a square away from the queen, and it
weakens the d4 pawn -- but, the bishop being on e2 has its own
disadvantages. The immediate Bd7 may have been better.} 

    13. Bd3 Bd7 14. Nf3 Rad8 

{Losing track.  Black's last move is a serious mistake that should have allowed White to equalize. It was better to force the exchange in the center immediately:} (14. .. Rac8 15.Nxd5 Nxd5 16. Bg5 Qd6 17. Qd2 Rfe8 {and Black is dominating every portion of the board. The win can't be far away.}) 

    15. Bg5 f6 16. Bh4 Nf4 

(16. ..Nxc3 {was interesting, e.g.} 17. bxc3 Rc8 18. Qc2 Qa3 19. c4 Ba4 20. Qb1 Nxc4 {Needless to say, I saw none of this during the game.}) 

    17. Bg3 

{After a simple Bc2, Black certainly still has compensation for the pawn, but not much more than that. The text move not only completely justifies my 14th, but also creates a long-term problem for White: there is no way to get the king off the 1st rank in less than three moves.} 

    Nxd3 18. Qxd3 Bc6 

{Not so much threatening to win back the pawn via Bxf3 Qxf3 Rxd4, as just pointing my bishop at the white king. I think White should have ignored the ""threat"" and tried to make the best of his rook position with h2-h4-h5.} 

    19. Rd1 Rfe8 

{After White's next move, I decided that my opponent no longer
understood the position. Its main feature is that Black welcomes any and all exchanges on the queenside, because he's essentially playing with an extra rook there.} 

    20. Re1 Qb4 

{It took me half an hour to calculate this move along with what follows. Subsequent analysis shows that White is already lost. It seems to me that once Kf1 was forced, this position, or one very much like it, had to occur sooner or later, which casts further
doubt on 7.Qa4.} 

    21. Rxe8+

For the last few days I have been constructing a playlist overview page here:

http://www.chessworld.net/chessclubs/playlistvideosstructure.asp

I hope you find it useful. The inspiration for this page came from how the Khan academy educational videos were laid out in a pleasing three column format. Also the guy behind the Khan academy seems to have a truly educational vision for the use of Videos and interactive software as this Ted video shows :

http://www.ted.com/talks/salman_khan_let_s_use_video_to_reinvent_education.html

He talks about the concept of a classroom ""flip"" where the homework becomes to watch the videos and the classroom becomes the place to do the homework. 

Chess though is not easy to categorise games. Chess games can fall into multiple categories of insight - but I think this evolving structure so far is quite reasonable. 

I have also been doing more dual commentary videos with my good friend Chris who is soon to be IM titled officially. We hope to cover the playoff games between Anand and Gelfand played today - they will be in the World championship 2012 playlist.

Some of my better videos this week:

First you'll need the database itself. There are a few free options available. My current preference is for “SCID vs. PC” which is an updated version of the free SCID database. It's available for download from Sourceforge:

http://scidvspc.sourceforge.net/

SCID is fairly complex, but there are tutorials on YouTube that explain the various functions pretty well.

There's also an online text tutorial:

Next you'll need an analysis engine. Houdini 1.5a has long been the strongest free chess engine available, but I've recently read that the newest version of Stockfish is stronger (though the CCRL still puts Houdini 1.5a ahead). Since  SCID supports several analysis engines you can install both if you like.

Download for Houdini 1.5a

http://www.cruxis.com/chess/houdini.htm

Download for Stockfish 2.3.1

http://stockfishchess.org/download/

-----

You'll also need some games. The two largest free games collections that I know of are the Million Base and ICOPY databases.

Million Base now includes 2.2 Million games and has been updated with ""The Week In Chess"" games up to January 2013

http://www.top-5000.nl/pgn.htm

The ICOPY database includes a whopping 4.6 million games, with a 2/16/2013 update available. There's obviously going to be a lot of overlap between these, but I don't know yet if ICOPY includes all the games in Millionbase.

http://icofy-blog.de/icofy-base/

You'll want to keep your database up to date by downloading TWIC pgn files each week.

However, there's one thing that I'm never quite sure how to deal with which frequently escalates into a series of unfavourable tactics: pawn rushes against my castled king.

I've heard, now and then, the general advice that castling early is a good idea. Some popular lines even have 4. O-O.  However, after several hundred games, I find myself wary to castle too early.

It seems to happen often that when I castle early, my opponent will immediately pawn-charge my king, and I'll realize that to attack their uncastled king would take longer than their attack will take.  So I'm forced to go on the defensive, and sure enough, some pawn trades will happen and suddenly my king is vulnerable and stuck on the open side of the board.  Then my opponent calmly castles on the other side and proceeds to finish off my king before I can launch a similar attack on their castled king. 
Also, I have found consistent success doing this to my opponents who castle early.  It just seems as though one's king is often safe enough in the early and early-middle of the game remaining in the center, allowing one to use one's tempo to instead pawn rush their opponent's castled king.  And such a pawn rush really can't be ignored by the defender.

I've recently started playing Queen's Gambit, and I like it.  It works fairly well at my level.  However, a few players respond to 2. c4 by immediately rushing my kingside. The logic behind this seems to be that c4 significantly weakens a queenside castle, implying that I'll castle kingside if I castle at all (and who doesn't?).  So they do their best to mess up my kingside guard pawns before I even castle.  The only response I can ever think to give to that is to simultaneously pawn rush their queenside, so that we'll both end up over-extended on one side and messed up on the other.  This is rather weak.  It offers a complicated, destructive, even-ish game.

So, is castling first actually a good idea?  How do you deal with pawn rushes against your castled king?  And is 2. c4 flawed in that it implies to one's opponent an intention to castle kingside, and thus invites an early attack against that side?  

I find myself more and more inclined to maintain ambiguity as to my castle side, and frequently to castle second.  

Thoughts?

EDIT: Here's part of a theoretical game where white opens with d4 and castles on the kingside, while black sets up a bunch of attack pawns as a reaction to 2. c4

[pgn] 1. d4 d5 2. c4 h6 3. Nc3 e6 4. e3 g5 5. Bd3 dxc4 6. Bxc4 Bd6 7. Nge2 f5 8. O-O Nf6 [/pgn]

How should white best take advantage of black's undeveloped queenside, or, as you guys suggested, foil, cut off, and exploit the advanced pawn wall?  Or should white, as others suggested, attack the center?

My team who normally is very relaxed (we don't take chess as seriously as other schools. We're not bad, we just like enjoying ourselves as we play.), played a very uptight team at our last tournament. The way the tournament worked is that the top 4 teams from the Eastern League play the top 4 teams of the Western league, so we played the #4 of the Western League. I greeted my opponent and he ignored me, and I just shook it off. Anyway, our game was fairly intense, and it came to just our Kings and one rook each. I realized unless he messed up, it would most likely be a draw, so I asked for one, and he declined. He then made a humongous mistake by  picking up his king, and placing it in front of his rook, so that I could put his king in check, and take the rook for free. He realized his mistake as he took his hand off the king, and took his move back. I told him that he had to make the move since he took his hand off, and he told me that the rule was that the move wasn't official until he hit the clock. Now, I've been playing chess almost all of my life, so I knew this was BS immediately, and told him the real rule, and he decided to play by the rules. I know how to checkmate a king with just a rook and my king, so that wasn't a problem, however; his teammate sitting next to him told him not to place his king in front of my king (forces king to next file when you challenge the king with the rook). I immediately called him out on helping his teammate, and how it was against the rules. My opponent replied: ""Who cares. You're going to win anyway. And I can have you disqualified for not minding your own business,"". Can't make this stuff up folks...So I decided to just continue with my checkmate and beat him. When I offered him a handshake and a ""good game"", he walked off without saying a word or helping me pick up my board. 
TL;DR: My opponent was a jackass :P

Sorry if that was super long, but I just wanted to share my story! Anyway, have you ever had a terrible sport of an opponent?   ",,False,self,t5_2qhr7,False,,,True,t3_17lxcg,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/17lxcg/have_you_ever_played_someone_who_was_just_a/,

There will be a simple story line having a group of ""soldiers"" cross multiple levels to reach some kind of peaceful place where they can settle and not worry about battles anymore.

They would pass levels consisting of various checkered paths and would have to overcome different combinations of ""bandits"". Of course, both of these would consist of chess pieces and all the movements would be same as in chess.

I think this might be a fun way to develop understanding of each piece's strengths and weaknesses and getting to know how to get most of limited resources.

These files are not database friendly and cannot be easily searched or analyzed.

I propose that we, as a community of chess players, build a free, open, and online chess database. We can warehouse all of the important historical chess games in our database. We should use a format that's both ubiquitous and easy to use (I suggest SQL).

This database would both serve as an historical account of the chess world and as a tool for research. First, as an historical account of the chess world, this database would catalog information regarding the masters of the game and the games that they played. Second, as a tool for research, the database should be easily ""analyzable"". A SQL database allows for far more detailed queries than a .pgn database, and as such, allows for much more detailed analyses.

To this end, I've created a SQL database of 1.74 million chess games. The database is in its raw form now, and needs to be organized. I can't take credit for the data within the database, as I started with 'Rebel's' and Ed Schroeder's .pgn database:
http://www.top-5000.nl/pgn.htm

**EDIT - I've also uploaded all of Jose's games databases. We now have over 3 million games (not all of them may be unique). My next step is to upload the moves, remove duplicate games and begin building the schema.**

Finally, I've created a blog to track the progress and act as a landing page for the community. From this blog, you can download my SQL database.
http://chessdata.wordpress.com/

I need your help! Right now, I'm at the very early stages of building this and need brainstorming ideas. Let's get a firm grasp of what we want and how we're going to do it. I've laid out my plan on my blog; feel free to comment. Next, I need help gathering and cleaning data. We have 1.74 million games already, but the data isn't pretty by any means. I also need help designing a database (I need people with database experience and ""chess people"" who know what kind of information we should be storing and where we can get it). Finally, I'd like to put this somewhere so everyone can access it (anyone know how to build a webpage?).

People of the chess world, UNITE! :)

http://www.chess.com/forum/view/general/lets-create-a-free-open-chess-database

**EDIT: I want to emphasize that I don't want to replace the .pgn with another format. The .pgn is an incredibly useful file and will most likely play a major role in the chess community for many years to come. Rather, I think another method of data storage should be introduced to compliment the .pgn. For example, a properly constructed SQL database might be a much better method of long-term data storage than a .pgn file.**",,False,self,t5_2qhr7,1356215721.0,,,True,t3_1559f8,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1559f8/lets_create_a_free_open_chess_database/,

I can't make the squares alternate shades though. A mod would have to put in some custom styling for tables to do that. If you see garbage in the squares above instead of chess pieces your Unicode support is broken or lacking, look for Unicode updates for your OS.

This is the ""source"" of it that you can copy &amp; paste in to a comment/post. Just paste the board then cut &amp; paste the piece you're moving. As a game progresses there'll be more cut/pasting of pieces required so it will be easier to update a self post with the ""source"" of the most recent move.

As discussed in a thread about other chess forums, I believe we need a regular discussion on /r/chess! I will post a new one of these weekly showcasing either a random opening, or one that the community has voted for. This can be a place to share our own games in the opening, offer strong lines that we've played ourselves, and teach others about the various ideas and motifs in this opening/specific lines of this opening. Let me know in the comments about any ideas you may have to improve this weekly feature :)

To do this it may be best to see the Resources tab on the right that with titles like ""game diagnostics"" ""books to read"" ""chess sites"" etc. I know that the FAQ has a few books in there but people usually don't look in the FAQ for things like that.

Some of the efforts seem a little gimmicky or superficial to me, like the chess casting computer analysis, proposals to monitor the players heart rates, using Carlsen as a poster boy. I don't find any of this really adds much to the experience of watching chess.

For me, the commentary is the most important aspect of the coverage. To watch the game alone is quite difficult. There is a lot of time between moves and it requires a fair bit of knowledge and effort to get anything out of the game.

It doesn't feel like the broadcasters are investing as much into the commentary and analysis side of things as they should be.

I've been playing correspondence games via [ChessbyMessage](http://www.chessbymessage.com/) and was recently pointed the way of chess.com.

Now, if you can get over the initial bewilderment of me not actually visiting the place beforehand, I'm actually finding it a pretty cool place. I've ran through a few blitz games, tried to get in on the recent Reddit tournament (but missed it due to not noticing I had an invite) and enjoy the tailoring of the puzzles to my level -- one of the things I really think was missing in the Shredder app.

Now, we come to the fuzzy part; I'm presuming that most people here have subscriptions to the site. Would you say it's worth taking one out? I'm not too sure how much the chess tutor would help me, but it would certainly be nice to be able to watch some video lessons on demand and be able to see, live, some shows. Obviously the unlimited access to the Tactics Trainer is a given, too! But really, how useful do you find these added features?

Some of you might've seen my thread on r/self earlier today. I wanted to do something new, and I don't have that many hobbies so I thought reddit could recommend one, and they did, a lot of great ones, but eventually I had to be realistic (falconry, as badass as it sounds, just doesn't work for me) so I picked another one in the list, chess! I now have to dedicate my free time to chess for (at least) the next year. If I give up, I will do a money donation to a local childrens' hospital (for an amount big enough to make me want to stick with this!)

I should mention that I have never played chess, ever. Before I google'd ""chess for beginners"" I didn't know about the most basic principles (such as the way pieces move). I've started a blog (I've had the web site for a long time but it's been completely unused for a couple of years now) so keep track of my progress. Feel free to visit (link below!)

So that's it. If you have anything to suggest that'd be greatly appreciated. I'll be looking for a local club and see if I can get some practice with actual people, maybe get a bit of coaching. Until then I'll find a site (probably chess.com?) and start playing there!

Thanks!

I have just begun playing competitive USCF rated chess.  In my first event I finished 4.0/5.0 dropping one game due to fatigue missing a simply tactic.  I have been teaching and helping several 1900-2100 players with their tournament prep.  I have played chess for approximately 4 years and have a positive score against crafty 23.4 and have scored wins against Fritz 11 and several other high rated engines including Rybka.  In order to help not only others improve but help myself improve as both a player and a coach.

So /r/chess if I started posting about 30minutes to an hour of chess advice and analysis every day would you watch it?  If you are in favor of it what would you recommend as topics.  I'm currently thinking of doing at least 1 or 2 casts on playing blindfold simuls as well as on what I call Tal style attacks and forming a strong opening repertoire.

So /r/chess would you be interested in going on this magical journey with me?

* The first dozen or so moves are theory. The most common plan for white in the symmetrical English (1. c4 c5) is to play d4. Black's opening tries to slow d4, I could play e3 and then d4 which is common but my idea (playing for b4) is common as well. 

* 14... e5 was a bit strange and probably not best. I have a slight edge. 

* After 21... Rac8, I thought for about 10 minutes. This is the key position because while I have a slight advantage, black is about to get a lot of counterplay on the queenside (3 pawns against 1). I couldn't figure out a good plan and decide on a pawn sack after 22. fxe5 Bxe5 23. Bxe5 Rxe5 24. Nf3?!. For the pawn my knight gets to e6 by force and black's pieces are a big disorganized. The position becomes unclear. 24. Nc4 is best according to the computer.

* After I play 30. Nxc5! I've saved a lost position. Any other move and I lose more material. I stop taking notation at this point which means I have less than five minutes left. From this point on I'm recreating the game from memory.

* Unfortunately I missed 35. d6! which wins for me.

* An option is 38. Qh8+, but 38... Kf7 39. Qxh7+ Ng7 and my queen is pretty misplaced.

* After 40... Nxd4 I'm up a pawn but only temporarily. I can't hold onto the d pawn. It's a classic bishop vs. knight endgame where I have a slight edge because bishops trump knights in open endgame positions where there are pawns on both sides of the board. With best play white has winning chances but we're both in time trouble and black is a GM so it's likely I draw or even lose this endgame.

* I can't remember what I played after 48... Kf6 but the game ended in a draw maybe 30 moves later. We ended up queening at the same time (I queened my a-pawn while he queened his g-pawn) and the game ended as a draw.

Is his ability to play so many games of blindfold chess games at the same time unique or are most GMs able to do this?

----------------------------------------

This is my first time doing something like this, so please forgive any and all signs that I have no idea what I'm doing! I'm a ~1500 rated player on blitz (chess.com), 1600 in correspondence, and I'd say ~1500 USCF (I'm technically 1400, but I've only played OTB for a few months and swept a U1700 tournament a few years ago. Otherwise, I haven't played enough to really increase it above the 1200 I started with)). This is all to let you know that my advice is not coming from someone as experienced and knowledgeable as youtubers like Jerry from ChessNetwork, but from someone closer to the beginner side of the spectrum. Still, I think I have a pretty cool opening to offer players wishing to improve their tactical game.

**How I think of the opening.**
-----------------------------

The Danish Opening is an extremely aggressive opening on white's part, ultimately giving up (or offering) two pawns right off the bat (three total, for one in return) in exchange for a huge developmental advantage. With proper play, white should dictate the flow of the game for the first 15-20 moves. This opening is particularly strong in blitz, as black has less time to make the correct moves to react to white's threats. Playing similarly rated players as myself in blitz, I win about 75% of the time with white with this opening, in contrast to 65% with all other openings (with white). As a warning in advance, chess masters and the like have largely dismissed this opening as unsound, as black can equalize the position with material to boot with perfect play, but at the rating level this advice is aimed towards, I don't think perfect play is something you should worry about.

**The videos**
---------------

The videos come in 5 parts (5 minutes each, due to me being too cheap to get a paid for subscription). The first two are theoretical lines and explanations, and the last three go over two correspondence games I've used the opening on with success, and go over some common themes that arise from it. I hope you enjoy!

[Part 1: Intro to the main line](http://www.screenr.com/5wV8)

[Part 2: Variation where black does not take the third pawn (probably the most common line)](http://www.screenr.com/WVV8)

[Part 3: A quick correspondence game against a ~1800 player, him resigning after 11 moves (after a blunder, but the game was largely lost already)](http://www.screenr.com/CyV8)

""One day when there was no matinee I ducked out and went looking for some kind of action. In front of a good-sized theatre, one I hadn’t been in yet, there was an unusually long line of people. The line wasn’t moving. No tickets were being sold. It had to be something sensational with this many people waiting for a chance to get in.

Since the day I bought my outfit at the government store I had become used to the idea that foreigners didn’t stand in line. I went up to the box office and waved a dollar bill in the window. The cashier grabbed the buck and gave me a ticket. Valootye – foreign currency – worked like magic in Moscow.

The house was packed, and noisy. Most of the audience were standing or walking around, chatting, drinking and eating. Others were sleeping or reading. I had apparently come in during the intermission. Yet the curtain was raised and the stage was lit. Oddest of all was the setting on the stage. There was a small table and a chair. On the table were two telephones, and a bunch of knickknacks. Behind the table was a large, tilted mirror.

It was the longest intermission I ever sat through. Fifteen minutes passed. Twenty minutes. Twenty-five. Nobody seemed to mind waiting that long for the next act.

Then a buzzer sounded. People damn near trampled each other to get back to their seats. In 30 seconds the theatre was silent as a tomb. Everybody was watching the empty stage.

A boy, maybe ten or eleven years old, walks out from the wings. He sits at the table. He picks up the receiver of one of the telephones. He listens for a while, then hangs up without saying anything. He moves one of the little props on the table. The joint is so quiet I can hear my wrist watch ticking. The boy moves another knickknack. A guy comes out, walks to the footlights, announces something to the audience, and the joint goes wild.

People jump to their feet. They yell and throw their hats in the air and embrace each other. The guy who made the announcement shakes hands with the boy and the cheers are deafening. This is absolutely the craziest show I ever saw.

Finally it dawned on me what I had been watching. A chess match.

The kid on the stage, I found out, had been playing the Polish chess champion and the Ukrainian champion, by long-distance telephone. It was nice to know the home team won, but it would have been nicer if I could have gotten my dollar back.""",,False,self,t5_2qhr7,False,,,True,t3_11fbdv,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/11fbdv/favourite_chess_quotes_21_harpo_marx/,

1345486720.0,27,self.chess,yj9dp,How do you build an attack in the midgame?,LazyJaydee,30,3,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/yj9dp/how_do_you_build_an_attack_in_the_midgame/,"Hello r/chess, beginner here. I've been studying chess for a little while now, mainly working on tactics and endgame, as suggested by everyone everywhere. I find that my main problem, right now, is that I never know what I'm supposed to do in the middle game. I mean, when the opening phase ends, my pieces are developped, my king is safe, and usually I feel pretty comfortable. But then I don't know what I should do. When I'm black and white is attacking, well, I defend and look for tactics to gain material and then trade down to a winning endgame, ok. But when I'm white, I have no idea what to do. Most of the time, I end up playing passive moves that generally create no threat, but create no weakness either (hopefully), waiting for my opponent to put him/herself into a position in which I'll find tactics, winning material. 

Needless to say, that's not a very good way to go. That makes me lose the initiative, let black build up his/her attack, and maybe find tactics of his/her own. So what general principles should I work with to play more actively in the midgame, and to build up an attack?

or better for chess than the KID slayer, the bastion of the bayonet attack,
the super star that scared Kasparov of the KID, to play the KID himself!} 5.
Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 e5 7. Be3 (7. O-O {is by far the main line. I'm not familiar
with Gustafsson's repertoire, but I would have loved it if he played Kramnik's
line against him.}) 7... c6 {a sideline, as Ng4 is definitely center stage.
That being said, Black has tried nearly everything in the position.} 8. O-O (8.
d5 Ng4 9. Bg5 f6 (9... Qb6 10. O-O Qxb2 11. Qd3 {gives Black some problems
even if he is temporarily up a pawn.}) 10. Bh4 c5 {is a typical Kid position.
Kramnik used this with White to crush Van Wely in 2010.}) 8... exd4 9. Nxd4 $6
(9. Bxd4 {is a better move. White takes advantage of the awkward pawn on c6,
since now Nc6 is not possible at all. White will follow up with Nd2 and
consolidate his center. Black should still be ok though.}) 9... Re8 10. f3 d5 {
This center break works well in this position specifically as White's e3
bishop is majorly misplaced. White shouldn't be any worse but Black has
equalized.} 11. cxd5 Nxd5 (11... cxd5 12. Qb3 $1 dxe4 (12... Nc6 13. Rad1 $14)

much better.}) 12. Nxd5 cxd5 13. Rc1 (13. Qb3 Nc6 {gives Black counterplay.}
14. Rad1 Bxd4 $1 {is the difference.}) 13... a5 $5 {Nothing but fighting
spirit. The move itself is questionable. I don't believe that it can be the
best move in the position, but Kramnik wants to fight! He intends to push the
pawn to a4 where it will restrict some of White's activity. Also the pawn
wants to queen on a1. And you think I'm kidding...} 14. Qb3 a4 15. Qxd5 Qxd5

Kramnik's next sequence. I can't blame him I wouldn't have though of it either.
That's why Kramnik is Kramnik.} a3 $1 17. b3 Nc6 $1 {This part is not so hard
to see.} 18. Nc2 {Now Black has some choices, for example:} (18. dxc6 $2 Rxe3 {
is obviously losing as White can't protect the knight on d4 and the bishop on
e2.}) (18. Nxc6 $2 Rxe3 19. Kf2 Rxe2+ 20. Kxe2 bxc6 21. Rfd1 $17) 18... Rxe3 $1
{Boom! This sacrifice is almost decisive. White must be very careful now.} (
18... Nb4 19. Nxb4 Rxe3 20. Bc4 {is what I would expect. Black has a lot of
initiative for that pawn and the dark squares are weak, but White is in no
immediate danger yet.}) 19. Nxe3 Nb4 {Black is down the exchange and a pawn.
However, his bishop on g7 is dominating and the a2 pawn cannot be protected.
One that falls, it is clear that the a-pawn is a powerful force.} 20. Rc4 (20.

computer line. Good luck finding that.}) 20... Nxa2 {It's really hard to see
how White can improve his position, whereas Black's plan is beyond obvious.
What is surprising is how effective it is.} 21. Ra4 $6 {This does make Black's
task easier.} Rxa4 22. bxa4 Bd4 23. Kf2 Nb4 {White's position is already
hpeless. Even after the best moves Black has a decisive advantage.} 24. Rc1 (

I recently completed an exciting game in the first round, and I thought you all might enjoy seeing my annotations to it. My rating on chess.com is now around 2000, and over the board I am about 1900 USCF. This of course means that there are certainly mistakes in my analysis - I am no master. I do let my silicon friend chime in at certain points in my analysis, to make sure that I'm not being an idiot, but if you all find improvements, I would be glad to hear them!

This game was in the Modern Benoni, Taimanov variation and I have white. This is an opening that I used to play with the black pieces, but I gave it up about a year ago, in part because of white setups such as the one I get in the game. With that, here is the game. I hope you enjoy.

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 c5 (2... e6 {I think that this might be a more accurate move
order to go into the benoni. In the game I am able to delay Nf3 so that I can
get in f4 without losing tempi, but in this position, I would probably play
Nf3 to avoid some annoying Queen's Indian things and to head towards my
favored lines in the QGD (if black plays with d5). For these reasons, I think
many benoni players like to delay c5 until after white plays Nf3. In the game,
I get to play with a rather nasty and tricky setup that proves to be very
dangerous for black.} 3. Nf3 c5 {And now white will either need to play
without a pawn on f4 (at least for the time being), or will need to lose time
to establish it.}) 3. d5 e6 {The idea behind the benoni, from black's
perspective, is to allow white to established an advanced center, often with
pawns on d5 and e4. Then the second player wants to obtain counter-chances on
the queenside and in trying to break white's center. We will see how my setup
tries to counteract both of these black plans.} 4. Nc3 exd5 5. cxd5 {And not 5.
Nxd5?!, of course. Here the white center is going to serve to restrain black's
forces, so we would like to keep pieces on the board so that the second
player's men can run into each other.} d6 6. e4 g6 {Black aims to control the
critical e5 square with a bishop, which could also exert an influence on the
queenside dark squares, should his plans come to fruition.} 7. f4 {And this is
the point. Since my king's knight is still on g1, I can play f4 without losing
tempi relocating my knight. My main plan in this position is to get my pieces
into a position so that I can at some point play the pawn break e5 under
favorable circumstances. One of the things that I have learned from playing
the benoni with both colors in the past is that the timing of this pawn break
is crucial to the first player's success.} Bg7 8. Bb5+ {This move is a tricky
one. It was first played by Fischer rival Mark Taimanov, and holds a
reputation as being one of the lines that causes black the most problems in
the benoni. The ideas behind this move are multiple. The first idea is,
clearly, to try to develop the bishop to a useful square, and force a black
response. In fact, this move wins a tempo, as both of the natural ways to
block the check are bad for black (see the note after the next move). I am
also starting to assert my control over the queenside light squares, in an
attempt to slow down black's ambitions on that side of the board. Further, I
am attempting to weaken black's potential control over the crucial e5 square
by pressuring a knight that would control the square from d7.} Nfd7 ({And not} 
8... Nbd7 $6 {after which the thematic break} 9. e5 $1 {is very strong, and
black's prospects are bleak. For example,} dxe5 10. fxe5 Nh5 11. e6 {And here
I think the current theoretical evaluation is that black is busted.}) (8... Bd7
$2 {Is even worse for black. Without the potential pressure on e5 from a d7
knight, the white center stays intact and the second player will suffer. For
example,} 9. e5 $1 Nh5 10. Nf3) 9. a4 {This move may seem silly. However, it
is very important that we stall black's ambitions on the queenside. If I were
to simply play a developing move like Nf3 here, black would surely respond
with ...a6, kicking the bishop, followed by ...b5. After these pawn moves,
black would have a dangerous amount of space on the queenside, and would
control many critical squares in that area. The game move increases my control
of the queenside light squares in order to slow down this plan.} O-O 10. Nf3
Re8 (10... Na6 $5 {Was Topalov's choice in this position, aiming to occupy the
weakened b4 square with a knight. As we can see, my plan with a4 may have
stopped black's main plan for now, but it gave up something in return. Perhaps
this was a better way to play the position for black.} 11. O-O Nb4) 11. O-O a6
12. Be2 {Here I could also have played 12. Bd3. I considered this move, as it
seems like a more active post for the bishop. However, it does not really work
well with my plan in the position. As I have said, I want to play for e5. In
order to make this pawn break work, I need primarily to fight for the control
of the e5 square, but also to defend d5, so that that pawn doesn't drop when
its commrade no longer defends it from e4. For this reason, I decided on the
slightly passive looking Be2.} Nb6 $6 {I think this is black's first real
inaccuracy in this game. The knight is trying to move away so that black can
develop his queenside pieces. However, he relinquishes control of the e5
square. Like I said, timing is everything in this opening. If you have been
paying attention, you know what comes next!} 13. e5 $5 {Of course! It may look
like the pawn can be taken - black has 3 attackers and white only has 2
defenders. However, the black queenside remains woefully undeveloped and the
white pieces are all ready to spring into action. The opening of the position
should surely favor the first player, and as can be seen in the note to the
next move, it does.} Bf5 {A good move, probably black's best. He develops a
piece to a good square and fights for control of the center.} (13... dxe5 $6
14. fxe5 Bxe5 (14... Rxe5 15. a5 N6d7 16. Nxe5 Nxe5 $18) 15. Nxe5 Rxe5 16. a5
N6d7 17. Bf4 Re8 18. Qd2 $18 {Black may have won a pawn, but his queenside is
still undeveloped, and the dark squares on his kingside are fatally weak. For
example,} Nf8 19. Bd3 Nbd7 20. Ne4 Nf6 21. Nd6 Re7 22. Bg5 Qxd6 23. Bxf6 Bf5 (
23... Re8 $4 24. Qh6) 24. Bxe7 Qxe7 25. Bxf5 gxf5 26. Rxf5) 14. a5 {Showing
the misplacement of this knight. Perhaps I even was a little over-zealous on
my last move with 13. e5. While that was a very strong move, it might have
been even stronger to first play 13. a5! followed by 14. e5!, after which the
reply ...Bf5 would be impossible, and black's queenside would be even more
underdeveloped. It is for these reasons that I have given my own move 13. e5 a
!? mark, indicating an interesting, if not best move. Like I said, timing is
everything in the benoni, and while good timing proved to be enough in this
game, it is possible that it could have been improved.} N6d7 $6 {This is
perhaps another inaccuracy by my opponent. With my slight move order mistake
on the previous two moves, I afforded him the option to play his knight to the
square vacated by the bishop. The move ...Nc8 would have moved the attacked
piece to a square where it at least defends the d6 point, and would no longer
be in the way of black's other knight. Perhaps my opponent aimed to increase
his control over the e5 square. However, the time for that has passed. Having
completed my initial plan of executing the e5 break under favorable
circumstances, I have moved on to a new plan.} 15. Ng5 $5 {This is my new plan:
to target black's weak points along the f-file. The f7 square is weak and I
have the potential to attack it with my knight and my rook. My other idea with
this move is to play against the f5 bishop. By moving my knight away from f3,
not only do I uncover the rook along the file, but my queen and bishop battery
have secured the g4 square for me, and my opponent's light squared bishop no
longer has a safe retreat square. I have abandoned my e5 pawn to its fate. It
has served its purpose and I will now focus on active piece play on the
kingside. As a college aquaintence of mine used to say: ""Idea: checkmate.""} (
15. Nd2 {The computer seems to like this move. I suppose the point is to set
up the bishop trap as in the game, but not to expose my knight to attack on g5.
I must admit I did not even consider this move during the game. Once I decided
that the knight should be moved, g5 seemed like the only square since I also
want to undermine the king's defense. I also didn't want to block my dark
bishop, in order to keep the maximum dynamic possibilities in my position. But
what do I know? After all, the silicon monster could crush me any day of the
week.}) 15... dxe5 {This seems to be black's only chance. He needs to create
counterplay somehow, or else he will be crushed on the kingside.} 16. g4 {
Trapping the bishop.} exf4 {This again seems to be black's only try. The idea
is that the defense of my knight has been cut off, and now it is hanging. I
decide to solve this dilemma in the most violent way.} 17. Nxf7 (17. Bxf4 {
This is also an option, but after} Bd4+ 18. Kh1 f6 19. gxf5 fxg5 20. Bd2 {A
similar situation to the game has occured, where I have traded my g5 knight
for his f5 bishop. But here, his king feels much safer to me, and why should I
allow that?}) 17... Kxf7 18. gxf5 Bd4+ (18... g5 19. Bh5+ Kf8 20. Bxe8 Qxe8)
19. Kh1 {This is the position I evaluated when looking at the move 15. Ng5.
Here black is temporarily up a pawn, and both kings seem to have a lot of air
around them. However, I decided that my king was in fact quite safe on h1.
This is mainly because of a phenomenon called the ""missing bishop"" where if
black still had his light squared bishop, he might be able to cause me some
problems along the a8-h1 diagonal. However, here my control of the kingside
light squares is strong, and I see no real way for him to attack my king. His
king, on the other hand, is quite misplaced on f7. His pawns shelter will soon
disappear, and his pieces are not arranged in a good way to protect their
monarch.} Nf6 {A good move. Knights are often the best pieces to defend the
king, and the rest of the queenside still needs to be developed.} {Now, over
the next few moves I take some time to consolidate my position. I want to
remove the pawn cover from around his king, and then redeploy some of my
pieces for maximum effect for the attack.} 20. fxg6+ hxg6 21. Bxf4 Rh8 $2 {
This strikes me as a poor move, and my silicon friend agrees. Black really
needs to focus on developing his remaining queenside pieces, and the rook does
little on h8, as my king is adequately defended by the influence of my two
strong bishops on the kingside. Notice also how this is the second time that
this rook has moved (not including castling), while my rook stands well on f1.
Maybe this again indicates why Topalov instead chose to play for the plan with
...Na6 on move 10, as the rook is not best on e8 in all lines. Maybe I am
wrong, but such foresight would certainly attest to the Bulgarian
Grandmaster's strength.} (21... Nbd7 {was surely called for.}) 22. Qc2 {
Targeting g6.} Nbd7 23. Rae1 (23. Rg1 {The computer likes this move, which I
cannot say that I considered seriously. It seems to me that there is no need
to give the exchange, since the attack on g6 will be strong regardless.
However, in this case the tactics do indeed seem to favor the first player, so
I must again tip my hat to the strength of the machine.} Nf8 (23... Bxg1 24.
Rxg1 Qg8 25. Bd3) 24. Bd3 Rg8) 23... Qxa5 $2 {I do not like this move at all.
It is true that earlier in the game, black would have loved to take this pawn
which was forestalling his ambitions on this side of the board. Perhaps my
opponent did not yet see the danger looming ahead.} 24. Bd3 {Attacking g6.}
Rag8 {Defending, but limiting the mobility of the rooks. Perhaps better was ...
Rhg8.} 25. d6 {After sitting on d5 for nearly the entire game, my central pawn
once again proves useful. This wins the e7 square as an entry point for my
rook into the opponent's position. It also sets up a further threat on g6, as
we shall see presently.} b5 $4 {Losing on the spot! It is true that this is
the type of queenside advance that black often plays for in the benoni, a plan
that worried me earlier in the game, against which i used the a4 idea. However,
after this my opponents position collapses. He must have been acting out of
desperation, hoping that I would miss the mate and allow him to create
counter-chances on the queenside. However, there follows a combination that
even I could calculate to the end (nearly) correctly, especially since this
was a correspondence game.} 26. Bxg6+ $1 {And the bishop is immune to capture!}
Kf8 ({If there follows} 26... Rxg6 {then} 27. Re7+ Kf8 (27... Kg8 28. Qxg6+ Kf8
29. Qf7#) 28. Qxg6 Rh7 29. Bh6+ {Discovering a pin on the f6 knight} Rxh6 30.
Re8#) 27. Re8+ Kg7 (27... Nxe8 {After this move, there is the very cheeky mate:
} 28. Bh6# {with double check, and mate. The king has no squares to which to
run, and he cannot block both checks.}) 28. Re7+ {And here my opponent
resigned. I will show the remainder of the mate, since it uses quite an
interesting idea.} Kf8 29. Qe4 $1 {A crazy move, and the reason why I said
that I calculated this nearly correctly to the end. The move I planned on
playing utilized this same idea, but was slower.} (29. Rf7+ {This is what I
probably would have played.} Ke8 30. Qe4+ {In this position, I found this move
to be much more obvious. I think that when attacking I tend to look at checks
before all other moves, which is why I saw this move here, but not in the
other position. The idea, however, is similar.} Nxe4 (30... Kd8 31. Qa8+ Nb8
32. Qxb8#) (30... Be5 31. Qa8+ Qd8 32. Re7+ Kf8 33. Qxd8+ Ne8 34. Qxe8#) (30...
Ne5 31. Re7+ Kf8 32. Qa8+ Ne8 33. Qxe8#) 31. Rf8+ Kxf8 32. Bh6# {Again with
the very cheeky mate.}) 29... Nxe4 {Of course the queen is off limits.} (29...
Be5 30. Qa8+ Nb8 31. Qxb8+ Qd8 32. Qxd8+ Ne8 33. Qxe8#) 30. Bh6# {I made this
the main line since it seemed to me most satisfying. All in all, I think I
played a pretty good game, although I still have something to learn about the
timing of my e5 break in this opening. My opponent also played well, although
early in the game it seemed like he was playing a little bit without a plan.
Then, once he finally settled on the plan of queenside action, it was much too
late, and the monarch paid the ultimate price.} 1-0

Examples of what I would like added to the side bar;

[http://chess.tv/](http://chess.tv/) - A dedicated chess channel for major events by DigiCast.

[http://www.twitch.tv/ChessNetwork](http://www.twitch.tv/ChessNetwork) - Jerry's Livestream.

[http://www.chess.com/](http://www.chess.com/) - A good all round chess site.

[http://www.chesscube.com/](http://www.chesscube.com/) - A user friendly blitz site.

[http://www.redhotpawn.com/](http://www.redhotpawn.com/) - A good correspondence chess site.

It was just a thought. If you want me to add some to the list just leave a comment or pm me.

It's a Flemish detective novel and the title means ""the enemy"".

[pgn] [FEN ""8/8/4n3/8/3Kqr2/8/8/8 w - - 0 0""] [/pgn]

I saw the chess-related cover and wanted to see if it is a checkmate, like I suspected. Not only is it not a checkmate (unless there is a piece not shown blocking the king); the position is impossible.

Here's my reasoning:

* the king could not have moved last, because that would mean he put himself in check

* the queen could not have moved last, because then the king was already in check by the knight (even if there was a white piece between the rook and the king).

* the knight could not have moved last, because then the king was already in check by the queen.

* the rook could not have moved last because then the king was already in check by the queen and the knight.

* no other piece not shown could have moved last because the king was already in check.

Am I correct? Is it indeed impossible to reach this position in a game?

Anyway, I got a good laugh out of it. Please feel free to post other examples of other chess-related screw-ups that you know of.

Im pretty sure this is really my last chance to go for it, because I'm starting my job in the fall, and from what I hear, its hard to be serious about hobbies while balancing a job, girlfriend, friends ect.

I have the entire summer to go to tournaments before my job starts, and Dallas has at least two tourneys a week.

He knows that I want to play against his isolated e-pawn, so he immediately
takes steps to secure  it. This move prevents an annoying Ng4 move, and thus

quickly fall into a passive position.} 11. Nge2 $1 {It's important for White

One thing that I keep reading is the huge benefits that come from discussing the game with people rated higher than you. I have a few informal relationships like that, but I'd like to find someone who can be consistent about it and help me regularly. But... to be fair, I should be willing to help people rated lower than me, too!

In this thread, make a post if you are looking for a mentor higher-rated than you and/or would like to be a mentor to someone lower-rated.

Make a post like this:

* Where I play: Chess.com and Chesscube
* My rating: 1400
* Time control (if applicable): 45 45
* Who I'll mentor: Anyone below 1000
* Mentor I'd like: Anyone above 1800
* Commitment: An hour a week
* Any other notes on what you're looking for in a mentor, and/or how you think you can help lower-level players.

How you work with your mentor/mentee is up to you! Get on Skype, or play a game together, solve puzzles together, ask strategic questions, get book recommendations, etc, etc.

Please update your post after you've found someone to work with, so people know to look elsewhere!

Of course, all the books I read are in English, since that is the only language I know.  I do however see that the FIDE handbook does not make this distinction.

What I would like to know is whether this distinction is peculiar to English, or is it more fundamental and is present in other languages as well?  Could speakers of languages other than English post saying how the terminology works in other languages?

Edit: the conclusion is that a number of other languages do have a word referring to non-pawn men, and often have finer distinctions for things like heavy (rook, queen) or light (bishop, knight) pieces.  Some languages have ways of referring to non-king, non-pawn men, which I think English does not have.  And like in English, these exact meanings of these terms sometimes depend on context.

For those that do not want to learn heavy amounts of theory against say the French defence and Sicilian defence, there is the move 2.d3 - which usually leads to Kings Indian Attack systems.

Members would be able to play one league game per week against a designated opponent.

This is what I have in mind right now, mainly based on how chess clubs work in the Netherlands, and on Internet chess:

- Each week, before a certain time (say saturday midnight GMT), you tell me whether you will be playing that week
- On sundays I make the playing schedule for that week, you contact your opponent to find a good time to play the game
- If there is an odd number of players then someone has to sit on the sidelines that week, that can only happen once per season per player, and an opponent may be found during the week
- You only play each opponent once unless you've already played everybody
- We try to keep colours balanced, and you play people near you in the standings as much as possible
- Games take place on FICS unless both opponents prefer somewhere else
- Games are with a standard time control, not too fast because we'd like a semi serious game, not too slow because then it becomes hard to find a good time for both players; 15 minutes with 5 seconds increment, something like that?
- Scoring system: right now I think that for the first season we should go for something simple, e.g. percentage of points scored (7.5 out of 10 = 75%)
- After a while (every half year?) we have a Champion, and the league starts over

Any interest? Should it work entirely differently? Looking forwards to your comments.",,False,self,t5_2qhr7,False,,,True,t3_eb984,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/eb984/towards_a_reddit_chess_club/,

**The Scotch Game**

&gt; 3.d4 

http://i.imgur.com/CXjsiQA.jpg

Ercole del Rio, in his 1750 treatise *Sopra il giuoco degli Scacchi, Osservazioni pratiche d’anonimo Autore Modenese* (""On the game of Chess, practical Observations by an anonymous Modenese Author""), was the first author to mention what is now called the Scotch Game. The opening received its name from a correspondence match in 1824 between Edinburgh and London. Popular in the 19th century, by 1900 the Scotch had lost favour among top players because it was thought to release the central tension too early and allow Black to equalise without difficulty. More recently, grandmasters Garry Kasparov and Jan Timman helped to re-popularize the Scotch when they used it as a surprise weapon to avoid the well-analysed Ruy Lopez.

My posted rating for this tournament was 1900, but I know I'm a stronger player. I had some very tough opponents, the five of them had an average rating of 2114. It was probably the best tournament I've ever played in terms of results, and my rating shot up to 2025. However, the quality of my play reveals much room for improvement. I still had a lot of fun! Hopefully all the formatting and such works.

First round I got lucky when my opponent blundered the exchange, but I gave up more counterplay than I was comfortable with.

EDIT: Due to a problem with the PGN viewer, I cut out some comments on the five games. Here's what I had to say about them:

Second round: Second game was against a 13-year-old whiz kid from Michigan, but I held my own and forced an early draw.

Third round: This game was my toughest and my only loss, and I misplayed the opening (the Grunfeld is notoriously complex, technical, and tricky), though against a master-strength player I survived fairly long.

Fourth Round: This was also a very difficult game and I made a risky move in time pressure that ended up working.

Fifth Round: This game.... I swindled the win. But my opponent was 20 minutes late to the board, and seemed very distracted and nervous, and must have drank a gallon of coffee over the course of the game. Sometimes, your temperament over the board can really make a difference, and I think he was too distracted to see the swindle coming.",,False,self,t5_2qhr7,1372139090.0,,,True,t3_1gytgj,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1gytgj/my_five_games_from_the_columbus_open/,

(new video about this here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUkpt8bqzbw)

I wanted to highlight some thoughts recently about the difference between winning and losing chess games. I answered on another thread but thought this deserves a new thread topic.

What is the difference to you between winning and losing?!

Here are my initial thoughts: 

- Winning and losing have quite a lot in common for most people here :
In both cases both you and your opponent usually made terrible blunders.

Tartakower observed this and in jest said :

""The winner of the game is the player who makes the next-to-last mistake.""

- In both cases you can try and improve your game from objective review of the game.

Both were games to be enjoyed for hopefully the most part except if you were tortured in a lost position for hours.

- The end result might be different - that's about it really for the difference between winning and losing for most redditors here I would assume. 

For 'chess as a sport' fans the end result often means winning turns into celebration and complacency for not doing an objective review of the game - setting oneself up for future losses. For the losers they are more likely to want to turn the pain of losing into a 'lesson' and therefore potentially might improve their underlying chess strength if they do an objective review. They set themselves up more if they do this for potentially winning more in the future if their underlying game strength improves.

Capablanca observed the ""chess as a sport"" symptoms and is quoted as saying:

""Most players ... do not like losing, and consider defeat as something shameful. This is a wrong attitude. Those who wish to perfect themselves must regard their losses as lessons and learn from them what sorts of things to avoid in the future.""

Kasparov considers his game content or used to for continuous rechecking, and echoes his thoughts in this video:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2KKfOGaR_w

For rating conscious players, a loss means a loss in rating points and any accompanying self-esteem that brings. And the reverse for winning.  This is despite the fact that rating actually is an external performance measure - which might have very little to do with one's actually underlying chess strength and understanding. Rating is also ""in context"" - if you are just bashing people lower rated than you, then you can inflate your rating too.

My question is this: What are the most basic things that beginners should know or be aware of regarding their openings. Does it even matter at beginner level games?

One thing I've noticed here and with chess novices in general is a preoccupation with learning openings. If you want my advice (I'm about 2100 uscf if that means anything), then don't focus too much on openings. I got to about 1900 uscf knowing almost nothing about openings other than the basic principles (controlling the center, developing your pieces, castling, etc.). The EASIEST way to improve is to play a lot of online chess and do a lot tactics. For online chess, I liked icc because it's more of a serious environment than chess.com, although it does cost money. Tactics can be done anywhere, whether in a tactics book or chess tempo.com . Obviously you need to complement these with other things like endgame training and positional ideas (How to Reassess your Chess by Silman is great), but in my opinion, these should be the core of your training. Only after you've gotten a strong grasp of the foundations of chess should you start looking at openings. Trust me on this one, I've been bullshitting openings for a while now and they only really matter at the higher levels (2000+) of chess.",,False,self,t5_2qhr7,False,,,True,t3_1awjgc,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1awjgc/honest_advice_for_beginnersnovices/,

Try to avoid them!

1. If you are low on time with an absolutely dominating position (like the player who lost on time with a queen and rook vs a pawn), just try to make sure that the other player will have no mating material. Even if you don't have the time to mate, you can at least make sure you have a draw in hand.

2. The object of the game is to win. If you see a sacrifice that wins instantly, go for it. However, unless your name is Mikhail Tal (And I assure you, it isn't), it is generally best to check for a better move after you consider an unclear sacrifice. If there isn't, go for it. However, if you have the time, you are more likely to earn a clean win than a messy one where you might lose.

3. If you fall into a slump, take a break. Think and relax. Then come back later. You will be less likely to be over-aggressive when you try to get your rating back.

4. If you find yourself getting emotionally attached to your play, also take a break. You want to be level-headed, or you might play too aggressively again.

5. Don't play late into the night. When you're tired, you're less likely to play sound chess.

6. If your opponent is low on time, a good way to try to pressure the clock may be to throw in some unexpected moves or checks. The unexpected check or rook sacrifice you may play might throw them off long enough to salvage a draw or win a drawn position or a time scramble. Also, you can in some time controls where you don't add time to the clock, if your opponent is low on time, repeating moves and holding the position can make your opponent rush and make hasty moves to make your job easier (assuming the position allows for this).

7. If low on time in a time control setting where you can add time to your clock by moving, it can be a good strategy to force a repetition of moves when you can. You can earn more thinking time for yourself and allow yourself to calm down and take full control of the situation at hand.

8. Premove recaptures or if your opponent has to make a really obvious move (obvious recapture, move out of check, etc.)  Don't premove when your opponent has too many options, however, or he could catch you off guard and this would hurt.

1341417064.0,22,self.chess,w19rz,A list of useful chess ideas,protagonic,27,5,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w19rz/a_list_of_useful_chess_ideas/,"I think one of the main things that separates an experienced player from a beginner is that the experienced player has a repertoire of ideas that the beginner has not. They are really just shortcuts that help in making sense of a position. 

Of course, all the basic tactical ideas belong here: forks, pins, skewers, along with some typical instances of them. The basic strategic ideas also: control of the centre, activity of pieces, etc. 

What I'm looking for and could not find, is a list of other useful ideas, so it would be awesome if you could share the ones you know! I prefer to keep the definition of this very broad, so feel free to add whatever. 

A few examples I can think of:

Rook lift. There was just an article about this on chess.com. It's not something that I have played very often in my own games, but when I have it's *only* because I had seen the idea before. There is no way I would have thought of that myself, on the board. 

Counting defenders and attackers. I remember when I was just starting out and learned/realised this, it was a huge deal. Knight takes, then his bishop takes, then my other knight takes... and so on. You can just count the amount of defenders and attackers, and if they are the same then the piece or square is defended, if you have more you can take then. But beware of the value of the pieces, the order in which they take and any inbetween moves (another important idea)!

Opposition. It's way harder to calculate an endgame if you don't know this. It is a pretty standard idea though... also the idea that the king should be in the square of the passed pawn in order to prevent queening, distant opposition, triangulation, etc. 

Rooks belong behind the passed pawn!

I find the idea of a fortress fascinating, but I've never really used this in a game (except in very simplified cases, like getting the king in a corner against a pawn and a bishop that does not control it).",,False,self,t5_2qhr7,False,,,True,t3_w19rz,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/w19rz/a_list_of_useful_chess_ideas/,

The rules were simple: White to play all the time. Each player played white 5 times, black 5 times. Whomever had the highest score at the end wins 3000$ prize money.

The endgame was approved by a local grandmaster and by a few chess computers, so the game was within 1 centipawn of advantage of either player.

I played since 8am, Friday afternoon, people. Each game took me little over an hour to play. However, my last game, my personal best and favorite, was also my tiebreaker.

I was in 6th, with 8.5 points. The people above all had 9.0+. So my last matched was not a sure 1st place win, but at least a 3rd place win.

Unfortunately, I cannot find a website that will host my game, even if I provide pgn, and I'm very tired so I am using my last resources and posting it as a static, and will provide pgn. Everyone can just play the game on an artificial board, online board, or just use your mind :)

In this game, I played black.

I took 5 hours to complete this last game (as was regulation for everyones last game) Needless to say, I just won a grand total of $1260. Who says you always lose money in Vegas? ;D

Now, I did not win, but tied. It was enough to push me to 3rd place.

In fact, I have heard that some computers say it is worth about a pawn.  However, I have won many games where I've gone a pawn up in the middle game, but have seen no significant difference in the outcomes of my games where I gain the bishop pair.

I know a few practical ways to use them to my advantage, such as opening up the position if possible, getting them outside of my pawn chain, and getting them working on adjacent diagonals, however I feel like I am missing something.  As an example, I often end up with my bishops staring at my opponent's pawns with no way of breaking through.

Many times I find myself in situations where I can force an exchange that leaves me with the bishop pair, but maybe weakens my position in other aspects. Knowing I can't successfully leverage my bishop pair into any concrete positional/tactical advantage, I often avoid these exchanges, but I feel like I need the ability to capitalize on even these small advantages if I am going to keep improving. What should I do to get the most out of my bishop pair?  I am hoping for concrete tactical/positional plans, not simply ""open the position"" type responses.

Even though I don't use it until I've already moved (so I'm a step behind), it does give me an idea for future moves and/or lines. Is this cheating?

Anyway, I almost always win since he doesn't know any strategies, and makes a lot of drunken blunders. But all my victories are pretty damn shallow and make me realize how little I know. Nine games out of ten, I win by simply playing defensively, protecting my pieces, and waiting for him to put one of his valuable pieces in a vulnerable position. I whittle down his guys until nothing's left but the king. Literally the last 8 matches have ended in the exact same scenario: He makes mistakes until he has just one knight or rook left, I eventually manage to capture it because I have at least four or five non-pawn pieces on the board, and then I checkmate him by pinning his king between an edge and a rook column, then moving my queen into the same column as his king. I'm pretty sure I'm describing the most absolute rudimentary method of approaching a chess game.

Winning with the same move every time makes me feel really lame, so I was thinking about learning more. But what does ""learning chess"" mean?

My opponent was rated 1935, which, given my short-term goals, meant I absolutely had to win.

I was somewhat torn about posting this game, since it's rather one-sided.  At the same time, it has a few things going for it that make it somewhat interesting.  First, White's 17th is probably the most aesthetically pleasing single move I've played to date (not particularly hard to find, just pretty and somewhat paradoxical).  

Second, this game, along with a near-loss in the 4th round, made me realize something rather important:  the fewer problems you create for your opponent (in this case, me), the stronger your opponent will play.  

In this case, this was most likely the strongest nontrivial game I've ever played:  Houdini simply doesn't disagree with anything I did.  This is unusual, to put it mildly, so I spent a fair bit of time trying to figure out what it is that I did and how to do it again.

Finally, I hope that this provides some counterbalance to the popular claim that everyone should spend 99% of their time on tactics.  My opponent could very well have been a much stronger tactician than I -- and my main task, throughout the game, was to make sure that we never found out.

**Edit:**  still having problems with the PGN viewer in Firefox, by the way -- I thought those had been fixed in 1.6?  Occasionally, it won't play past the 5th move or so, or will go blank if you go directly to some specific move.  Other times, works just fine (on the same PGN in the same post).

    1. d4 d6 
    
{Inviting White to play 2.e4, transposing into either a Pirc or a Philidor. I do play 2.e4 occasionally, but I didn't feel sufficiently prepared.} 

    2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 e5 5. dxe5 
    
{A spur of the moment decision. I've almost never exchanged on e5 in the KID, but one of my goals for this tournament was to work on converting small advantages, and the ensuing queenless middlegame appealed to me for some reason.} 

    5... dxe5 6. Be3 

(6. Qxd8+ Kxd8 7. Be3 {is similar to the game. The immediate capture is played almost exclusively by strong players, but I don't see how Black's king is any worse on c7 than it is on g8.}) 
    
    6... Qxd1+ 7. Rxd1 c6 
    
{Nb5 was never a threat, and a simple 7...Nf6 would have come close to equalizing.  The text move will prove to be the source of Black's problems for the remainder of the game: it denies the c6 square to the knight, meaning that Nf6 can't be played without hanging the e5 pawn, so now Black has to somehow thread three pieces through the two available squares e7 and d7.}

    8. Nf3 Be6 
    
{One possible plan here was to put a piece on c4 via c4-c5, Nd2, and Bc4, but I felt that this was too slow. Another plan is to wait for Ne7 and put a bishop on d6, where it would be incredibly strong. 

My opponent decides to respond prophylactically to the first one, which was perhaps a mistake. Two other options were available:} 

(8. .. Nf6 9. Nxe5 Nxe4 10.Nxe4 Bxe5 11. Nd6+ Ke7 12. c5 {and White is better .}) 

({Instead, Black could have achieved near equality with a standard exchange operation:} 8... Bg4 9. Be2 Bxf3 10. Bxf3 Bh6) 

    9. Ng5 
    
{Conventional wisdom dictates that the side with more space shouldn't exchange, but Be6 is Black's only active piece, and I felt that exchanging light-squared bishops on e2 would benefit White more than it would benefit Black. Provoking ...h6 also seemed like a potentially good idea.} 

    9... Bg4 10. Be2 Bd7 
    
{I don't understand this move. I had mostly just considered the obvious Bxe2:} 

(10. .. Bxe2 11. Kxe2 Nf6 12.Rd2 Nbd7 13. Rhd1 {at which point Black should have trouble getting his bishop into play (via e.g. Bg7-f8-c5) without hanging a pawn on e5.})

    11.Rd2 
    
{White wants to castle and play Rd2 followed by Rfd1. I decided that the order didn't matter, and figured I'd overprotect e2 just in case.} 

    11... h6 12. Nf3 Ne7 13. O-O Be6 14. Bc5 
    
{Improving my pieces while making it difficult for Black to develop. The bishop is headed for d6, targeting e5 while being generally annoying.} 

    14... Nd7 15. Bd6 Bf6 
    
{Here and earlier, I was mostly worried about Black transferring his bishop to the a3-f8 diagonal and forcing exchanges. To do this, the knight must go on g6, so 15...g5 had to be the best move. After the text, the bishop is both passive and vulnerable.}

As my opponent and I are both pretty bad, we should have a lot to learn.


I was playing a blitz game (I'm white; 10 min. controls) with a friend today, and reached a position that I believed (and chessx) agreed was theoretically drawn. At that point in the game, he had 6 seconds left, while I had 13. Not wanting to pick up a cheap win off a drawn position, I offered a draw, which he (of course) took.

We did have an interesting discussion afterward, though, with him essentially saying that I should have taken the win, because that's the nature of blitz chess. I'm not sure I agree, because the win would be pretty much meaningless to me. (We're certainly not playing in a tournament here.)

Thoughts? What would you have done?

So my question, how do I best teach him chess?

I wish there was a place like team liquid where you could go and view streams. 

Could KingsCrusher's site be that place? 

I only suggest Chessworld because KingsCrusher is an active redditor, and obviously has a successful chess website.

Do chess pros need motivation for streaming? If they are a dynamic personality and good at chess they can gain followers and generate income. 

Hell I am a really bad chess player and I would consider streaming just to have people watch me and try and improve.

I just wanted to bring up the differences I've noticed - 

Bosnian player likes to claim she is ""eating"" my pieces.  I like to make jokes about it.  She also calls the bishop the hunter; I believe this is because the bishop is a catholic reference and Bosnia is primarily Islamic.  Also, she calls the knight horse  or actually horsie.  Most noteably, ""check"" is translated to sh'a (sp) but there is a queen check pronounce - sh'e(sp as well).  She was a little upset that I didn't say sh'e on my current game when I baited her but then took her queen.  I'll try to abide to her rules from here on out.

I also get to play with someone from Belarus, and he calls the bishop - elephants.  He also jokes that he knights are horsies.

Lastly, I've played someone from India, and they told me that they setup the board differently.  They also call their bishops - elephants.

He's been a big part of ICC for a long time and has written a couple of nice books on attacking chess.

In 1981-2 he took part in the seventh series of  The Master Game, a BBC TV chess tournament. It's hard to appreciate just how much of an impact this show had in view of today's technology and the availability of GM thought. In the those pre-computer times, pieces were moved via a glass chess board and black art (velvet) with a grid system to highlight squares.

Most importantly though, was that the players spoke about their thinking process and variations which was a revelation (well, to me at least).

Larry was up against a teenaged Nigel Short. Larry got a good position with a bit of an attack. He went straight for Nigel's king and both players seemed to think Short was on the ropes. Nigel kept finding strong defensive moves and Larry kept pressing his attack.

Finally, it became apparent that Larry's attack was over and Nigel was winning. Larry gave a big sigh and said:

""Wow, I guess I'm the new apprentice for Bozo the clown"".

Larry says some other great stuff and you can see the encounter [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzEYVuiS3CU).

Well worth watching.

Lately we've been having a rash of threads complaining about people posting low quality games, i.e. ""look at my bullet game with a funny ending!"" I agree that these kinds of games can be irritating popping up on my frontpage or as the top link in the subreddit. So, I thought we could combine them into one mega-thread, which may be renewed every few days, or maybe every week.

How it works: a top level comment should be one of your recent games.

Step 1: Post the site of the game (chess.com, ICC, OTB, etc), the ratings of the two players, the time controls, and which side you played. 

Step 2: post the game pgn. Remember to add [ pgn] [ /pgn]. Add whatever commentary you'd like, but put comments in {} brackets.

Step 3: any response should be a second level comment. Upvotes and downvotes according to how interesting the game was, how good your annotation was, etc. 

Hopefully this will be popular. It seems like it might be a nice way to get more of a community feeling on r/chess, as we can track each other's progress on a week to week basis.

1329054633.0,21,self.chess,pm0wi,My method for determining what to work on.,goltrpoat,24,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/pm0wi/my_method_for_determining_what_to_work_on/,"The most difficult thing about studying chess without a trainer is figuring out *what* to work on.  This is reflected in the number of posts here that ask the perfectly legitimate, but essentially unanswerable question:  ""what should I work on next?""

One well-known methodology is to analyze your own games.  This is, of course, indispensable, and should always be at the core of any training regimen.  However, this method rarely produces *global*, strategic decisions about the direction of your training for, say, the next six months (unless you luck out and have an epiphany along the lines of ""you know, I really have no idea how to play against Benoni-like structures with White"").

I came up with the solution a few months ago, and so far it's been consistently useful.  I suspect that it might be difficult to apply below 1600 or so, but otherwise it seems like it should be fairly universal.  The basic idea is to conduct thought experiments that examine the hypothetical results of your training, while making the assumption that you'll choose an optimal (but not yet known) training regimen.  Then you solve for the unknown variable, so to speak.

I'll use myself as an example.  First, you pick a very ambitious, yet practically attainable, goal.  To put what follows into context, mine is to surpass 2300 FIDE in three years.  Second, you pretend to get in a time machine, travel to three years from now, and start asking the future you questions;  if your goals are loftier than mine, feel free to replace the time machine with a crowd of reporters.

""What would you say was the main thing responsible for your remarkably consistent improvement over the last three years?""  

Now instead of dealing with a nebulous ""what should I work on"" question, I have a very concrete question to answer:  if three years from now I'm over 2300, then there's something very specific I must have done, and what the hell is it?

""Well, first,"" I say, ""I started to make sure that I'm able to spend at least two hours a day on training *(total lie, at least for now)*, since obtaining actual results requires actual work.  Otherwise, the first thing I realized was that a portion of my opening repertoire was based on simply not understanding the middlegame positions resulting from a number of openings:  I avoided the Gruenfeld main lines and the Meran with White, for instance, which in retrospect denied me entire categories of highly interesting middlegame positions.""

When I came up with that answer, practically off the top of my head, that was a serious, huge, major epiphany.  I strongly suspect it's also what a good trainer would have said after taking a look at my games.  Obviously it's something I knew already, but I really didn't *want to* work on that.  Putting myself in a scenario, made up or not, where I *had to* be honest, seemed to just move that issue to the forefront.

I won't go over the rest of my answer, I just wanted to demonstrate the portion of it that made an immediate impact, which also illustrates how the technique is complementary to analysis (I would never have been able to arrive at that realization just by analyzing my games).  The same technique can be applied to more concrete goals:  ""goltrpoat, three years ago your endgame technique was, shall we say, average at best, but you seem to have improved drastically since.  What happened?""  ""Well..."", etc.

I think that the effectiveness of this technique should be fairly universal, since it's just a way to pose the same question in a much more *answerable* form.  Nonetheless, I've never heard of it before, so I just figured I'd share in case someone might find it useful.
