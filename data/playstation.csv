I remember getting the playstation 1 for Christmas. Crash Bandicoot was the only game I got that year but soon saved money to buy my own games later.

When NCAA 98 came out, my dad bought me the game. We played and well he kicked my ass every single game we played.

Fast forward, I am 26 years old, live two states away, family of my own and my dad sends me a text asking, ""When we go on vacation next month, do you want me to bring your playstation and NCAA 98?"" I told him to kiss my ass. I will never forget every time I see or hear the name Danny Wuerffel, I picture taking NCAA98 out of the case and getting ready for a stomping.

We have been bringing this with us to every vacation since I can remember. We save it for a rainy day at the beach or just too damn lazy to get out of the condo one day. I missed two family vacations while I was in the Marine Corps.

We have both pre-ordered the PS4 through amazon. Hopefully pass something as comical down to my son someday.

I had PS+ so it turned out a great deal for me because it was $28 in the PSN store and was discounted 50% so I got it for $14. I checked gamestop and they have it for $40 on new and $38 on pre-owned.

But here's the thing: I only bought the one for PS3. But apparently, with that $14 purchase, I checked my available downloads and **also** got the PS Vita version?

So not only I got a huge savings on it, but I also got it for two consoles (PS3 and PS Vita)? Holy crap I didn't know buying through PSN was **this** good (and also mad good discount with PS+).

Was it always like this with PSN? If so, this makes me really want to have Vita now. (PS4+Vita bundle please Sony)...

...

Additional question though **regarding free games from PS+**: If my PS+ expired and I renewed it maybe a week or two after it expired, will I still have access to the PS+ free games I have previously purchased? I mean, will I still be able to redownload them again or will they be removed from my download list?

This is an idea that I hope you, the PlayStation community, can bring up to Sony to implement this. This is the easiest feature ever to be implemented and I have no idea why Sony didn't do it yet.

A very small feature that should be on PlayStation is the ability to go offline. A simple edition to the types of status you can put, a ""offline"" or ""invisible"" button should be added. 

Why you may ask? Why would anyone want to appear offline?
First, this is a feature Xbox has that helps its users and Sony wants to catch up with Microsoft so... Why not?

SECOND, and my personal reason, along with thousands of others, is privacy. You see, I have lots of friends (in real life) that have the PlayStation. In fact, almost all my friends list is all people i know in real life. While its nice to play with friends, we all have days that we just want to play by ourselves. For me, what happens is that I get a game invite since I appear on but I really don't feel like playing with him/her. Keep in mind that its not that I hate them, it's just I want to play by myself.

I'm forced to ignore or make an excuse saying that its not really me and I'm someone else using my console. It's not a good feeling overall. 

I would like to ask if Sony implements this feature onto the PS3, a simple software update can roll this out AND if for some reason they can't, it would be nice enough to add it to the upcoming PS4.

I hope this gets talked a lot and eventually get the eye of Sony to recognize and implement this.

Thank you and please feel free to post your comments and thoughts below! :D

They went through a few questions, ""is it getting hot?"", ""is it all games?"", ""does it always happen?"". Once he had an idea of the issue, he told me that one of the files may have corrupted and that it's a common issue. He then told me to tell the console to look for any corrupted files. You do this by holding the power button down. It'll beep once, then it'll do a double beep which then you release the power button and it'll bring you to a debug menu with the options. If you hold it too long, it will just turn the console off. One of the options was ""Rebuild File System"" in the debug menu, which will look for any corrupted files, and fix them. Once this had looked for them, found them, and replaced them, my games then worked flawlessly. This is just for anyone who has had this issue. The guy who was helping was extremely patient and kind, and he also was able to respond very quickly. Thank you Sony!

I had a PS2 a long time ago, but since then I've been on the 360 until I built my PC very recently. I've never followed what is happening on the Playstation side of things, so I've gotten pretty out of the loop. I've decided that I want to catch up on a lot of the great exclusives before the next generation comes out, but most cross platform titles I'd still rather have for the PC. Is it worth getting one so close to the end of it's life just for those few games, as good as they are?

 I know that certain models of the launch PS3 are backwards compatible with the PS2, is it worth finding one of those? Or is the newest ""super slim"" model the one I should go for? Which bundle do you recommend, and what must play games should I pick up?

Sorry if this has been asked before; I didn't see anything recent in a cursory search, but then Reddit's search isn't the best...

Cheaper than Amazon, old slim which I think I like better (the sliding top seems *really* easy to break to me), and a good game that I'll definitely buy anyway. I might go with this one assuming there isn't something wrong with that model.

Also on my list of games to play are Persona 3 and 4, Rachet and Clank, Okami, Viewtiful Joe, Sly Cooper, Katamari, and Killzone.

What other great PS2 games should I try to get my hands on?

It's a PS3 slim and I've had it for about 4 years, so not really surprised there. My friend and I have already tried changing the thermal paste so I guess that wasn't the problem. I decided to talk to a Sony Representative about it and he said that I can send it in for $99, where they can fix it or send me another refurb, with a 90 day warranty. I've looked around and a new PS3 Super Slim bundle costs about $250 with a 250gb harddrive (couldn't find one that wasn't in a bundle). If I could find a stand alone new PS3 with a small harddrive, that costs less than the bundle costs, I was thinking of using my PS3 Slim's 250gb harddrive to replace the new ones'. 

So I'm wondering, should I send it in for $99 or play it safe and pay $250 for a brand new Super Slim? I'd really love to know what you guys think because I have no idea what to do.

Now I don't own a PS3 but I do have a PS4 zero-balance pre-order that I am waiting for! 

I have several (or 7!) questions regarding to how the removable HDD process works for the PS3.

1. Does the mounting bracket you have to buy support 2.5 and 3.5"" drives?
2. Does the PS3 support HDD's over 7200rpm?
3. Are SSD's actually a bad choice due to the amount of (guessing) read/writing the Playstation does?
4. How would you transfer content from an existing PS3 HDD to a user-replaced HDD?
5. Once the HDD has PS3 specific content on it, can you hook it upto a PC and check out the contents on there?
6. How does the PS3 handle the HDD -&gt; PS3 connection? Is it like a SATA cable, or a sata output jack that plugs in at the bottom?
7. How big are game installs usually? (This would give me an idea of going SSD or HDD)

Many questions I know, but I would really appreciate answers as even though they are for the PS3, I could extrapolate on this feature for the PS4 and give me some insight on whether to replace the default 500GB HDD it comes with, with either a 250GB SSD or 1+TB Caviar Black HDD.

I plan on buying a PS4 at launch and it will be my first console since the PS2.

I am a huge Playstation fan.  I grew up playing the NES and SNES systems until I was about 10 and my family bought a Playstation, which I fell in love with.  To this day, it is still probably my favorite console.  When I was about 13 the PS2 launched and I fell deeper down the Playstation rabbit hole.  Around that time I started getting involved with computers and PC gaming, and I haven't looked back since.  A little while after I graduated high school the PS3 and XBOX 360 came out, and I passed them both up.

Now, with the announcement of the PS4, I am hooked again.  It's been a long time since I've been interested in console gaming, but I am ready to jump back in.

I am a bit confused however. There are several games that have me interested in getting a PS4; Watch Dogs, The Division, The Crew, Destiny.  What confuses me, is that a couple of those titles (Watch Dogs, Destiny), are coming to both PS3 and PS4.  How does that work?

In my day, we have never heard of such a thing.  Is it the same game with lowered graphics?  Could a PS3 and a PS4 user both play Destiny together?  These may seem like simple questions, but I have never heard of anything like this before.

We gave away our Xbox 360 to our relatives since theirs was breaking down. I have very minimal experience with Playstation, and seeing all those 5, XII, VII, 9, part games can be pretty intimidating and would love to get some suggestions.

First, some previous experience. I loved Gran Turismo, played it on the PS1 religiously. Beat Valkyrie Profile, and played a bit of Front Mission and Tenchu. DBZ and Bloody Roar were my go-to fighter games.

And I think that's about it. Since moving to Xbox, I really missed playing any anime/mecha based game and endless RPGs that Sony always gets.

Definitely getting the newest GT. As for the premium games, I really want to get into Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy, Metal Gear Solid, God of War, but I have no idea where to start.

Would also like some suggestion for some cheap and fun mindless button-mashing fighting games (not Dynasty Warrior type), maybe more like Dreamcast's Powerstone, some DBZ, SSB type. Also a bit curious about the motion controller. Any good games for it? Not talking about ping pong or tennis, more along the lines of the Wii's ""No More Heroes"".

There is one game I played when I was a kid that I really want to revisit but I can't remember the name. I'll try to explain the gameplay in as much detail as I can and maybe some of you have played it and can tell me what's the name.

So it was a fighting game but not a 1-on-1 fighter, you go through levers and fight waves of enemies, there were 4 characters to choose from - 2 chicks, 1 normal dude and one buff motherfucker, as far as I remember the buff dude is wearing a white tank-top. While playing you can pick up objects and throw them at enemies, you can roll around and dodge shit, I think you can also beat the shit out of a wending machine and drink the sodas that fall out to regain HP. The game can be played either in local co-op or alone. Also the camera is not from the side but also not from the top as in first GTA games, the view is very similar to games like Bastion. I think it's called top-down view?

PS3 - Pros

* Cheaper price
* Reliable hardware/software
* Good amount of games
* Lots of exclusives I haven't played

PS4 - Pros 

* New technology
* New games designed for next gen

PS4 - Cons

* Chance for glitches/buggy consoles

I didn't hop on the PS3 train this gen because of the insane price ($600) it cost at launched, and by the time the price went down, I became too invested in the Xbox 360's library that I didn't feel that it was worth buying a PS3 to only play the exclusives.

 

Enough with the backstory. I came across a CECH-01 Model (40GB) for $120 that I couldn't pass up.

 

As I wait for it to arrive in the mail, I'm looking into what I should get for my new machine.

 

I was thinking the God of War Saga &amp; the Resistance Collection, but other than that, I'm not really sure.

 

I also need to pick up a controller &amp; a power cable as the eBay listing does not include one.

 

Please leave any suggestions, they would be appreciated.

 

Thanks.

So far, I have seen the game freeze after selecting GTA IV, the audio has crashed in the middle of playing-it just froze like taking a cartridge out of the gameboy, the game has stopped showing parts of the GUI and even stopped me from using controls properly- I couldn't shoot, take out the phone, etc.

So everyone, is this a version glitch? Do I need to update something? Or is my CD getting damaged?

Just today when I played, I had the GUI problems, so I cleaned the disc and put it back in... Now it completely freezes after I pick GTA IV and my playstation reset when I took out the disc.

First, the console is out of warranty. The Sony CSR that I spoke with told me it would be $99 to fix the system. Website shows they charge at least $50 for shipping and to actually look at the system without repairs. Is this correct?

I tried restarting my system, restoring former settings, turning my router on and off, trying different ethernet cables, tried unplugging ethernet and connecting via wifi (the scan shows my SSID but it's unable to connect), I've tried basically everything. 

What's weird, is now my ""test connection"" screen only displays [these](http://i.imgur.com/FGgXaMu.jpg?1) two fields, rather than the standard 10-ish (where it tests upload/download/psn/etc).

What's even weirder is that half the time it'll say ""failed"" on ""Obtain IP Address"", but if I run it ten seconds later it'll ""succeed"" in both fields. Then when I try to do something like sign in to PSN, it'll tell me ""a network connection could not be established"".

First of all, I bought my PS3 around January 2013. I know theres different types of PS3 models but I hope this information can tell you which one it is (i think its called the Slim Model?)
 
The PS3 connects to the internet via WiFI and is hooked up to my TV by an HDMI cable.
 
Ive never had an issue until Sunday (April 28, 2013) where it seems after I have turned off my PS3, the TV starts to not work. The first example came from my wall TV where when I try to turn it on, it fails and just shuts off. My dads friend did a factory reset to the TV which got it working... UNTIL i played with my PS3 and turned it off. 
 
I thought it was the TV at first but then I moved it my Flatscreen TV (which never had any problems, like my wall TV) and after playing with my PS3, the TV WOULD NOT TURN ON. I tried pressing the power button from the remote and the button on the physical TV but no game. I unplugged my PS3 and the TV and replugged my TV (but not the PS3) and... it worked!
 
My wall TV is still having problems failing to turn on and after this incident, im scared to play my PS3 on my flatscreen because im scared it will break it.
 
Ive never had any problems with this before or any device/console and this is the PS3 causing the problem as my new TV (the flatscreen) never had problems and always worked perfectly until I plugged my PS3 in.
 
Can anyone help me with this? I dont want a $250 black brick on my table. 
 
EDIT: Just more information to help after trying to find a solution (didnt find any yet)
-I bought mine the USA
-Im living in the USA
-My PS3 account is in the same region where I live in (USA)
-It has never been jailbroken or hacked before, I always download updates as soon as they come (to access PlayStation Network)
-Its not a used console, this is straight from Best Buy

Just want to say that THIS IS NOT A TROLL IN ANYWAY! IM BEING SUPER SERIOUS!

My TV problems started happening on Sunday as I said. My main TV (the wall TV) was the first one to hit this problem. I thought it was because my TV was getting old UNTIL i plugged my PS3 into my other TV (Flatscreen) and it started experiencing weird issues (such as not working correctly) so it has to be from my PS3
 
Here, if you want, ill describe my TV problems
 
First TV - Wall TV - Main TV

Never had anything like this before. What happens is that it powers on normally and usually the blank screen comes up (depending on what HDMI its on, usually blank if PS3 is off) but INSTEAD, it turns on but no blank screen, just still dark. After about 20 seconds, it powers off and a red light blinks on and off for a couple seconds
 
Second TV - FlatScreen

Again, never encountered this. I remember shutting my PS3 off and then goin to take a shower (didnt turn off the TV but no one couldve broken it as no one was in the house), i come downstairs and relax until my grandparents come home. They try turning on the TV and it doesnt power up. I get scared and try pushing the ""Power"" button, nothing. Unplugged the TV power and the PS3 from the TV and replugged the TV power (NOT THE PS3!) and... IT WORKED!

So I used my honest age. One day I got a $20 PSN card, but I had to be 18+ in able to register. In fact, I had to be 18+ to redeem any means of currency whats so ever, so I created a new PSN account with a lied age in able to buy Final Fantasy VII.

What's not fair is every other platform, even Xbox, allows users under 18 to redeem any amount of money into their accounts and make purchases themselves (with the exception of M-rated games). 

Having to hold an adults hand in able to buy ANY game or DLC is just ridiculous. But why not use their ID instead?

Imagine how many users lied their age in able to purchase with their PSN account. Some of the winners in the Uncharted 2 competition probably weren't at the minimum age.

It may sound like a rant, and don't get me wrong, I like PlayStation, but it's like having this paranoid parent who doesn't let you handle your own money, so all your purchases are made through that parent.

I'm not angry, this ""25 year-old"" is just a little annoyed because because his peers he met online have really high-pitch voices.

I gladly took it because I've always wanted to play Metal Gear Solid 4, but didn't want to spend $310 for it. Now I own a broken PS3 ad a few of the cords, but I'm not sure where to go to see about Sony fixing it; especially because I'm not even sure if it's still under warranty.

I don't want to just let anyone mess with it, because I'd rather trust Sony than a friend of a friend who ""totally hacked his PS3 at home"", so I googled it to see and someone on a forum mentioned Sony will make any repairs to the system as long as the warranty sticker is intact.

So I was wondering if anyone here could help point me in the right direction? also, knowing where I can purchase cords would be extremely helpful.

I believe I only played this once on a demo disc, but I could be mistaken.

From memory:

1) It was cartoonyish.

2) It was on a beach area.

3) The beach had a lighthouse that you could enter at some point. The lighthouse interior was a level of it's own involving platform gameplay.

4) This may not be accurate, but I THINK that you could talk to people, sort of like a Zelda kind of feel.

5) Finally, I believe the characters (being a more family/kids game) were possibly animal based. Though I made be wrong on that one.

played my little heart out and had a jolly ol time with my battles.

fast forward late 2009 I ended up getting married, moved off post to some not so friendly area of town, well the thing gets stolen. 
With no real care I said fuck it and moved on with my life dealing with the sham of a wife I had.

so fast forward to now, no longer with the life sucking witch and in another state, after leaving the state and the military (house got broken into, pretty much loosing everything of value) with pretty much the clothes on my back and some other technology I have established myself quite well off, so much in fact im able to now start looking at getting a new ps3/ps4. 

I decide to hop on PSN and try to recover my account, however I can no longer remember my email associated. In addition I have no records of my SN for my old PS3.

so here I am stuck feeling like the only option is creating a new account, however my pride and history with my old account is getting the best of me at this point. 

so my question for you all is there any humanly way to recover my account without either source of information? 

1. yes this is legitimately my account

2. I have multiple records and identification

3. I am able to correctly answer all security related questions (obviously excluding the email &amp; S/N)

Reddit you are my only hope. If you can legitimately help me or point me in the right direction of backtracking my old email address or getting me access into the account I may be able to get you a pizza or some gold

Now I'm a bit further in the game and have access to the open world area, and have found that the Move either performs atrociously or not at all in this environment, yet it still works perfectly on story levels.

For instance, when fighting enemies, you need to perform a little gesture to finish them off if they're weak, and this always works flawlessly.  However, none of the side jobs in the overworld, which consist of the exact same gestures, register properly at all.

Examples:
Mowing the lawn.  Game says to tilt controller in the direction you want to turn, but no matter what I do, Travis spins wildly in a tight circle.
Semaphore flags.  Simple gesture commands that are exactly like the ones used to kill enemies, but it doesn't register at all.  I can flail my arms wildly and Travis just stands there motionless.

I end up missing important information like instructions.
It effects the little cutscenes as well. Example: Zombie Basketball, I had a very hard time hearing what the announcer said. 

I've gone through all the sound settings in the game and on my tv but nothing works. Sometimes there is no sound at all when they are talking. (I have subtitles on)
I have contacted PlayStation for help and their instructions did nothing. They kept thinking it was my systems fault but it plays all my other games just fine. I talked to people at Future Shop and they said it's a problem with the game. I went to return the game but was forced to get another copy, and guess what, same sound problems! that's 2 different copies! 

After doing some research I have found people who have a PS3 copy are having sound problems as well, problems such as: people talking over others, echoing, repeating, bad music quality, low voice volumes to know voice at all. Were as the Xbox seems to have no to little problems with the game.

If anyone else is having sound issues, please come forward and let WB and Grasshopper Manufacture know that they have to develop a patch for the game.  I'm sure this is something that can be fixed, but they need to be convinced that it is worth the effort.

If there is any fix that you have found to get around these issues, let me know!  I'm willing to try anything.

Honestly, this shoddy PlayStation port practice by Grasshopper is starting to drive me mad.  The PS2 port of Killer 7 was laggy, glitchy, and took forever to load between rooms.  No More Heroes was smoother on the Wii than on the PS3, and that's just crazy.  I love Grasshopper's games, but this is extremely frustrating!

End Result - When I set the Ps3 to component, I get a black screen, my monitor gives me a message saying ""Optimal resolution not set, 1920 x 1080"" and neither Media Express or Xsplit shows me a picture. I haven't tried all combinations of setings - thought I would post here first.

Second situation - I've tried it with the Wii. Only using the composite cables this time. (Red white yellow) and it has worked - it doesn't show up on my PC monitor though (HDMI out failing again (??) - but it shows up in media express. (I don't get sound, the levels show sound, but I hear nothing coming out of my speakers) When I add the camera in Xsplit, blank screen.

Could anyone help me troubleshoot this?

Some updates, because this is a cross post -  I fiddled with the settings some more, the BMIS can't take in 1080p at 60fps, so I'm stuck with 720p.

I don't play a lot of multiplayer games and when I do, I usually play them on PC (even though I primarily play everything else on PS3 and 360). I really want to play the GTA V multiplayer and I'll be buying it on PS3.
Because I don't really do any multiplayer gaming on PS3, I don't have a headset for it. I'm looking for the cheapest possible option.

I found this [Youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_qWvjcJFMk) of a guy explaining how it's possible to use a USB adapter to use a standard mic and headphones. [I found one on ebay](http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/USB-Headset-Headphone-Mic-Sound-Adapter-For-PS3-Slim-OZ-/110635219726?pt=AU_MobilePhoneAccessories&amp;hash=item19c25f7b0e&amp;_uhb=1) However I was a little concerned about how cheap it is ($4.27 or best offer) and how generic it looks. Has anybody used one of these before? Are they dodgy? Would the sound quality be okay? I'll be using a Zalman ZM-MIC-1 microphone and Audio Technica ATH-M50 headphones (that is if I have to use headphones at all, I'd kind of prefer to output the sound of other players voices to my external speakers as I want to maintain surround sound, would this be possible or would I have to use headphones to hear other people talk?. I also found a [cheap Offical Singstar adapter](http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Official-Sony-Singstar-USB-Adaptor-Converter-for-microphones-PS2-PS3-NEW-/181180989308?pt=UK_VideoGames_VideoGameAccessories_VideoGameAccessories_JN&amp;hash=item2a2f3a7f7c&amp;_uhb=1), would this work? If so, would I get better sound quality out of it given that it's an official Sony product?

Is this my best option?",,False,self,t5_2qh6b,False,,,True,t3_1knvtm,http://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1knvtm/are_ps3_microphoneheadset_usb_adapters_any_good/,

After I downloaded and installed the 4.46 update (setting it to turn off once finished) but when it was done, instead of turning off, the screen went black and the console froze. Trying to turn it off just gave me the beeps, and since it was frozen, I had to pull the plug. When I turned it back on again, obviously it started the corrupted media reboot. Again, during this process the console shuts down once finished. But like before, it just froze. So I did the same thing again (insanity, I know) without success. This time though, I decided to try the ""emergency reboot"" feature or whatever it's called. (Holding the power button, wait for 3 beeps and repeat) Which brings you to the safe mode menu. I selected option 3 (restore file system). The screen said ""Preparing, please wait"" with a spinning loading symbol in the top right corner. I left to watch a football game, and got back, 2 hours later, to find it was stuck in the same process. It's been 3 hours now and it's still ""preparing"". It's not frozen, because the spinning ""loading"" icon is still spinning. 

Does anyone know what happened or how to fix it? Any help is appreciated. 

If it matters, I've never replaced my hard drive and I never installed the 4.45 update, in fear of bricking my console... ironic.

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this post, but I'm having two issues with my PS3 (60GB CECHA01). The first is, I think, more related to my room's ventilation than anything else. When I first turn the PS3 on, the fans are at ""level 1,"" or nearly silent. They jump up to ""level 2"" after about five minutes idling on the XMB, and then to ""level 3"" when I load a game. After about half an hour of gameplay, they ramp up to ""level 4,"" and very occasionally to ""level 5,"" which is about as loud as a standard hair dryer. Is this normal fan behavior for a PS3, or should I look into clearing it out? My room is slightly warm - I'm getting a window unit soon - but it doesn't seem to trouble my desktop PC. Then again, I have a Silverstone Raven case, which has great airflow.

The second problem is more annoying. I've started getting random bursts of static, both visual and audible, from my PS3. It only lasts about a second, but it is frequent enough to disrupt the experience completely. It happens whether or not I'm going anything. I've tried plugging the PS3 directly into my monitor, instead of using my HDMI switch, but the problem persists. The strange thing is that I have been using this switch since I bought the system, and the problem has only cropped up within the last week or so.

I'd appreciate any advice on either of these issues.

My PS2 will read the first disc just fine, but with the second disc it only gets to the PS1 bios screen then freezes, and with the third disc it doesn't even get that far, just a black screen after the PS2 bios. I thought it might be because my discs were dirty, and the third disc had a really nasty concentric scratch, so I took them to a local game store to have them resurfaced. It's a really nice machine, cost them a few thousand bucks, so it's not like one of those stupid Disc Doctors. Anyway, my discs are spotless, so I'm pretty sure it's not them.

For further information, all three FFVII discs will read in the PS2, and with the FFIX discs I can see them listed when I go into the System Browser, and it says Playstation Game. So I really have no clue what's going on here. Most of the stuff I find online is for if the PS2 isn't reading PS1 discs at all, which isn't my issue. Stuff like adjusting the potentiometer that controls laser voltage, but it's still reading some discs so I'm pretty sure the voltage is fine.

My next step is to take my discs back to the game store to see if they'll read on any of their machines.

I then shut it down anyways without saving again. A couple of hours later, I started up the ps3 again to see if it was working better. It took a very long time for it to load to the play-station menu, and even longer once I was in the game.

After I was in the game I tried to load up the save game because it sowed a save file for the time that I had tried to save but it would not load (no surprise) and I then instead tried to load a previous save. It successfully loaded but the game would not progress past the in game loading screen. So I once agian shut the machine down and then tried to load it again. However, this time it would not even load to the play-station menu. I then did some troubleshooting online and decided to run through the options in the safe mode menu.

At this time I have run through all of the options with the last one being a system restore to factory settings. The machine will still not load and when I start it up all that happens is it will show the background waves but the menu options will not show up. I am then forced to hardboot it to turn it off.

On one hand, I'd like to get it on the PS4 since it'll be the newest generation so the games will most likely, for lack of a better word, stay fresher and not as outdated years from now. The PS4 is also a lot more powerful than the PS3 so in theory, the game should perform better.

But on the other hand, I feel like maybe the PS4 version of the game won't be as optimized to perform as well as it will on the PS3. I mean, developers have had a very long time to work out how to tell the PS3 what to do and how to do it. If you look at the first generation of Xbox/PS3 games, the don't even compare to what developers are able to coax out of the systems nowadays. So I feel like the game might not perform as well on the PS4 graphics and performance wise. At least not the launch-games if the developers started working on the games for the current gen before they knew about the new genand received a dev kit. In this scenario, the new gen would be receiving the port and the current gen would have the original, optimized version.

There's my argument and I'm not quite sure what to do. Anyone have any thoughts on the matter?",,False,self,t5_2qh6b,False,,,True,t3_1jfoft,http://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1jfoft/which_platform_should_i_buy_a_game_for_if_its/,

I began to doubt. It looked bad. Really bad. Then they talked all about the Kinext and it's features. I felt... disappointed. I was left with a seemingly modern VCR. :( But I kept lying to myself trying to find its qualities. Then, I saw the PS4. Anyone here believe in love at first sight? It looked sleek, jagged, all around just better. But I didn't want to believe it. Then, E3 came around. After hearing about all the amazing exclusives, I. Was. Hooked!

Edit: And I'm sure people will mention there are 3rd party controllers - but let's be honest, these suck. However, it is further proof of how easy it would be to do.

I have a first generation PS3, and up until about two months ago, it's made me a very happy man. Only, now I have a problem. Whenever I try to download a new game, an error message pops up that says something to the affect (or effect, whatever) of ""There is not enough space on the system storage"". I consulted my brother, and he told me to buy a new external hard drive, so I bought a 500GB Digistor PS3 hard drive. I moved all the saves over to it, but the same error still came up. I deleted a few of the game data utility slots, and that solved it, for now. However, I was wondering if one of you could tell me how to fix this, short of deleting one of my games every time I buy a new one. Much obliged!
