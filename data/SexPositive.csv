They kids had numeracy in the morning, then literacy, then art, music or PSHE (personal social health education) after lunch. 
They were working on gender roles. The teacher was basically getting the children to write lists of names in a Venn Diagram by gender. She then got the children to challenge each name. Even names like Mark or Jane. 

She then got them to do the same with jobs that 'men' did and jobs that 'women' did. The children had already caught on and told the teacher she was being silly, and that boys and girls can do the same jobs (apart from one slip up- funnily enough they said only women could be chefs)  and at the end she told them that you can never assume someone is a girl or a boy because of their name or their job.

""There seems to be a huge misunderstanding concerning what consent is when it comes to sex. And yet -- when discussed with teenagers -- the idea that ""unless someone says 'yes', it's not consent,"" is easily accepted. It's not a hard conversation: Unless you get a ""Yes,"" assume ""No."" Uncomfortable, maybe, but difficult? Hardly.

Please make the line between a clear ""Yes"" and anything else -- whether it be someone drunk, asleep, or otherwise unable to say ""No"" -- something schools must cover in health or sex ed.

If STI information and methods of contraception are standard fare, consent should be, too.""

The site owner Nik Richie (confirmed douchebag) referred to them as ""roast beef"" and encouraged the idea of getting a labiaplasty. While a number of guys (and girls!) showed their support and acceptance of larger labia, a lot of them continued with the body bashing.  Things like this really get to me. There's nothing at all wrong with preferring smaller labia, but to call larger ones names and say they are disgusting is rude, immature, and unnecessary. Women and girls today are already under an overwhelming amount of pressure to fit in and look good, why are we adding the pressure to have something as minute as LABIA look ""prettier"" too? The surgery is great for health reasons or trouble with sex because of them, but I sincerely hope that no one read that post or any other hate for larger labia and became ashamed of the way they looked enough to also consider this. It is a real SURGERY that is expensive and can be dangerous and come with a number of complications and even the loss of feeling. What's the point of having smaller labia to be sexually attractive to someone if you can't even FEEL sex anymore? Really though, if someone is already seeing your labia chances are they want you bad enough to not give a fuck what they look like. And for all the people who were acting like there is nothing in the world more disgusting than some large lips: fuck you. If you can't at least have *respect* for **all** pussies, don't deserve **any** pussy. So ladies everywhere with larger labia, please don't feel bad about yourselves.

I've been in a relationship with my girl (let's call her B.) for three years, and we're engaged with a wedding date next year. We both love sex, generally and with each other, but we like some variety, adventure, and the occasional validation from others.

We've talked about being casually open throughout our relationship. However, aside from a couple of spontaneous group events (having sex with each other, but in the presence of others doing the same) and some casual flirting, we haven't been able to make it work. Several things got in the way: our shared focus on a particular type of openness (no poly/emotional relationships and no pickups, only FWBs); social constraints due to heavy work schedules; communication issues; and some really unfortunate timing during a few opportunities.

With all of those complications, it's been impossible to make it click. We were also feeling like time is running out: I'm in my upper 30's, and we're planning to start having kids late next year. So we were both starting to wonder if it was ever going to happen, or whether we were only OK with openness in theory...

Last weekend, everything changed.

For several years, I've had a casual and mutually flirty friendship with another lady (let's call her C.) A month ago, C. sent us a message that she was coming to town and asked to stay with us (B. and I have friends across the country, and we often host visitors). We agreed, and since B. had to work most of last weekend, C. and I made friendly plans to hang out. B. and I knew that C. is pretty sexually open - one of our group sessions was with C. and her guy at the time - so it seemed possible, but we had no expectations.

As soon as C. arrived, it was clear that she and I had chemistry. It started manifesting that evening: B. very graciously tucked into bed early Friday (legitimately, as she had to work early), and C. and I spent most of the night making out on the couch. We took it really slow - clothing didn't even start coming off until after an hour of heavy making-out - but it was intense. C. and I spent most of Saturday and a little while on Sunday in full-on hookup mode (while still managing to keep our evening social plans with B. and others).

B. and I sent C. back home on Monday. That evening, B. and I changed the sheets, showered together (she washed me, almost ritualistically - very powerful experience), and had sex. It wasn't intense or prolonged (truth be told, I was a little spent), but it was the emotional reconnection and closure that we both really needed.

Throughout the weekend, B. was AMAZINGLY supportive. She repeatedly expressed her complete comfort with the situation. She made room and privacy for me and C. She even discreetly handed me a box of condoms before C. arrived, just in case.

I was deeply moved and grateful for her openness - and I really wanted to return the favor. ""Some day,"" she said, noting that her flirty friendships with other guys had oddly ebbed of late.

But by sheer luck, one of the guy friends whom B. has most wanted to hook up with is visiting town tonight. His main plan is a friendly group meetup... but the possibilities seem VERY ripe, and for once, the timing is perfect.

""Would you be OK with me seeing him tonight?""

""YES! Have fun! Be safe!""

We share a car, and I had some afternoon plans out of the house. So this evening, I cleaned up the car for her, filled it up with gas, and came home to turn it over to her.

""I have no idea what to expect tonight. Things might work out, or might not. I don't even know if he's still interested...""

""Whatever happens is fine, but I REALLY want them to work out for you. If you come home tonight, great - we can have a Game of Thrones and sex night - but I won't expect to see you until, let's say, 10am tomorrow.""

I sent B. out the door 30 minutes ago, and I'm feeling... really, really excited for her - and where this is taking us: it feels like we've finally broken the ice on this aspect of our relationship.

Some observations:

1) Timing. Motherfucking TIMING. Like normal relationships, TRYING to make it happen seems to be a recipe for failure - worse, the added pressure actually reduces the odds of having it work out.

2) My hookup with C. kind of flipped a switch in my mind about the context.

While both B. and I want occasional sex with others as a supplement to our relationship, I think that I was harboring some deep-seated insecurity that she might actually fall for another guy. I wondered if I would feel envious or spurned, and I was leery of becoming hypersensitive and mistrusting. I know unquestioningly that she loves me, and I trust her completely - it's just a product of lingering social anxiety that I've been working on my entire life.

Sex with C. put it in perspective. My emotions and mental calculus finally hit home:

This isn't a big deal.

To be clear, I really like C., and the sex was wonderful, and I'm hoping that we can meet up again - but basically, it was just some friendly, fun screwing with a friend. It didn't change my relationship with B. at all. Sex with C. finally gave me a mental framework for totally accepting and supporting B.'s own sexual adventures.

B. has been saying that all along, and I've completely agreed conceptually; but I don't think I was able to let go of my insecurity until I experienced it myself.

3) Sex with C. not only satisfied my cravings - it also strengthened my relationship with B. First, again, her unqualified support was achingly beautiful. And second, the variety of sex with C. reminded me and made me appreciate what I've loved about sex with B. (not as a competition, but simply as recognition of the contrast).

4) Maybe the most important thing that reinforces the OK-ness of this all is: developing a relationship safety net. Throwing a little more time into my relationship with B., before and definitely after my time with C., seems like a great way to validate that our relationship is unchanged. And we have date night planned for Friday - it'll be great to reconnect.

So that's my story. Hope it's helped some of you and entertained others. I'll be eager to read your feedback, too.

1366067739.0,52,self.SexPositive,1cf8hc,I've come to the conclusion that the incest taboo reinforces rape culture. (possible trigger),oidaoyduh,84,32,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/1cf8hc/ive_come_to_the_conclusion_that_the_incest_taboo/,"Consider the following scenarios:

Scenario 1: Long-lost twins meet for the first time and are attracted to each other. They engage in totally kinky, totally consensual sex.

Scenario 2: A parent rapes their 16-yr old child.

It really bothers me that whenever something like scenario 2 happens, all the headlines say ""incest"" and not ""rape."" I understand that downplaying rape (and suppressing/appropriating the word) is an all-pervasive phenomenon that affects basically every rape case the media get their hands on. But I'm arguing something more specific (I think) is going on in the case of this word ""incest.""

I got a bunch of downvotes in a TrueAskReddit thread about incest, because when I use the word, I'm always referring to scenario 1, because it seems obvious to me that we can be comfortable with scenario 1 without having to get into those creepy reddit discussions about grooming and how difficult it is to determine consent, etc, because where there definitely IS consent, there is definitely no problem.

But when most people hear the word ""incest,"" they automatically think about scenario 2. And yet they don't think about it as rape. It's complicated. It's ambiguous. It's ""impossible to know what's grooming and what's just natural attraction."" 

So on one hand, you have people condemning totally consensual sex merely on the basis of taboo, and on the other, you see these abstract discussions about pederasty like we're suddenly in Ancient Greece and that's somehow not a bad thing.

I'm making this post, because I searched ""incest"" in r/SexPositive and came up with nothing. It seems logical to me that sex positive feminists should recognize at least the conceptual possibility of consensual ""incest"" and validate it as kinky and thus good, because based on consent, whereas the more common/mainstream use of the word should be militantly condemned as a manifestation of rape culture, using ambiguous language about something which should not be ambiguous in the least, namely rape.

I guess a possible alternative would be to decide that ""incest"" refers only to cases of coercion, whereas scenario 1 above should not be referred to as incest. Either way, I think it is toxic to have a word which can both mean ""consensual kinky sex"" AND ""rape.""

Thoughts? 

Sorry if this is nothing new. It's new for me. thought I would share and see what y'all think. sorry this is so long. re-reading it seems I just regurgitated what little I know about basic sex-positive fundamentals, but I think it's important that scenario 1 above be included as just any other kink.",,False,,t5_2r7c9,False,,,True,t3_1cf8hc,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/1cf8hc/ive_come_to_the_conclusion_that_the_incest_taboo/,

1347465675.0,51,self.SexPositive,zrrii,It's Global Female Condom Day.  Let me tell you why they are awesome. [graphic adult language],potator,64,13,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/zrrii/its_global_female_condom_day_let_me_tell_you_why/,"For the interested, [here](http://www.nationalfccoalition.org/) is the Global Female Condom Day site.

Internal condoms have been my go-to for STI and pregnancy protection during penetration for almost three years.  Here is list of tips, advantages, and features of internal condoms that I brainstormed with others:

* Internal condoms are non-latex and cannot cause allergic reactions.
* You can put them in long before you have sex. No need to stop sexytime to make the condom happen. You can grind all up and down your partner before you ever fuck, and voila! There is protection.
* You can get your partner to put it in for you. Unlike putting a condom on with your mouth, putting an internal condom in with a finger is something that pretty much anyone can do. And thus the safer sex is naturally integrated with foreplay.
* It is easy to alternate between fucking and oral sex. Internal condoms don't have a taste the same way latex condoms do, so it's just going to taste like whatever lube you used, not latex. This also means that it's a cinch for the penetrator to pull out and have an orgasm in your mouth, on your chest, or whatever you've negotiated.
* They're quite handy for multi-person sex. If two female-bodied people want to fuck one male-bodied person, using two internal condoms lets them ""set and forget"" their protection up front. And they turn out to be pretty fucking fantastic for coitalingus - where a pair of people are having sex and a third is going down on them simultaneously.
* Internal condoms can be used for a safer DVP (double vaginal penetration).  Note that there is no way to perform a ""completely safe"" DVP with three warm bodies.  At least two partners must be fluid-bonded or not use protection together.
* Unless you mess them up (which admittedly a lot of people do), they're better disease protection than traditional condoms, because they're better at protecting against skin-transmitted STIs like herpes.
* Another fun thing about internal condoms is spontaneity. If you have a partner restrained and blindfolded, they'll have no idea when you're going to ""hop on,"" because you wont have to put a traditional condom on them.
* Use lots of lubricant. If it feels like having sex with a garbage bag, you're not using enough lube.
* There are actually two kinds of internal condoms, the FC1 and the FC2. The FC1 is made from polyurethane and the FC2 is made out of synthetic nitrile. The FC1 makes far more crinkling noise than the FC2. Because they didn't stop making the FC1 until 2009, many are still in circulation that haven't expired yet. From a completely unscientific sampling of internal condoms acquired from clinics, I'd guess about 1 in 20 is a FC1.
* You can use the internal condom rectally, provided you remove the internal ring. No, they are not approved for rectal use by the FDA or the CDC, but then again, neither are traditional condoms. An added bonus is that the external part of the condom will protect you from potential poo.
* Internal condoms are a great option for people with external frits (read ""front bits""). If you're smaller, slippage is no longer as big a concern. If you're bigger, you don't have to worry about the ""condom tourniquet effect"" anymore. If you have difficulty staying hard, it streamlines sex when you don't have to put on a new condom each time you get an erection.
* Internal condoms are not damaged by the same temperatures as latex condoms. If you were camping in the heat of summer, you'd want to keep your latex condoms in the cooler (away from the ice, but definitely out of the sun). Nitrile can just be kept in the shade and it will be perfectly happy.
* Most people have never used an internal condom. It can be a difficult conversation to bring up. ""Hey, do you mind cramming one of these inside yourself?"" or ""Hey there's this weird alien tractor beam thing hanging out of my crotch.""  If you'd like your partner to try one, particularly a new partner, try bringing it up before you get to a sexual scenario so they'll know to expect it. Bonus points if you're cool about it and can help them put it in (assuming you are doing the penetrating).

I hope this convinces you sexy people to try sexy sex with a sexy internal condom.  I receive no karma for this post, so what can it hurt to upvote?

1375198802.0,53,self.SexPositive,1jcqsd,Sent my girl off for a night with another guy - terrifically positive experience! (update) (xpost from /r/nonmonogamy),sexplus-anon,65,12,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/1jcqsd/sent_my_girl_off_for_a_night_with_another_guy/,"An update to the [Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/1j09dc/just_sent_my_girl_off_to_spend_the_night_with/)...

As my girl, B., was preparing to leave our apartment to spend the night with a guy (let's call him D.), I was riding an emotional high - this was exciting, and I really enjoyed supporting her adventures. But I wasn't sure how my emotions would respond.

I made one request of her: Please be back by 10am. (We had a 1pm obligation that required our mutual attendance, and I knew that I wanted just a bit of time with her before then.) This wasn't a demand or requirement - it wasn't about control - it was simply a request: the certainty of seeing her again the next morning would calm my nerves through the night.

She agreed, and I kissed her goodbye for the night.

My evening apart from B. started out fine - ordered some pizza, dug into a free-time project. But after a while, irrational doubts started creeping in and tinkering with my emotions: What if B. likes D. better? What if she really enjoys sex with him more than me? What if she doesn't come home tomorrow? What if, what if, what if...? Of course, it was all nonsense - my relationship with B. had been rock-solid, and our sex life was consistently great - and I knew better than to give them any credence, but the buzzing in the back of my mind was becoming a nuisance.

Two things helped.

First, I reminisced about my weekend with C., and I found that it had a calming effect: it brought back perspective. It reminded me that while B. and I are committed for life, I don't depend solely on her for my needs. The weekend with C. was fulfilling for many reasons: developing a closer relationship with a friend; the basic pleasure of physical contact; a reminder that I am desired and desirable; the feeling of personal growth into a new area; and of course, some great, fun sex. In addition to simply enjoying the memories, it reminded me of what the weekend had been about - and that that's the experience that B. was having with D. that evening.

Second, I called a friend and just talked for a long while. Specifically, I called C., because I really wanted to talk to her and I knew she'd be up late. Our discussion neither avoided nor focused on B.'s evening with D.; we just talked about everything - life, work, hobbies, the past weekend, future plans to see each other. Feeling the strength of a social connection further steadied my nerves, and when my thoughts returned to B. after our call, the emotional tinge was attenuated; it just felt, again, like *this wasn't a big deal.*

Our bed felt huge and empty that evening, and when I awoke at 8 am, my nerves were buzzing again - right up until 9:30, when B. texted me:

*I'm coming home.*

A sense of calm and happiness washed over me, and I knew that everything was going to be fine.

Bless her heart, B. walked in at 10 on the dot. Then she made a beeline for the shower... mostly to rinse away the clinging odor of the  cigar bar where their evening had started.

I joined her, and as we washed each other, we talked excitedly about her night. It had been fun! I was surprised at how natural it felt to talk with B. about her night with D. without a shred of negative emotions. We both love sex, and we love *talking* about sex, so this was just a sharing of experiences. That these experiences were brand-new, and had arisen during our relationship, felt... completely irrelevant, actually.

(Sadly, the rest of B.'s weekend kind of fizzled. She wanted to find time with D. for a second evening or a brief hookup, but his plans during his visit had to take priority. Also, D. admitted that he's having a bit of difficulty with the situation: he would really like to *date* B., but that's not what she wants, and he wants to be careful with his emotions. Props to him for recognizing the difficulty; B. is giving him space to work through it.)

Going forward: B. and I are talking a lot about how where things might go. Our circumstances with C. and D. are different, and it leads to some interesting options. C. and I have been talking a lot and developing a deepening friendship, and we'd really like to see each other on occasion - maybe a weekend visit every few months - but it's always going to be long-distance. On the other hand, B. and D.'s relationship is more casual - closer to a booty-call relationship - but D. may be moving to our town for work, so it could be more common. Because of the differences, B. and I are talking constantly about these relationships to ensure that we're still on the same page, and still OK with each others' actions.

I'm sensitive to all of the ways that we could fuck up this arrangement: neglecting each others' needs and our relationship; letting our other relationships become serious; a relative imbalance in our side activities; etc. Seems like good communication can mitigate those problems.

**tl;dnr**: Everything that I'd *hoped* would happen from the first post has come to pass. B. and I each had a great experience that satisfied some deep-seated needs and desires; our relationship feels stronger and more interesting; and we have some new friends and fun thoughts of future adventures. Pleased to report that it's possible to have your cake and eat it, too.

Heck, some MEN can even induce lactation! 

No, it's not my thing and it may not be yours but it is some people's thing. They aren't hurting anyone nor are they mentally ill (that comes along in the comments)-- what's the big deal? But, of course, CafeMom chimes in with the ""gross,"" ""try not to laugh"" and ""this makes me throw up in my mouth"" commentary. REALLY!? That's not at all necessary. 

Articles condoning attitudes like this really piss me off.

Every once an a while I see a half way decent article on CafeMom (okay, it was once! LOL!) and I refused to repost it. I will not be responsible for anyone thinking the bulk of their articles are of any substance. They aren't much better than Cosmo IMO.

I have considered myself a feminist for about two years now but absolutely hate when feminists put other women down for doing what they want with their own bodies. Yes I don't think women should be seen as simply sexual objects but I don't think things such as modeling or even porn really cause any gender inequality in themselves. There is some other issues around them but there is no reason to hate on the industries as a whole. 

I also really dislike when people say that you can't be a feminist into BDSM as this is making so many untrue assumptions such as all feminist are women when in reality anyone who is willing to fight for gender equality could be considered a feminist. It is also assuming that if a woman is taking part in BDSM she is always being the submissive one, which is so untrue it makes me laugh. The final assumption they make is the one that actually psychically angers me, and this is the assumption that if a woman is submissive in a relationship she is doing something very unfeminist. If your submissive in a relationship it isn't because you feel the other person (who could be a women might I add) is better than you. No it's because you trust them. Having trust in others is not unfeminist by any means. 

Sorry I ranted a bit there I just wanted to explain my views on these issues a bit.

I've never saw myself as a terrible person, and I never thought I could commit such a crime, but well I guess I did.
About a couple of years ago, I was at this get together and we were drinking and it turned out to be this girls birthday. She went around for birthday kisses, and well, it kind of got out of hand. Now I know sex doesn't always come from a kiss, but this was a special kiss...
Anyway, I was surrounded by 2 girls and 2 guys and this girl. The 2 girls cheered me on to keep going, and before I knew it she was on the ground. I didn't have any intention of getting in her pants, and I don't even recall how she got naked. It wasn't me. I felt like she was being attacked, of course now I realize it was me. There was a dildo in there, never penetrated her, but just kind of teased her. I don't even know how those got there. The others left the room, and I stopped and asked if she wanted to continue. She said no, so I helped her up and put a blanket around as she sat down on the couch and passed out. The next morning I got up and left, not really thinking anything happened.

Well she comes up to me a year later telling me of how she felt of the situation. I thought it was mutual till she told me that she felt violated. When I heard that I couldn't believe my ears. I didn't know how to react, and we talked for a long while. We went our ways. I soon went to the local liquor store and picked up a 32 and started slamming it as soon as I got out of the store. I didn't give a fuck about cops or anything, I was in no condition to think. I cried a bit and fell into depression, I couldn't believe what the fuck I did. At first I wanted to tell all my friends, just to be open about the situation (protected her name), but eventually I grew quite as the shame and hatred for what myself grew more and more. I try so hard to be kind and play safe and be cautious, but one fucking night I don't even know.....

She has contacted me a few times, she's still fucking pissed at me, she'll always see me as her rapist. I still want to kill myself over the whole matter every now and then, but they say that won't do anything. She says she's getting over the trauma which is great to hear, but I know that I have directly made an enemy in the world now.

Anyway I needed to share the story, for everyone's sake, though this isn't really a forum that reaches the masses, and only those who are interested in talking about the current way sex is dealt in society are on this subreddit. I never saw her as a lesser or greater individual before and after the event. I do see myself beneath her though (and now she has emails so that's digital proof of something) and all I want to do is make her feel better, and live beyond it. She said she wasn't going to let that part of her life define her and that that part of my life define me. I'm just so full of shame-I feel shitty, I wanna die.",,False,,t5_2r7c9,False,,,True,t3_1491vs,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/1491vs/i_learned_that_i_raped_someone/,

I believe AMAs are a fascinating ethnographical tool that honours the OPs own voice and elucidates surprising answers since it is not filtered through any third party. When compiling this list I was aiming for a diversity of experiences and OPs that could provide educational answers; shock value and popularity were not my criteria.

For me, these links are a voyage into the wonderful world of sexual diversity. I can get to know persons on a human level that I wouldn't get to otherwise.  I hope you enjoy and post your favourite responses in the comments below.

All of a sudden, my mum says ""well it is illegal, maybe he shouldn't be talking about it!"". We all just stopped and looked at her, totally shocked, and stated the obvious - that porn is in no way illegal, at all, ever. So after about an hour discussing it... the whole time we are just getting more and more outraged at the ideas that she's throwing at us. Basically, she believes that porn leads to people becoming pedophiles, I assume in the same way that some people believe that watching violent films makes you go off on killing sprees... totally ridiculous!!! In the end, we gave up out of sheer frustration and disbelief. 

Sorry, just had to post to have a bit of a rant! If anyone has any advice though, on how we can encourage her to be a bit more open minded, and less judgmental. My brother and I suggested she watch some (like the easy stuff... X-Art or something) but she's adamant she'd never do it. It just seems so strange, that I (female) and my older brother have managed to come out so normal and sex positive.

[Here is the thread in question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/119fjl/fellow_ladies_do_you_mind_lots_of_body_hair_on_an/)

Every bit of marketing that I've seen since I was a kid has shown me men with hairless bodies, especially when their sexiness or relationship potential is in question.

I've made many google searches only to find hairless men:

* male models - shirtless surprisingly often, and always hairless
* condom ads - rarely including pictures of shirtless men, but when they do, hairless
* beer ads - same as condoms
* razor ads - I was thinking of leaving these out, since this could be the point of the razors, but no commercial seems to acknowledge the existence of chest hair
* fire fighter calendars - stereotypical male soft porn, figured it would be a good gauge
* romance novel covers - I was expecting every image to be filled with hairy men, but I was surprised that I couldn't find a single one out of hundreds!

I would also like to add that I have been ashamed of my body hair ever since puberty, and I have shaved it off, plucked at it, trimmed it, etc.  I would be waxing it now if it wasn't for the price and pain involved.  I have worn shirts with high collars to hide it, thinking everyone would be repulsed by it.

And now, it turns out that the majority of women (or at least, a sizeable portion) prefers their men to have natural hair.  I'm both astounded in the media's completely incorrect portrayal of men's bodies and women's desires.  Furthermore, I am impressed that these constant images have seemingly little effect on women's desires.

So, how many of you put effort into removal or alteration of your chest hair, and either way, how do you feel about it?",,False,,t5_2r7c9,False,,,True,t3_11arrh,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/11arrh/on_twox_someone_asked_do_you_like_men_with_or/,

What was it like?,cosmotraveler,45,9,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/1is9a9/have_any_of_you_straight_males_experimented_with/,"Backstory/why I'm asking: I'm 25, M, girlfriend and I just broke up about a month ago.  She's bisexual and I consider her to be very sexually open and free.  I do not feel completely free, in some way, sexually, as if I haven't fully been able to let go and experience my sexuality to its fullest extent.  I was really hoping I could explore this and open up in this last relationship.  In some ways I did tap into parts of my sexuality and learn more about myself.  However, in many ways I feel so disappointed and discouraged by this break up and by how I feel about myself in terms of sexual confidence or identity or something like that.  I identify as heterosexual, but am more on the feminine side.  I don't think of myself as very sexual in terms of how I view other people, but I want to be more so.  I want to be able to fully embrace and enjoy sex, but I feel like I need to overcome some blocks in order to do this.

Now, I have a male friend who is homosexual who I've talked to a lot about all the emotional breakup stuff I've been dealing with, and he's been really open and supportive, so I've felt more connected and trusting of him because of this.  He has lightheartedly but sincerely hinted that he would give me oral sex if I ever decided to explore that direction.  I'm considering taking him up on it, just for the sake of exploring this dimension of sexuality that I have otherwise never identified with.  

I've contemplated my sexual orientation in the past, and asked myself whether or not I am sexually attracted to men.  Generally I am not and much prefer the touch of a female body.  The idea of getting oral from a guy would be a huge step outside my comfort zone, but at the same time I am curious and tempted by the novel opportunity.  

Do any straight males have experience with this?  I guess I'm wondering if this will be too much of a mind fuck for me...or maybe it's really no big deal.  What are the challenges of integrating an experience like this?

Thanks for any input!

TL;DR Straight male, considering the psychological effects of letting another man give me oral sex.  Looking for input

Celebrate sex; it's playful, joyous, and innocent.

Celebrate sexual desire (the hungry, wanton kind); lust is a delicious emotion.

Sexual needs are important.

People feel miserable when their sexual needs aren't met.

Give a helping hand (or mouth, or cock, or bum hole, or pussy) to people around you who have a hard time having their sexual needs fulfilled.

There's bad sex out there, and there's abusive sex out there; this is about making the good, wanted sex happen.

Show compassion to people whose sexuality has been injured; we all need time and support to heal our wounds.

It's not everyone who is comfortable with sex; be mindful of that. We hope they get there someday, but people need time to grow.

If your sexuality has been hurt, hang in there. It heals. It gets better. Don't be afraid to ask for help, and take the time to love yourself.

If you're blessed with a healthy, happy sexuality, share! Be a sex volunteer!

Sex workers provide a valuable service by helping people meet their sexual needs; they're an important part of our community. The problem is not their work, but how they're treated. You should respect them and speak up for them.

Forever alone? It's hard, and it hurts. This manifesto is also about you. We promise that there are people out there who will love you, and who will want to do sexy things with you. In the meantime, take good care of yourself.

Look at what makes people attractive, especially people you would not be attracted to on first sight.

Look at people around you, and imagine what they look like when they're filled with sexual joy.

Compliment people on the things that make them hot. How come so many people feel unattractive?

Masturbate! Fantasize! You deserve the pleasure, and it's great for you!

Make porn! Write some, draw some, photograph some, or film some.

What's in your pants matters, but it's vastly overrated. There's fun to be had no matter what the bits are.

Gender matters, but it's also overrated; we're all human beings first. We all laugh, cry, love, and get horny.

It's okay if you are monogamous at the moment, but before you commit to it, be honest – can you only fuck one, and only one, person for the next 50 years of your life?

It's fine to be in love with more than one person at a time! Love is not a finite resource. It's a blessing to have more than one amazing person in your life.

It's okay if you don't feel like having sex right now. Take the space you need, and catch your breath.

If you have a kink, you have something to offer; there are people out there who will love you for it.

It's okay to express your curiosity about your friends' sexuality. No one should shame you for being curious.

It's okay to ask friends if they'd be cool with showing you how they have sex. It's not normal that you've seen strangers in porn fuck more often than you've seen your own friends have sex.

It's okay to have sex with friends! Friend sex can be awesome! Do it right, and it will make you all closer.

Organize a sex party! Like all sex, there's good group sex and there's bad group sex, but great group sex changes people forever!

Condoms give us the freedom to fuck around safely! The condom god must be worshipped and honoured! ;)

Communicate! Communicate! Communicate!

Ask! “Would you like it if we did that?”

Reassure! “It's okay if at any point you change your mind and want to stop or do something else. I'm here for you.”

Check in! “How are you feeling? Are you enjoying yourself?”

Speak out! “I'd love to do this! Do you want to?”

Respect! No means no. Unless there's a safeword. ;)

Between yes and no, there is maybe. Before you say no to someone, pause and think to see if there's something sweet you'd be willing to give them anyway. You will make them happy, and who knows – you might end up having more fun than you thought you'd be having.

If everybody had their sexual needs met, it would not fix all the woes in the world. But aren't you curious about what kind of world this place would become? 

If we're all a bit more open, if we all share a bit more, there will just be more to go around for everyone.

Be the best sexy human being you can be! :)

EDIT: Wow. I'm saddened and disappointed at the amount of vitriol in the comments. This manifesto comes straight from my heart, and it represents a vision of the future that I hope will come to pass for most of us. I posted it in hopes it would inspire other people, and I hope it was inspirational for some here.

To the asexual people I have offended, my apologies. I'm sorry you didn't recognize yourselves in a manifesto... about sex.

To the couple of people who have leveraged the accusation the manifesto is not sex-positive... *shrugs* You can keep your toy. I have no issues with just calling it ""A Sex Manifesto"". I'm convinced however that there are plenty of people on this sub who thought it was sex-positive. In fact, I've met far more people who claimed to be ""sex-positive"" who were in fact rather sex-negative, than the opposite. I'm sick of having to mention two pages of disclaimers and fine print *whenever* I say that sex is good for us, that we should enjoy it as much as we want, and that we should celebrate it. There's enough people who will gladly remind everyone of how dangerous and bad sex can get (and as a sexual abuse survivor, I know a page or five on that). I also believe that everyone here is savvy enough to understand that you don't have to do anything you don't want to do.

I've been a sex-positive ethical slut for about a decade. I've been in a non-monogamous marriage for about 5 years. A few years ago, I met a somewhat repressed guy. We fooled around for a while, and now we're just friends. We always used condoms.

He tells me about a drunken one-night-stand he had with a girl last weekend. Then he tells me they didn't use a condom because she didn't want him to get up to go get one. I told him this was a really, really dumb thing to do. He says it was because my influence. I happen to take pride in being the queen of safe sex, so this really bothered me.

What I said: ""I'm not sure how exactly I influenced you into having unsafe sex, but this is me telling you it's fucking stupid and don't do it again (and certainly don't try to blame me for it).""

What I *wanted* to do was go into a long tirade about how the ""sluts"" like me get blamed for unwanted pregnancy and spread of disease. So I educate myself and am diligent about practicing safe sex, and yet I still get blamed for an unsafe hookup I had fucking nothing to do with? What in the fuck?

Under the circumstances, I think I did a pretty good job reigning in my temper, but I also think I kind of blew up at him for something he meant as a joke (not the unsafe sex part. That actually happened. The part where he said it was my influence.) Am I being overly senstive? Have any of you have your sex-positivity blamed for someone else's bad decision?

Edit: So after reading the comments here (thanks so much) and thinking things over based on what I know about him, I think this is why he did what he did and said what he said. As I've mentioned, he was pretty sexually reserved when I met him. I introduced him to the idea of casual sex, and last weekend he went overboard and made a stupid mistake. Like a rubber band that was pulled back too tight and overshot when it was let go. He was probably feeling defensive about it, but trying to laugh it off to make it seem like less of a big deal. The  comment about it being my influence was said in a joking manner, not an accusatory one. So, I'm not going to hold it against him. I think I made my thoughts on the matter clear when I got a bit sharp with him the other day, so I won't bring it up again (although I will make it a point to mention condoms the next time he talks about hooking up). However, if he tries to blame any future mistakes on my ""influence"", I will be done with him.",,False,,t5_2r7c9,1342186538.0,,,True,t3_wg7a7,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/wg7a7/am_i_overreacting_friend_claims_my_influence/,

If you are still together, it is successful, right? Longevity has long been the most important measure for whether a relationship is considered a success or a failure.

I beg to differ.

My definition of a successful relationship is one in which:
1) The balance of pleasure against pain is overwhelmingly pleasure.
2) Lessons were learned (on either side or both).
3) You did not part ways as enemies, and will always care about the person.
4) You would do it over again, given the chance...even knowing it would end.

People come and go in our lives...I believe we need to allow those comings and goings without looking at them as failures. Learn your lessons, revel in the pleasures, and let it go when it's time.

The deep intimacy of a long relationship is something most people really want. But we have all seen relationships that have endured for too many years in a state of mutual torture.

I'm not saying a long relationship is bad and short ones are good...rather, I'm saying we need to go easy on ourselves when a relationship ends. Would you do it all again?

I know I would.

A couple years ago, my girlfriend and I (M) got a bit tipsy and had an FFM threesome with a friend (F) of ours. It was great fun, everyone had a good time, just oral/fingers/toys, no PIV. We hooked up with this friend a few more times under those circumstances, then circumstances changed with that friend so no more adventures happened there. Figured that it was a fun time and we wouldn't be going down that road again.

Fast forward, and a few weeks ago we shared a hotel room with another couple (F and M) who are friends of ours, and some barely clothed massaging turned into a makeout and mutual masturbation romp cut short when some others ALSO sharing the room returned. This renewed both my girlfriend's and my interest in outside play.

See, my current girlfriend was my first, and I am her first partner that actually gave a shit about her, and despite being VERY committed to each other at almost 7 years together we both have confessed to curiosity of what it's like to ""be with"" other people in the PIV sense of the word, and in our romps thus far she's had very little opportunity to fool around with another man at all (basically limited to a short bit of time in the foursome, mostly I've been the lucky guy since she likes playing with girls). While she likes playing with women she also wants a chance to play with men in general. While I have some trepidation about including another man, I want to think I can get over this and give her the same opportunity I've had (via an MFM, or MFMF/variant) even if I'm not interested in playing with another man, and prefer to focus with another man on my woman or his woman. And like I said, we both are curious about PIV sex with other partners.

Has anyone else here found themselves in a similar situation, that could share their thoughts and experiences? I'm open to any feedback and thoughts you may have for me :)",,False,,t5_2r7c9,False,,,True,t3_1ev2du,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/1ev2du/girlfriend_i_considering_mfm/,

1368304240.0,28,self.SexPositive,1e59r5,A question about gender/sex based double standards in feminism,ThatGamer313,36,8,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/1e59r5/a_question_about_gendersex_based_double_standards/,"I just read an article about slut shaming and women owning their own sexuality, rather than being sexualized by men. A sort of underlying theme was that men approaching women for purely sexual encounters was demeaning to women, but women approaching men for purely sexual encounters was alright. It didn't come right out and SAY that, but it was definitely implied.

To be sure there is still a lot of culturally reinforced inequality, and plenty of men who do subscribe to the idea that a girl who would accept such an advance is a ""slut"" but if a woman can have sex with whoever she wants and not be a slut, why then can't a man have sex with whoever he wants and not be a jerk who is demeaning and sexualizing women? Isn't that just the man also having sex with whoever they want, aren't they just owning their own sexuality by doing the exact same thing?

In a world of perfect equality there has to be some homeostasis, where anyone -regardless of sex- can approach anyone they want for whatever level relationship they are interested in, and have that be nothing more than it is. How can we get to that point when this double standard is in place? I don't think we can, and if we can't, how then do we break down this double standard when the gap between the men who actually are thinking of the women they have casual sex with in this way, and the feminists who believe that that group are the only type of men in existence is so vast, and every voice in the middle gets lost behind a constant chanting of ""sexual women are sluts"" and ""men who want sex from women are pigs""?

EDIT: The article I found through facebook, was also posted here just recently. ~~http://thoughtsonliberty.com/how-slut-shaming-empowers-sexual-abusers~~

This is less of a direct response to that article, and more of a train of thought I had after reading the article.

Is anything wrong with me?

A little backstory: my boyfriend mentioned he had some old videos of his ex. I was curious and he mentioned we could watch them together if I wanted.

I do want but I feel like a bit of freak. For one, it's seems like a pretty out there kink and for another it seems like it might be a major privacy violation for his ex. I don't know her but still, if it was me, I might have a problem with it, I don't know...

**TL;DR** BF has hot sex tape of him and ex. I want to watch it but troubled by ethics and oddness of kink.

**EDIT 1:  I talked to my BF last night and mentioned my concerns about his ex's privacy. He said he hadn't thought much about it because, from what he'd known in their previous relationship, it most likely wouldn't phase her but that I had a good point.**

**He got in touch with her and asked for her if she'd be comfortable if he showed it to me.  She said and I quote: ""Sure, as long as you don't post them to Reddit or something.""  :)**

&gt;Traversing what a sexually healed society would look like, we delve into a dynamic and edgy investigation of guilt; shame and the social norms inhibiting our sexual freedom.

[Second episode](http://vimeo.com/36746906)
&gt;We explore the cultural taboo; child sexuality. Let’s talk about children’s masturbation, parent’s reactions and the guilt and shame coupled with it.

[Third episode](http://vimeo.com/38602955)
&gt;Let’s talk about sex and religion. Patriarchy Society. How the Catholic Church coded and organized sins! And how religion use power to control peoples by controlling their sexuality. Am I going to hell for being gay?

&gt;We can’t talk about what’s outside of the box without taking a closer look at the box itself.

1339986016.0,21,self.SexPositive,v7do8,The Paradox of Sex-Positive Language: How sexuality terms perpetuate the categorization and generalization of sexual identity.,Veritas1982,26,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/v7do8/the_paradox_of_sexpositive_language_how_sexuality/,"Over the last few years as sex positive information has been increasingly available, (some) people are becoming more educated and open minded about sexuality. This has lead to the dissolution of the heretofore ubiquitously accepted cultural myth that nearly every aspect of sexuality and gender identity are strictly binary: straight or gay, male or female, kinky or not kinky.  As people become more sexually educated and open minded, they are re-evaluating their own sexualities and gender identities within this enlightened, non-binary framework. Sexuality and gender identity have been conceptually described by some as more closely resembling a cloud matrix, rather than a two point binary system, or even a sliding scale. Within the cloud, an individual can be any particular 'shape', as a blend of various desires, attractions, and behaviours related to sexuality or gender identity, and no one point within the cloud necessitates the presence of any other point. You may find men more sexually attractive, but you may not enjoy performing fellatio, but really enjoy receiving anal play, but not anal sex, for example. This is an extremely positive step towards true sexual freedom. 

However, in order to be able to discuss all of these things, we, naturally, create terms for them so that we can communicate. So in terms of gender and gender identity, we no longer have only male, female, and transgender. We have cisgender, trans, questioning, sexually cisgender but socially trans, etc. This list of new terms and phrases (or at least terms which are new to common usage) is doubtless in the dozens. 

However, in the very pursuit of sexual freedom, we unknowingly reinforce the chains that we struggle to free ourselves from. By continuing to create new terms to 'describe' our sexualities and gender identities, we commit two crimes, both against ourselves. 

The first, and lesser of the two, is that we continue to allow other people to make generalizations and judgements about our gender identities and sexualities. If you tell someone you are a gay, cisgender male, bottom, who is masochistic but decidedly dom rather than sub, you are actually INCREASING the number of generalizations and assumptions that person is making about your sexuality. For every label their is a set of assumptions that someone can apply (here we are not focused on genuinely sex positive people as the audience, because the struggle for sexual freedom is not against those who are genuinely sex positive and open minded). As you list off the labels you have agreed apply to you, you are listing off a set of assumptions that your are granting someone permission to make about you. You are actually offering them a menu of assumptions and prejudices to apply to you. This is the first crime

The second, and far worse crime we commit against ourselves is that we can in fact fall victim to our own labels, and actually categorize and restrain our own sexualities because of the labels we have decided 'best' describe us, rather than being content to simply be ourselves, with no label. So if you've decided you're a bi female, you may 'force' yourself to participate in sexual acts that you don't genuinely enjoy simply because you feel it's 'what you should do, if that is your sexuality'. For example, let's say you love giving oral sex to another girl, but only enjoy receiving oral sex from men, or some such thing. You may go along with it simply because you think ""I'm bi, there's no reason I shouldn't like this, so I'm going to do it and like it."" instead of genuinely letting yourself explore your desires and sticking to what you really like doing. 

There is this great paradox where we claim that we are seeking sexual freedom, but the INSTANT we have a genuinely sexually free experience (let's say a guy touching another guy's penis for the first time, just to see what it's like), the first thing we want to do is slap a label ON OURSELVES, categorize our sexuality, and determine what we 'should' or even 'could' do next, according to what the label prescribes we do. We stop allowing our desires to guide us freely, because we are so obsessed with picking a category.

Fight the paradox. Refuse to label your sexuality. Just. . . be. Just be yourself, do what you want to do, with whomever you want to do it (safely, of course). It's none of anyone else's business, and it is NOT their right to ask you for a neat and tidy little label that they can slap on your sexuality so that they can keep you organized in their mind. Are you bi? Are you gay? So are you a butch or a femme? So wait, you have short hair, you talk like a guy, you act butch, and now you want to wear a girlie dress to the party? These are all questions that lead into each other, because we allow them to. It's time to cut it off. 

Stop asking yourself if your cis or trans, gay or bi, like ALL anal play, or NO anal play, are femme or butch, or flamboyant or macho or conservative. Just let yourself be free, to be yourself, whatever that looks like. When someone asks something like ""So are you bi?"" Just smile warmly and genuinely, look them in the eyes, and say something like ""I'm just me. Sexuality isn't something that fits into one box or the other. I'm free from the labels, and I don't really care to jump to conclusions about myself, or have anyone else jump to conclusions about me either. I hope one day you get to feel what it's like to be free too.""",,False,,t5_2r7c9,False,,,True,t3_v7do8,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/v7do8/the_paradox_of_sexpositive_language_how_sexuality/,

i’m a Masters student and technically speaking my thesis proposal was due thursday but thirteen days ago (after submitting my proposal over a month prior) i woke up to an email from my advisor saying that if i did not change my thesis, she could no longer advise me.

it was pretty much the worst feeling in the whole world.  i have been laser focused on my topic for three years.  this was topic that made me apply to grad school, the topic that got me into grad school, and the topic that changed my entire life.

i was in third year when i came up with this topic.  i was going to do my final course essay on it, but when i went to speak with the teacher about it she heard me out and promptly stated: “this is not suitable for an undergrad essay.  you’re going to grad school to do this.”
so i did.  i spent a year in violent, deteriorating relationship in order to complete my final year of university.  i had an address but whenever my partner was home, i was homeless.  i would sleep at friend’s houses, in the library, anywhere i could to stay safe and focused.  i busted my ass to get into grad school. 

and then ten days out - flash.  bang.  it was gone.
ethics issues were the problem.  the ethics of online research are not set in stone and i was told (and i quote) “if you had six months to fight with ethics, you could and you would win.  but you only have six months to complete your thesis period.” 

so i’ve had to start a whole new topic.  out of the blue, plucked from the ether.  it has been hell.  i was graciously allowed an extension on my thesis proposal so it is now due next week instead of friday.

so consider this a cry for help.  ***i am looking for any first person writings (be it in an autobiography, an anthology, a play, etc.), published from the year 2000 to present day, from North American cis-gendered white, Black, or Canadian Aboriginal women who have engaged in prostitution or exotic dancing.  i am also looking for any online resources (NOT personal blogs - ethics says noooooo) of the same.***

i am essentially uglycrying for help.  its like trying to fit in doing three years worth of research in just over two weeks and i wasn't even given clear guidelines for my topic until this past thursday.

this weekend is thanksgiving weekend in canada and i am spending it with my head buried in books and continuing the most prolonged nervous breakdown ever.

any help anybody can offer would reaffirm my faith in humanity &lt;3",,False,,t5_2r7c9,False,,,True,t3_113z7p,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/113z7p/total_flailing_academic_panic_please_help_xposted/,

My friend and I are tentatively planning on opening a sex shop in the next few years. It would feature a wide selection of safe, locally-crafted products for a wide variety of sexual preferences. We would have a library and lounge, as well, where we could host classes and other events. We would seek out knowledgeable staff members (worker-owner style, a co-op type of thing) who represent a range of sexual and gender identities. We would not carry any mainstream porn. We have a pretty clear vision, but we would benefit from your input and suggestions. Here are my questions for you:

1.) What are some of your favorite sex shops? (What is it called and where is it?)
*Side note: Major plus if you can recommend places in the Southeastern U.S./Carolinas that we should visit (cities like Athens, Atlanta, Raleigh, Richmond, etc...)

2.) What makes a great sex shop? (Specifics appreciated!)

3.) What features do you think subtract from the experience of shopping for sex accessories? Why?

4.) Is there anything that you've wished for in a sex shop but never seen?

5.) What sex toy/accessory can you not do without?

I was brought up in a non-religious household, where sex was neither discussed frequently nor a taboo, and I was never abused or anything similar, but I do have anxiety issues, which probably contributed to the following. 

When I was about 13 I realised I had strange feelings towards certain women (for the sake of keeping this on-topic, I won't say which, but if you ask I'm willing to tell). Seeing as I had only just discovered sex *itself*, naturally I was very confused. At least, I understood the *concept* - I was supposed to like attractive women (which 13-year old me defined as the few images of pornstars I had inadvertently stumbled accross on the internet) right, so what the hell was this? 

My tiny immature mind refused to accept it, and for the next seven years I worked long and hard to suppress any of those thoughts. Early on I tried to condition myself to be 'normal' through vanilla porn, and when I was too anxious for that to do anything I gave up on porn altogether. I denied myself masturbation for long stretches (and inevitably I would cave, followed by a wave of guilt). I avoided discussing sex, was too nervous to ever seek out a relationship for fear of someone discovering my terrible secret. Though I was too afraid to speak to anyone I knew  I sought help online several times, and then ignored the people telling me to relax. that a fetish was nothing to beat yourself up about (unless you're in to that).

My breakthrough finally happened at the beginning of this year, during one of these internet therapy sessions when someone suggested I listen to the Savage Love podcast. On the very first episode I listened to, there was a caller asking questions about how to realise their their partner's daiper fetish. Not struggling to accept it, but actually *embracing* it. I never realised someone could be so open and accepting - and for good reasons, since I'd tried to cut myself off from sex entirely until I had 'straightened' myself out. I started listening to other peoples stories, first on the podcast then on other places on the internet, eventually to here on reddit.

And once I had finally realised the obvious, that a kink is no big deal a miraculous thing happened - I stopped being so afraid. I could find 'normal' women attractive again, I became more sociable, and much less anxious. My fetish has just become another small part of my life. I'm now courting a lovely girl for the first time, and my life is infinitely happier.

So thank you to communities like reddit! Has anyone else struggled with their kink/fetish/paraphilia?",,False,,t5_2r7c9,False,,,True,t3_kqubi,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/kqubi/struggling_with_and_accepting_your_kinks/,

Update time! After reading over the wonderful advice everyone gave in my last post, the SO (f) and I (m) decided to make a play date with the friends of ours we played with briefly in the hotel a few weeks ago. I'm going to call them Anna and Mike for the purpose of this update. We had them over for homemade dinner and board games. We put a movie and traded some massage, and then at some point in the evening Anna and I headed to the bedroom to play, followed later by my SO and Mike. We kept it relatively low key - fingering and toys, except for the oral that I got from Anna at my SO's encouragement.

All went well! We were fooling around, talking, snuggling, and fooling around again until almost 4 AM when we went for a Denny's run prior to calling it a night. We definitely plan to do so again. My only regret was not going down on Anna, since she and Mike had not been screened recently and while they've each been with very few partners I insisted that we all be up to date on screenings before the point of unprotected oral sex. No one was really interested in dental dams, so there you go.

The other gentleman was in fact larger than I am, but I did not feel any jealousy or competition, which was great - I thought I might feel a little intimidated by having another naked man involved but apparently not. Huzzah for self-confidence! We're planning to have another play date sometime soon'ish, after screenings are done. And in the interim I've bought a new mattress (something I've been needing to do anyways), and it's a king size :D [SO MUCH ROOM FOR ACTIVITIES](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FpBjN7MYSuw/UL0xDilZ9fI/AAAAAAAAAe0/u0EchNYIINM/s320/tumblr_mded1mklTP1qfvgpgo1_500.jpg)

Additionally, I find myself having developed something on a crush on Anna. This is interesting and unexpected. I love my SO to bits, and of course have told her about the crush and she is not intimidated at all. I love my SO and am deeply devoted to her, and she trusts this deeply enough that she's not worried, which is fantastic. Anyone else find themselves in this type of situation (unexpected crush after playing with someone) that could share their thoughts?

Oh, and I've found my libido and desire for my SO has kicked up a few notches too. So that's fun :D",,False,,t5_2r7c9,False,,,True,t3_1g69dy,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/1g69dy/update_girlfriend_i_considering_mfm/,

The short form is this: I'm a large woman, and my SO loves a large lady (and parts of me besides my body of course). He has a full-out belly fetish and he fantasizes about me gaining weight. He's explained this to me slowly through our 3 years together, and it really has helped my self-esteem- he truly thinks I'm beautiful, especially my middle regions ^_^. I don't particularly mind- I'm flattered, really. And he's help me my accept my curves with tons of belly-rubs and soft belly-kisses.

I won't gain weight for him. It's for health reasons and self-esteem and I don't want to buy more clothes and I just feel awful when I gain weight. And he respects my decision, but will always slyly suggest more food (like slowly putting cookies in my grocery cart to see how far he can get them before I shoo him away).

We've found some middle ground with me eating during sex. It started with a brownie during pre-foreplay cuddles, progressing to frosting during foreplay.

My blood-sugar drops heavily during sex, so much so that I once started passing out after my orgasm. The sugar helps me stay active longer, as long as I'm not eating too much at once. I also find it comforting when he feeds me... I'm being taken care of on such a basic level.

The farthest we've gone? Me eating a whole pint of Ben&amp;Jerry's (temperature differences in bed turn me on- ice cubes are amazing) while in cowgirl (condom goes on BEFORE), and getting a good bucking every time I finish a giant spoonful. It usually takes at least 30 minutes, and is actually very exhausting. I think I've been successfully conditioned towards ice cream :P

If it's any consolation, we barely manage this once a month (partial long distance), I usually eat very healthy food.

**TL:DR: My SO likes when I eat during sex because he fantasizes about me gaining belly weight, and I really don't mind. Anyone else find this?**

I hear a lot of people say ""my body is not a fetish"". I just don't think I mind that my SO loves my body- especially the more cuddly parts. It's really helped me accept my weight and take care of my body better.

Any other big girls come across this kind of fetish/kink?",,False,,t5_2r7c9,False,,,True,t3_14n7go,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/14n7go/sweettooth_sex_my_so_20m_gets_off_when_i_20f_eat/,

The sort of certification I'm looking for would include a background check and would have some sort of medical requirements or even drug check requirements. Since the government (in my case) isn't doing anything, could a private organization pull this off?

Pros for Companions: 

* You'll be able to ask for a higher price (certified quality)
* You'll have an organization to go to for security (but not one that controls you / takes your money)
* You'll be sourced with contacts / be part of a community

I drunkenly lost my virginity as a freshman in college and had sex with that same girl once more a week later but since then no sex. I have gotten a handjob since and a few months ago I received my first blowjob which wasn't great. The reason the bj wasn't very good was because I dissociated myself from the situation and lost interest in it, I didn't finish either. 

So, nowadays I find that even masturbating isn't all that pleasurable and I typically feel ashamed of myself afterwards. I obviously still get horny but immediately following the release of that energy I regret it and feel disgust. In social situations I'm very normal and don't have trouble talking to girls but I can't help but feel that should anything advance sexually between me and a girl that I wouldn't be able to perform due to nerves. Before anyone asks, I was not sexually abused  in my youth.

Your Thoughts?",cosmotraveler,24,7,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/1idtgm/male_recently_single_not_one_for_casual_sex_feel/,"Hey SexPositive, if there is a more appropriate subreddit for this discussion, let me know.

I'm male, 25, and recently broke up with my girlfriend.  We had a number of issues including my inability to fully ""let go"" during sex.  I've always had a lot of performance anxiety with sex, which has perpetuated itself and always left me feeling inadequate, especially with this last girlfriend.  She expressed her preferences for ""rough sex"" which, due to my inability to last and being easily discouraged, I was never really able to provide the endurance or enthusiasm.  

This has been a big confidence-killer for me.  Now that I'm single the sexual urges still come from time to time, and I'm not sure how to deal with them.  I don't typically pursue casual sex because I need some degree of emotional attachment and again, don't feel very sexually confident to begin with.  I've also given up porn, though I'm open to other forms of, hm, mental stimulation.  So currently I feel very alone and very horny, but I have this apprehension about masturbating because it feels like a reminder that I am single and sexually inadequate.  I'm almost afraid to do it because in the back of my mind I'm thinking about how my ex could easily go out and get gorilla-fucked by whoever she'd prefer if she wanted to, and it just adds to the insecurity.

I generally have this feeling that I have not fully realized my sexual potential i.e. I consistently feel unsatisfied, like I'm missing out and not getting the full experience of sex, and the girls I've been with have always been very comfortable with themselves sexually, which makes me feel this pressure to be confident and free as well.  

Can anyone provide some insight or resources?

Thanks!

I went to the Alexander McQueen exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art yesterday. There was some clear genius in his work. It made me think and helped some obscure thoughts coalesce. I feel inspired to pay closer attention to my primal side for the sake of my mental health. These are some thoughts.

My childhood upbringing involved labeling the human primal instinct and nature Evil, irreedeemably so. This was a cause of psychological damage to me. I received strict parental guidance by my mother to maintain not only chastity, but asexuality, well through puberty and well beyond my point of reaching sexual maturity. Internally I automatically rejected these teachings. It was damaging to my mental and emotional development to be entirely denied of childhood romances, and instead to be trained to deny my own natural desire to experience closeness with women. I was taught that I was too young. This teaching continued for several years too long. I was strongly discouraged by my mother against seeking a girlfriend at all, so the subject of whether or not I was being abstinent was never even a question. It would have been better for me to be permitted at least some degree of intimacy with girls my age, so at least even a small emotional connection with a girl would have been available to me. Such a connection would have been healthy for my emotional development. The deprivation caused serious depression in my preteen and teen years. I became an outcast in high school because eventually I was too far behind the curve in the arena of intimate connections to be able to successfully connect with and relate to my peers. My mother rejected outright my suggestions that I was depressed, and my desire to seek professional help.

Now I feel it is important for me to pay close attention to my primal nature, in order to effectively overcome the unhealthy mental and social programming of my youth. This involves reminding myself that listening to and respecting my own sexual desires can be healthy, and that they are not inherently evil and entwined with Satan's attempt to drag me to hell for unrelenting eternal torture.

In summary, these are some reasons why staying connected to the primal nature, a sex-positive outlook, and atheism are important to me.",,False,,t5_2r7c9,True,,,True,t3_hc7b2,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/hc7b2/maintain_touch_with_your_primal_side_some/,

Always play safe with others and it's very satisfying. We get quite a bit of extracurricular play in but all of it has been organised by him.

I'm terrible at getting hook ups.

I have no game, I don't know how to hit on others. My best tactic is get really drunk and hope someone hits on me. That actually did happen once but that was before the bf overcame his jealousy so he scared away the play mate. (We did discuss it before and he said he was ok but he didn't realise how much it would bug him. The issue has been resolved.)

Every time someone flirts with me I just don't notice it. Every time I try flirt with someone, and believe me when I say it's not for lack of trying, I just come off as awkward or pushy. I feel like I'm being rude or crossing acceptable boundaries and making people uncomfortable.

What doesn't help is I feel like a contradiction. I'm a 6' 2"" gay guy. Submissive bottom. There's no way I can't appear intimidating and I want to inspire the urge to brutally fuck me in those I flirt with.

Another factor that scares me is I like my men to be MANLY as fuck. Eg [1](http://www.woofhunt.com/userpics/2009/Muscle-Daddy-and-Hairy-Muscular-Men-1-009.jpg), [2](http://images.tribe.net/tribe/upload/photo/5b2/419/5b241903-3a85-4fcd-b041-bd7f1b80ad4f), and [3](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3204/2752337014_7bebc5f24d.jpg) so what that roughly translates to where I live is homophobic and strong. I get the feeling I'll sooner be hit than hit on.

Using the Internet for hookups is not very useful because again, I live in MiddleOfNowhere, South Africa. The sites come back with maybe 7 profiles for the whole country, and that's including the ones without pics.

Any advice? I'm still practising and hoping to one day get somewhere. Just hoping there would be a few hints.",,False,,t5_2r7c9,False,,,True,t3_124g4w,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/124g4w/feeling_timid_on_some_level/,

My lover is big. Not terribly huge to the point where penetration is painful, but it takes *a bit* to adjust. Throughout sex, I loosen up a little, but as soon as I get close to orgasm, I begin to tense. A lot. To the point where it's borderline painful for him to remain inside of me. He calls it ""difficult"" to continue because it's like I'm trying to force him out. 
How can I fix this? I don't do kegels, we've tried a few sex positions to fix this, but I'm not sure we're getting anywhere. Any suggestions? Anything I can do as an individual, anything we can do as a couple? New positions to try? 
I feel SO BAD that sex can get uncomfortable for him when I enjoy myself so much. 

Edit: You guys have been giving some really good advice, but the main problem happens when I orgasm while he's inside of me. Even if I orgasm before hand, it doesn't stop my muscles from tensing when I orgasm again.

If so, how did you do it?",nustinbutts,18,0,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/jjra2/has_anyone_here_overcome_serious_premature/,"Well the title basically sums up the question. A guy with serious problems (8 pumps kaboom). Google seems to be a terrible place to try and find answers. Mostly just advertisements and the same vague useless advice. I've tried Kiegels, they dont really do much, in fact they seem to make me cum faster. I've tried the whole brinking thing (getting used to being on the edge of an orgasm), and that worked for a while (very well actually), but the problem is I've started to become desensitized to porn, so i cant get as aroused by porn as with real women. This essentially leads to me thinking i have everything under control when i watch porn and masturbate, but when it comes down to the real dirty dirty, boom kablam 10 second man.

What's odd is sometimes i can get into the swing of things for like a week and be a straight maningo. Go for exactly as long as i want, cum on demand. And i'll think everything is better but then the problems come back again. Please let there be some sex therapist on reddit that can give some advice. Upvotes!!

Edit: Just to go in to the whole detail with the brinking thing. I would masturbate (with lube) and focus on not having a kiegel response at all (not clenching that pee muscle) while masturbating, because it seemed to feel really good (to clench) and would make me cum faster. When i would get clos to orgasm i would slow down drastically and move very slowly basically almost feeling the orgasm creep up, but slow down ever so slightly when it would get too intense. This way i could be nearly cumming for about two or three minutes or so until the urge would go away and i would work back to that point and repeat the process a few times until i felt like cumming. This worked for a while until all of a sudden i wouldnt really be able to stay fully aroused while watching porn without a little clench which eventually turned into my loss of control of the clenching which is now where i am.

Also using an artificial vagina seemed to help for a while until i got used to that too. Now its the same story as it is just not the same as a real woman.

I saw two other posts reflecting my viewpoint, one of which is the only post in the entire thread to be downvoted into the negatives (mine is at 0 and the other has two upvotes including one I gave it).  On the other hand, everyone who states that they love hairy men or that they don't care is being upvoted.

The two of us who have been downvoted received comments in reply about how we must only date pre-pubescent boys due to this preference.  I guess what bugs me most is the double-standard of men always asking ""How can I make my girlfriend shave?"" but when a girl doesn't like hairy chests she's a pedophile.

This was/is achieved by putting my left leg over my right and essentially wiggling/squeezing until climax. I can still do this. It takes me about 5-10 minutes to achieve a pretty juicy clitoral/vaginal orgasm in this way.

I learned this at such an early age that I would do this pretty much anywhere anytime since I ""didn't know any better."" Unfortunately, this led to some verbal sexual abuse on the part of my babysitter...her way of trying to get me to stop doing it. I still continued to do it as I grew up, just hidden with the fear of getting caught.

I didn't really have the best ""sex talk"" growing up. It lasted about 10 minutes and I was left feeling like sex was a pretty bad thing. I didn't even make the connection that what I was doing was an orgasm until I was in my 20s and began studying sex on my own since my partners weren't really getting me off. I also sought counseling for my sexual abuse and eventually developed a more sex-positive attitude. I've experimented with kegels and sex toys, and I now have a range of sexual responses with a partner including clitoral orgasms and ejaculation.

However, I do enjoy sex now, but I still have never really had a climax with a partner the way I can with the ""wiggling."" I have never ever told a partner that I can do this, not even my husband. It is not achievable during penetration (edit: or any other partner or other kind of self-stimulation). I thought kegels would possibly bridge the gap, and I would be able to achieve it through other means, but so far it hasn't worked.

Sometimes I don't give a shit that things are this way, and other times I do. I feel grateful that I can even climax in this manner. Sometimes I want to tell my husband, and other times I don't.

I recently got married, but have been with my now-husband for almost 5 years. We also have a unicorn we've been with for almost 2 years now.

This isn't something that happened suddenly, or was triggered by anything in particular (I don't think). It happened gradually. At first I thought I just wasn't in the mood as often, but as time went on, I realized that it was becoming a problem. I wanted to have sex, but just couldn't bring myself to. I'd always think of some reason why ""now isn't good time"".

I wasn't raised in a religious household. I was never told ""sex is bad"", and I know consciously that there's nothing wrong with wanting it, but for some reason, I just get these bouts of guilt afterwards. Even when I first started masturbating as a pre-teen, I didn't even know what was going on, except that it felt good...and then it felt bad.

There are a lot of things that I think probably contribute, for example, my self-image, my idea of how others view me, my limited experience in sexual and relationship matters, but I don't want to bore you with a wall of text.

I'm just not sure what to do. I've talked to my partners about it, as well as our therapist. I guess I'm looking for another perspective.

It’s about a Joseon-era court painter that was disguised as a man by her father, to settle a score with a rival. The protagonist is interested in painting pastoral scenes instead of the usual elegant subjects, and due to a chance meeting makes friends with a poor brass mirror maker, with whom she develops a relationship with- which culminates in a really beautiful 5 minute long sex scene (ridiculous for a serious movie, as I’ve said, but something tells me that S. Koreans try to make up for the ban against porn productions by sticking a lot of sex into their blockbusters). It’s perfect not because it’s very sweet and loving- I prefer this myself, but even if the two characters had rough kinky sex up against a wall I’d still like it. Because there was leadup to that moment. They met, they hung out and inspired each other, there was chemistry that slowly built between them, and eventually they decided that they wanted to explore each other’s bodies. Kind of like…a lot of real life sexual situations. It’s been said that desire should be added to the Human Sexual Response Cycle before excitement, and I agree. Thinking about someone, gauging their reaction to you, getting turned on/experiencing sexual tension because you want them, maybe even masturbating to them… is a key part of some people’s sexuality. Erotica writers and screenwriters of movies and tv often incorporate this. Erotic fanfiction, most often written and read by young women to fulfill their own desires through their favorite characters, almost always features this. So why does porn never incorporate something so key… and in my opinion, so sexy? Even feminist and queer porn is still two people having random sex with little examination of why they wanted to have sex, what they find attractive about the other person, how much they desire them, etc. I mean…I know a lot of people don’t care about this and are perfectly satisfied with what’s out there, but I know I’m not the only one that isn't.",,False,,t5_2r7c9,1362250605.0,,,True,t3_19j7ob,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/19j7ob/i_wrote_a_thing_about_porn_and_i_want_to_know/,

Sorry if this breaks any rules here, I didn't see too many self posts, but I wanted to get some feedback from the community.

I want to call myself sex positive, but I don't like talking about sex with my close friends and acquaintances.

I just...don't really want to know about it. The concept of my close friends and coworkers having sex sort of weirds me out a bit, I don't really want to think about it, and I get flustered when people bring up their sex lives in casual conversation.

As well, I don't really want anyone else to know about what I get up to in the bedroom. I'm ok with the thought of other people knowing that I have sex in general, but I would be ashamed beyond belief if any of my close friends or acquaintances knew specifically what my boyfriend and I get up to.

My group of friends almost never talk about sex in a personal-experience context, so it's mostly only a ""problem"" in the abstract, but I do get a little weirded out when I think about how thin my apartment walls are, and I've been thinking a lot lately about how I view and react to other people and thought it was worth addressing, or at least getting some feedback from other people to get out of my own head a bit.

Is this something I should work on overcoming? Is it enough that I figure out how to react positively to others' openness about sex, without feeling like I'm somehow doing it wrong with my desire to never talk about my own sex life, like, ever?

If it matters, I'm cis-female, straight, mid-twenties, inclined toward monogamy.

TLDR: I'd like to consider myself a sex positive person but I'm worried that my desire for privacy in my sex life and my inability to converse with others makes that a false statement.",,False,,t5_2r7c9,False,,,True,t3_os60i,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/os60i/sex_positive_doing_it_wrong/,

The introspections are very detailed about my personal life and how I figure this really has shaped me subconsciously and sexually.  It goes in depth to my life, my family, and touches on some relationships. I find it almost impossible to talk about the development of my sexual self without really explaining my non-sexual self.

I don't think of myself as particularly special or interesting, but so many cuckolds or groupsex fetishists, seem to write in great detail about their sexual adventures with only passing mentions of their motivations, or the source of where these, sometimes unsettling, desires arrive from.  

I suppose if you want science, there's a whole host of books to read on human sexuality - but these are my anecdotes and I'm sure many folks that enjoy these kinks might be able to relate.  Anyways, here you go:

Would you be uncomfortable if your gf had done an art nude photoshoot?,Quartz11,18,1,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/i2lkz/guys_need_your_opinion_please_would_you_be/,"I've done two art nude photo shoots. I started this hobby roughly a year ago when I engaged a photographer to take an outdoor nude photo series of me. These are NOT porn. This was something I wanted to do. I previously had struggled with severe depression and poor body image, and had been recommended to take the plunge by a friend. I had laughed the idea off at the time, but it stuck in my brain and I researched off and on for two years before finally finding a professional I liked. 

The motivation for these photos is as a celebration of my body and the imperfections and flaws that make me beautiful. The pictures show me being happy and comfortable in my skin and enjoying myself in a lush natural setting. These are fine art nudes and I bought rights to the photos following the shoot. The only ones who have seen the photos are myself, the photographer and one friend who was my emergency contact. 

After I finished my first shoot, I discovered I really loved the entire experience. My photographer had asked permission to use a select few of my photos as part of his portfolio he would show to other fine art clients and I agreed. I decided I wanted to do another shoot and found another photographer (friend of first photographer) with a different style I also liked and who was interested in working with me both in fine art nudes and modeling some of the clothing I and other local designers had made. It was a BLAST! It was further confirmation of how much more beautiful one can be if you are comfortable and confident, flaws and all. 

My questions (long time getting here... I know) is it was recently brought up to me, by a trusted confidant who knows of my hobby, that many men would find it very uncomfortable to find out their girlfriend had been nude in front of the camera and would consider it cheating if she continued doing shoots during a relationship. I did not understand this, as one would assume that one's girlfriend had been seen nude by someone else before and that because of the lack of sexual nature, and rather empowering nature, of the activity it was hardly grounds for calling it infidelity. So how do ya'll feel? Would you not like it if your gf had engaged in nude modeling previously (even if photos are only for her own personal use) or wanted to continue? Help me out oh wonderful men of reddit!

As soon as my roommate left for class, I decided I wanted to try a little self bondage. Skip to the tldr unless you want the details.

I've never done this before but have kinda recently been fantasizing about my gf/so tying me up/pain among other things. So, in true solo style, I started to watch some porn, broke out a belt that I knew if I wiggled enough it would loosen up and put on a sock hat over my eyes and got undressed except for my socks haha(my feet were cold!). I wasnt really worried about getting stuck tied there because if worst came to worst I'd just have a very awkward day with one of my good friends after he untied me lol

First I stuffed a washrag as much into my mouth as possible(made sure my nostrils were clear!) I tied my hands together and to a metal bar under my couch with my belt. I put the hat over my eyes and kinda braced my legs against another part of the couch. (Ideally I wish my legs were tied too but that requires another person probably)

It was fucking awesome. I've never been tied up before but it got me going crazy and a totally different mindset. I really really like the feeling of being tied up, and before now I wasnt 100% sure but since trying it i cant wait to do it again.

Only two problems: I was getting pretty into it but my leg got stuck for about 10 seconds and of course I freaked and stopped all I was doing. I wish I would have gone longer but I was way out of the mindset at that point. I got my hands out very quickly and it was no prob getting my leg out. And my wrists kinda hurt while I was doing it but I'm not afraid of a little pain ;)
I started the traditional fap and sat on an empty booze bottle while i finished (clarify: the broad side of the bottle not the top owww)hahah.

My roommate came back probably 10 min after I was done because his class was canceled. So that could have ended horribly hahaha.

Overall A+++ will do again!

Ill answer any questions you redditors might have who are thinking about trying this!

tl;dr Tied myself up for the first time ever it was fantastic and cant wait to try it with the SO!",,False,,t5_2r7c9,False,,,True,t3_fdebq,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/fdebq/guess_what_i_tried_today/,

However, I am neither of these things.

Yes, my parents divorced when I was young, but my father has always been around for me. I see him at least once every year during school breaks and I have positive male influences around me (i.e. wrestling coaches when I was a manager and the chorus teacher). I love my father in a healthy way and I know he loves me just the same.

Regardless, I still have a fetish for older men (I'm 18 but am easily mistaken for 12, 22 if I put on enough make up and the right outfit) and daddy roleplay. Surely, one must think, ""Your father wasn't around enough!"" But he is. It's not even an issue with hearing a man tell me I'm pretty. My father has always told me and my sister we look beautiful and especially praises us when we go an extra mile. I don't NEED that attention. Hell, I get plenty of it from school.

So what I'm trying to figure out is, is my fetish just something I'm born with? Is it because I'm doomed to look like jailbait for the rest of my life and therefore seek borderline pedophiles?

He's not squeamish about period sex, but I'm more comfortable when I don't have to worry about it, and I'm also an avid fan of oral sex, which I wouldn't ask him to do while I'm on my Lady Times.

Guy, 32, dating a 22 year old female. Been dating for about 3 months. 22 year old female does not want to have intercourse at this time, but is more than willing to explore each other sexually in other ways. Guy has repeatedly said he is ok with this. Girl gives guy first blow job about a week ago. He seems pleased by this, if a little surprised. Next time female attempts to give him a blow job he stops her halfway through and asks her if she wants to do this. Female replies, ""Of course!, Why, did I hurt you?"" 
Guy: ""No, but wouldn't you rather sit on my cock."" 
Girl: ""No. Are you really going to stop me from this.."" *insert sexy sucking and playing with testicles* 

Guy flips girl over and proceeds to ask girl if she is certain she wouldn't prefer to have sex. 


Ok, annndddddd cut! 

Now, fellow redditors, can you analyze this for me? What guy in his right mind stops a girl from giving him a blow job, and a willing and enthusiastic one might I add? This guy added that most people have sex before getting to blow jobs... I'm the opposite. I want to explore every little bit of a person before taking that plunge. Not to mention I've communicated this to him VERY clearly. He says he wasn't trying to push me into sex, but wanted to make sure that I really wanted to give him a blow job and just wasn't doing it to do it.... 

I'm not willing to budge on the intercourse part. Until I'm fully comfortable with the idea, and he can openly talk about sex and what he likes that's a no go for me. Also, he doesn't understand why I was afraid he was going to try and have sex with me even though I told him no. He is horrified I would even be afraid that would happen. I think its a rational fear for any woman, especially in a new relationship. 

help reddit, am I socially/relationally stunted or what?


*Update*: So here's the situation. I talked with him and things kinda went down hill. I was very straight forward about my reasons for not wanting to have sex, which he said he understood although he thought it kinda sucked I didn't trust him. I pointed out I did trust him, I'm just not to the point where I would feel comfortable having sex. I told him it makes me feel weird in a bad way when he points out that most people have sex before bj's. He countered that he didn't mean it was bad, just unusual and something he hadn't encountered. He states that he thinks I'm closed, guarded and shy and that its hard to approach sex with me because he's afraid he's going to scare me. This post from an earlier conversation is basically what I told him:

Idk what to think. It's not that I don't like sex. I just don't want to have sex with him. To me, intercourse is me giving myself to someone in an act of complete trust and caring. I should have few misgivings and be comfortable with this person where I can just relax and know that my lover will take care of me, and I him. I am definitely not there with this individual. In fact, he will be leaving for law school in a month or so. I see no reason to just sleep with someone, to me it means something, even if it doesn't to the other person. Its a personal thing that I don't expect others to understand.
This being said, I'd also like for him to get me off without sex first. Or at least try. We haven't done much as it is, and I am starting to question whether its worth it after the events of the other night. I don't know whether I'm just really uptight or if I'm still hung up over my ex (its been a year and 8 months, its ok to move on right?) or if i'm really just making a call and deciding that if a 32 year old can't be as mature about sex and boundaries as my 22 year old self then I am perfectly capable of being alone again.
Don't get me wrong, I am voracious in bed, but only if I know I can trust the person I'm with and that they love me, at least in some capacity. When I feel cared for and desired, I'm a confident and classy lover, willing to take charge and dabble in all sorts of new adventures. But when I feel uncomfortable or unsure, I doubt myself, I doubt the motives of why someone is with me and I'm self depricating. I don't like that.
Lastly, the whole idea of a relationship is for two people who care about one another and enjoy making each other happy to share and support each other, right? I mean, in essence that's it right? I didn't miss some lesson, not being too idealistic or too pessimistic? Cause apparently its a foreign concept, or at least a fairy tale...

And this was his response...

Him: ""I initially thought you wanted to have sex with me. At first I didn't realize you were shooing me away. Yes I tried to engage you in sex. But you said no and I stopped. You make it seem like I'm going to rape you. That is serious and not a thought which should cross either of our minds when talking or thinking about sex. I've tried to be intimate with you and failed, I can live with that. But you can't keep me on the defensive. I've done nothing wrong, bad or ill intentioned towards you ever. Recognize what I am actually doing and that you have put me in a difficult position. I've never turned on you or said ill to you. I can't say or do what I normally would and I am not being immature about this."" 

So yeah, I feel like crap and like I've screwed up. I know I've got problems and I pissed him off by saying he was being immature and I don't know what the hell I'm doing. I'd like to rewind but unfortunately life doesn't work that way....

So the divide between the words used for male oriented vs female oriented oral sex has been bothering me for a while. On one side ""blowjob"" is a word that just rolls off the tongue, just by saying it you know it's gonna be a lot of fun, and on the other side ""cunnilingus"" sounds like a dusty word that escaped from a medical book. And that's unfair, because oral sex is a lot of fun no matter the sex of the person receiving it.

Words are important, they influence the way we think about what they mean, and we should take ownership of them. So together, let's find a better term for female oriented oral sex!

I have two suggestions myself:
- A simple solution would be to use ""blowjob"" no matter the sex of the person receiving oral sex. That doesn't sound ideal, because in this case the sex of the receiving person matters for a bunch of obvious reasons, but it's worth giving it a thought.
- For the past few month, my sex-positive friends and I have been using ""bunnyjob"" instead of ""cunnilingus"", and I think it works really well. The idea behind this term is to take back the etymology of the first half of ""cunnilingus"", and append ""job"" to sort of normalize it and make it part of the set of ""somethingjob""'s (""handjob"", ""blowjob"", ""titjob"" and so on). But the most important part is that **it's fun to say and it sounds like we're gonna have fun**, and I think that's what matters most.

So what do you guys call cunnilingus? What do you think of using ""blowjob"" or ""bunnyjob"" instead? Or do you think we should just stick to ""cunnilingus""? We need to figure this out people!",,False,,t5_2r7c9,False,,,True,t3_1j2lha,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/1j2lha/lets_find_a_new_term_for_femaleoriented_oral_sex/,

I'm more concerned about finding a job than seeking a relationship with anyone, let alone conversing with the opposite sex anything beyond small talk. I'm generally comfortable about this but its something me and my therapist talk about and he helps me try to broaden my horizons on that front. 

The thing that sort of bothers / excites me now is that by a simple idea of curiosity, I've experimented in some anal masturbation and have gotten some good experiences due to it. At first it was more about smaller objects say a rounded pen or an ice cube, and its extended all the way to larger objects like a shampoo bottle and beyond. Since I know using household object is not the way I should really handle exploring further, I will most likely purchase a dedicated anal sex toy in the near future (an inflatable butt plug is what I'm currently looking at). 

Next time I meet with my therapist I plan to talk about this extensivly but at the same time while I ponder about all of this in my head, I just tend to shift in and out of focus with it. I do know I'm attracted to women, yet as I look online for various kinds of sex toys I get aroused by some of the larger items and even some of the gay items as well. It just makes me question about myself and I don't know how to compensate for it.

I have been wracking my brain all day about this one. I know I haven't made the best decisions in this situation, but please, I need some solid advice. This is a throwaway and I already feel horrible so please no judgement.
I contracted HSV1 genitally about a year ago from my boyfriend at the time. He spread it to me through oral sex when he hadn't realized he was getting a cold sore. I was devastated. Since then I have had about 4 outbreaks. We stayed together for another year and just recently (2 weeks ago) broke up. While we were together I never really worried about unprotected sex with him. I'm on birth control and since he tested positive for the virus, as well, he was not worried about contracting it elsewhere. So, last week, while on the rebound, I met this very nice boy. We met up for a first date and ended up very drunk and had sex. Honestly, I didn't think much of it since I am not showing any symptoms (I can always tell very early on what's going on down there) and we used a condom. Ok, so then we also met up the next evening (last night) and ended up in bed again. This time much more sober, but unfortunately the condom ended up slipping off inside of me and he finished without realizing what had happened. Luckily, again, I am still on birth control (Nuva ring), so I am not too worried about pregnancy.
He of course feels awful and I tell him that it's ok, accidents happen. He says he's clean. And all this guilt floods me after that because I can't say that back to him. I feel horrible but I have no idea how to bring this up to him (I barely know him). I plan on going to my doc this week to get checked out myself to make sure he was telling the truth.
Anyways...my questions are: What is the real possibility of me passing it onto someone else, especially when 80% or so of people are already infected with HSV1? I haven't had any symptoms for months and I take good care to support my immune system. How the hell do I tell this guy if we continue seeing each other? This is all new to me. We would likely be nothing more than casual partners, probably not falling in love with or marrying him. If you are positive for HSV1 orally, what are the chances you will also contract it genitally? I mean if you already have it, can coming into contact with someone who has it genitally cause you to have an outbreak?
Thanks reddit. It feels good just to get this all out into words. I also plan on having a long discussion with my doc about this whole situation and see what she says.",,False,,t5_2r7c9,False,,,True,t3_1jq4it,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/1jq4it/many_questions_new_partner_failed_condom_and_i/,

I think it really links back to my mother, whom even though i love, was an alcaholic and now has taken a nose-dive in her health. Being the only female role-model in my life, i have grown up with a fear that women would bite your head off if you offend them in anyway, I definitely know that isn't the case now, and that women are for the most part rational people, but i still have this unconcious fear that ""if i try flirting or asking this person out, they are gonna kill me"" just driving home to point in my head.

but as i have explained before, i have had sex once. and dear god that was one of the most fantastic days of my life. We had a whole day to ourselves, about 6 hours in bed (there was a lot of pillow talk involved) but the intimacy i felt on that day was phenomenal! she was open, receptive, kind, and i could literally feel that she was just as happy to be there as she was, and even though i had just met this person, i don't think i have felt that close to anyone emotionally in a long time, let alone physically.

so when i get ""into bed"" all my inhibitions drop and i am able to be my happiest, free-est, and more comfortable than out in public with clothes on, but i know that I can't just up and go to sleep with random people, especially in my area which is definitely in the conservative christian side of things. That's when i heard about Sex-Positive culture, which promotes healthy sexuality and exploring, and kinda has the vibe of Free Love which has interested me before.

I guess i just want two things, to learn how to get past the ingrained fear of being flayed alive by females, and to sort of explore this Sex-Positive cultural thing, which seems to be exactly what i need to feel comfortable expressing myself in not only a sexual way, but just in a way where i don't fear offending somebody

I'm going to the next one, I'll get the time off. I just really want to experience one, show some solidarity and hang out with some people I know, there is usually a contingent of fellow students to go. 

The thing is, I feel like I have something I could say and I just want to run it by some people who have in all likelihood been to a SlutWalk/support it.

Since it's a very sex-positive kind of event, I want to ""come out"" as a male virgin. Virgin guys, especially at my age (over 20) really don't have much to be ""proud"" of in terms of their sexualities or their autonomy in identifying themselves or defining themselves, KIND OF like a girl/woman who likes sex is automatically a ""slut"" in the negative sense. I figure it's better for me to stop letting virginity define me in negative terms, I've let myself suffer because of it and I want it to stop. Rather than wait around for some movie to churn out a positive male virgin role model, I figure I might as well frame my status in a positive light and be my own model, liberate the definition for myself - I could be the first ""proud virgin"" I know of. I've always felt left out of the whole sex thing, I identify as ""sex-positive,"" roughly a third wave feminist and I think it's awfully sex negative to get down on male virgins. I can say that I'm a virgin over the anonymity of the internet, but I can't really discuss it IRL like people who have had sex can. Virginity is also a flimsy social construct as well, I could do everything but vaginal intercourse and I'd still be a ""virgin"" because the heteropatriarchal definition of ""sex"" is PIV intercourse.

Now I am absolutely not at all whatsoever looking to become the centre of attention and take airtime away from rape victims so this is why I'd like to run this idea by a few people first. I'm thinking I could tie my status in with the greater picture of consent, which is what the entire Walk is about. Maybe I could say something to the effect of how I will vow to have a perfect track record of consent (since I'm a ""clean slate"" right now). I don't see how that is ""boastful,"" since I'm also admitting something which is ""shameful"" but I don't want to come off as all like, ""Look at me, I've never raped anybody, look at how awesome I am."" I'm all for ""allyship"" and showing support and solidarity so I figure I can find some kind of common ground. I'm all about consent over conquest, and male virginity is all about the failure or lack of conquest. Either way, if you're not on a sexual conquest, you're not a man so by some extension, if you're not having sex where consent is hazy or questionable (IE ""conquest sex"") you're not a man either, if you get what I mean.

So what do you think, am I totally off-base and ridiculous, or am I on the ball enough to show up and have something to say myself that won't be totally irrelevant to the event overall?

But I'm already starting to plan out the next fundraising blog carnival, which will be in late October. This time around, the participants are 95% sex bloggers....and they're largely the type who already care about and write about bad sex toys and toxic sex toys. So while their readers are indeed donating, we're ""preaching to the choir"".  I'm interested in gaining some fresh perspectives for an opportunity to teach, and am wondering if there are any bloggers here who do not primarily blog about sex toys but are not afraid to talk about sex toys to their readers. And if you, personally, don't know much about toxic sex toys then that's okay, because I'll be more than happy to tell you all about it so that you can tell your readers about it. I don't have the exact dates pinned down yet for the next one, so I'm really just looking for people who would more than likely be interested in joining it in late October - early November. You can message me privately here, comment here, or email me (dangerouslillyATgmail.com). The beginning of October is when I'll start officially rounding people up.  What you'll do: Write up a post on your blog on your assigned day, to both educate your readers and drum up donations as best as you can. Dildology.org is run solely by donations, is a non-profit and we don't even take any salary for ourselves. We take a sex toy and send it off to a lab to see if the manufacturers are being honest about the sex toy material and to see if there are any toxic chemicals in it. There's a lot more to the organization, but that's the gist of it.

That’s not to say women can’t and don’t enjoy porn, or erotic pics or the like. But I haven’t known women who are really into pics of specific body parts the way men seem to be.
I’m interested to know, however, in this sex positive Reddit universe, are there women who are really into visual stimuli the way men often are?  I mean, I have definitely enjoyed and gotten turned on by pron. But in general, I have to somehow buy in to the overall scenario. It can be cheesy as heck (the hunky pizza delivery boy), but if they are into it – and the women seem to be truly aroused – that’s what gets me. It’s not about the “stills” of what the body and the parts look like and how they fit together, it’s about her turn on and pleasure. If it’s well done, there is an underlying scenario – whether of dominance and submission, or pizza boy and MILF – that adds to the arousal in a significant way. 
That is really different from a gay friend of mine who loves jacking off to 60 sec cum-shots, one after the next.
What got me re-thinking about this recently is my receipt of a cock shot, from someone I’d met on OKC who I was corresponding with. He’d approached me about dating/relationship, not just sex or hookup. So, I wrote this about it: http://welcometopolyville.wordpress.com/2013/04/04/the-cock-shot-or-why-do-men-think-women-want-pictures-of-their-penises/  

It feels kind of like the human equivalent of a display of one’s peacock feathers, or a bright red baboon ass, or some other strictly visual mating call.
But I would like feedback – what do you think?

My question for the sex positive community is: 
Taking for granted that sexual activity that is gratifying and enriching for participants is to be encouraged and celebrated - how can/does this affect the psychological obstacles experienced in one's life?

Does feeding into a set of power-plays, experiments in trust, role play, etc.  tend to _reinforce_ perceived _unwanted_ shortcomings, or help an individual to explore them and reach resolution so they can move forward and become more like the person they want to be?

Years of research and study on this parallel dimension of thwarted male desires have led to a strange rip in the fabric of the known angst universe to reveal some kind of alternative structure to how these interpersonal relationships unfold.

Could it be that the ""friend zone"" is not only mythical, but not applicable to all single males as a universal blanket theory, when variant situations reveal a section of modern masculinity that is less hateful at their ""defeat"" at finding a relationship, but hopeful that the right person will com along?

halle206:  so how come our messages never get far? lol. what i mean is am i in some way, not what your looking for?

me:  yeah, i was actually getting around to that!

me:  Essentially, you seem to be looking for a more serious relationship than I am

halle206:  ahhh

halle206:  so what are you looking for?

me:  So sorry about that. I don't really have time for a full on relationship because I've got loads of course work

halle206:  no strings fun,kinda thing?

me:  Not exactly, something between the two

me:  Someone I can hang out regularly with, but not with any ideas about a long term relationship

me:  Is that quite common for guys on [site]?

halle206:  no i dont think it is really

halle206:  not the ones i chat to anyway

me:  So they're more into long term stuff as well?

halle206:  well im looking for someone who i can be with for at least 6 months

halle206:  i think so yer

halle206:  but problem for me is that.....lots of them believe casual sex to be an ok thing

halle206:  but i believe strongly thats its not

halle206:  and am lookin for someone who thinks the same

halle206:  so thats where most blokes go wrong

me:  What about if they've had casual sex in the past, but wanted a relationship now?

halle206:  no way

halle206:  if they have done it then no way

me:  No way - as in you won't date them?

halle206:  yep no date from me

me:  How did you arrive at your opinions of casual sex?

halle206:  i want them to believe in respect for women!

halle206:  well iv always had them really

halle206:  just as iv grown up iv thought more and more about how wrong it is

me:  I say that just because it's relatively uncommon to find a non-religious person who also believes casual sex is always immoral

halle206:  yer i know

halle206:  im VERY unreligious too

**me:  Is it wrong if the woman enjoys it as well?**

**halle206:  yep**

me:  Also, ditto on the atheism!

halle206:  totally wrong everytime

me:  Because you believe the women are being exploited even if they enjoyed the experience?

halle206:  yay go atheists!!!

halle206:  nope just cos sex is the most intamate thing people can do.....so it should be saved for people you love only

** halle206:  the only time that is an exception is......**

**halle206:  if you are experimenting with same sex stuff!!**

me:  Why do you say that?

halle206:  well cos that person  cannot get into a relationship then have sex if they dont even know for sure if they like someone of that sex

halle206:  so they need to have sex first to see if they lik it

me:  I think that's a tenuous argument. I knew that I would enjoy sex with a woman before I actually did, and I imagine that (for example) a lesbian would know that she would enjoy having sex with a woman

me:  before she actually did.

me:  You don't need to do something to know that you will like it.

halle206:  well i can do more than imagine because im in this situation!!

halle206:  i think u do need to do it before knowing

me:  You're in a same-sex relationship?

halle206:  nope

me:  What do you mean by ""well i can do more...""

halle206:  but i feel that i need to have sex with a woman before i am able to get into a relationship with her

me:  So you are bisexual?

halle206:  nope im bi-curious!

me:  ahh okay

me:  So if you had sex with a woman and enjoyed it, then would you label yourself bisexual?

** halle206:  but am finding it hard to experiment in order to see if i actually am bi. because i dont believe that casual sex is ok**

halle206:  yes i would

me:  Hmm. You're in a bit of a bind.

halle206:  yer i know dude lol

me:  I'll put my opinion out there: (but please don't go because this is fun!)

me:  I have had casual sex, and enjoyed it

me:  She enjoyed it as well

me:  Sex in relationships is better

me:  But sex outside of one is still great

me:  It is very possible to separate sex from romance

me:  They aren't intertwined

me:  Sex is just fun and people usually like doing fun things.

halle206:  i think if they arnt for you then they should be 

halle206:  i think its about love first then fun

me:  I'll admit that I did used to share that viewpoint

me:  But if two people enjoy something and no-one gets hurt

me:  then what is the harm in that?

**me:  Why is consensual casual sex between two mature adults wrong?**

**halle206:  cos its the wrong thing to do in my opinion**

**me:  That's not really an answer**

halle206:  cos you shouldnt be doing that because its meant for lovers

me:  Why is it meant for people in love?

halle206:  people who are in a loving relationship

halle206:  becasue its love making

me:  Having sex with someone doesn't make you love them

halle206:  its makes the bond betweeen people stronger...thats what its meant for...to show how much u love each other

halle206:  no but it often get people to have feeling for each other

halle206:  besides casual sex people do often get hurt

me:  It definitely makes the bond stronger within already established relationships, but not if there's nothing already established

me:  I don't see why a fraction of people being hurt by something should exclude the majority from doing it

me:  People are killed in cars; it doesn't mean we ban driving

me:  or that driving is wrong

halle206:  but it can make one person lik the other when the other doesnt like em back

halle206:  people do often get hurt

me:  it can do

halle206:  besides its just like prostitution but you dont actually pay

me:  but most mature adults can deal with mis-matched feelings

halle206:  no they cant it had nothin to do with maturity

me:  Well I can't see us agreeing about this.

halle206:  so ur sayin that ur mature if you can block out all feelings. is that what ur sayin

halle206:  that not what mature really means

me:  No - I'm saying that if you get hurt after casual sex then eventually you heal

me:  Maybe you learn to do it less, or not at all

me:  Maybe you have just as much casual sex

me:  It doesn't make it wrong

me:  Anywya

** halle206:  who says you eventually heal??? not everyone heals at all, most of the people i talk to never heal**

halle206:  but thats why they have come to a therapist i suppose

me:  So you're saying you have a group of friends that have all been wrecked by casual sexual encounters?

me:  Because I have a group of friends (guys and gals) that high five over casual sexual encounters

halle206:  no not at all....im talking of friends and clients

**me:  But you do know personally at least one person who has never emotionally recovered from a bad casual sexual experience?**

**halle206:  yes**

**me:  How long has it been? Months, years..**

**halle206:  years**

**halle206:  and i know more than 1**

me:  Well I am honestly incredulous.

me:  Anyway

me:  I think that you should chat to the [University she goes to] LBGTQ people

halle206:  why?

me:  I think they might be able to help work through your bi-curious feelings

me:  They might also have some sex-positive material for you to read. It could be enlightening, or re-affirming.

halle206:  nah im just gunna go for the causal sex thing....but chat to the gal first about the whole thing

me:  Ok well I hope everything works out for you eventually

halle206:  but when iv sorted out whether i am or am not...then i certainly wont be doing it agian

me:  Good bye!

halle206:  bye

Regardless I had a question for you sex positive people.

Do you find that its easier to be comfortable when naked with someone?

I find that dating is a little awkward until I manage to get the clothes off. As in for some reason, being covered up physically means mentally I'm covered too. 

Even in a friends only situation, if I chill in the nude for whatever reason its just easier for me to open up. 

In all honestly I don't feel the least bit differant clothed or nude but it seems to flip a switch in my social conditioning that makes it really ok for me not to try and make sure I choose my words carefully or not offend. 

Am I just weird or do any of you feel the same?

We connect perfectly, at least socially.  Unfortunately, I get the feeling the sex is going to be fairly vanilla (we're taking it slow), and I have a fetish that I'm pretty sure she'll not be able to fulfill.  See, she's just a hair above normal weight, and has body image issues, and I'm into girls who are heavier in addition to girls like her who have just a little extra in all the right places to make her curvy and gorgeous.  In case that was too subtle, I'm turned on by fat.  Call me an FA, Chubby Chaser, whatever.  For the record, I'm a 6' ~220 lb guy.

Even though I enjoy being intimate (well, intimate-ish, we're at the mutual masturbation phase) with my girlfriend, both mentally and physically, I find myself fantasizing about women who would be SSBBWs in net-parlance (super-size big beautiful women, women above 350 pounds or so).  I keep on thinking to myself, ""Gee, wouldn't it be great if I could have sex with my current girlfriend (who is capable of more positions and who I feel really connected to, which I'm certain makes it feel better) and also have the occasional fling with larger women?""

For the record, it's not so much that I'm ashamed of being with a fat girl.  I dated one for a while, and we almost had sex, but not quite (forgot the condom like a moron!).  Anyway, it was fun, but she lived really far away and started to have health issues, partly because of her weight (or her weight was because of her condition, it was based on co-morbidity).  We kind of drifted apart, because it was hard to meet up with her and she would often need to have a test done.  We just weren't able to get that close.  Anyway, so most of my friends already know.  The thing about women that large is that they're a relative rarity around me.  Joke all you want about America being fat, but apparently in the Northeast, we don't have that much morbid obesity in women my age.  Worse yet, were I dating a SSBBW, I'd probably be tempted to sleep with a merely chubby woman to try other positions/acts inhibited by her size (tried being underneath while dryhumping, couldn't breath fully).

Is there any way I could bring up the idea of me having relationships with SSBBWs on the side, without sounding like a freak to my girlfriend?  She's a strong agnostic, so she's not got dogma against it, and I feel like I could have the occasional one-night stand without complicating my feelings for her.  However, I understand it would be a gamble to ask her.  Other complication: I haven't told her I like big women yet, but we haven't really had the ""what turns you on?"" talk yet.  She has body image issues, and I'm concerned bringing it up too soon/the wrong way would make her feel like I liked her because she was fat, thus she's fat.

What I won't do is cheat behind her back or suggest feeding (which I think is unhealthy and isolating, and therefore not a healthy kink), so please don't suggest those things.

Please excuse this awkward thread, I'm really just thinking aloud and debating how much of the sexual freedom I have available I want to take advantage of.  I don't want to give up a good relationship and emotional closeness for one night stands.  But I also want to enjoy my sexuality.",,False,,t5_2r7c9,False,,,True,t3_dv2bs,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/dv2bs/sexpositivit_im_conflicted_how_do_i_know_if/,

TL;DR: Not sure if it's time to break up, as our relationship is slowly decaying. 

I know it's kinda childish to ask for this kind of advice, but maybe I need to read the obvious to be sure of what's going on: I'm 25 and he's 32, we've been living together for about 3 years and we even have a civil union registered. Our relationship hasn't had any major problems or issues, on the contrary he's the laid back type and I'm becoming the more neurotic and angry boyfriend stereotype. Not without my merits I guess, I have this constant feeling that he's not contributing to our life together. 

Then again, every time I try to talk about it to him he feels that I'm pushing him into a wife gender role. 

I guess this is issue number one. 

I work in a bank and I get about 2.5 his salary, as he owns a bar. He spends most of the week at home doing some social marketing for this bar, and then he has to be at this said bar about 8 to 10 hours thursday, friday and saturday - but usually he stays a little bit more to get some after party in the morning, as it is his only time to relax. 

But I have this hard impression that half of what he's telling me is bulshit. He says he has a lot to do during the weekdays, when I'm pretty sure he doesn't. Most of the projects he works on are never finished (he's also a graphical designer on his free time, which the only things that he currently is working on is the bar's website and artwork for our music). And I constantly notice that he only starts working when I get home (at 7 pm). 

So basically he's kinda like a liar, but I know it's not on purpose, he has a weird perception of time, he doesn't seem to notice how much wasted time he has during his day. Add this together with some sort of guilt for not doing things, he seems paralysed. 

I've already managed to get him a psychologist, since he told me in the past he's aware of some of his flaws. 

I guess the main issue about this is to hear that he'll do things, specially related to chores, but these are never done, and whenever I press him on these matters, he'll complain that I'm asking for a housewife. 

How are these roles distributed in non-standard relationships? Am I being a jerk? Should I feel like he should be doing more of these chores, specially when I work 9 hours a day and have to go to college at night?

While that is a major problem, issue number two is related to sex. 

Again, we do have an open relationship, but the lack of sex between us is kinda bad... it leaves me frustrated, I feel rejected, unattractive. It's really bad. And when we do have sexual contact, he seems like a dead body, barely looks at me, and just waits for me to finish. We already talked over and over about this, but somehow he's unable to let himself go when were together. 

Which leads to the fact that he complains that we don't cuddle or be in non-sexual situations. In my defense, I have no interest of doing those things when I don't have any expectation of sex. And it's something I've told him, I've spent the last two months at home with him, cuddled in the sofa watching TV, without any sex. These last two weeks I've just had it!

On the other side the kind of sex I'm looking for is something intimated that I want to have with him, not with fuck buddies. It's just, different. 

How does sex work in an open relationship? Are there any examples of couples that get all their sexual gratification without their SO? 

And the last issue is finance. 

We're always broke, I can't get any kind of budget for us to work on, anything I try to do, he'll simply ignore. It seems that if I don't do all the work on that matter, he won't even try to help. Weekly market is a good example. Every sunday there's a free market across our street, and every sunday I'll go there to buy vegetables of the week, tomatoes, onions, lettuce, eggplant, zucchini, kabocha, mandarin, oranges, peppers and whatever. It's just so cheap, about 1/3 to what we would pay in an actual market during the week. 

This particular sunday I was with my family, I asked him to do the groceries, but nothing. He simply ignored what I asked, and didn't even mention anything on sunday. I know sometimes people forget, but this goes back to something I mentioned earlier, he's always forgetting. 

I guess these would be our major issues, besides that I have this constantly leaving feeling for months now. I've dreamt about former boyfriends, better sex lives and more tangible futures. This has been destroying me inside and making me feel constantly miserable, specially because I'm not sure if I'm right about this, or if I'm actually being a jerk and wanting a housewife to support me. 

Again, he did promise he would help me during college, especially because I helped him when he started to acquire the bar. 

I just feel constantly let down. With someone I can't rely on or even trust. How can I be sure I want to end this relationship? He is a great person. I love spending time with him. And we have lots of gun together. 

BTW, if anyone mentions talking about this with him... well... I tried in the past. I've sent emails saying how I feel, and I think I even made another topic asking for advice in the past, but to no avail. 

Maybe I should just shut up and hang on a little bit more, specially because I know that he wants to change, and I do know how much time that will take, even with some shrink helping him out. 

**FOLLOW-UP:**

I did some reading on ADHD and a lot of it seems to fit the profile. We had a talk yesterday about all of this and it was very very positive. 

I appreciate everyone's help and support =)

(20 F),hedonist_perhaps,11,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/1ccaje/i_am_in_three_polyamorous_relationships_and_i/,"Hello lovely inhabitants of r/sexpositive,

In my three current relationships I feel that my physical and emotional needs are met exquisitely, and I also have the opportunity to pursue any other relationships I desire with the consent of my partners. 

Yet even with my needs met and ample freedom, I still desire to be physically intimate with many other people with whom I am emotionally intimate on some level, even if there isn't a romantic attraction. I just can't seem to find a boundary in physical intimacy that makes sense to me. I cuddle and sometimes kiss my close friends all the time and with many people it feels completely natural and totally comfortable that sex should follow, and often has when I am single. I feel like there should be nothing wrong with having sex with people you like even if you don't want to make an emotional commitment. I can understand that my partners are uncomfortable with this due to concerns about health and safety, but the main issue seems to be this notion that I *should* be satisfied because of what I do have, and that wanting to have sex with all these people I don't ""love"" and have no intention of ""loving"" is somehow wrong. 

Maybe I should be in an open relationship and not polyamorous ones... But I feel like open relationships are disregarded as non-meaningful relationships. I just feel like I have no idea what I'm doing....Would anyone care to provide some clarity?

Finally I apologize if this post is confusing, I am terrible at expressing myself. I am happy to answer any questions that may help you understand me better.",,False,,t5_2r7c9,False,,,True,t3_1ccaje,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/1ccaje/i_am_in_three_polyamorous_relationships_and_i/,

As I sad, this is supposed to be non-violent, non-oppressive, non-creepy, and the only way to do that is to not start by asking other people, but by opening yourself up to be asked. This whole thing is opt-in with a list of things you would be okay with being asked about in an upfront manner. 

I've been thinking for a long time about a way to facilitate non-violent, non-oppressive, non-creepy communication of interest in other people that:

* Does not discriminate based on ability, race, class, gender, class, body type, orientation, or other axis of identity
* Broadens the domain of acceptable communication in negotiating intentions with others
* Does not conceal the many gender identities and orientations of people
* Exposes various types of relationships and does not repress/promote one over another
* Can work for any level of prior contact
* Is respectful

I think the only way to do this is to have an opt-in system, because propositions are not automatically okay in any context. This way, people can discretely make public what they are open to, depending on who is interested. I am going to start with analog, but this could move to software and be pretty cool. Here's what I have and I want your feedback so that it can be finalized before putting together a website and spreading the word! 

=

Down to X is a way to say what kind of possibilities you are open to with different people, and to recognize what people respond well to being upfront with them. The point is to bypass the awkwardness and uncertainty in expressing interest in other people. Our hope is to broaden the domain of acceptable communication in negotiating intentions with others.

*How it works*

* If you are interested in someone who has a personal Down to X policy posted, and they have specified that they are willing to be contacted, send them a Down to X note. 
* While a personal DTX policy means that they are non-judgemental and open to being contacted, they are not obligated to respond. A non-response should be interpreted as a no and a signal to stop trying. 
* A personal Down to X policy also means that they are open to being asked, and they are not obligated to say yes. Being turned down is not a big deal, and is better than being uncertain!  
* You can post your own personal DTX policy so that others can feel comfortable contacting you

We've been very comfortable telling our dirty wishes and desires, with who we'd like to do it, with who we'd do it together, but it's been mostly platonic... for me anyway.
She did arrange a sex night with someone else after asking me and I gave her my ''okay''. To be honest, it excited me somehow, of course there was a bit of fear, but I liked to hear her experience after, while we where doing it. Sensing a genuine opinion when she went forward and told me how so much better i was was a nice ego boost too.
Somehow, though, I feel like I'm guilty when I'm flirting with girls and It gets going. I never did it all because of this, and I have difficulty with saying I'm in an open relationship to my friends as well as potential hook ups. I fear, especially for the hook-ups, some kind of backslash, and somewhere in my mind when i tell them that detail, they'd think I was lying and cheating. Worse, I sometimes get myself thinking and subconsciously validating some kind of stupid double standard, where if a women is in a open-relationship, she gets it easy and his viewed as emancipated, but if a men says he's in a OR, he's selfish and not mature. Even worse is I also get myself thinking my girlfriend wouldn't handle it, and that doing so would make me destroy our relation.
I got to admit my first complete sexual experience was love related, and with the girl I am right now. So, sexxit, how do I liberate myself from all this? I got a month without seeing her, and I'd like to experience others..

I am a woman.  I am 21 years old.  I am writing this because I am afraid that I might be guilty of what I always promised myself I would not do.

I think I have trouble identifying what I want out of sex, and instead, *voluntarily* take on the role of satisfier of my partner's sexual urges.

I realized that, as strong a woman as I try to be, I find myself more and more incapable of having my own sexual fantasies.  I feel myself trying to mold myself more and more to my partner's desires, rather than my own.

It makes me really scared and sad and hopeless because I desperately want to be my own person, and I desperately want to get what I want out of life, rather than what someone else tells me I want.  I don't want to let myself be submissive, but I keep feeling it, and I don't like it!

Am I betraying myself to men?  Am I betraying myself to others in general?  I sometimes have trouble knowing who I am when I am around other people - I often act the way I think they would most want me to act, and convince myself that I also wanted to act that way.  I rarely tell people off.  I have drawn boundaries that I say people can't cross, but I don't know if I would have the courage to enforce them.  

I don't feel like myself and I don't feel very vital at all, if you know what I mean.  Please, can somebody give me any help as to how I can start feeling like I own myself?

The dating/personals sites i'm on: 

**[OkCupid](http://www.okcupid.com)**

OkCupid is great because it's made by nerds. Without needing to scam you into paying for the service (match, harmony, etc), you can get very relevant matches. Also their blog is awesome. Still, OkC is really a lot about maintaining your profile and trying to message people and from there it's hit or miss. There's also lots of Redditers on OkCupid, as well as Fetlife which i'll talk about now. 

**[FetLife](http://fetlife.com/)**

I just found FetLife and it is similarly made by nerds, but on top of that it's built on Ruby and is big on free software (or open source, as they call it). I just opened an account but i'm yet to populate [my profile](http://fetlife.com/users/562342) yet. The obvious downside is that is focuses on fetish and kinksters, but it's certainly nice to see the community getting together. It's not ""exclusive"", but it would be nice if it wasn't directed for or away from kinksters, and just open to everyone. Still, the concept is sensible because they avoid the classic mistake of dating sites that focus on...dating. FetLife is much more about networking. Dating happens when you socialize and meet new people and eventually find someone who you like and likes you back. FetLife builds on mutual interests and doesn't emphasize the same things more conventional dating sites do. 

**[Pirate Date](http://piratedate.com/)**

The Pirate Bay has also been advertising Pirate Date on their homepage, which certainly seems interesting. I also [opened an account](http://piratedate.com/zp/go.php?to=view&amp;userid=1589749) there, but i am still experimenting with it. The site needs a bit of work, and seems to prefer Facebook integration (but it's only an option, not required) but the idea is something like building up a real social network.

By my teenage years my negative self-esteem broke me down to the point of being barely functional. I drew away from everyone I cared about and spend the majority of my high school years alone. I didn't feel like I was worth anyone's time. I made myself believe everyone hated me and no one wanted to be around me. 

After grinding half of my way through high school it got to the point where every night all I'd wish for was just to not wake up again. I don't want to go into detail why I was like this because most people would just stop reading after a while, and it's too much to sum up in a simple tl;dr. 

Anyway, I'd pretty much reached the bottom at that point. I decided I'd try to fix my problems myself. Of that one of the things I did was to take the things I hated about myself the most, accept it, and make it into a strength. The easiest and most apparent thing was my sexuality. I now identify as a pansexual. Getting to the point of accepting that required me to fight a lot of repressed urges. My family is fairly religious and not very accepting to these kinds of things so I learned early on to hide them. I spent most of my early years deluding myself into thinking they were wrong, that everything about me was wrong, and that being 'normal' was the only true image for me.

Through a lot of struggling and soul searching I came to reason that the various components of my sexuality that I taught myself to hate were harmless. I reasoned that they themselves could have no negative effect on my life or others as long as I was responsible. I was very naive to think it could be so simple. 

Fast forward three years, and my sexuality is one of the first pillars of my new self. I graduated high school and I'm working on other parts of myself, trying to start a life and be happy. I have a girlfriend who is two years older than me. I tried to explain myself to her, but my sexuality poses a direct conflict of interest. Suddenly this part of me that I've spent years accepting and securing is being threatened by someone I love. I hoped we could reach some sort of compromise but she refused.

I asked around on other subreddits but very few people were understanding. With what little help I could get I've managed to resolve the situation for now. I've worked really hard to accept my sex-positive mindset, to let it be a part of myself... And now this person that I love expects me to just throw it all away for her traditional view of a romantic relationship. What do you do? 

I resolved to change my lifestyle for her... But every day it really hurts, especially seeing how I can put all that time and effort into rebuilding myself just to see someone I love knock it all down. All the passions I have that I'm forced to never explore because of her unwillingness to understand. I love her so much and yet every day there's a nagging voice in my head telling me I should end it. Everyone else told me how I was trying to exert control over her by tying to change her... But what about me?

This is all a completely new and frightening experience to me. I've spent most of my recent life alone, barely interacting with people in general. I say and do stupid stuff because I don't know any better... She isn't the same way, she's  been in many relationships before. She's older and she's got a lot more experience with relationships and people in general than I do. I hope I can get some thoughts instead of downvotes and people telling me why I'm a bad person, why I'm controlling her. I'm really not trying to do any of those things. I honestly just need help.

As much as it hurts I can deal with it, but I'm left wondering if really we shouldn't be together. She took the first thing I really worked to accept and turned it upside down without any remorse. What's to say she won't do it again?",,False,,t5_2r7c9,False,,,True,t3_1jtnbn,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/1jtnbn/what_do_i_do/,

1355283162.0,8,self.SexPositive,14pept,Consent on behalf of a third party,sparr,12,4,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/14pept/consent_on_behalf_of_a_third_party/,"I'm going to jump right into some real situations that occur with regularity for me. I don't feel my usual need to resort to hypotheticals, because most of the bases are covered by things that have actually happened and will continue to recur. As usual, I will tend to progress upwards in terms of the importance/severity of the situations. If we reach a point where you disagree with my thoughts or actions, you should stop and discuss THAT point with me. There is nothing to be gained by debating my conclusions if you disagree with one of my base premises.

There is a naked person in my bedroom. You knock on the door, and I invite you in. Seeing naked people is something that offends some people. Being seen while naked, by some large subset of potential viewers, offends some people. When I invite you in and you see a naked person, I have accepted responsibility for understanding both of your rules and have consented on both of your behalves. You are not repsonsible for invading the other person's privacy; if they are offended then I am responsible. They are not responsible for revealing themselves to you; I am. I know some people who would say that the naked person should cover up just in case the newcomer does not want to see nudity. I know a few people who would say the newcomer should always ask through the door for anyone inside the cover up. I say that neither person is responsible for taking either of those actions, because I have absolved them through my actions and decisions on their behalf.

In another situation, I am electrified, such that I give a shocking sensation to anyone I touch. You are someone I know, who has experienced the sensation before. You walk up to me with a friend of yours, who I haven't met before. You say to your friend ""hold his hand"". How should I proceed from here? Having encountered this specific situation some hundreds of times I have mostly established that if the new person seems eager then I will allow them to grab my hand immediately and if they seem wary then I will explain what is going to happen to them first. I have upset a few people by not informing them of what would happen when they touched me. I have also scared away some people by explaining it to them, who I later found out did enjoy the sensation and would have wanted to try it, sans explanation. Many people will, at this point, say that I am partially (or even mostly or completely) responsible for the potential violation of consent here. You, as their friend, have established by setting up the situation that YOU are willing to subject them to this sensation without their consent.

There is an alternate version of this scenario, still not hypothetical, where the shock is delivered by a device instead of by my hand, and the device is simply sitting on a table. When you say to your friend ""touch that device"", and they follow your instructions, the total responsibility for the outcome is split between you and them. If I have responsibility in the previous scenario, where did it come from? Do you or they become less responsible for the outcome because of my participation?

This concept extends to sex. Some people want anonymous sex, quite literally. I have been tasked, in the past, with arranging for a friend to be fucked by multiple people that I knew and she did not, without her meeting them beforehand or them being able to identify each other during. I am currently involved in a similar situaton, although more aimed at second base than at fucking. How could any of my friends accept that invitation, without getting consent from her? They trusted me to enforce and implement their requirements. How could she ask me to have them do this, without getting consent directly from them? She trusted me to convey and enforce her preferences and requirements. I, as the initator and facilitator, have willingly accepted the burden of implementing the consent of the other parties, and I accept responsibility for any errors in that regard.

Now, combining all of the above... You walk up to me with your friend, knowing that I am electrified, cover her eyes, pull down her top, and say to me ""lick her nipple"". You have chosen to offer third party consent on her behalf, for her to be topless in public. You have consented on behalf of the other people in the room, to be exposed to nudity. And you have consented on her behalf to be ignorant of my identity, to be touched sexually, and to experience an unexpected sensation. This is not a hypothetical, nor even an isolated incident.

So, given all of this information, where do you draw the line? Can you, should you, would you accept consent from one person on behalf of another, and if so then for what actions? Are there things about their relationship that would affect your decision, such as if you know they are acquaintances, friends, lovers, married, in a D/s relationship, kinky, sexually open, polyamorous, etc? Would you give that consent, on behalf of someone else? Would you let another person give consent for you? When, and why? Have you already told them that? Does it require more trust for you to accept consent from me for someone else than for you to accept consent from me for me?",,False,,t5_2r7c9,False,,,True,t3_14pept,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/14pept/consent_on_behalf_of_a_third_party/,

Do they fight and argue and get all the drama out, and then go out and get his and her's Valtrex prescriptions? And then all is back to normal?

I realize this is an odd question, but I'm genuinely curious. Just imagine I'm doing research for my novel. 

EDIT: So, this mostly turned into a challenge about my claim that the attitudes toward extra-marital affairs are more relaxed in France and Germany, which isn't the point of this post.

About six months ago, she told me that she had been abused by an adult member of her childhood church. The period of abuse lasted from the ages of 3 to 7. She was also abused again in her early adolescence by a babysitter. Since revealing this to me, our sex life changed dramatically.

Now she can't stand to be touched. I can kiss and hold her, but anything more than a shoulder rub is unbearable for her. She is more than comfortable pleasuring me, but can't stand to be touched herself. Being a victim of sexual abuse myself, I think I understand the feelings she's going through. I just can't seem to get her back to the place where we enjoyed each other.

I guess my question is how can I help her to feel safe and comfortable again? I want her to be able to enjoy feeling sexual pleasure and not feel guilty (as she says she's begun to feel). I'm willing to put in any amount of time and effort. I just want to make her feel whole again.

How should I proceed?,mooncatsblank,7,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/17911b/new_guy_has_a_lot_of_emotional_triggers_around/,"I don't really know where to post this so please redirect me if I'm wrong.

Recently I (f20) really hit it off with a guy (m19). We really click and we've talked openly about the fact we're both totally crushin' hard for one another. We've been taking things very slowly for various reasons, one of them being that he has depression triggers around intimacy. Over a year ago he was witness to his ex gf cheating on him (having sex with another guy at a party) and that triggered a suicide attempt. He has been in counseling since then and has been a lot better emotionally, and he has been very honest with me about it all. 

What I want to know, is how to move forward with him. We cuddled during a movie, which he loves and has been literally dreaming about ever since, and when he left after our day together (he lives a couple hours away) I kissed him on the cheek as he was getting on the bus. 
He has expressed interest in returning that particular affection, and I quote ""I'd like to just be able to cuddle with you... and perhaps try and experiment to see if I'm capable of anything more?""
I would love to be more intimate with him but I just am not sure how to proceed. He doesn't know how he will react since this is the first romantic/intimate experience since his ex cheated. 

Does anyone have any advice? I really like him and I would like to very positively re-introduce him to romance, and introduce him to sex (possibly, he's a virgin, I'm not).

1330975037.0,6,self.SexPositive,qixil,"I gave a short talk on cognitive science, linguistics and sex positivity at BIL 2012 aboard the Queen Mary. Here is the outline I drew up (and then didn't really use), which covers my points.",jdac,7,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/qixil/i_gave_a_short_talk_on_cognitive_science/,"So, below is the outline that I cobbled together in Emacs Org-Mode for my talk. I ended up not really sticking to it, but my presentation, being the first time I've been in front of a microphone since becoming an Eagle Scout, wasn't all that great, so I'm inclined to let my outline represent me instead.

I've formatted it with the code formatting rules here on Reddit because, being from an Emacs buffer, it's best viewed in monospace font.

Here it is:

    * What does cognitive science mean for sex-positive activism?
    ** Introduction 
       This talk is about words, reason, framing, and (as a non-expert)
       what the science around them might mean for sex positivity. I'm
       going to touch on word reclamation, and offer an idea of what that
       could mean in light of this ""new"" knowledge.
    ** Understanding Check: We're all sex-positivists here, right?
       - don't wanna upstage the panel later, so I think it suffices to
         say:
    
         ""Sex positivity is the position that what consenting adults do
         for pleasure is not inherently shameful or harmful.""
    ** Name Check: George Lakoff
    *** Reason
        - Enlightenment
          + Beliefs about Reason 
            1) Reason is conscious
            2) Reason is disembodied
            3) Reason is emotionless
          + Also, words directly fit the world
        - Modern cognitive science has shown that all of that is false
          1) Reason is unconscious
             - even when you reason consciously you do a lot of
               unconscious processing
          2) Reason is embodied 
             - it's in your brain!
          3) Reason is emotional
             - when people acquire brain damage in the emotional centers
               of their brains, they don't become Mr. Spock.
             - instead, they are paralyzed by indecision because they
               can't ascribe a value to anything or tell good choices from
               bad. They can't make plans!
             - You can't be ""rational"" without emotion
          4) Words don't fit the world
             - words don't exist in a vacuum: they come pre-packaged in an
               envelope called a frame.
    *** Frames
        - A frame is a collection of anecdotes, stereotypes, metaphors and
          narratives.
        - ""Girl Next Door"" has a frame, one with characters and narratives
          that people here for Maggie Mayhem's talk will recognize
          + The Girl Next Door is young, white, brunette, often
            bespectacled and usually a student
    *** Metaphors are circuits in the brain (1997)
    **** Metaphor is how we think
         - When experiences activate different parts of your brain at
           once, they spread over time until they meet, like the streamers
           from clouds and ground objects during a lightning storm.
         - When they connect, a circuit is formed. THAT is the
           metaphor. It's a physical link in your brain! And it's made
           stronger every time you see that metaphor in action.
         - We then project these bodily understandings of the world into
           abstract domains, like politics or morality.
    ***** primary metaphors
          - precede language acquisition
          - up for increase
          - warmth for affection
    ***** Other metaphors
          - I mentioned morality up there.
          - purity and corruption are our moral metaphors
    	+ have people do something nasty in an experiment and then
              give them the opportunity to wash their hands, and
              they jump at the chance
    	+ doing something nasty or ""immoral"" has made them feel
              physically dirty.
    ***** Mutual inhibition
          - some metaphors cancel each other out (nurturance and obedience
            to authority, for instance)
    *** Reframing
    **** ""Virginity"" 
         - Metaphorically connects sexual inexperience with purity (thus morality)
         - Some sex educators have reframed this brilliantly (though I can't attribute)
           + your first sexual experience is your ""sexual debut""!
           + Completely evades entanglement in the frame of ""virginity"" as a word.
    *** Word reclamation
    **** ""Slut""
         - one of the first things that came up after SlutWalk got going.
         - But what is the frame the word ""slut"" is attached to?
           + Too much sex is bad
           + Being sexual will make you a victim
           + Implication that victimization is DESERVED.
         - We must be cautious using this word.
           + Since the word is connected to this frame, we only activate,
             and thus REINFORCE, the metaphors, narratives and
             stereotypes of that frame.
           + This is the opposite of what we want.
         - We can change what the word means in our own communities:
           that's been done.
         - The general public will understand it differently
    **** ""Sex""
         - the term ""sex"" itself bears consideration in this light
         - Is it too big a concept to reframe? Possibly.
         - As a sex-positivist, I DO hope to reclaim sex by reframing our
           discourse about it.
    **** Reclaim frames, not words (Using frames for our own ends)
         - when a woman asks her partner to call her a dirty slut:
           + does NOT necessarily mean she believes she's immoral or dirty
             * If that were true wouldn't she just call herself that,
               rather than ask her partner to do it?
           + rather, she wants her partner to invoke metaphors that
             associate carnality with dirtyness
             * would enhance the experience if that is how she understands
               sex physically.
         - So we as sex positivists can endorse the use of sex-negative
           metaphors and language for the mutual pleasure of consenting adults
           + THERE IS NO CONTRADICTION HERE
    ** Conclusion
       1) we want to be a rational movement
       2) We must understand framing and metaphor in order to reclaim
          frames used against us for our own use
       3) We must MASTER framing in order to tell the truth
       4) We must be careful not to work against our own interest when we
          try to reclaim words.",,False,,t5_2r7c9,True,,,True,t3_qixil,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/qixil/i_gave_a_short_talk_on_cognitive_science/,

We will use long term only for privacy issues. We are a couple in our 60's, open-minded, but cautious. Frankly, I have discovered that I (the male) may have anal desires I did not recognize when younger and my wife does not share the desires, but is basically quite open-minded about meeting my desires. Sounds like no-problem...

However, she has had very limited, and very negative experiences with receiving anal in her past and dos not want to participate in me having bad experiences...  

So, it would help us both if we could see frank videos that are not 'porno' but are also not 'reserved or held back'. She needs to hear how it can actually be done, without pain. She needs to see and hear what works, not what 'might' work or 'sometimes' works. But, we both do understand an element of YMMV in any how-to.

So, if you can lean us forward toward a real video that might inform us, we would appreciate it very much.  TIA

&gt;Sex is many things. It's a fun and extremely pleasurable activity, it's a good workout, it's a deep learning experience, it's an intense bonding ceremony, and when you want it to be, it's a glorious expression of love; most importantly, sex is nothing to be ashamed of. These sentiments are often misconstrued, but please avoid stretching the truth. Nobody thinks that everyone should have to be open about their sex life if they don't want to, nor that anything about anyone's sex life should change, except of course that which, due merely to cultural norms, hasn't yet but could freely change in a sex-positive society.

&gt;What is sex-positive? As [defined by Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex-positive_movement), the sex-positive or sex-affirmative movement ""is a loosely defined term that applies to a wide variety of elements that embrace social and philosophical attitudes promoting open sexuality with few limits"". Some limits are reasonable, and in a sex-positive culture, those limits would be maintained. For instance, sex may not belong in the office, but sex outside of the office should never be cause for firing. While understanding such reasonable limits, the sex-positive movement opposes unreasonable and harmful limits on the expression of human sexuality.

&gt;Being sex-positive is being comfortable with our own sexualities and accepting of everyone else's without preconceived notions of what that is. I'm straight, you're gay, he's pansexual, she's transgender, we're polaymorous, they're not, and it's all okay! Most importantly, everyone should have the basic human right to express their own sexuality freely. Ironically, a sex-positive culture is a culture in which [sex is not an issue](http://sexwillhappen.com/what-is-sex-positive). If you're open enough with yourself, sex is just not something that distorts your point of view. Society has a long way to go in that regard.

&gt;Why is it that the movie industry is so tolerant of so much violence yet won't allow even artful depictions of sex? Why is it that religious groups push for abstinence-only education, which is more a censorship of sexual education, when this ignorance not only leaves so many young people with distorted and inaccurate information about contraceptives, but also has proven to have no impact on the actual rate of sexual abstinence? Why is it that same-sex couples have to fight so hard for the same basic civil liberties as everybody else? Why is it that the very same laws that are supposed to protect youth are instead [criminalizing them en masse](http://freestudents.blogspot.com/2009/09/there-is-fury-and-and-sadness-inside.html) with punishments far exceeding those for murder, even for consensual acts within the same age range, for doing what is an expected element of growing up? Why is it that erotica is frowned upon when [40 million](http://internet-filter-review.toptenreviews.com/internet-pornography-statistics.html#anchor6), over 1 in 10, US Americans in 2006 admitted to regularly visiting internet porn sites and when all that viewership actively serves to [reduce sex crimes](http://www.slate.com/id/2152487/)? Sexual repression hurts society.

&gt;So let's fight all of this sexual negativity. Let's build a creative, diverse, sex-positive culture by acting as though we are in the society we wish to create. Spread openness with openness, and don't let societal norms and taboos stop you.

&gt;In this vein, i have decided to make a homemade sex-positive erotica video. Why? Well, why not? This is precisely what it is all about: there should be no reason why doing this should have negative effects, so despite those potential consequences, i will do this as an act of retaliation against them. I think it'll be fun, i want to do it, and let's face it, we all watch porn.

&gt;People warn that i might regret it, but i don't want to live my life like that. I might just as easily regret not having videos to look back on when i'm older and more importantly, not standing up for my values. Well what if i am elected office or running a major company and it ends up in the news? I don't see those positions any differently: if a sex tape turned up of an American president, great! I'm doing this because i want to oppose a society where that would be newsworthy, or anything frowned upon. It's just sex, naked bodies sharing a ritual as old as humanity itself. In the future they will wonder why we were so bothered by nude images and recreational sex. 

&gt;The final product will be a tasteful erotica which is not degrading to either partner. It will be distributed via torrent and the Internet Archive for free under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 United States License, making it the first ever video pornography distributed as [Free Content](http://freedomdefined.org/Definition), and only the second to ever be released under any Creative Commons license after the Spanish indie short film, ""The Good Girl"".

&gt;So, all that being said, i'm in need of a co-conspirator. Before you ask, i'm not doing this with a girlfriend because it isn't necessarily something i want tied to a relationship, both for the relationship and for the message i want to send. Lots of couples make sex tapes and lots of random actors who don't know each other make sex tapes. Meeting someone like-minded for this specific purpose and establishing a friendship-level relationship that can both sustain the project and last beyond it just makes more sense.

TTENTION CIRCUMCISED/RESTORING MEN!

January 1 is CIRCUMCISION DAY — the day Catholics traditionally celebrate the circumcision of the Baby Jesus — and what better way to observe this ignominious day than to send a letter about YOUR circumcision (and your subsequent foreskin restoration, if applicable) to “Savage Love” author Dan Savage, America's most influential sex-advice columnist?

An initiative of the Canadian Foreskin Awareness Project (CAN-FAP)!

Savage’s views on circumcision have become progressively more enlightened over the years. He wrote disparagingly about foreskin in the early years of ""Savage Love"", but when he adopted a boy in the late 1990s, he had a change of heart and now commonly refers to circumcision as “mutilation”. But he has yet to state that boys have a right to keep their foreskin — if he receives enough interesting letters, perhaps Dan will dedicate an upcoming column to unhappily cut men and sharpen his position on this controversial subject. 

The Savage Love email address: mail@savagelove.net

Some tips:

SUGGESTED LENGTH: max 200 words; THE SHORTER THE BETTER. Over the past several months, the average length of a question or comment in Savage Love has been 140 words. Dan prints letters as short as one sentence or as long as ~300 words (RARELY). Keep in mind that the longer your letter, the less likely it will be printed. 

-Keep it personal. Don't claim that circumcision ruins sex or that circumcised men don't enjoy sex, because most circumcised men have satisfying sex lives and consider this to be nonsense. (Dan, a happily cut man, has commented on this in the past.) It is fine to talk to talk about how circumcision ruined YOUR sex life — such details will differentiate your letter from the others — but don't assume that most other circumcised men are in the same boat as you. Feel free to indulge in a bit of dark humor or cynicism about your situation—this will endear you to Dan and his readers. Your real name will not be printed, and you can be creative with how you are signed... Dan likes cute acronyms! 

-Don't criticize Jewish/Muslim circumcision unless you are Jewish/Muslim yourself. If you are Jewish or Muslim, by all means.

-Please don’t expound unsubstantiated or otherwise unproveable personal theories linking circumcision to a laundry list of personal and social problems. If you stick to your own personal sexual harm and how you feel about it, you will be on much stronger ground.

Please familiarize yourself with ""Savage Love"" a bit if you don’t know the column. (Don’t worry, it’s an entertaining read.) See http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove 

***Please send your letter on January 1. Not before, not after. Let’s give Dan a Circumcision Day to remember!

If you would like another pair of eyes on your letter, send it to me ( http://www.facebook.com/glen.callender ) and I’ll be happy to comment. (I am a professional writer/editor, by the way.)

Thanks for your attention everyone! Perhaps we could make this a yearly event? 

Regards,
Glen Callender
Founder, Canadian Foreskin Awareness Project (CAN-FAP)

PS. Please pass this event along!

From a 2004 article in Vancouver’s Georgia Straight:

Sex columnist Dan Savage isn't a supporter (of circumcision) himself; he and his partner didn't circumcise their son, who's now six.

""The social argument 'I want my son to look like me,' well, I never compared my dick to my dad's,"" the Seattle-based Savage says on his cellphone. ""My son and I don't compare dicks....A circumcised penis doesn't obviate the need for showering and bathing. My son knows when he's in the shower that he has to wash his legs and feet and has to roll back his foreskin and wash in, around, and underneath. If my six-year-old can do it, a 26-year-old can do it.

""After years of joking about my personal preferences as a gay person,"" he adds, ""I think it's unnecessary and causes a great deal of pain to an infant.""",,False,,t5_2r7c9,False,,,True,t3_152ume,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/152ume/attn_circumcisedrestoring_men_write_to_dan_savage/,

I've always identified as a member of the ""sex positive"" community, and I've taken a principled stand in favor of withholding judgment about sexuality wherever I can.  I recently discovered, after a huge information dump, that she's had an extraordinarily high number of sexual partners and participated in group sex before.  A little while later I also discovered that she slept with four different guys over the course of the week leading up to the day we met.  I'm bothered intensely by my knowledge of her sexual history, and I feel like this is a major indictment of my sex positivity.  I've been really preoccupied with this since this was all revealed a few days ago, and I can't stop replaying her previous sexual encounters in my mind.  Some part of me wishes I'd never learned any of it, and some part of me thinks it would help to have her tell me all the particulars in detail.  Would that be a good idea? I've brought up my discomfort in as non-judgmental a way as possible, and she was sympathetic and reassuring in vague terms.

Being alone absolutely doesn’t bother me—I’ve basically been isolated for the last year by choice. I’m not looking for sex. In fact, I haven’t had sex since my last relationship a little over two years ago, and I really could care less. Sex when legitimate chemistry is there and it happens spontaneously is great—but I have no interest in seeking it out for its own sake. 

I have, however, discovered that I have an overwhelming need—simply for ~touch~, with someone whose … scent I find attractive (aside: scent is a major component of attraction in general for me, and I’m fully convinced this is because we use scent to determine genetic compatibility. I’m also blood type B, and the only long–term same–sex friendship I’ve ever made was with someone who is also B. Type B being the rarest, I think this is a major reason why attraction is as rare as it is for me: fewer people are genetically compatible). I believe I was confused in almost all my past relationships: the need, the craving, the desire—it wasn’t emotional passion and it wasn’t (with somewhat rare exceptions) sex; it was this. I used to maneuver into watching movies that I didn’t give a damn about, without really thinking about what I was doing, just because I knew it would be an excuse for us to be close, next to each other interrupted for two hours or so. And I wouldn’t pay a bit of attention to the movie and I would start count down the minutes left when it got near the end.

I’ve never been abused or abandoned, and it isn’t a simple craving for touch; when anyone I’m not attracted to like this touches me, ever, I recoil and it actually makes me angry. And I should clarify that I quite literally get a very vivid sort of high. As someone who has done large doses of LSD and psilocybin, and plenty of cannabis sativa, I know what does and doesn’t deserve to be called a “high.” This really has been on par with some of my most intense psychedelic experiences; and it is in fact so strong that I’ve genuinely wondered if something like pheromone addiction might exist. It’s arousing, but (usually) doesn’t make me want sex; it just interrupts the trance, and then at climax the high basically ends. I wrote this (http://tinyurl.com/vangoghmalady) after a particularly vivid experience, which essentially involved no more than us looking in each others eyes for a prolonged period. I remember one of the only times one of my exes didn’t lay next to me when we sat to watch a movie: she thought nothing of it, and it meant nothing to her; but as soon as I realized, I felt this deep overwhelming sinking feeling, suicidally intense, like nothing else I’ve experienced short of an actual breakup. Immediately, everything in me was screaming, ‘how the fuck do I get her back next to me!?’ I bore it because I couldn’t figure out any nondesperate way, I forced myself to pay just enough attention to the movie to be able to discuss it, nothing changed in the relationship at the time, and she never knew anything happened. Before then, I assumed that everyone else was like this, because it seemed so normal to me. When that happened, it started to occur to me that it might not be; and that’s when I started discussing it. Since doing so, I’ve found that so far, even people who can relate to scent being a component of attraction really do not experience this in the way that I do. 

So, How do I present this?; and is it normal enough that I should expect to be able to find it at all? ",,False,,t5_2r7c9,False,,,True,t3_tijt4,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/tijt4/pheromone_addiction/,

If you're not comfortable feel free to not take it.

This is not professional research, it's undergraduate educational research. An academic assignment for a psychology course. The nature and topic of the survey is something I do hope to pursue as a graduate student. I understand the nature of online survey but hope that I'm able to take what I can from using an online survey and actually be able to administer a streamlined and revised version of it later on in my academic career.

My long term goal is to promote more sex positive attitudes in general and to promote the provision of equal mental health care to anyone who seeks it, regardless.

I just found this paper on the Journal of Royal Society of Medecine 
(can someone clarify how good their reputation is ? thanks)

It explains the origins of the negative attitudes of science toward masturbation and how these beliefs were routed in theology and the concept of ""[humors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorism)"". It also discusses the papers Onania and Onanism (someone has the link please ?) and how Onania is basically only based in religion (and an incorrect interpretation of religion at that !)

It almost seems to have come natural to me.

At first, I thought it was just a meaningless fetish and kept it as that, but I started reading some works by psychologist William Marston (Inventor the lie detector and Wonder Woman), and he spoke about ideas such as matriarchy and submission to females as valid, real world ideas, not just fetishes. Maybe I'm ignorant, but as I said, I kept things like female dominance in the fetish realm and never analyzed them too seriously.

But Marston had very interesting ideals. He talked about how men naturally craved for a mother figure their entire lives. Even if they seemed to become dominant towards women as they got older, it was only because their desire for a dominant woman manifested in different ways. He was also of the opinion that women were naturally smarter, more honest, and rational than men, and if they ruled society, war and crime would be almost nonexistent. He basically stated that men needed a mature, cool-headed female presence to submit to in order to overcome their natural tendency towards unruly and anarchic behavior. He even admitted that his writings in Wonder Woman were pretty much propaganda for matriarchies, and he took Wonder Woman's overwhelming popularity as partial proof of his theories.

Pseudoscience, or overlooked ideals that deserve analysis? I'd like to know the opinions of some ladies on here, although I don't mind hearing from men too. ",,False,,t5_2r7c9,False,,,True,t3_wuqql,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/wuqql/the_psychological_side_of_female_dominance/,

1332804914.0,5,self.SexPositive,rezlc,Demisexuality,gmath90,8,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/rezlc/demisexuality/,"I'm a bit conflicted. I don't really like to use labels when it comes to sexuality (or lack thereof) but at the same time I'm not trying to step on anyone's toes if they identify with a particular label, whatever that may be.

Anyway, ""demisexuality"" is a state of being in which you do not feel sexual desire or attraction with a person unless you are emotionally/romantically bonded with them. It struck me as interesting because I've never felt instantly wild with desire upon seeing an attractive woman (I'm cis-male identified and ""heterosexual"") like other guys apparently do. Of course, I can't compare what I feel to what they feel, but if for example a woman bends over in front of me and I happen to get a glance, I'm not ""DAT ASS-ing"" all over the place, although on a rare occasion I'll have a noticeable ""twinge"" in my body when I see someone or some cue which is particularly arousing but I can't really reliably predict what such a cue would be.

In all honesty, I wouldn't want to have sex with somebody without there first being a good basis of trust; one night stands don't appeal to me in the least and I don't pursue them. If I did, it would be out of a sense of feeling like I had to in order to prove something. Does that definitely make me a demisexual? No, there might be some kind of block in my mind, who knows. I'm a ""virgin"" at the moment so maybe ""once it happens"" something will click and I'll be ""normal.""

Basically I just find it curious how I'm 21 and have never had a relationship or any kind of sex, I don't immediately feel some kind of intense attraction upon seeing a person one would find attractive.

I'm more comfortable saying that I feel attraction in a more subtle way, I just have to look harder and more closely to find it? The thought of being asexual frightens me. For those of you who are asexual, I don't know how to be more tactful about it - the idea of having no sexual desire (as i understand asexuality) isn't a comfortable thought for me and my identity, I'm sorry if I offend.

Emotionally connected sex, if there is such a thing, appeals to me much much more than a more detached, promiscuous ""red hot"" kind of sex as well. Again, I'm not trying to denigrate promiscuity, it's just not something I'd be comfortable doing, at least not now.

So anyway, has anyone even heard of demisexuality, what are your thoughts, do you know anybody who might be demisexual, do you think I might be? Etc. etc.

The term ""porn"" itself seems to me to have meaning only the context of anti-sex+ attitudes, inherently judgmental, usually derogatory.

Something created for the specific intention of arousing lust, as opposed to having ""artistic merit"". Seems designed expressly for the purpose of some ""social norms authority figure"" deciding what's going to be legal/acceptable and what isn't. Which to me seems inherently anti-sex+.

To me, you have media in general. Some of that media displays nudity and/or sexuality in its various degrees of ""tastefulness"" or ""artistic"" or whatever. Some people like this kind of media representation, others don't, but no one person or group IMO should have the authority to place such a derogatory label on any given work.

Dialog around sexuality can be a challenge for many of us, whether because some of our desires are a little (or a lot) “out there,” because we may have been raised in a society or gender role that discourages talking about personal sexuality, or simply because talking constructively about our sexual wants and needs isn't a communication skill we've ever been taught. We'll talk about how, when, and yes, whether, to broach sexual topics, as well as how to hear and respond to other people's expressions of desire. 

I've pitched it to two upcoming events, but I was curious what folks thought about the description. It's a variation on a popular class I teach in the kink community. You can see my full course listings [here](http://barkingshaman.com/presenter/).

The top comment refers to the girl in the left of the picture, asking when she got boobs.  The actress is 15 and plays a girl who's about 11/12 years old, and the character is squarely pre-pubescent and flat-chested*.  From this came the usual debate.  One side of the debate is that she's (actress, not character) at a stage of physical sexual maturity, so don't be surprised when people find her sexually attractive.  The other side of the debate is that it's wrong to be attracted to a 15 year old girl.

What tends to bug me is the argument that a 15 year old girl can't consent to sex.  I find the logic superfluous.  Now, I don't mean this to advocate that your typical 15 year old girl- or boy, for that matter- is generally at point of physical and emotional maturity to give meaningful consent.  What I don't like is that we base consent off of age rather than ability to actually give consent.

In my opinion, any person who has been forced or coerced to have sex is a victim of rape.  Yet if a 15 year old girl is found to have had sex with a middle-aged man, the debate ends at her age without ever examining the issue of consent itself.  If 15 year olds so universally lack the maturity to give meaningful consent, then why is a law that makes sex illegal by virtue of that age necessary?  To be quite honest, I think that what I'm proposing actually makes anti-sexual assault and anti-rape laws stronger.  By replacing the age of consent with a law like I'm suggesting, you're extending the same protections we currently provide minors to *all* people of limited autonomy.
