1369109882.0,1512,self.depression,1eqtrg,Today was my 21st birthday,flylowyoucarrioncrow,2067,555,605,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1eqtrg/today_was_my_21st_birthday/,"I turned 21 today. I live in one of the biggest college towns in the country. When you turn 21 here, it's a big deal. I just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends. I'm not the party type or anything, but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with. Today I received three texts (more than most days): one from my mom, my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday. In all fairness, I don't have a facebook and I don't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything, but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone. I guess I've never been comfortable with having a facebook, the idea of being so interconnected which each others' lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me. But I think in not having a facebook, I've sacrificed my social life absolutely. 

Anyways, I've spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college. There is not a single person who if I called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. I've been fighting with my parents and after a few shared 'unpleasantries,' are not answering my calls because they want we ""to cool off,"" and understandably so. I've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven't heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn't forget hers. 

Anyways, If you've made it this far, from the bottom of my heart, thanks for listening to me vent. 


EDIT: The Reddit community has been absolutely amazing. You guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe, I've been getting offers for people to buy me drinks, and some have even given me their cell numbers to talk/text me if I was still feeling down. You guys are unbelievable. You turned what was a miserable day for me into one of the most memorable birthdays I've ever had. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. For all of you who took the time to help a stranger on the internet, thank you. Your words of encouragement have lifted up my spirit exponentially. I can't say it enough: thank you, thank you, thank you. ",,False,self,t5_2qqqf,1369127297.0,,,True,t3_1eqtrg,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1eqtrg/today_was_my_21st_birthday/,

When the time comes that I finally admit it's all pointless, that my life will be terrible no matter what I try to do, it always feels more like accepting reality than depression. 

This is always reasserting my belief that any sort of medication or therapy that actually had any sort of positive effect (none ever has) would just be a delusion. Like Cypher knowingly going back into the Matrix to be able to eat ""steak."" It just seems like a dishonest existence...and then I tell myself I'd rather be sad in the real world then happy living a delusion.

There is a lot to look through, but knowledge can be your best weapon. There are recommended videos, books, articles, resources, guides, how to help yourself, how to help others, research, military specific resources, quotes from literary memoirs and medical journals, reddit comments and discussions, and much more. I posted these links at different times, so each link has additional information I had found from the previous post (there are character limits to posts). I am sorry that many of my links are just that- links- rather than descriptions of the links, but I keep editing as I can to make these lists more user friendly and easier to navigate, and I am constantly adding to the lists as I find more information worth sharing. I was going to just create a brand new post combining all like categories from the three resources posts (for example, all the videos in one section), but I thought many of the comments and discussion generated on those original posts may be just as helpful to read as the resources themselves. This has been a work in progress over two years. Pretty much everything on these lists are resources I am personally recommending because I see value to them- not just whatever comes up when you type ""depression"" into google.  

Please don't hesitate to ask me any questions.

However I feel I definitely have a lot of the symptoms that those diagnosed with depression have (also of note, I do not feel suicidal at all).

I suppose the title of this post is a bit hyperbole, but I was thinking that if I did talk to someone and they prescribed some type of medication I would not feel comfortable with taking it.  I mean for one, I have a lack of faith that it would even work (but maybe that's just me being cynical and/or naive) and for another it seems like even if it did work it would lead to a contrived happiness as opposed to a genuine happiness.  Even just talking to someone I feel like I wouldn't properly be able to open up about what I've been going through. 

...And sometimes I feel like (and this is going to sound just awful) that I'm just using depression as an excuse or outlet for just being lazy or not taking an initiative in life.  I mean, there are times where I am happy...it's just seems like a rare occurrence.  I feel like I'm feeling sorry for myself.  I mean I have a great job, I'm only 23, I make very good money, have a nice car/apartment, etc.  But something just hasn't been feeling right...and it seems like it's a combination of multiple factors.   

It seems like it would all be an exercise in futility.  Maybe instead of talking to someone or taking medication I just need an escape via some new activity or something.

I was busy and didn't even see the message for 30 minutes. She was gone by the time I got back home. She had been fighting depression and I guess she lost. I called friends and family for support right after 911. They've been with me all day, but now that everyone is sleeping, I can't. The image of her hanging there will haunt me until my dying days. That was my baby, my better half. Falling asleep without her at my side just feels wrong. There's a huge hole in me and I don't know what to do or how to handle it. I just cry, I've been crying since 3pm. My face hurts, hell, my whole body hurts. To anyone that has lost their love, how did you handle it? What gave you the will to want to go another day? Or anyone that just wants to talk, keep my mind off that image. Not suicidal though, couldn't imagine putting someone through what I'm feeling.

Thanks for the kind wishes everyone. The xanax has finally kicked, in chest isnt hurting so much and I'm cross-eyed.hopefully be able to get some sleep. Can't take any more tonight.

I was able to get a few hours of sleep this morning from the xanax. Spent today with friends keeping me busy, I haven't cared about any of it. I've been out of it, just following them around, nothing matters to me anymore. I know the sun shown today, but I didnt notice it. I've caught myself pulling out in traffic without looking, not on purpose now but it has happened a couple of times. Not sure why, I guess it just doesn't matter to me anymore. I'm gonna quit driving for now. My school friend said our college has grief counseling. I will be going there in the morning. I knoweveryone is trying their best to help me, but I'm just cold. Cold and hurting and it seems to be getting worse. Tonight will be rough again. 

Everyone is sleeping again and I've taken my xanax so I apologize for spelling errors and  whatnot. Just wanted to give some back story. Beyond an abusive family she had, gang raped, losing her son 3 years ago today, losing her mother to suicide 2 years ago today. She was the most compassionate person to me. She had tried this before before we met. We didn't find, never did. Once when I did get upset with her, I caught her heating up a lighter tip and buring.her self eith. I'll finish this in the morminf

It's night time again, this is starting to feel like a journal. I want to thank everyone for their kind words and support, being able to read your encouragements and relatable stories  throughout my day has helped, more than I can express in text. Today has been one fucking hard day to put it lightly. I got some answers to my questions on why what happened did happen and that only raised more questions. I'll give an censored cliff note version to keep from airing her dirty laundry in the public, but I think its important for me to write this down. And I apologize from typing errors too, been doing this on my phone as my computer is still in the apartment. My gf wasn't from here, I never met or talked to any of her family. I didn't even know their names. She told me that there was a really bad childhood for her and that she had lost 2 children  with her husband years back. So I never asked questions, I just listened when she felt like she needed to talk about it. Eventually, she finally told me there was a younger 3rd child that was still alive with the now ex husband. She said they divorced when the children died, on Oct 15. Fast forward a year, her mother took her own life on Oct 15 for the guilt of feeling responsible. That was 2 years ago.we started dating in no November of last year. She started seeing a therapist for the past 3 months this year that was a very nice lady that she trusted. Well then her incident occurs from the guilt and grief, she blamed her self for those deaths which was completely unwarranted. The coroner had no idea of how to get in touch with family, so that's been my goal since then. I got in touch with the ex husband and an old close friend of hers from back then. I wasn't prepared for theinfo they had about her. The reason shed been crying and putting herself through hell, didn't exist. Well her mom was gone but not for what I was told. There was only two sons and they were both alive, she basically drove off one day and never came back. That was a few months before we met. She liveds those lies for the year everyone kew her here. I talked to her therapist and she was just blown away. All we can figure was that she was so much more mentally dustrurbed than any of us had any idea. Therapist figures she was delusional, maybe borderline schizo. There was really nothing we could've done to help her given the info we didn't know, it was like throwing a bucket of water on a house fire. Id here her talking to herself, but now I'm not sure that she wasn't just having conversations with someone she thought that was there. She would tell me about her conversations shed been having with her old friends that she was able to get in touch with, that really haven't heard from her in over a year. It's just so much to process. Shed actually be excited that she got to talk to them. She believed her delusion so strongly, no one had a reason to doubt it. This just makes things clearer and so much more sad.

12/03/2012: I am doing much better everyone. I thank you all for you thoughts and concerns. Life has gotten easier as time is passing on for the most part. The only lingering effects is the last image of her, every time something remind me of her my mind goes straight to that. That happens quite a bit, but hopefully that will pass as the other pain has. To those that have messaged me saying how much this has helped them, it really means a lot to me. I am glad some good could have come from this at least.

1365165201.0,646,self.depression,1bq90v,Depression is humiliating,Seamoneyyy,737,91,109,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1bq90v/depression_is_humiliating/,"It turns intelligent, kind people into zombies who can’t wash a dish or change their socks. It affects the ability to think clearly, to feel anything, to ascribe value to your lifelong passions, your relative good fortune. It scoops out your normal healthy ability to cope with bad days and bad news, and replaces it with an unrecognizable sludge that finds no pleasure, no delight, no point in anything. 

You alienate your friends because you can’t comfort yourself socially, you risk your job because you can’t concentrate, you live in moderate squalor because you have no energy to stand up, let alone take out the garbage. You become pathetic and you know it. And you have no capacity to stop the downward plunge. You have no perspective, no emotional reserves, no faith that it will get better. So you feel guilty and ashamed of your inability to deal with life like a regular human, which exacerbates the depression and the isolation. 

If you’ve never been depressed, thank your lucky stars and back off the folks who take a pill so they can make eye contact with the grocery store cashier. No one on earth would choose the nightmare of depression over an averagely turbulent normal life. It’s not an incapacity to cope with day to day living in the modern world. It’s an incapacity to function. At all. 

No one chooses it. No one deserves it. It runs in families, it ruins families. You cannot imagine what it takes to feign normalcy, to show up to work, to make a doctors appointment, to pay bills, to walk your dog, to return library books on time, to keep enough toilet paper on hand, when you are exerting most of your capacity on trying not to kill yourself. 

Depression is real. Compassion is also real. And a depressed person may cling desperately to it until they are out of the woods and they may remember your compassion for the rest of their lives as a force greater than their depression.

1368462608.0,587,self.depression,1e92yd,Battling depression is a skill. Here are some tips that worked for me.,Sk33tshot,688,101,170,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e92yd/battling_depression_is_a_skill_here_are_some_tips/,"After battling depression over the last year, I have come to discover some tips that have improved the overall quality of my life. The first, and most important discovery, was a change in the way I perceived happiness. Before my bout with depression, I assumed that happiness was my natural state of mind and that being happy is just inherent. Happiness was my baseline, I didn’t have to do anything, and I just was content. Of course, this all changed once the darkness came creeping in, and eventually my baseline emotional state was grey. Here’s what I discovered; being happy takes effort. Being happy is a skill and needs to be worked on. Thinking that you can magically become happy, or not depressed, without changing any aspect of your life is absurd. Once I got my mind around this concept, I worked on my emotional wellbeing every day. It’s a lot like weight lifting. It takes a lot of effort, it isn’t easy, and it takes a while before you see results. However, it is completely worth it in the end. 
Not everyone will derive joy from the same activities that are pleasant for me, but I will share my experience in the hopes that it helps you out. Here are the simple things I added to my life that helped lift the apathy, sadness and empty dullness I was stuck in: 

1)	**Talking about it.** I got in touch with a counselor and talked about it. We literally just sat in a room and chatted back and forth about my feelings for an hour a week. After a few weeks it really started to help. I was also fortunate to have a very loving and caring SO that put up with me while I battled through the darker times. 

2)	**Putting away the booze.** I don’t think I had a problem with booze, but it wasn’t improving the quality of my life, so I stopped drinking. Made a difference. 

3)	**Exercising. Seriously.** It might sounds cliché, but holy shit does this ever help out. Lifting weights and doing hard cardio was amazing for my mental health. While you are busting your ass in the gym or at home, you leave your problems for a brief amount of time and focus on completing tasks at hand. Lift that fucking weight 7 more times, that’s all I have to do, just lift it. The physical pain and concentration to just do simple body movements, matched the pain I was feeling inside and I was finally able to match my mind and body. Being exhausted physically felt great, and it released endorphins that gave me a much needed boost for hours after a workout. It also helped with my energy levels throughout the day, I was able to feel better and more energetic, which translated into happiness over time. Walk around the block, go for a run, do a few pushups in your room, just do it, get out of breath, push yourself for no reason, feel your body, get in the moment.

4)	**Gardening.** I never planted shit before. On a whim I bought some peat pellets, some hot pepper seeds and a few plastic containers – about a $15 investment. Best money I’ve ever spent. The process of germinating seeds, watering plants, taking care of them, and seeing weekly progress is fantastic. I read up on gardening, visited some subreddits and picked up a new hobby. I live in a tiny apartment in the middle of the city, but I have a window with sunlight and that’s all you need. Having nature around you will make you feel better, get a plant. Grow something. Take care of it, and it will take care of you. Try it out. 

5)	**Meditation.** I still suck at it, but it works. Every morning before work I take 5 minutes for myself. I just sit on the floor in my living room, look out the window and breathe. 20 deep breaths, focusing on the act of breathing. In, out, in, out. Simple. I added stretching into the mix. Stretch, breathe. 5 minutes, not a lot of time, not a lot of effort, but the mental clarity achieved is great. Stop reading this right now, take a deep breath, as deep as you can, and breathe it out. Do it again 2 more times. Try it, right now.

6)	**Vitamins and water.** Omega 3 (fish oil), Vitamin B, Multivitamin, Vitamin D. Take them. Especially the Omega 3 and Vitamin B. After only a couple days of supplementing my nutrition with extra vitamins I noticed a difference in my mood. Drink lots of water. More than you are currently drinking now. It’s not hard, go fill up a glass and drink some water. Plenty of articles out there on the link between proper nutrition levels, hydration and mental health. 

7)	**Daily log and journal.** The world isn’t out to get you, people aren’t out to get you, your problems are not impossible to deal with, but they do need to be addressed. This was hard for me to learn. Pick 1 daily goal. That’s it. What do you want to accomplish today? What completed task would take a little weight off your shoulders? Need to make a phone call? Need to pay a bill? Need to wash your sheets? Once task, one goal, per day. Write it down, that’s important. Write down your goal, and write down if you completed your goal at the end of the day. You might not reach your goal every day, but you need to try. The feeling from accomplishing tasks is great, even the small one, just recognize what needs to be done, make a goal, and try. Do it right now, open up notepad or get a pen and paper, and write down the date and what you’d like to get done today. Big or small. Just try. 

8)	**Small improvements.** Do something small that enhances your hygiene and/or appearance. Get a haircut, trim/shave, paint your nails, shower, wash your face, cut your toenails, brush your teeth, whatever. Do something easy that makes your appearance slightly better. Use some mouthwash; make your breath smell a little better. Doesn’t matter what you do, just make a tiny adjustment, a tiny improvement. Lots of tiny improvements over time make a big difference. Take care of your body, and it will influence your mental state. Look better, feel better, be better. Small, tiny incremental improvements. You will get a boost from completing the task, and overtime this adds up. 

9)	**Understand that it is a journey.** It’s hard. For you, and for me, happiness is not baseline. Our normal, everyday feelings are not happy. That’s ok. You can work towards a better life. Some of the shit that I mentioned above takes 5 minutes. The activities aren’t hard, most are enjoyable, what’s hard is bringing yourself to commit to them. Just fucking try it, please. Pick a couple and try it out. You’re taking a small step to taking back being in charge of your mental wellbeing. Yeah you didn’t choose to be depressed, I know, and probably feel like you have no control over your current state. You can help turn the tides. I went from daily suicidal thoughts, to being able to crack a smile here and there. You owe it to yourself to try. I think you can do it. You’re awesome.  

EDIT: Speaka_Engrish brought up a great point - Just to tag on to number 8, keep your room clean! Make your bed, wash the dishes, don't let little problems pile up; take care of them sooner and eventually it becomes second nature. A clean room is analogous to a clean mind.

EDIT 2: AndNowIKnowWhy made another great suggestion - Find a creative thing you like and maybe are even good at. ""Making"" something can become very meditative and self-asserting. Whether it's drawing or doing something with fabrics, wood, clay, metal, styropor, papermaché, threads or whatnot, it is an alternative form of meditation for people who are not into more common forms of it. 

Just don't do it to create something perfect, but rather to just create for the fun of it. It can be very stimulating and I like to create useful stuff for my household. Just googling the words ""easy diy"" and hit the image search will provide you with tons of ideas of which might be for you. also r/crafts, r/diy and all the other subs linked there might be an inspiration to find the right choice of material for you.

Depression, when it is present, is more like the force of gravity. It is there, pulling down on you under all circumstances. Though I'm depressed I am often very happy- but still there is the unfeeling wet blanket of muddled confusion and writhing frustration seething under it all. Waiting.

A creeping numbness that insidiously degrades and diminishes every aspect of conscious life. A storm of screaming and hatred in dreams. A dull apathy in waking. A sinking stomach in the face of joy and a faithless lassitude in the face of hope.

He talks here about the grief of losing his father and two brothers in a plane crash when he was ten [(source)](http://www.playboy.com/playground/view/playboy-interview-stephen-colbert?page=3):

&gt; The interesting thing about grief, I think, is that it is its own size. It is not the size of you. It is its own size. And grief comes to you. You know what I mean? I’ve always liked that phrase He was visited by grief, because that’s really what it is. Grief is its own thing. It’s not like it’s in me and I’m going to deal with it. It’s a thing, and you have to be okay with its presence. If you try to ignore it, it will be like a wolf at your door.

In the past I would always think of my self loathing as a symptom of something wrong with me. That is, I thought it was in me and I have to deal with it. And my repeated failures to deal with it just made me feel worse.

It's far more straightforward to want to attack the negative feelings I've held close for most my life. Get rid of the negativity.

It turns intelligent, kind people into zombies who can’t wash a dish or change their socks. It affects the ability to think clearly, to feel anything, to ascribe value to your children, your lifelong passions, your relative good fortune. It scoops out your normal healthy ability to cope with bad days and bad news, and replaces it with an unrecognizable sludge that finds no pleasure, no delight, no point in anything outside of bed. You alienate your friends because you can’t comport yourself socially, you risk your job because you can’t concentrate, you live in moderate squalor because you have no energy to stand up, let alone take out the garbage. You become pathetic and you know it. And you have no capacity to stop the downward plunge. You have no perspective, no emotional reserves, no faith that it will get better. So you feel guilty and ashamed of your inability to deal with life like a regular human, which exacerbates the depression and the isolation. If you’ve never been depressed, thank your lucky stars and back off the folks who take a pill so they can make eye contact with the grocery store cashier. No one on earth would choose the nightmare of depression over an averagely turbulent normal life. It’s not an incapacity to cope with day to day living in the modern world. It’s an incapacity to function. At all. If you and your loved ones have been spared, every blessing to you. If depression has taken root in you or your loved ones, every blessing to you, too. No one chooses it. No one deserves it. It runs in families, it ruins families. You cannot imagine what it takes to feign normalcy, to show up to work, to make a dentist appointment, to pay bills, to walk your dog, to return library books on time, to keep enough toilet paper on hand, when you are exerting most of your capacity on trying not to kill yourself. Depression is real. Just because you’ve never had it doesn’t make it imaginary. Compassion is also real. And a depressed person may cling desperately to it until they are out of the woods and they may remember your compassion for the rest of their lives as a force greater than their depression. Have a heart. Judge not lest ye be judged.”

Ten reasons why a zombie apocalypse would be awesome for depressed people:


1) You can shoot any zombie that ever told you pre-apocalypse to ""cheer up"" or ""get over it.""

2) Your feelings of isolation and being alone are even more valid. 

3) No more expensive psych meds - pillage all pharmacies.

4) Staying in bed four days in a row is a good idea and potentially life saving.

5) Fewer awkward social interactions. Possibly no social interactions.

6) Zombies far less judgmental than real people.

7) Forever alone doesn't feel like your fault anymore.

8) Fewer options and need to re-populate possibly means never alone again.

9) ""Normal"" survivors might finally experience clinical depression and understand.

Phrases like 'I missed Game of Thrones last night; I'm so depressed about it.' or 'I only got 68% on that test, I'm so depressed.'

I'm not going to try to describe the black depths of hopeless despair and nihilism a true depression-sufferer experiences - either during an episode or constantly, - but I think that if people knew what it felt like to be truly depressed, they would never use the word facetiously.

Sorry if I'm being pedantic, but I feel like it lessens the severity of the condition, certainly in the public eye; if you inadvertently or unknowingly equate depression to the slight sense of disappointment you feel when you miss a TV show, it completely undermines the severity of this pernicious, horrific illness.

EDIT: Wow, this post really has polarised opinions here. I've researched and thought about this some more, and yes, I cede to my opponents the point that 'depressed' can - in common parlance - mean to feel slightly upset. **My point here is that as someone who suffers from clinical depression, it annoys me that the same word used to describe this crippling and debilitating illness is also used flippantly by people to mean 'a bit disappointed'**, in the same way that it would annoy a poverty-stricken African to hear someone use the phrase 'I'm starving', when really they just fancy a hotdog.

I am a pretender.

There are a lot of us.

We go about our day the same way that you do. We go to work, school, the store, etc. We wave and smile at our neighbors, we water our plants, walk our dogs. But there is something different about us. It’s very delicate; it’s elusive and hard to put your finger on.
 
It’s a monster.

Pretenders blend into society seamlessly. Parents don’t know, friends don't know, lovers don’t know. I didn't even know what I was. Not until college. 

In college I realized that I wasn’t normal. Other students would go out on the weekends and get drunk but I preferred to stay in, alone, and watch Netflix. Even so, I still managed to make a few good friends. I found out later that they were also pretenders; no wonder we were drawn to each other.

Pretenders are hiding something deep inside them. There is a darkness that radiates. These people try hard to hide it, but there is no mistaking the dark mind of a pretender. 

When I realized that I had this darkness, I knew I had to do something about it. I went to a doctor, a therapist, a psychiatrist, but the darkness fought back. I would escape it, if only for a day, and then it would drag me back in.
 
I’m not really sure what this monster wants, it doesn’t appear to gain anything from the situation. It just isolates its victim and slowly kills it.  Like a parasite, it slowly leaches out life. 

It took me four years to kill my monster. First, I figured out what I was. After that, the long battle between me and my darkness began. Doctors gave me medication; I met with a therapist once a week. The darkness slowly faded away until eventually it was no longer in control. Occasionally it will try to take over again, but I know how to defeat it now.

I'm writing this as a warning. This monster can be killed, but first you have to find it.

Ask yourself, how many pretenders do you know? How many of my friends and family are being slowly killed?

Find them, and please, help them. The longer you wait, the stronger the darkness gets.

I never had a dad, he was the closest I've ever come.  I had a breakthrough a couple weeks ago with him, realized where most of my feelings of guilt came from.  The tears that rained down that day felt so cleansing.

Almost a year with him.  He gave me one hell of a discount to my financial situation and lack of insurance.  It made me feel bad that I was getting him for so cheap.  

One of the kindest men I've ever known.

During our last session we talked about how much we both admired Eminem's ""I don't give a fuck"" attitude.  He was a pretty hip guy for a 63 year old.  

He encouraged me to follow my passions, to not let all the internal nay saying and fear get the better of me, to cultivate a rebelliousness within me.  I hope I can do him proud.  

Feeling a little adrift right now, not sure what to do next.  More therapy?  Mourning period?  Remember every session with him and right down every scrap of wisdom I can remember before it washes away?  Yeah, definitely that last thing if nothing else.  

Starting to cry again.  The thing I need right now is...a hug.  Even if it's just an internet hug I'd appreciate it a lot.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiWRoMOeoLo


The dementors in the book and film were a metaphor for depression. They sucked the life out of you leaving you feeling as if you'd never feel happy again. Although everyone was affected by the feeling, some, like Harry, were more affected by it than others because of the horrors he had witnessed in his past. Some of his peers made fun of him, others worried, not understanding why he was greatly affected by the dementors.

He eventually seeks a way to repel the dementors, and his professor teaches him a special charm to do so. His professor tells him when conjuring the charm that he needs to focus on a happy memory, i.e. feeling happy. This never produces a strong charm though. Towards the end of the book/film, we see what *does* produce a strong charm against the dementors.

In the clip I posted, Harry had traveled back in time and is now watching his past-self being attacked by dementors. I feel like this scene touches on meditation or at least viewing yourself objectively. He's watching how the depression is affecting him from a detached state.

His past-self had thought someone else had produced the charm to save him, but then his present-self realizes that no one else was there to do that except himself. He runs out and produces his most powerful charm yet. Later on in the book and film, he mentions to his teacher that he produced his most powerful charm not by focusing on trying to feel happy, but by doing what was right, needed in the moment, and by believing in himself.

If you notice Harry's face in the clip when he produces the charm, he certainly doesn't look happy, but because of the actions he took, happiness eventually finds him. Your goal out of depression shouldn't be to feel happy, but to be happy. Being happy means doing what you know is right, doing what you need to do, and *being* optimistic even when you *feel* worried, etc.

""You know exactly what to do. Don't be afraid. Keep on walking.""

^(There are probably lots of things that could be filled in here, like eating chocolate after the dementors to make you feel better, which could be seen as appreciating the small things in life / stopping to smell the roses, and maybe I've mistaken some details, but I'm tired.)

^(Just want to also mention that it's impossible to feel happy all the time, which is why it shouldn't be your goal. You'll surely fail.)",,False,self,t5_2qqqf,1372053077.0,,,True,t3_1gyata,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gyata/harry_potter_and_depression/,

I spurned an Ivy League education thanks to my guilt of being smarter than you. You earned a full athletic scholarship to the family jock school a few years earlier and you still couldn't let me shine. I defended you when my boss called you a ""lesbian cunt"" behind your back. And you couldn't defend me when he yelled at me twice a week for two years regarding things that even *his boss* said didn't matter. And then you tell former colleagues that I was ""the family loser"".

You went on your first date on your 27th birthday; I seem to think your rotten personality was a factor. My best female friend since third grade was asked out by her now husband of 11 years/father of their three children. He is not a child molester just because he chose a 21 year old woman instead of choosing you. I encouraged him to get a lawyer, but he was the bigger person. You have no memory of me not making cucumber jokes when you were single, yet you managed to ask a dateless me at a family reunion ""is your hand tired?"". Your dichotomous behavior is inexcusable. You said I drove those four ex-girlfriends to cheat on me because I constantly disobey people, including you. An emotionally trampled man, emasculated by his environment, and defeated by cruel words hurled in his direction was the perfect victim for those succubi. I was a man unable to stand up for himself, for his dreams, nor for his self-worth.

Controlling people use ""trying to help"" as a mask for their real intentions. Mom and Dad frequently overcompensate by saying you are a great person. All those years of ""I'm ignoring you loser"" taught me that I was pathetic reaching out for conversation with an emotional vampire. All those times that you tattled indicated that a cool sister---or even an average sister---wouldn't do that, and that rebelling is sometimes beneficial. Your pouting when your ""advice"" is not taken shows your lack of maturity. If you get pissed when people don't take it, that's not advice; it's an order---at least in your eyes. I loathe three decades of facepalms because you are ""embarrassed to share blood"" with me. The silent treatment---on six separate occasions of at least six months, not to mention three years and running---has been magnificent for my self-esteem. You're finally done mistreating me.

**Middle Sister**
Thank you for always agreeing with whomever is in the room and for switching positions more times than Ray J and Kim Kardashian. It tells me you don't know what you think either. If I don't like your lack of loyalty, all I have to do is wait ten minutes.

**Youngest Sister**
A person winning the argument would let me speak instead of spending the last 25 years interrupting me. Those death stares when you're proven right about something mean that you're supposed to be able to admit it when you're wrong. I hate it so much that you had to pretend to be sick for 95 days in 7th grade because you were getting picked on at school. It serves you right for all those years (before then and since) of picking on the three of us. Mom and Dad used all their vacation days that year and they made trips to 17 baffled doctors because of your ""headaches"". A lie for a minute or a lie for a whole school year is **STILL** a lie. My music collection doesn't have enough female musicians so you should make a scene about it at Niagara Falls. You really hate me if you lambaste me for a peccadillo like that.

You shouldn't have lectured your one boyfriend in 33 years about the CORRECT way to make macaroni and cheese; he said that was the last of a thousand straws. All those years of calling me a loser, dork, moron, asshole, and retard taught me that love doesn't sound like that. It took him six years to stand up to you, significantly fewer years than it took me. No, I don't root for the family jock school, and if that bothers you, get a life. Fans (you and Oldest Sister especially) of that school really are horrible.

""Get over it"" during my wife's breast cancer at age 33, during each of my two layoffs, during my kidney issues, during each of my wife's two layoffs, during my wife's parents getting divorced after 27 years of marriage, and also during my broken wrist. ""Get over it"" is the worst three-word phrase in the English language and I will always hate it thanks to you. Your oil changes at the **BMW** dealership being *so expensive* demonstrate that you can't handle the slightest adversity. I loved the four separate occasions of the silent treatment for at least a year each, not to mention three years and running. You're finally done mistreating me.

**Dad**
Thank you for ""all Asian women are ugly, most n*ggers will rob you blind, and if you speak Spanish, you're here illegally"". I will never hate anyone based on looks. You have made it clear that all of your grandchildren must be baptized by their first birthdays. My wife and I are agnostics so good luck with that asshole. Your preferences in life have to be the same as those of your children----what a perfect example of how **NOT** to raise my kids.

Slapping my oldest sister and slapping my youngest sister were not the best courses of action. Neither is laughing at me when I struggle opening my wife's radiation medicine. I can't imagine you honestly believe that ""[Middle Sister and I] need to behave better but [Oldest Sister and Youngest Sister] misbehave **occasionally** because they are ""products of recessive genes"". Middle Sister did not deserve to be thrown against the bunk bed when she was 14 years old because she told you that you were being a jerk. All of us were thinking far worse words than ""jerk"", and she had whiplash for three weeks. Sometimes kids are right and parents are wrong. My high school coach (the closest thing I ever had to a father) is not a loser. He's the bigger person and refuses to stoop to your level. 

""[Your] opinions are facts and [my] opinions are opinions"". Well, then. You're a vicious cocksucker. How do you feel about that opinion? I hate you for all the eye-rolling and smirking that you and Oldest and Youngest do right in front of me. I see what you three are doing with those ""knowing glances"". Go fuck yourselves.

**Mom**
I am too sensitive huh? I betcha can't say that while Dad drinks a glass of water. Anything to yet again avoid the back of his hand. Thank you for the criticisms of everything from my dairy intake to having my identity stolen and the ensuing false arrest. You failed as a mother if you can't let me make my own decisions. So you do have a spine? Only when dealing with me, I guess. Yes, we all see that you have a perfect marriage, perfect kids, perfect career, perfect figure, perfect people pleaser personality, perfect education, perfect siblings, and perfect parents. Your life is a mansion built on sand, and my family therapist plans to bring it down a la Mel Gibson at the end of ""Lethal Weapon 2"". You don't have diplomatic immunity. Well, except for the stilts part in place of the sand; other than that---it's the same.

**Now the time has come. I get to live my life *MY WAY*, the way Sinatra would have wanted me to.**

**Me** (third of four, only boy)
I learned to accomplish epic shit just to spite all of you. I won a national title in a high school academic competition (against 1200 competitors). **SOME** people care about me and the rest belong out of my life. It cost me thousands of dollars in therapy to learn that sentence. Here it is again. **SOME** people care about me and the rest belong out of my life. 

I earned a statistics degree in four years while working forty hours a week. I busted my ass for an MBA a semester early while working 20 hours a week and driving 106 miles a day. I have a marriage of two people who adore each other; we are good friends, great lovers, and we've learned from dysfunctional backgrounds and that is very rewarding. Even if Dad did call her fat, despite that he is 5-11 and 280. 

My suicide attempt in 2001 was due to people who are worth less than any of the sleeping pills. I lost 100 pounds thanks to the reduced stress of missing the last seven Christmases. All that credit card debt represents the happiness I tried to have; guess who paid it off anyway with three jobs for three years? Me you fucking losers. I will become an actuary no matter what you people said to me. Yes, those exams are hard. Yes, there are nine of them, and yes, only 36% pass each one. I have passed the first four all on the first try. Suck this. Determination combined with intelligence easily conquers test makers much of the time.

Love is not critical, shaming, abusive, manipulative, controlling, demeaning, humiliating, separating, discounting, diminishing, belittling, negative, traumatic, nor painful.

Someone out there could be inspired by what I have done. He or she could overcome similar obstacles and have his or her life changed forever. I had nobody to help me until I met my wife. Now I am a beacon for a suffering soul drowning in the sea of negativity literally anywhere in the world. Your abuse has inspired me to write this post and to overcome everything in it. I am inspired to share and to enlighten, instead of being crushed by the injustice of your bitter rejections.

The ravine of insecurity, hostility, envy, sarcasm, and anger holds each of you hostage and love is the escape you choose not to use.

It's difficult. I actually learned the hard way. And when the relationship ultimately ended I was crushed. My depression is ""better"" now(I'm more numb than anything). I learned that I can survive anything mentally. Even having the one person I love leave me, being nearly broke for 2 months,  and her finding a new guy within a week of leaving me, leaving him, then her getting impregnated by another guy. It hurt. Made me feel worthless and like she only stayed because she felt I'd kill myself if she left. 

Telling someone that they're your reason for living puts a lot of pressure on them. It may force them to leave one day because the task of pleasing you with depression seems too daunting and a lost cause. They may not understand and never talk to you again. Could you live with yourself after that? I barely made it.

However,  this is just my story and it may work out for you. It's just tough on the other person. Very. 

Live for yourself and those you wish to influence and inspire with your knowledge and experiences. Just some advice. I dont want anyone to go through what I did.

[Three Things You May Not Get About the Aaron Swartz Case](http://www.popehat.com/2013/03/24/three-things-you-may-not-get-about-the-aaron-swartz-case/)

I plan on sharing this with family and friends that do not really understand what it means to suffer from clinical depression, to those who urge you to just snap out of it.

Click through to read the full article but here's a snippet:

&gt; Depression is not like sadness. Everyone has been sad. Everyone has been depressed on one occasion or another. But clinical depression is something else entirely.

&gt; What is it like?

&gt; Forgive me, but I'd like for you to imagine the worst day of your life. Maybe someone you love was killed in an accident. Maybe a loved one got a terrifying diagnosis. Maybe you abruptly lost a job you need to support your family. Maybe you caught your husband or wife cheating on you. Maybe you found out your son or daughter is addicted to drugs. Maybe you experienced some dreadful public humiliation.

&gt; Remember how that felt, at the worst part of that day? Now imagine you feel that way most of the time, for months at a time.

&gt; Think of the most stressed and worried you have ever been in your life, and then imagine that your stomach feels like that all the time.

&gt; Imagine that you are constantly gripped with overwhelming feelings of dread and crushing hopelessness — irrational, not governed by real risks or challenges, but still inexorable.

&gt; Imagine that you are often fatigued to the point of weakness and irritability because you can't get to sleep until late at night, or because your mind consistently shakes you awake at four in the morning, racing with worry about the day's activities as your stomach roils and knots.

&gt; Imagine that most social interactions become painful, the cause of nameless dread. Imagine that when the phone rings or your computer dings with a new email you get a short, hot, foul shot of adrenaline, sizzling in your fingertips and bitter in your mouth.

&gt; Imagine that, however much you understand the causes of these symptoms intellectually, no matter how well you know that you are fully capable of meeting the challenges you face and surviving them, no matter how well you grasp that these feelings are a symptom of a disease, you can't stop feeling this way.

&gt; Imagine that you have moments — maybe even minutes — where you forget how you feel, but those moments are almost worse, because when they end and you remember the feelings rush back in like a dark tide that much more painfully.

&gt; Imagine that you know you should talk to someone about how you feel — but you can't bring yourself to do so. Have you ever been so nauseated — from illness or from drinking — that you can't bear for someone to touch you or talk to you? Imagine feeling like that — that the human interactions that might ease the pain are too painful to endure, that every word on the subject is a blow.

&gt; After a while, this wears you down a bit.

Every day has been a struggle. My career has sputtered to a halt, I've nearly ended my marriage, it has been awful. I've relentlessly beaten myself up for things that happened more than 15 years ago. I can't overstate the daily terribleness I have suffered through. No drugs or counseling have helped. 

A week ago I got into bed feeling awful as usual. I rolled onto my back and for some reason put both hands palm down in the centre of my chest, one below the other. 

Unbelievably, the mental pressure faded. The knot in my gut that has been my constant companion unwound. I was shocked. There was a warm, flow-y sensation that was hard to describe. I didn't move, just basked in it, fell asleep feeling like I was five again and mommy was reading me a book. 

I have been sleeping this way for a week now. Everything has changed. I am functioning again. My wife has noticed the difference. I never thought I would feel happy again, and now I can honestly say that I have, and am. I haven't changed anything but my sleep posture, but my motivation is back. Positive feedback loop here I come.

Depression is like being in the deep end of a really big pool, and the deeper you go, the more depressed you are. When you feel sad, you're underwater, but you're near the surface, so reality is only slightly distorted and you can still see plenty of light. But the deeper you go, the less light there is, the darker it gets, the greater the pressure. Deep enough and there is no light left, only darkness, and the pressure is so great that it feels like it's going to crush you. You feel like you're suffocating, like you're going to die. The root cause of your depression is like a weight tied to you that pulls you down. Fix the root cause, cut the cord, and you start to float out of your depression.

Despite all of my efforts, language barrier and cultural difference finally has taken its toll to my mental health and I've never been so depressed all my life. Not to mention that I've developed a binge eating disorder. 
I used to be a productive and positive person, but for this past two months I would just sit around, do nothing, bingeing on junk foods, feel guilty and throw it all up. And then I would cry myself to sleep every single night.  

Yesterday I decided that I have to do something if I want to change for the better. I called my close friends, and told them about my problems. At first I was hesitant about telling anyone because I feel embarrassed about my eating disorder and being homesick, but to my surprise they're being supportive and not judgmental. That alone had helped me through and gave me the motivation to clean my apartment that I've been neglected while I was being depressed. Now that my room is clean, I feel happier!

A year ago, I was sitting in the middle of class and just up and decided I wanted to be dead, so I got on the next bus to the train station. A man saw me crying and sat next to me and asked me what was wrong, I told him what I was going to do because, well who gives a shit? He sat there and talked to me the whole bus ride and convinced me to stay with him until we got to the hospital (the bus route that goes to the train station also happened to go to the hospital as well) and he took me to the desk and told the administration women what I was planning to do. That was when I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and a week later I started on medication. 

I started on 30mg of Lovan, and have since moved up to 50mg of Mirtazapine (daily). It was not easy and there were many, many setbacks. After multiple breakdowns (me just going absolutely psychotic/trying to hurt myself) and 2 legitimate suicide attempts (as in, I planned them for days before) I was hospitalized for about a week and a half, held in a psych ward. I have been seeing a psychologist regularly for all of this time. 

I know I'm young and I understand that the battle is not yet completely over, but I feel proud in what I have accomplished in the last 12 months. I've gone from barely functioning to loving life and pulled up my grades in such a short time, and it is because of the hard work that **I** put in, as well as my huge support network. 

**edit** holy shit what is with the downvote parade in here? I appreciate every single one of these comments, yet many of them are in the negatives, for no apparent reason! I understand that reddiquette stresses to downvote comments that don't add anything to the discussion, but I think its a little bit different in a depression-related subreddit, where compassion and kind words are equally as important as thought-provoking discussion.

Just an observation.

I've seen a lot of posts where people talk about how much things suck for them and the comments are simply people one-upping the OP by saying 'Look, I have it worse.' This doesn't seem productive and it sure as hell isn't supportive. This subreddit, in my humble opinion, could be doing a lot more good than just being a slew of 'my life sucks' stories.

When I see a post with an inspirational quote or something happy, I think to myself, that's what is going to help people. That's gonna change someone's perspective. 

Again, this is just my observation. As someone who is facing depression currently I think what everyone needs is support. Chime in on some success stories. If you've been happy for one day out of the month, talk about it. Happiness and mental health is what we want, right?

First of all, I should probably say ""Happy Valentine's Day!"" although ""Barely Tolerable Holiday Where Your Relative Loneliness Has Never Seemed More Easily Apparent"" is a bit more accurate.

Second of all, I want all of you who are dreading this day, or are single, or who will see other couples today or who will mourn a past relationship today to STOP RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE AND PUT BOTH HANDS OVER YOUR HEAD.  NOW READ THE NEXT PARAGRAPH.

I was in a three year relationship with this girl who I had waited three more years of high school just to go out with.  I had to watch her date my best friend, change into another person, and then slyly play with my emotions.  And I let her, because I respected other people more than myself, even though I hated her and myself for it.  

This tumultuous relationship (of which we only dated for 5 measly months) ruined the relationships I had with everyone, including my parents and brothers.  I'm sure even my dog suffered, bless her Beagledor heart.

Three months ago I finally said goodbye to her for good.  I'm off of weed, cigarettes, and many other impulsive-addicting habits.  I'm on my way to Virginia Tech's Engineering school in a year and a half.

I'm not 'happy' or 'content', no, but I sure am my own man again.  If I hurt myself, it is because of my own personal negligence, not some whore's selfish manipulation.

I'm getting better everyday, even if I don't feel better.  But hey, just like mouthwash, the burn means it's working.

Okay, you can put your hands down now.  

Make today your day.  Spoil yourself with your own Love.  Hug yourself.  Masturbate.  Sing a love song to yourself (Lady Gaga's are always crowd favorites).  Go on a romantic walk.  Write yourself a Love Letter.  Let yourself know that you will never leave you, even in death.  You're in this together for life, depression be damned.

And if anyone can't stand it, I WILL BE YOUR VALENTINE.  Just PM me, and I'll write you poetry.  I'm not kidding.

I thought these were supposed to be the best years of my life? I'm not ugly, and I like to think I'm funny and friendly, so why don't people like me? I'm always alone. Always, always, always. I've spent my whole life in transition, and though I've made ""friends,"" I don't have anyone I can rely on.

I know it's stupid, but I want to be wanted. I want people to like me, to want me around, and to give a shit if I fall off the face of the earth. But they don't.

I have no money, so I can't do the only thing I really want to do: get away. I'd love to just hop on a train or a plane and just get the fuck away from here, but I wouldn't know where to begin. I don't even have enough gas to get out of the state.

My family loves me. I have a boyfriend who, though I can't see him often, loves me. What's wrong with me? I take 225mg of venlafaxine every day, why aren't I happy? Life leaves me with such a sour taste in my mouth. I feel like I'm out of things to look forward to. I'm two years into my college career, transferring schools for the fall semester, and changing my major to something I hardly care about.

I hardly care about anything. I don't want a job.  I don't want to work. I don't want to do anything, but I'm sick of doing nothing.

All I used to have was my writing, and I'd almost be thankful my depression is back so I can write again, but I'm too unmotivated to even crank out a poem. 

I'm sick of people liking everyone better than me. I'm sick of myself. I'm sick of not getting invited out. I'm sick of coming up with reasons not to eat or cut myself.  I can't let my family down by dying, but I'm letting myself down by staying alive.

I don't get what's so terrible about being alone. Society has made it so taboo to suffer. Where are all the other depressed kids? I'm sick of having the party scene shoved in my face. I don't have friends who want to hug me, I don't have people who want me at their parties. I just want some other depressed kids with no fucking friends to come over and sit with me and not feel the pressure to fill the silence.

I'm sick of the social ""trend"" of not having friends. Don't post a status saying ""omg have no friends"" or ""lol so depressed such a loner"" if you're on your way to a friend's house. I don't want your ironic hipster sadness shoved in my face when I'm barely staying alive every day.

Fuck, man.

I think I'm going to get rid of everything I don't want anymore. I'm going to go clean out my room and check back for messages here in an hour. I don't expect a response at all because this is just a cliche vent, but if you've made it this far, thanks.



******Edit:****** Holy shit, I was not expecting this big of a response. I love you all. This has been beyond amazing. So many people have said this is the first time they've ever been truly able to relate to something, and that just goes to show that we're all a little more similar than I thought.

I'm trying really hard to respond to everyone but it's taking forever to get through everything! Just know I appreciate and read every single comment and message and I am trying to get to everyone. 

To everyone feeling similar to me, stay strong, we can do this, and message me if you need anyone to talk to.
To all the advice-givers and comforting people, thank you. You have affected me more than you can ever know.

But you hold back because it isnt socially acceptable,,269,33,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/10gjlh/anyone_else_want_to_burst_out_crying_at/,"Just got asked by a coworker that got back from vacation, ""are you ok?"".  I just avoided eye contact, said 'yes' and kept working when I had to clear my mind out of fear of bursting into a manic depression sob episode.  

I've been very blue lately because stuck in England (from 'merica) working for 6 months and never really made friends or a hobby to do with people and coworkers all have SO so that is ruled out.  Whenever we have lab dinners or something it is the best part of my month.  7 more weeks (total 6 months) of trying not to fall into too big of a depression until I get to go back and have people to hang out with and  only maintain my mild depression.  

I never realized until this trip how much having a little social life outside of work keeps me from having almost 24/7 depression where I wake up in the morning with a headache from crying in my sleep.  I have 1 good friend and some nice friends whom Im mildly close with and that sustains me as I have some social anxiety and do not go out too much.  Just like to sit at home, play SCII,, watch cartoons, and drink a few liters of hard cider.  

Sorry for whining, I know some people on here have it worse but I feel for you and keep on keepin' on, even though I am not sure how much it really matters.  

Cheers!

The reason behind the rule change is explained in depth [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1cep2h/psa_whats_wrong_with_posting_a_general_people/) but the basic reasoning below. 


A message that in any way tries to tell or show the suicidal (or depressed) person that “it’s not so bad” is just another way of saying “I don't understand what you’re going through”. People suffering from depression often have trouble with feeling detached or alienated, and these sorts of posts can often serve to only increase those feelings. 

It is at the request of many members of this community that we have instituted this rule change here as well as on /r/suicidewatch. If you want to make a post but are not sure if it will violate this new rule, *ask* and we will happily take a look for you.

A few years back a colleague and I were involved in developing the British Columbia Depression Strategy. 

As a part of that project, we realized that 80% of people diagnosed with depression were seen only by their GP, but all of the effort on enhancing service was going to mental health specialists.

We wanted GPs to have something other than their prescription pad to offer, so we developed the Antidepressant Skills Workbook, a self-care manual in pdf format that GPs and others could hand out to people who might benefit from it. 

It’s not therapy, and it’s not support, and it’s not detailed enough to suit the complexity of some people’s issues. But it’s something. And there are versions in English, French, Punjabi, and Chinese. There’s also a special edition called Dealing With Depression for teens, and a manual on Antidepressant Skills at Work.

Since we developed these (I was the junior guy on that project; Dr Dan Bilsker was the lead), tens of thousands of people from all over the world have downloaded the manuals, and hundreds of doctors hand them out as a regular part of their work.

You can access all of them free here:
http://www.changeways.com/resources/aboutdepression/scdp/scdp.html

This is a page on my own website, which has links to the download sites of all of the various versions of the manual. 

I've also got an online course on diaphragmatic breathing for stress reduction. That one costs $15, but there's a 100% discount for redditors (just use the Coupon Code ""breathingreddit"" and you get it for nothing). There's also a sample video you can look at without any signin. Here's the link for that:

Are Antidepressants just “happy pills?”
No matter what their exact mode of action may be, it is clear that antidepressants are not “happy pills.” There is no street-market in antidepressants, for unlike “speed” which will improve the mood of almost everybody, antidepressants only improve the mood of depressed people. Also unlike the almost instant effects of speed, the mood-improving effects of antidepressants develop slowly over a number of weeks. “Speed” induces a highly artificial state, antidepressants cause the brain to slowly increase its production of naturally occurring neurotransmitters.

She asked, ""What would you like to speak about today?"" and after hesitating for a couple seconds, teary eyed, I said, ""I want to get screened for depression.""

Then I told her why, what symptoms I had been feeling and for how long. Then she asked me some questions about my life and why I feel this way. I said that there was nothing really in my life these days that could be a cause for these feelings, and I didn't know why I had them. Then we started to talk about my past. And that's when the waterworks really started to flow.

She said that because I never talk to anyone about how bad things have made me feel, they are dragging me down and affecting me even when I don't think they are. ""Repression leads to depression,"" she said. And I think it's true, at least in my case. I've been through a lot of bad things in my past and never expressed how it made me feel. I never considered the value of talking about bad things, it's so hard for me to do so I just bottle it all up.

Her advice was to find a counsellor in the new town I'm moving to at the end of the month and talk about some of these issues. And to start exercising because it will help release endorphins. She said to treat exercise as medicine, which I think makes perfect sense. 

So, to anyone else struggling with similar issues, find someone to talk to! I think it's really going to help. Even after just a half hour of discussing my past I feel like this is the right way to go.

My mother wouldn't let them touch my college funds.  She fought for me every step of the way, and I am so incredibly grateful that she did.

I struggled with depression, an eating disorder, and self-harm, amongst other self-destructive tendencies throughout my four years of college, but I made it.  I fucking made it and it was the best feeling ever to walk across that stage in my cap and gown with my little gold sash. 

For those of you out there currently grappling with self-doubt...don't underestimate yourself.  If you have the strength to keep on keepin' on while dealing with depression, you have the strength to one day heal, rise above it and live a life that is joyous and colorful.

I'm also very tempted to find out the name and address of that counselor and send a copy of my graduation pic, my transcript, and perhaps a picture of my middle finger.

Thanks for reading.  Love to you all in /r/depression &lt;3  I believe in you.

**Edit:**  I should clarify that I am not in fact going to send the counselor a ""fuck you.""  I was being a bit sarcastic.  And that was not a school counselor or even my counselor.  It was a court appointed counselor to help my parents solve disputes (they were divorced and not getting along at that point).  I don't think the counselor had even met me.  And my mom didn't even tell me what was said until about a year ago.  I just think it goes to show we can't write off ""troubled teens"" or individuals that struggle mentally/emotionally more than others.  The labels don't define us, and they certainly speak nothing of our true capabilities.  If anything, my struggles have made me a much stronger and wiser woman for them.  I wouldn't do it any differently even if I could.

It would be tragic, but it happens, and in a while no one would care anymore and eventually it would get to a point where, if anyone ever thinks of me it would be about my suicide.

Please don't downvote me.,Supora,269,59,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/qojmw/hi_please_dont_downvote_me/,"It's my birthday today...well it will be for the next twenty minutes...and the only thing I've done today is see my psychologist. None of my friends remembered it was my birthday. I know that's not something to be depressed over...I know. But I've been making a big deal out of it being my twenty-first and I would have hoped at least one of them wanted to show me they had thought of me. 

For a lot of people, their twenty-first birthday is really special and they go out and have their first legal drink with friends. But I'm at home, watching MST3K...and like every year, I've wasted my birthday. 

Last year I spent it in a hotel room, alone, after being kicked out of my apartment because the guy who I was living with had a crazy girlfriend who hated me because I wouldn't do everything she ordered me to do told him to kick me out or she would take his kids away.

The year before, I had no friends at all and spent it in my dorm room, listening to my neighbors party in their rooms with their friends.

I just wish I had a better personality so people weren't so turned off by me. I try so hard to be a good friend. But it's not enough if you're boring and, well, pretty dumb. 

What's more, I took one of my midterms yesterday and failed...again. After hours upon hours of hard work studying, I still failed. Everyone on the class's facebook page posted their wonderful grades and one guy even said that if you didn't pass, you should just drop the class, because you must be some sort of idiot.

Thanks for pointing it out, guy. It's not like I already didn't feel horrible.

I don't know what's wrong with me, and I doubt anything will come of this post. But I just wanted to get it in writing.

I know one of these days I'm going to take my life. I've accepted it. I know one of these days I'm going to cut myself again, and my boyfriend is going to leave me. It's pretty inevitable. 

It's clear I'm not smart enough to make it through college, and I don't have enough talent to make it in the career I want. I don't even have any work experience, so it's not like I could get a job at Wal Mart or anything.

I wish this would end.
I wish this would end.
I want it to be over.
Something.
Either my life, or how I feel.
Either one.
I wish there was a god, so I could beg it to take my life.
Or ask it to help me feel better, at least.

My head hurts from crying so much, and I woke up with my face all swollen and my eyes red and puffy from crying the day before. 

Make it stop.

The loneliness is unbearable. I am a loser. But what else is new?


I tried to get someone to talk to me today, on the internet. I posted on someone's ""cake day"" post, and I said it was my birthday as well. But all I got was downvoted.

How do they know I am so worthless? How is it that obvious? Can they tell just by looking at my username? All I said was that it was my birthday, too. 

I just want to stop hurting so much. Why do I have to have a sick brain? At least I could just be a not depressed loser. Maybe think I'm awesome, even though I'm not. At least I would be happy.

Things haven't been going well for me. I've been feeling second best to everybody, I'm not all that important to anyone. It hurts, knowing that if you up and left you wouldn't be missed at all.

He seemed so sad, like he wanted help, but he was too scared to take it. So I stopped and picked him up. He curled in his shell, not knowing I was there to help and not hurt him. I laid him gently on the grass, and drove off.

I've been thinking of that turtle since then. If I really had drove off and killed myself, somebody might have run over the poor guy. But I didn't. I was there to save that poor turtle.

I slammed the door behind me. I threw my bag to the ground and myself along with it. I learned against the wall and held my face in my hands. 

“Hi there.” A voice said. I looked up, and there he was, sitting cross-legged on my living room couch. 

“Did you miss me?” He smirked and took a breath through his cigarette. 

I didn’t say anything. I didn’t want this to happen. Not here. Not now.

“Oh, so now you’re ignoring me!” He yelled. He stood up and walked right in front of me. I stood too, and looked up at him. He seemed so much taller from last time. 

He blew smoke in my face. I coughed and turned towards the door, ready to leave.

He laughed. He was already blocking the door.

“What are you gonna do, run?”

“Get out.” I said, pretending to be bigger than I was.

The expression on his face changed from playful malice to anger. 

“What did you say?” He dropped his cigarette and put it out with his shoe. I noticed the gun in his hand as he walked towards me, practically pushing me up against the wall. 

“I don’t take orders from you,” He whispered. He held the gun to my head. “Kill yourself.”

I closed my eyes and I suddenly became very aware of my breathing. I kept waiting for the gunshot to go off, but the room stayed silent.

I opened my eyes and felt myself holding a gun to my head. He was gone.

But really, he’s never gone. He is me.

1352670247.0,210,self.depression,1310ac,I'm living proof that you can outlast depression.  my story.,uberwolf0,255,45,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1310ac/im_living_proof_that_you_can_outlast_depression/,"I grew up in an abusive home.  I suffered mental, physical, and even sexual abuse at the hands of my caretakers and family.  The mental abuse was daily, the physical abuse every few days, and fortunately the sexual abuse was only once.

I was neglected.  I was fed wrong on purpose.  I was taught improper hygiene techniques and diet.  By the time I left that house at the age of 18 I weighed 400 pounds.  

I spent the entirety of my adult life in recovery.  I suffered from deep, deep depression.  I couldn't hold down a 9-5 job.  I would sometimes go completely in the dark.  I tried to attend college and flunked out.  I tried to work but couldnt hold down a job.  I simply could not function.  I put myself to work doing web design when the internet was new.  I couldnt keep clients.  I eventually had to find other more shameful ways to make ends meet, but I survived.  On less than 6 grand a year, but I survived.

I built myself a support structure of friends who could help catch me when I fell.  When I did finally bottom out I lost the small business I'd created.  I put on another 100 pounds getting almost to 600 pounds.  I tried to eat myself to death.  I contemplated suicide every day, telling myself to try 1 more day each time.  What actually kept me alive?  Fear of death.  fear of the unknown.  fear that whatever was on the other side would be worse than this.

Eventually I went into therapy with genuine intentions to try.  We tried every drug we could find.  This was back when prozac was about the only thing and just small variants of that.  Most made me feel dead inside.  Some made it worse.  Nothing made it feel better.  

I tried losing the weight.  I couldnt find the motivation.  I ate myself into a prison of fat to match the prison in my mind.

Eventually we did find a drug that worked.  For me it was Effexor.  It gave me almost constant vertigo but for the first time in my life I felt like getting out of bed.  I felt like trying.  I felt like fighting.  I felt like I had the energy.

With that drug in my veins for the next 4 years I was able to slowly but surely grasp some of the tools I needed to start working around my depression.  I almost typed ""beat"" it but you never beat it, I guess.  But I learned to make ROOM for it.

I tried losing weight.  I failed.  I tried getting a job.  I failed.  I tried dating.  I failed.  I tried getting past all that trauma.  I failed.  For years and years I fell flat on my face.

but something gave way about 3 years ago.  I don't know what it was.  Maybe it was the death of my mother, and the closure that brought.  Maybe it was meeting a girl who loved me even though she knew how broken I was.  Maybe it was just I started to finally get a foothold.

Whatever it is, these days I'm losing weight.  I'm working steadily.  I'm maintaining relationships and friendships.  I suffer from depression still, i know its there... but it rarely comes to the forefront any more.  When it does I'm able to work around it and it only sticks around for a day or two at a time.  My worst case has been for about a week straight about a year ago.

I still have a lot of work to do to get my life together, as we all do.  But I'm finally able to work WITH the depression, rather than it holding me down.

Its hard.  I don't know if I'll ever feel like other people do.  But I do know that this is my life, and as shitty as it can be, I'm going to take advantage of it while I have it.

So what I'm saying is this.
Please stay here.  You'll die one day anyways, so why not stick this out and see what you can achieve?
Fight dammit.  Fight for what you want.  If the depression has you to a point to where you don't want anything, learn to want again.  All I wanted for a very long time was to die, but I tried to find other goals.  I've achieved them and yes while sometimes it feels empty, it also feels good as well.

Been reading a lot of posts, and I have to say one of the things that helped me a lot is a change in language.
It was so subtle I didn't realize I did it until I started discussing coping strategies. 

Here it is. It may seem obvious. 

""I am"" is the most powerful phrase in our brain. 

I read it a lot, and I used to use it a lot myself. ""I am depressed. I am miserable. I am unhappy.""

I don't like it. I don't like it because it makes what ever you say an irrefutable fact, incontestable, and without rebuke. 

So I would ask every person who can to try and use ""I feel"". 

When I started doing this, I slowly began to be more mindful that feelings can change, behaviors can change, and very few things are set in stone. 
""I feel depressed. I feel like an asshole. I feel miserable."" These are things that can be changed, they are now symptoms of a problem that can be fixed/mitigated. 

I say this every time I message or post - this isn't a cure. It's a skill that will help with coping.

AMA ,patientnumbertwo,238,38,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/17n9hh/iama_person_who_underwent_a_full_6week_treatment/,"Wow, I really dropped the ball on keeping /r/depression updated.  For some background, please check out my previous posts for my [initial treatment](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/y2gi5/iama_person_who_has_just_started_transcranial/), [my first week](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/yfwdg/i_just_completed_my_first_week_of_transcranial/), and [my second week](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/yqokx/i_just_completed_my_second_week_of_transcranial/).

What can I say?  It worked!  The depressive thought patterns and subsequent behaviors have diminished **significantly**.  I have been asked to describe it to professionals and laymen alike, and the best way that I can describe it is this:

Having depression is like owning a very large, powerful dog.  Have you ever taken a large dog for a walk?  It's more like it walks *you*.  Anything that catches the attention of the dog causes you to get dragged along with it.  Bad memories and negative thoughts pop up in the your brain like rabbits and squirrels, and your dog (depression) goes chasing after them.  It tries to take you where it wants to go, and most days you just don't have the strength to keep from letting it happen. 

Most people don't have that strength.  But most people have normal sized dogs.  You have a normal-sized amount of strength with a very large dog.  The size of the dog and not being able to control it isn't your fault.

Not having depression means that YOU walk the dog.  It's still there.  Your bad memories and dark thoughts don't disappear.  They just don't crowd out all the other thoughts that occupy your head.  And when they go too far, you just yank the leash and say ""No, we're not going there today.""  

Let me also say that not having depression is not a cartoon anti-depressant commercial.  The sun doesn't smile down on you, and the world isn't bathed in bright colors.  Everything is not a hollywood triumph with an Explosions in the Sky soundtrack to mark every achievement.  It's being able to more objectively assess your life and the truth about it.  And the ""truth"" is a set of emerging frameworks of belief that can be judged, kept, or discarded based on how usefully they serve you in living life in a way that makes you happy.  Depression trips that up.  Depression sucks.  And depression is not your fault.

But I made myself get up, put on the lights... I stayed in bed for an hour just relaxing.

I finally got up, and

Put food on for dinner tonight,

Got an orange and a banana and a cup of tea for breakfast,

Did a short yoga routine,

Was offered some work (limited).

I can't believe yesterday was as tumultuous as it was, and yet today has begun so well. I'm really proud of myself.


**EDIT:** Wow. I cannot believe the incredibly positive response to what is such a simple thing - you all recognize how much it actually means to me, but I don't know if you realize how much your support means to me
 &lt;3
 *I'll tell you the second half of the day*:

Was *officially* offered two independent contractor contracts, to work remotely, i.e. at home: this is fantastic because I will have the time to get a handle on my social anxiety and fears about going outside sometimes,

Ate some delicious barbeque chicken pizza leftovers for lunch, and took my vitamins and probiotics for the day,

Took a nap! And didn't feel guilty at all,

Spent some time responding to an email thread with another person whom I met a couple years ago, with a similar kind of depression, and I gave a random call to a week ago (reaching out),

Spent time on reddit, particularly laughing so much at [pedophilophiles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-1bhZ8Ho00) and even more at [horrible valentine's gifts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=a4VVrl3Cqio#!) from the front page - the latter made me super happy to be single,

Watched Ferris Bueller, and while doing that,

Made dinner for a friend and I, huge delicious pork chops covered in a mix of flour, garlic salt, paprika, and brown sugar, cooked in about three tbsp of butter, with steamed vegetables and a beet-feta salad,

Spooned with friend (ok, ok, ex) for about an hour, just zoning with Gentlemen Prefer Blondes playing.

And now I'm going to drink a chocolate frap, get washed, read some Song of Ice and Fire, nighttime yoga routine (oh my gosh I'm becoming such a Tara Stiles fan, she chills me out so much), and sleep.

Thank you all *so* much, I love you guys. /r/depression FTW

DISCLAIMER: Meds and Therapy can and do work for many people, the purpose of this post is an in addition to, or holistic approach. 

ANOTHER DISCLAIMER: try and limit how many of these you take on at once. A few small successes is better than one grand attempt and one grand failure. moreover, if you miss a day of journaling or eating right let it go, it helps when you don't track your days.  


It is not easy, and these steps will only help if you decide that you are sick and tired of being sick and tired. 

1. Write by hand a journal. Don't hold back on this thing, and don't judge anything that goes into it. No matter how much you think it sucks or whatever. Make it  your space. Seeing thoughts on paper helps to take them out of your head and gets you primed to challenge them if you want. 

2. Meditate: just search beginners guided mediation, and try and do 5-10 minutes a day, it helps.

3. Get out of the house, away from screens. Go outside feel the fresh air, and go for a walk or a bike ride. 

4. Temporarily lay off the news: it is depressing, I try to avoid it, when you feel better you can go back to skimming the headlines.

5. Stop drinking booze, and lay off the caffeine. They both lower the essential brain chemicals. 

6. Read ""The gifts of imperfection""- It is a different kind of self help book, it focuses on teaching critical thinking instead of stupid anagrams or positive messages. 

7. Learn to critically think about life and start critically analyzing your negative and positive outlooks on life. Take them apart see how they work, and write the results down, and compare what you perceive vs. what is.  

8. Realize that you are fighting a very hard battle, and as such treat yourself with kindness. If you dont do all of these in a day so what? Relax

9. Make the choice to live life even with depression. Its the same for Bipolar, OCD, and anxiety. You have to force yourself to go do things, and to get out and live, otherwise you wont get better. 


10. If you cant sleep try putting on www.Soothetube.com, Any of the videos especially the girls just whisk me right to sleep. [edit 2]:

11. exercise: Try and do it 2-3 times a week for at least 20 minutes, do things you like that exert activity. [edit 3]

12. Create something, Playing_Hookie, sugested you cook, no pressure, low cost of entry and fun, and freaking tasty. [edit 4]

13. Take Vitamins,  ann_louise , reminded me of this, make sure you are getting enough vitamin D, all the B's, and  flax or fish oil ect. [Edit 5]

14. Related, examine what your eating. Try changing it. Try taking yourself off of the most common allergens and see if that helps. 

15. From,  ricolascream, Shave, shower, and groom yourself regularly. There is something so tribal and ritualistic about cleaning ourselves. It is a powerful force, I don't know how to explain it. Spend the money and get yourself a nice comfortable outfit, and change into it instead of staying in your Pjs. It really helps. 

16. As Boring as it sounds a routine is wonderful. 

17. Try different sleep rhythms but try and get 6-8 hours no matter what. If your a night owl try getting up early for once, and if your an early bird sleep in. you might be out of your natural sleep cycle. 

18. Treat Depression like addiction. The day before doesn't count. Anything you do the day before that is negative  is negated at the end of the day meaning you start fresh every day. 

19. Accept that there are good days and bad days. They are both part of life. Try no to dwell on them but let the bad days and bad feelings happen. Don't try and fix them just let them be felt and then let them pass. The same with the good feelings, don't try and make them last just enjoy the moment. 

Hope this helps.

(TRIGGER WARNING),Misureth,212,31,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jyokh/what_does_it_feel_like_trigger_warning/,"Something I struggle with all the time is trying to convey how it feels to be in a depressive episode to people who have never experienced it. Below is my latest attempt. Apologies for the length  (MAJOR TRIGGER WARNING).

*

It starts with something simple; maybe a rejection, or a social faux pas, or a harsh word from someone. Whatever it is, it plants a seed of self doubt in your mind that won't go away. This leads to a consistent feeling of self hatred, the feeling that you are somehow unfit or that everyone would be better off if you weren't around to embarrass or annoy them; you begin to isolate yourself because of this.

The longer this isolation goes on, the more persistent the feelings of inadequacy become. It becomes harder and harder to shake the perception of yourself as an essentially worthless person. Outwardly you maintain a persona, smiling, laughing, socialising, but on the inside you feel like you are slowly being ripped apart.

If you're like me, you feel very strongly that you cannot share these feelings with anyone; perhaps you are afraid that they will confirm your worst fears about yourself, or they will belittle your problems. Perhaps like me, you're afraid of being stigmatised as a basket case, or having your masculinity questioned because you're a man who talks about his feelings. In any case, instead of seeking help you bottle your feelings up.

Slowly and painfully, you begin to disintegrate on the inside. You push friends and family away, believing yourself to be unworthy of them or not wanting to worry them. You lose interest in things that you once loved, able only to procrastinate and wile away your time abusing substances. You neglect your physical health, hygiene and work commitments; concepts like hours, days and weeks become meaningless as your life blurs into a meaningless sludge alternating between when it is light and when it is dark outside. Your brain seems to be fogged constantly, similar to the aftermath of a heavy night out, and thanks to your inability to have proper sleep you are constantly exhausted.

Eventually you hit rock bottom; you sleep and eat far too little or far too much, and things such as dressing yourself or brushing your teeth become not only monumental challenges but seemingly pointless. The only thing that stops you from ending it is your fear of the act, your guilt over the consequences and your complete lack of drive or energy. You have forgotten what it feels like to experience love, joy, excitement; all that persists is the exhaustion, the anxiety, the embarrassment. 

At this point you no longer experience what it means to be human; you are a husk, a body robotically carrying out meaningless tasks. That is what depression feels like.

 It didn't actually take much effort and kept my mind off the ""boeee, I suck"" thoughts.

A friend came along, someone who I had fancied but was now feeling pretty neutral about it. While I bought her drinks because she claimed to be broke she said horrible things behind my back. Things that have kept me awake at night. Things that just reaffirm the negative thoughts in my head.

I have a pattern of this kind of behaviour too. I used to let kids practically beat the fuck out of me during lunch at school in order to feel some sense of belonging. I have never felt like I've belonged anywhere, or with anyone. The only person I've had sex with described it as ""doing a bro a favour"" and still says ""I love you"" to me despite literally never talking to me unless she needs something.

I'm aware having a relationship won't make me better. I just hope it will at least alleviate the physically painful loneliness I experience every waking moment. Even if I just feel distracted for a few moments a day by being with someone maybe I'll feel better about myself. Maybe a person who says nice things about me will give me enough confidence to do something that doesn't involve drinking, using the internet or a combination of the above.

At best maybe I'll stop feeling pain and having suicidal thoughts nearly every waking moment and become a more confident person. At worse, a cuddle session will feel good for a while. Why can't I just that? A good feeling for a little while? It's not like I'm asking for loads of money, a jet ski or something stupid; I'm just asking for basic human contact.

I've dealt with depression for about 15 years, though it didn't really start kicking my ass and ruining my life consistently until a few years back, in my early 20's.

In late 2009, I started seeking help.  I found a good psychologist.  He was insightful and amiable, but after a dozen sessions I concluded (and he concurred) that there weren't any terrible deep-seated issues, or even physical problems, causing my depression.  Life *should have* been good, but it sucked and wasn't getting better.  Based on a lifetime of melancholy, introversion, and self-hate, I figured I should see a psychiatrist and give medication a shot.

It took about 6 months and 4 different medications until something made life better.  Citalopram, your typical SSRI, was the first thing I tried.  I felt spaced-out, kind of trippy, and couldn't feel any sexual pleasure.  Then came Depakote.  Fuck that garbage, I felt heavily sedated all the time.  Abilify seemed to help, but not that much, and I might just have felt better because I wasn't on any of those other awful meds any more.

One fateful day, after hearing so much from fellow college students about the wonder of Adderall, I tried one that I bought from a friend.  My depression was instantly karate kicked to the face, and replaced with a wonderful (and slightly scary) mania.

After talking with my doc, I was put on Wellbutrin, which is an anti-depressant with properties akin to stimulants (like Adderall and Ritalin, but long-acting and less likely to result in abuse/dependency.  I would later take a combination of Ritalin and Wellbutrin).   Life changed 180 degrees in about 2 or 3 days.  *This is how most people feel!  This is how people can just be happy most of the time, instead of one or two days a year!*

There were some side effects and some lifestyle changes (like quitting drinking) that needed to be done.  I made the mistake of stopping the medication instead of adjusting the dosage, and that cost me an amazing girlfriend.  But overall, the next year and half were the best of my life, hands down.

**Why I came to r/depression:**
One fateful day, I nearly fainted while working out on a hot summer day.  I told my doctor, who freaked out and insisted I had had a seizure (a possible side effect of Wellbutrin).  She pulled me off the medication *cold turkey*.  I had to submit to a bunch of tests like EEG's and CT scans for something that was almost certainly NOT a seizure.  It would eventually take me almost a year to get put back on my medication. 

My life, which had been going so wonderfully, was ruined within a few days.  I had gone back to school and just finished my bachelor's degree.  My GPA during my first attempt at college was a 2.5.  The second time around, it was a 3.8 .  I had wonderful friends that I loved, who respected me.  I was dating an extraordinary woman.  I was applying to a number of cool teaching jobs.  Basically, I was finally living up to my potential.

Over the next year or so, I lived inside my own mind.  Physically, I rented a small bedroom and shut the curtains tightly, sleeping 14-16 hours a day.  I rarely showered or left the house.  Started smoking cigarettes.  Bought drugs off the internet or abused over-the-counter products to try and replace my former medication.  **When you are huffing epinephrine or vicks inhalers to get enough energy to go to the grocery store, you know your life sucks.**

It was at this time that I discovered reddit, and soon r/depression, r/drugs, and a few other subs.  In between swapping stories, bitching about life, sharing support, and all that stuff, I learned a LOT.  About how bad the American medical establishment is with mental health.  How fucking hard it is to afford treatment/drugs.  How hypocritical some of our drug laws are.  I learned about neuroscience, chemistry, biology, and philosophy.  I have folders upon folders of medical texts, journals, drug trials, and more.  I once went to my former school's medical library and sat down to read an entire book on amphetamine tolerance.

**Where I'm at now:**
Life is OK these days.  As long as I can get my medication, I'm pretty decent.  But I feel like the sudden withdrawal from Wellbutrin/Ritalin and the subsequent months-long abstinence from it has damaged my mind and body.  I randomly have weird problems with blood pressure or tremors.  I still smoke.  I don't exercise nearly as much, and it's starting to show.

But most of all, I am not the man I was 2 years ago.  The man I was raised to be.  I'm a shadow of him.  I'll get by, but I won't change the world.  I'll sit back and watch, like everyone else, as this rotten system collapses under its own weight.

I'm done experimenting with drug regimens and treatments and all that.  This is who I am, and it's probably not going to change anytime soon.

So, in summary, or **TL;DR**, goodbye r/depression.  You saw me through the worst of things.  The good news is that things are better; the bad news is that they are just OK. Thanks to those of you who take the time and energy to help others.

I'd also leave you with a warning.  I've seen many posts in recent days like ""I took a shower today"", and people respond with ""you are a hero!"".  Sometimes people need a pat on the back, but sometimes they need to be challenged.  Sometimes things need to get worse before they can get better.  And what almost *everyone* could benefit from is by getting better educated about what the everloving fuck is going on inside your brain.  There are really terrible doctors out there handing out drugs willy nilly.  If I hadn't taken my care into my own hands I'd probably have killed myself years ago.

Educate yourself, and fight for what you need or want.  Don't be pushed around by a broken system or be smothered by well-meaning but misguided people.  Don't let people tell you ""no I can't prescribe you that"", or ""you don't understand how XYZ works.""  Fucking no one on this planet knows how 99% of your brain and your mind work, and you are the one that has to live with that mind.  Do keep an open mind, because some doctors DO know best... but figuring out which ones do is a tough job.  The ones that communicate with you and admit they don't have all the answers, and work *with* you are usually the best.  Think of a psychiatrist/psychologist as a consultant.  (Who, for better or worse, has the key to the medicine cabinet.)

Finally, when you have to feel sorry for yourself, do it and get it over with.  Whether that's a minute, an hour, a day, or a week.  But then go back to the fight until you get a satisfactory outcome.

This is something that is very hard for me to take to heart. I do not believe that I am a bad human, or even a bad person. As I learn more about my illness, as I learn that I am not fully in control, I do not feel relief.

Social Anxious and Generally Anxious since birth.

Depressed since 16.

Seeing a psychologist and taking anti-depressants at 19.

Drop out of uni at 20, get fired from job at 20.

Wake up on my 21st birthday, I have no friends, my mother has asked me to move out, I have no job and no future. This was 4 months ago. I spent my 21st birthday playing League of Legends in my room alone, clothes packed in the corner.

Shortly after I got rejected by a girl, it was actually really silly when I think about it now, I was so clingy and so desperate for a saviour, but took it really hard too. It got to the point where I could no longer avoid my pain with video games. It was the last straw and said fuck it, I'm doing something about my life.

Since then I've said yes to almost every opportunity that has come my way and holy fucking shit, the word yes is extremely powerful. 

Since that change of attitude I'm now training in martial arts 5 times a week, I've got money in my bank account, I've got a reasonable size of friends, I've experienced more in a few months than I have in the 6 years of depression and I'm living in a completely new city, hundreds of kilometres away from my parents and family and my future is looking bright.

Depression isn't a choice and you are fighting yourself. Fight yourself, it's worth it, if the depression says no you say yes.

""I don't want to get up today"" - get up

""I don't want to go out to that party"" - go out

""I don't want to go to the gym"" - go to the gym.

Once you hate yourself, this is surprisingly easy to do.

Oh and if you're depressed and you haven't seen a psychologist or doctor, do, they will change your life. If they don't find a new one, not all are good, but there are good ones.

The first step is the hardest, took me two years to make it.

The receptionist recognised I needed help and made sure I saw a doctor within 30 minutes. He listened, I didn't feel rushed, he gave me an immediate referral to a hospital 2 miles away. I got the bus. After  presenting the referral I was seen by a doctor (i think)  within an hour and passed to the next one who has decided to admit me immediately. Since then I've been sat here waiting for them to find a bed for me.
It was reading previous posts here ( which I discovered by accident) that convinced me I wasn't a useless piece of shit, I was unwell and needed help. So thanks reddit . I don't know what's going to happen next or even if I get to keep the phone but if I can I'll keep you updated. Please excuse any mistakes. I'm typing on the phone and my hands are shaking like a bastard.
Edit: A few hours waiting while they find me a bed  and now I'm being escorted to a psychiatric hospital in a taxi, bit scared and nervous but kind of relieved I've finally done something to help myself. Shit, I hope this goes okay.  
Edit: I've arrived, waiting to be let in. It's big and set in nice grounds,Its almost midnight here so I don't know how much longer I'll be able to post or even if I'll be able to post once I'm on the ward. When I çan I will, hopefully tommorow. To anyone else suffering I hope you have a peaceful night. And you know what? I think maybe there is hope.
Edit: I'm in, it's the following morning, I can keep my phone but no charger (have to ask a member of staff to charge it in the office). Well, I've been assessed (again) same questions but but broader than the more specific ones of earlier, given a brief introduction to the ward and had my property searched. 
This is where reality starts to kick in, they take all my chargers, electric shavers, laptop, aerosols, lighters and a tin of petrol. (I persuaded the taxi driver who brought me here to stop off and let me grab a bag of stuff from where I've been staying, the petrol is Zippo fuel) I start to realize although I'm here voluntarily I am about to be locked up and I can't leave when I want.
My single room's ok, and the night was fairly quiet but I'm under constant observation and having someone turn on your room light every 15 mins is not the way to treat someone suffering from sleep deprivation.
Edit: I've just read some of the comments, too emotional to reply atm. Thank you all so much.
Edit: Saff I've met so far seem nice enough, in a steptford wives sort of way and despite all the rules and restrictions I'm beginning to relax a bit and I'm starting to feel safer.  This is obviously not going to be easy on many levels but I now I feel I'm at least facing forward and can start to take the first steps on my road to recovery.
The positive effects of the comments below can not be overstated, the trouble is everytime I try to reply individualy at the moment I burst into tears and can't see to type. I will try and reply asap but in the meantime I'll  send you all my heartfelt thanks and appreciation for the strength you are giving me, from here.

With permission, here it is.",Mahogany_Barrelflute,191,15,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/s0cv0/my_friend_attempted_suicide_a_few_weeks_later_he/,"Not more than a few weeks ago, I was hanging by my neck in a shower stall. I wanted with all my heart to die and for about 10 seconds I squirmed on the end of a belt. Seconds from drifting out of consciousness—never to return—the basic evolutionary instinct of self-preservation overpowered my best efforts of will and I robotically forced myself to support my weight with 1 arm and unfasten the belt with the other. After barely avoiding death I was no happier to be alive, in fact I felt worse about myself for having failed what should have been an easy task. Let me make this as real for you as possible. In my mind, I was fully and utterly convinced I was the most worthless, incompetent, and hopeless piece of shit to have ever lived.

I hope this serves as a wake-up call that it’s impossible to detect the difference between depression and justifiable sadness if you don’t truly know what depression is. The state of life that is absolute fucking misery seems completely normal. The brain is cleverer than words can describe in how well it can play tricks on the mind. Societal stigmas being what they are, I don’t think the average person out there understands the condition nearly as well as you do now. I’m not trying to make anyone an advocate for depression awareness, but if someone who usually isn’t ultra-lazy starts sleeping 12+ hours a day and ceases to do once enjoyable activities, it’s likely that they have depression which has gotten to a severe stage, in which case you should probably send them the “How You Feel is a Lie” link and encourage them to seek medical help. Of course, if they don’t happen to be depressed it could be pretty offensive to insinuate that they are, so it should just be labeled as an interesting article you came across. The other symptoms such as not having interest in things are much harder to be aware of, since they will essentially hide the fact from anyone. For the past couple months I’ve basically been a really good actor, since I myself didn’t even know I was acting. And there’s probably a fair amount of other people out there who don’t know they’re acting either.

If someone thinks that depression is just an extended sadness for people who can’t deal with their challenges, then they can’t possibly know that it’s an actual medical condition with physiological and genetic components, and they can’t possibly come to the understanding that there’s just no way to understand what it’s like. Throughout high school I had feelings of inexplicable sadness that, unbeknownst to me at the time, had little grounding in the real world. But my brain is a real asshole and it flooded my consciousness with feelings of loneliness and inadequacy to provide me with actual concrete justification for the sadness. Keep in mind that this was only a mild case of depression. I could still my feelings of hopelessness and negativity somewhat in check by reassuring myself that I was going somewhere in life that I was smart and high achieving. At [college], surrounded by geniuses and Olympians, that became a whole lot harder to do. Then shit started snowballing. Hugely oversimplified, it’s a vicious cycle that goes like this:

1 Asshole brain creates feelings of sadness/emptiness for no reason

2 Mind indulges delusions of loneliness, inadequacy, hopelessness so that it can understand why you feel sad and empty

3 Depletes energy, interest in things, self-esteem, and confidence

4 Leads to decreased performance in reality

5 Hopelessness and inadequacy are more easily justifiable

6 Depression worsens (actual chemical imbalance worsens itself, it’s as fascinating as it is sickening) 

Repeat over a few years and it breaks a person.

Between each step is a myriad of complicating thoughts and ups and downs. I mean… many years of life are happening over this time. But in short, it’s a combination of negative self-fulfilling prophecies fueled by self-doubt and a persistent widening of the gap between expectations and reality. I could see how mild depression could actually be a little motivating... Since you feel a bit dissatisfied with how things are going, you can be driven to try harder; to be just a little better. (Just a possibility, haven’t really found any noteworthy research on the effects of mild depression. Mildly depressed people can be quite lazy and those without depression can of course be quite motivated)

In the medium stages of depression, I became filled with regrets and couldn’t stop dwelling over missed opportunities. I was convinced I’d have been so much happier if I’d just made better choices. I would’ve traded places with almost anyone. Everyone seemed to have their shit together, to be more made up about what they wanted and more on track to getting it.

Once it becomes severe, the medium effects become amplified and feelings of regret manifest themselves into an unrelenting sensation of self-hatred. Energy dissipates to the point where just getting out of bed is a serious challenge, even while wide awake. My grades started to slip, I was drinking alcoholically and having some good times, but daily living was just hell. For me, this started about a month out from making an attempt. It was around this time when the feelings of guilt and shame accompanied the self-hatred. Looking at my life objectively, I thought I should be at least somewhat happy to be up at [college] with a good circle of friends and decent grades for a public schooled freshman. Thinking objectively about my situation, I knew I should’ve felt good about where I was at, and felt guilty for not feeling good about it. When it came to the point of beating myself up about beating myself up, I was pretty much done for.

A couple weeks later, my depression had advanced to lethal stages. Previously, I thought I’d have been satisfied if I were some billionaire playboy/movie star/etc. Now, life of any kind didn’t seem worth living. My self-hatred remained strong as ever but it was now accompanied by a hatred of life in general. Talking me out of it at this point would’ve been pretty much impossible. I didn’t even want hope. I used having a cold as a scapegoat for my excessive sleeping and I just faked some level of interest or happiness so as not to be questioned about it. I’d already made up my mind that suicide was the only option and it just took a couple weeks to build up the courage to actually try it. I’m not trying to say a person with a healthy brain can’t feel depressed to a certain extent. It’s natural to have insecurities or to live a sad and difficult life. Life can be hard, that’s just how it is. But if it ever gets to a point where one feels they’re out of options-and an objective viewpoint clearly suggests otherwise- they should know that it’s not natural and that it’s mostly treatable.

I’d really prefer that all this is kept on the low. I feel like it changes the kind of relationship I can have with a person if I don’t know them really well. I don’t want people to feel they have to be inauthentically kind or sympathetic. People should be allowed to genuinely hate me for who I am; I do the same for a healthy portion of people I come across. There shouldn’t be any sort of checklist for who people choose as their friends. If you like their company, that’s all it should really take—or rather— really all it should take. So if anyone asks, I’ll just say I had a real bad flu and couldn’t attend class for a few weeks so it was university policy to let me take a couple quarters off and just start fresh next year. Sorry to make this sound so much like a textbook, but I feel it may be helpful if I wrap up with just a few key points.

-Behavioral changes are gradual, so it’s near impossible to see depression as it escalates from that viewpoint. The most discernible changes will probably take form in more physical ways such as not being able to sleep sleeping endlessly, excessive eating or lack of appetite, or the development of strong alcoholic tendencies (like drinking when nobody else is). That the same condition can manifest itself in completely opposite ends of the sleep/diet spectrum makes it especially tricky. Moreover, these tendencies aren’t surefire indicators of depression. But it’s worth looking into at the very least.

-When it comes to the point where a person is only a few weeks out from killing themselves, asking them if they have suicidal thoughts isn’t useful. They may have reached the level where they genuinely do not want anyone to try to convince them against it. A genuine suicide note is not a cry for help. It’s recognition that everything is one’s own fault and that there’s simply no point in living longer. More importantly, “it is not at all apparent that those at risk of suicide are always aware that they are in fact suicidal, at least in the earliest cognitive manifestations of suicidal ideation.”

-Everything has been oversimplified to keep this within a reasonable page limit. Not even close to all depressed people (clinically or otherwise) actually attempt suicide, and of those that do only about 1 in 10 succeed on the first try—however, this figure may include a small percentage of suicide attempts that aren’t genuine but rather done for ulterior motives, e.g. attention or sympathy. Such attempts are often preceded by subtle or not so subtle hinting of what’s to come and a highly dramatic and sappy fake suicide note. I’m now really grateful that I ended up in the 90% and that I did not seriously injure myself in the attempt, and I’m quite assured knowing that my family and friends are grateful too. For the first time in months, I don’t downright despise myself. And even though I’m bound to make a lot more mistakes and miss some opportunities in the coming years, I’ll take them in stride and move on. It’s perfectly fine to have regrets, so long as they’re used as learning experiences rather than devices with which to tear yourself apart over things that can’t be changed.",,False,self,t5_2qqqf,True,,,True,t3_s0cv0,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/s0cv0/my_friend_attempted_suicide_a_few_weeks_later_he/,

It is a cliche and often unsupported comment I hear repeatedly from friends, therapists, and even sometimes strangers when I try to explain my situation and my depression. I tell them, ""I just want someone to love me,"" to which they reply, ""well, no one is going to love you unless you love you first."" And then, to them the conversation is over. They have given me that golden ticket that will forever change my life. I often don't have the heart to get into it with them about why I refuse to believe that and what that sounds like to me when they say it. They seem so happy, so why take that form them.

When people tell me that I need to love myself before others will love me, all I feel is a cycle of despair at the amount of responsibility i burden in my feelings of being unloved. I reason ""No one will love me unless I love me; I don't know how to love me; therefore, no one will love me."" I start to feel that if this piece of wisdom is indeed true, then it is more hopeless than even I expected. I have to some how delve the empty recess of my love and try to love me, the person who dislikes me more than anyone else I know, before anyone else will? That is a daunting task to ask someone who is crippled by depression to try and accomplish.

See, I am not one to believe in spontaneous love. I don't think we can learn to love in a vacuum. Love is something most people are taught. Before we even comprehend what love is, someone cares for us and cares about us. Some people get a lot of love from parents, some people get is it from relatives, some people get it from friends and relationships. It seems to me that in order to love oneself, one has to be shown that it is possible to love oneself. I think that there is usually some outside source that jump-starts each persons love generator. I have tried to love myself, but I never know if I am doing it right, or what it means, or how to sustain it, so after a few days of optimistic work, I fall back into a place where I don't feel loved with no one around to encourage me to continue. 

So my question is this: to those on here who are depressed, have you heard this phrase before? What are your thoughts? Has anyone ever explained it to you in a way that made sense? And to those of you who are not depressed, what steps does one take to begin self love? Are there activities you do that help when your own love isn't enough?

I don’t think the average person understands just how difficult it is for someone suffering from depression to talk about it. How deep the fears go. The fear that the average person will either dismiss what the sufferer feels, to misunderstand, to belittle, or the worst: reject them for reaching out.

The sufferer always worries that what they need to talk about will seem so little to someone else, so unworthy of worry. One person’s mountain is another person’s mole hill.

But sometimes, for some people, mountains are insurmountable.

Even worse is when the sufferer finds someone they can talk to when they’re at their worst … and knowing that eventually, they’ll use them up.

And then they do. And then they’re gone. And the sufferer has no one to blame … but themselves.

No one wants to be a burden on someone else, especially someone with depression. The sufferer doesn’t want to drown the person trying to save them, or find out one day that when they reach out, that person is no longer willing to listen because the sufferer is just once again going through the ‘same old thing’, not realizing that this ‘same old thing’ is really just a way of life for someone with depression.

Depression is an ongoing game of hide and seek. Hiding true feelings when someone asks how they are doing, while desperately leaving just enough clues about how badly off they really are in hopes that someone will care enough to seek out what’s really going on.

And then there’s the shame. The sufferer’s shame in knowing that they’re not normal, that they’re broken, that nothing has been able to fix them. Shame in knowing that they should feel happy, but for some reason, they can’t. The shame of not knowing why.

And, especially for the adult sufferer, the shame of needing help.

It’s so much easier to be alone. To suffer in silence. To put on a brave face and just reply that you’re ‘fine’ whenever someone asks how you are doing. When you’re alone, you can’t hurt someone else. I don’t think anyone with depression wants to give it to someone else or wants to hurt someone else; I think that’s something they fear more than anything.

The sufferer would rather hurt themselves than hurt someone else. Because even if they don’t think they’re important to that someone, that someone is important to them.

And maybe they’ll do bad things that the average person cannot understand. Maybe they’ll find a razor blade and quickly slash it across their skin in hopes that the physical pain will drown out the mental anguish. Maybe they’ll do it to punish themselves; because why would anyone have bad thoughts unless they are a bad person?

Maybe they’ll do it because it’s easier, better than asking a friend to talk to them.

Maybe they’ll do it because they want someone to notice that they feel so badly on the inside that they’ve made it visible on the outside.

And the sufferer will end up feeling even more ashamed. Because they know they can’t do anything right. They can’t do anything ‘normal’.

It’s hard to talk to someone with depression; it’s hard not to just brush them off and tell them that everything will be okay, that they just need to cheer up. It’s equally hard for the sufferer to hear these things. To have what they’re feeling, that which is hurting them so badly, dismissed as nothing more than just a phase they need to ‘snap out of.’

If it was that easy, if all a person had to do was cheer up and snap out of it, why then would anyone have depression?

Depression is a cry for attention from someone who doesn’t want to be noticed. Depression is a soul-crushing blackness that’s hard to attribute to anything. Sufferers can laugh and still feel like they’re dying. Sufferers can have close friends that they love and still believe that the best thing they can do for these people they care so much about is to just disappear. That the greatest gift they can give someone is to remove themselves from their lives and no longer hold them back.

Sufferers don’t always feel, or are able to accept, that anyone could possibly like them, or that they could be important to someone else. How could anyone possibly love someone like them? They’re damaged goods.

And damaged goods aren’t useful to anyone. Damaged goods are just taking up space. Damaged goods need to be discarded.

The sufferer doesn’t always want to die so much as they want to live, just not like this.

Suicide is the greatest selfish gift the sufferer can give. The sufferer doesn’t want to be a burden all the while knowing that all they want is for someone, maybe a specific someone, someone they’ve tied their heart to, someone they’ve opened their soul to, to just hold them and tell them that you know things aren’t okay right now, but someday, they will be. To tell them that while they may not understand, they want to. To tell them that they’re too important to lose. To tell them that they’ll try to help, and mean it. To help them try to believe you.

Someone suffering from depression is afraid of snuffing out the light of hope by pulling it too close, holding onto it too tightly, needing it too much, loving it too much, until finally, one day, they open their hands and find that the light has gone out.

Because, guaranteed, it’s happened before. Maybe more than once. Maybe more than ten times. Maybe every light they’ve reached out for has been snuffed out in their hands.

And they feel they have no one else to blame but themselves. It’s always their fault. It’s always because they’re broken. The next light they see may be the one they’re finally afraid to reach out to, because they’ve detsroyed so much already.

They feel they are nothing but an infection in the life of someone meaningful and, sometimes, the only cure for an infection is for it to be cut out. And tossed away.

No one misses an infection. No one will miss the person spreading their disease, even when they don’t know that they are. No one will miss the gray cloud that always ruins the sunny day.

Not everyone understands that even gray clouds might long for the sun.

All the sufferer wants is to be normal. Praying to a god they have no reason to believe in for something to change. Longing to feel what the average person feels. To know what happiness may be. To just not hurt anymore for no reason at all. To finally no longer be a burden. To accept that most times, the answers the sufferer so desperately needs are not the answers they’re going to hear. To be able to change their questions. To not second-guess their answers.

The answers that the friend of a sufferer needs is that whenever you may hate them the most, that’s when someone with depression needs you more than ever.

And the sufferer will hate themselves for needing you more than you’ll ever know.

**ETA: Thank you, every one who commented. You helped me feel a lot less alone.**

In June of last year I was laid off.  A few weeks later, my fiance and I split up.  We'd been together almost 5 years.  The thing is, I initiated the split; she really wanted children, I really didn't.  I'd been able to trick myself into thinking I wanted kids, but my last job was working with kids which brought the issue to a head.  

And the thing is, I didn't really stop loving her after the breakup.  It was really only in the last week that I'd finally started to feel some sort of closure.  I don't know how or why, but something started to click, and I felt I was finally ready to move on.  

On to the job - I'd only seriously applied for one other job in the past year.  About 5 months ago Verizon was hiring.  I applied; got a phone call the next day, ""We need to fill this slot very quickly, can you come in right away?""  I interviewed two days later (""right away"" in corporate time).  The manager **loved** me.  

I didn't get the job.  I was kinda crushed.  I'd had a lot of these sorts of cock-tease job offers in the past and this one coming in a time I was already emotionally weakened...well I basically gave up.

This was the first resume I'd turned in since then.  And really, this was my first attempt at talking to a girl since around then, also.  

I'm trying not to get too excited for either; maybe I'll break the espresso machine or maybe she just gave me her number to be nice.

A lot of those have been people asking about whether or not their symptoms fit with what depression is, and unfortunately there have been a few people who have been told that are not depressed because they don't show signs of [Major Depressive Disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder). However this is not the only form of depression there is an entire spectrum ranging from [Psychotic Depression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotic_depression) to [Psychotic Mania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mania). These are, to my understanding, the extreme ends of the spectrum and are often readily apparent and diagnosable. There are however spectrum disorders much closer to what is called ""stable"" and among these is Dysthymia. And what I have observed is that lots of people have posted describing symptoms of Dysthymia and asking if they are depressed only to be told that they are fine, as anyone with depression can speak to be told you are fine when you aren't is an awful feeling and it is my hope that this post can help address some of those issues.

[Dysthymia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysthymia) is what was formerly called depressive personality and is a chronic disorder that persists for multiple years it is characterized by the following symptoms ""low energy and drive, low self-esteem, and a low capacity for pleasure in everyday life. Mild degrees of dysthymia may result in people withdrawing from stress and avoiding opportunities for failure. In more severe cases of dysthymia, people may even withdraw from daily activities and isolate from society. They will usually find little pleasure in usual activities and pastimes.""

Because Dysthymia manifests itself as a long term permanently lower state, and typically lacks major depressive episodes it can go untreated and undiagnosed for years. Dysthymia can often seem like it is nothing at all since it can seem like everyone has the some problem of apathy and general malaise. For myself the Dysthymia was so long term and prevalent that I truly thought that that was how everybody felt, and I didn't realize that other people weren't always fighting to be positive. 

If someone reads this and thinks they may have Dysthymia I urge them to contact a psychiatrist and just talk to them, they are trained to help you and they won't judge you. Proper treatment can make all the difference in the world.

I suffer from Chronic depression. I didn't choose this. It just sort of happened. I've been bullied since kindergarten and I've attempted and had suicidal thoughts since sixth grade. I never wanted any of this, Ever. I would never wish this on even my worst enemy. This isn't something you can just get over like it's a cold. I'll always have this, I have no choice or say in it. But there is always the option of running away or Suicide. I've never wanted anything more then to fit in and have a guy call me beautiful for being me :). But it seems no one ever gets close enough to see the real me behind my angry/depressed wall I put up to protect myself. If I were to harm myself in anyway then I would be causing more pain to others then taking away from myself. I'm a writer and singer and I've always struggled with stage fright which I believe comes from my dysthymia. I find my way out of this depression in short YouTube videos talking about my life, hopes and dreams or just talking about the ugly society we live in. If you suffer from this then I urge you to try and find a way to deal with it. Rather then cause more pain to everyone else.

You are never alone,
Stay beautiful.

My name is Jacob and in a couple of hours I will be ending my life. I have a suicide note written and ready to go. First let me start on how I got this way. My older brother and only full blood brother I have is much better looking than me. He's maybe 6ft brown hair hazel eyes Nd super muscular has never ever had trouble getting a girlfriend has had jobs offered to him because of his looks and has life a lot better than me. Me on the other hand I've barley had a girlfriend, am overweight, depressed, never had a job, no license, no ID, and am constantly last when it comes to priority. My mother and just about everyone for that matter complements my brother on his looks all the time. I've never been complimented on anything and only recieve either sarcasm or insults or peopleaughing at me. I don't many friends, I can make friends esay, but recently dropped out of high school and decided to get my GED. Ive always wanted to become a nurse at a children's hospital, because I honestly love children and would love to work with them. Anyway I'm going off topic. My brother went into modeling and got this huge shoot in NY I was very happy for him and still am. But the big problem was there was only two tickets one for him and one for my mother. My other smaller brothers and sisters are at their fathers house staying the weekend. This trip was supposed to last two days. My birthday was conning up and would run into the day they were in NY. I told this to my mother but she reassured me she would be back in time to celebrate my birthday. But here I am now alone in my house on my 17th birthday, no celebration no anything. I'm just in complete shock that my mom would allow something like this to happen. This puts me in a low deeper than I thought I could ever go. I have no friends to celebrate it with or anything. I've just been crying all damn day And have a headache from the depths of hell. And what really makes me sad is that I try to be a good person, I've volentered at homeless shelters. I've grown tons of vegetables and donated them to very needy shelters. And I remember once at school there was this boy and his sister, both Mexican immigrants and very poor I would save my money and give the boy my lunch money and his sister lunch money for an entire year just so they'd have something to eat. I've never been a bad kid, but I'm treated like this and it just hurts so bad I can't stand it. So here I am ready to end it. I was born and raised Christian, so I hope and pray that god will forgive me for what I am about to do. I want to donate my body and try to have my organs matched for people that need them. My brother has a reddit account and knows this is my account, so when you find this Ryan please know that this is isn't your fault, even being your little brother I'm very proud of you and incredibly jealous and would never have what you have in a million years, keep shining on dude. And to my mother I'm really sorry I'm not the son that you always wanted and it had to come to this but I'm such a big failure at life and will most likely never amount to anything, I've always wanted to have kids when I became older, but I fear no one will want me. I mean no one, not even my family wants to celebrate my birthday with me so I must have done some thing wrong. Make sure my organs are donated. I'm sorry I love you all. And to reddit y'all have made me laugh when I needed it the most thank y'all I love  and goodbye. I also posted this in r/suicide watch just to make sure someone sees it.

my movement forward is fleeting,

in the scope of time and space,

but to me, it seems everlasting.

I long for the comfort of stillness,

even if the impact crushes

and destroys my soul. I will cry out from the pain,

and I will be heard, and I will not reach out

in hopes of being caught. I will race toward the earth,

however slowly, face first,

in acceptance of my fate.

See, I was made this way. I was built to collapse.

I was designed without the internal structure

necessary to keep myself erect, and I will implode,

time and time again, just to prove my imperfection.

myself from the insides out, time

I think it's due to the characters rather than simply the plotlines. I don't get it much with gritty and realistic stories (e.g. Taxi Driver, etc) because the characters are flawed and realistic. When the characters are realistic enough to relate to, but generally more good and kind than most people in real life is when I get depressed, as I just think these people are better than anyone I meet in real life, even those I love such as family. I always wanted to meet properly good and kind people who I can connect with and go on some kind of adventure, I don't even know how to explain it. I just feel that reality is not enough for me. Nobody is as good as certain fictional characters because I believe that society causes people to become conformist, closed-minded, cynical and judgemental of others. I want to meet people that are unspoilt by society (I don't just mean children, I mean people generally my age or older) and form some kind of tight-knit group of outcasts who actually look after each other and give a shit about each other and don't conform to all the worst aspects of society. But I don't feel these people exist except for in stories. It seems reality just isn't enough for me.

Today I finally made the call and got myself an appointment with a psychologist next week. ",getitonthebus,160,12,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/zwcmi/ive_wanted_to_talk_to_a_professional_for_a_while/,"Since I was about 12 (I'm 24 now, shit- this is half of my life) I've had my bouts with depression. I've either tried to bury it deep inside me and not address it or beat it into submission with weed and booze. Sometimes this worked, other times I could barely pull myself out of bed to face the world. 

My story is probably very similar to a lot of yours, so I won't bore you with it except for these few details. 

I knew I had a problem with depression since I was in high school, but I'm that type of guy that people think is the happiest, most carefree guy in the world. Every time I've tried to nonchalantly bring it up to a friend they've always seemed to either brush it off or not known what to say. 

Also, except for my depression I've never dealt with something that I couldn't over come if I really put my all into it. I think this is one of the reasons I've put off seeking help for so long, I felt like I could fix it myself. 

But I can't. I really can't. Now I've spent the past three weeks looking at the same list of mental health specialists (I live in a small town). I made excuses for why I wouldn't make an appointment with each one.

I did the same thing once while I was having a bad time in college too, I kept looking at the names of all of these people that could of helped me, but I didn't do anything.   

Finally, today I was met with another trigger that brought me down again. I couldn't take it anymore, I finally decided that this was bigger than me and that I really needed to talk to someone. 

Five minutes later I had spoken to a local psychologist and set up my appointment. 

Isn't there some cliche about the first step always being the hardest? I can't tell you if working through my depression will be easy or not, but I certainly feel like I'm already moving in a good direction. 

Once final thing, I think it comes from my stubbornness or do it on my own mentality but I still don't like the idea of being medicated. I know it helps a lot of people but I want to try to get through this with professional help first before I rely on therapy and medication together. I'm open to it, but just not yet.

Thanks for listening.

I took it for awhile but I didn't like the effect it had on me.  I felt like ""blah"", I was gaining weight, and my penis wasn't cooperating with me when I needed to (dealbreaker).

So I just stopped taking the meds against my doctor's orders.  He warned me about extreme withdrawal but I was fine.


That was then...

Now here I am fighting everyday against the remnants of depression and anxiety left from my past.  I somehow make it to work every day, am reasonably social, and even continue to progress quite nicely in my career despite my mental issues.  

The mood swings come and go but I've just learned to live with it.  Two years ago I went through a break-up that sends me into episodes on the regular.  Every day I have NO IDEA what's going to happen.  I also don't know what's worse, the anxiety or the depression.  There is no trigger other than memories I can't forget.

I went and saw a doctor again because I was having chest pains and he tried to prescribe me Lexapro.  I told him no and settled on a Xanax prescript for emergencies.

Am I crazy for not wanting to be on meds?  I do NOT trust doctors, I feel like they're all pushing an agenda.  I meditate daily and try to fight the big beast known as depression/anxiety on my own.

Dear friends of /r/depression


As many of you know life sucks, atleast at times, and then it can feel nice to escape into a fantasy world. Because of this I would like to give the oppertunity to you who also need a getaway at times but cannot afford it for yourselves.


Now the issue with this will be that many people that do need it feel that they maybe do not deserve it, but even if you do feel like this, post anyway. If the response is big I will add some more gifts to this so your participation will just increase the best possible outcome.


Now, I will not go check or question you on how you feel and will trust you completely. And please do not downvote others as I will not base who recieves based on votes, upvotes to everyone, let this be a happy place. It is also not a competion of who feels worse, suffering is bad in itself and there is no need to think that you are not deserving because ""others have it worse"". It is after all a symptom of the disease.


So the games that I decided to give away are ones that I've played and enjoyed(or in some cases owned extra copies off and those were the ones that inspired this giveaway).


And remember, please, please, do not think you don't deserve it, and even if I cannot afford to give everyone a game, I can give you some tips on games that you might enjoy if you'd like!

Here are the games that I currently have to giveaway, if they are unknown to you then I recommend checking out a review on youtube or asking me what the game is about:

How do you do that if you can only see yourself as incompetent, unreliable, unlikeable, and generally not worth a shit? The only honest ""compliments"" I can give myself are along the lines of 'not retarded', 'not physically disabled', 'not addicted to heroin', etc.

How do you pursue the immediate necessities of life (employment) or fundamental comforts (companionship, sex) when you believe you have nothing to offer? How does a person describe their self in positive terms when they hate their own voice or reflection?

Is there some 'trick' to it? Do I just go through my life lying to everyone, knowing that eventually I'll slip up and lose my job/friends/significant other when they notice the obvious discrepancy between who I claim to be and the total shitbag that I am?

I need to move forward but I don't know how to go about doing it.

UPDATE: Hey to everyone that has contributed to this thing, y'all have lent a great deal of perspective. It's been very helpful reading your various responses. I'll try to keep all this in mind as I keep on keeping on. 

Also, I should like to add that I don't think that being disabled, physically or intellectually, or addicted to any substance makes a person worthless. I guess I was just trying to get across that I am usually only able to describe by abilities by reference to a lack of disability or illness... uh, hope that clears that up, in case there was some confusion.

1351560975.0,143,self.depression,12bapl,I found my roommate after he committed suicide and I need help. First post btw.,bluegrassjams,168,25,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12bapl/i_found_my_roommate_after_he_committed_suicide/,"I need help, reddit. I've lurked without profile until now but I need to reach out somewhere. Here's the story.

I am 19 years old. Last year was my first year at college. I have always wanted to be a veterinarian, my ambitions have wavered little, I really thank God I have that to keep me going. I was eager to start my undergraduate career, I was making straight A's; academically, extracurricularly, physically, socially, and i guess you could even say sexually. I was excited to be independent, I had a real oppportunity to make something of myself!

My roommate was JC. He was a computer science major, introverted, genuinely good, a fellow redditor, and my friend. JC was an open minded and open hearted individual, he struggled with family issues earlier in his life, family alcoholism and divorce were a large part of his childhood. This, I believe left him introverted and clinging to only his close group of friends from home. As far as our campus went, i think i was the only person who really got to know JC and I'm thankful, regretful, confused, and angered by that.

The year was going well, in fact, the JC who at first was purely introverted had begun to come out with me on weekends and when i went to hang out with friends.

The Thursday after we got back from Spring break I was sitting in my room relaxing before I surrendered to the library for the night. JC got out of class early so we were able to sit back and listen to some music. He loved Pink Floydd, I used to. We listened to them almost every day. That day he put on his favorite Bob Dylan song; Hurricane. Mine is still Tangled Up in Blues, he always gave me shit for that. After that song I went to the library, I had a big test coming up, after all. I came home from the library about 3-4 hours later, it doesn't make a difference. When i came back to my dorm room that night the light was on inside but the door was locked. I unlocked it and walked inside, the place looked empty. I began to make my way over to my desk to put my backpack and things away. Half way across the room, in between our beds I stopped. There were four notes on JC's bed. The foremost one had my name on it, the others were addressed to whom I understood were his closest friends. I ripped mine open skimmed it and thought it was some sort of fucked up joke, he did have a dark sense of humor, and then I checked under the bed. He warned me not to, in the note. He was laying there with his arms folded across his chest, looking completely peaceful, that is except for the black bag over his head. I shook his arm, i still thought he was fucking with me. That's the first time i've ever shared that part of the story. 

Now my life has not been peaceful. I'm third generation of an angrily successful irish american family family at odds with each other. Bipolarism runs through my veins like the hurricane floods currently running through streets all up and down the NE Coast. I've probably had a few more negative experiences in my life than the average 19 year old, but they're for another time. Anxiety issues started long before that night but that image, above all, is burned into my skull. I really don't say this to brag, anyone experiencing something similar to this knows it's not something to brag about, but I need you to know where I'm coming from.

Well, I went and found the only other person I considered myself close to in the dorms. I had no business involving him but like the good man he is, he led me to the elevator and we went to the dorm office in order to contact the proper authorities. What can i say i was in shock, i sat at a table and through my sporadic shaking and tears answered whatever questions the police and counselors asked. I tried to act like it was something I could get past.

I was so convinced that I could handle it, I even got up in time for my 8 am bio lecture the next morning. well, the truth is i couldn't. Although I did fall behind a bit I got through the semester with my usual good grades and never sought the counseling recommended to me. I thought I was strong enough and I'm just not. 

This past summer I kept myself busy with work, I'm a vet tech. Whenever I wasn't working I was with my brother, who is the one person I know I can tell anything to. Well now I'm back at school and my brother is not. He can visit every month or so but he has a full time job and can't be around all the time especially since i live over an hour away at school. It wasn't until I was back at school, that I realized the impacts this has had on me.

I cant think clearly, I space out and dissociate frequently. This makes trying to keep up with school incredibly challenging. I cant be alone and quiet by myself or my head goes to a million bad places at once. i constantly have headphones in my ears and am fidgeting. music and textures keep me grounded from flashbacks, which, have been lesser recently but still so vivid. I think people have noticed too. i used to be the life of the party and now i have FUCKED UP tattooed across my face. That's not to say I get out and have fun, like I said I'm trying to be better. I still exercise, study, go out and try to keep a healthy lifestyle. I still consider myself an ambitious person but I can tell that these ambitions are derived, at times, from mania and depression. Early in the semester I decided that I needed help and began seeing a psychologist at Student Counseling Services, he was good for me. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, and Post Traumatic Stress Symptoms (i think because he didn't want to tell a 19 year old that he has PTSD). I was offered the drugs but i don't see those as a solution so i denied the prescriptions. Unfortunately, he relocated and I'm apprehensive of starting that relationship over again with another person. 

I have trouble sleeping, and feel tired almost all the time. My hands often shake uncontrollably which is probably a combination of this and nerves.

I have difficulty with intimacy, even my brother doesn't know everything I've stated in this post. The last girl I had sex with thought it was great, i took 3 hours, but she doesn't know that that's because I was numb and in a different place entirely. I couldn't keep that or any of my other relationships together, there has been a lot of meaningless sex trying to fill something. I want a woman I can share myself with but eventually they always get past my charisma and recognized how fucked up i am. All my friends have been extraordinary but they have their busy lives and cant listen to my problems every day. I need a relationship with someone who cares enough to stick around that way. I want someone who I can hold and feel love for but i haven't felt that for a long time now.

I also get angry frequently and feel a tremendous amount of guilt for it. My upbringing taught me to place blame intrinsically for just about everything. Which I believe is the root of my anxiety. I lose my temper and hit myself in the head often, although, this is something I've recently been very careful about controlling. I am not suicidal, i don't fully know how anyone who has been touched by suicide could be, but often I think the only way to get rid of these memories is for me to go away. I need to know how to deal with them. My nails are down to the nub and have been for a long time. I never just feel happy, I used to. I think the traumatic experience just pushed me over the edge and I want to find that person I used to be, but I'm scared he was stolen. Being away from home makes all this more difficult but I need to continue moving towards vet school.

Emotions are difficult for me, it's not only that they're erratic it's that i'm never sure how I feel. Even if I'm happy i don't enjoy myself, and theres always just something stressful underlying everything. I know i'm sad but never admit it. when people ask what's wrong I always know the thoughts are way too fucked to actually share so i just say nothing. Above everything I feel shame and guilt. Partially ashamed because I feel anger towards JC and partially because I can't handle this. I don't understand why he did what he did, he said there was no reason, he knew i would be the one to find him. BUT WHY DID HE HAVE TO DO THIS TO ME? did he think i wouldn't care? I do care, and that's what has messed with me so much. please help.

Thanks for listening, reddit. I love you.

PS: Remember, I love you and am here for anyone who needs it. please try to remember that suicide affects the people around you on a level difficult to put into words, it is never the answer.

I thought it was getting better.. How wrong I was, just another steep slope I've slid down..
I went out with friends for work (I have only been working there 3 months. Every payday they all go out, I've missed the last 3 due to other commitments) I final went out.. I'm normaly ok but ie realised now I usualy had a drink before hand or we started at a quiet place and moved up to a club slowly.

Me and my friend went together after work and we somehow met its her totally drunk friend who she ended up having to follow about all night to make sure he wasn't going to do something stupid. By the time we got up it was like.. 12 o'clock already people were drunk as hell. And all dressed.. Well skimpy. I ket ettng wierd looks all night I'm guessing because I was dressed quite demurely for a club..

But the whole time I was there I just felt wierd, like I just wanted to run off and cry to myself somewhere, I couldn't fit in at all I was too worried for my friend and her guy friend.. And everyone was just flaunting it grinding and pretty much just goings all out in this club... I ended up leaving early myself.. I got home fine I didn't even get a drink..

I just feel so crap now the morning after. I feel like a complete failure, I'm almost 20 and I can't even enjoy myself at a club or something I just don't know what's wrong with me.. I just feel like I am running my own frequency while everyone around me is on the same.. So I'm out of the loop the whole time..

But now I'm worrying about the unpredictability of waking up and not being able to do anything and not seeing purpose in it all again. I couldn't even let my best friend say she was glad my longterm relationship ended because it was an unhealthy safety net, even though she was trying to help me, because I was worried it would flip some switch in my head...

I have bipolar that runs in my family and am starting to get more help understanding what is going on with me from some professionals. I never get manic but I just get great moods, not overly high to the point of being risky, just feeling good and confident. And I am able to be outgoing and feel happy and less anxious!

&gt; I am going to share something on facebook that may fundamentally change the way you look at me. I am not doing this to bring attention to myself, but because I think it might be healthy for me to get it off my chest. 


&gt; I was suicidal as a kid. 


&gt; I thought about it several times, and attempted it once. I have been on medication for clinical depression and seeing a counselor for over a year now, and I cannot describe how much better my life has been. They probably saved my life. I still think about my failures, my regrets, the losses in my life, but I can face them now with a grounded courage that I never had before. 

&gt; I wanted to share this with you all to showcase the reality of suicide in our society. It is very real and not talked about enough. Not enough at risk people will get the care they need, and that to me is very sad.


&gt; But there are things you can do to help. Simple things. 


&gt; Take a little extra time to be nice to someone, hold a door for someone, offer a stranger help if you see them struggling, listen to people without planning what you are going to say next, smile. The little things give people hope, and make this confusing world a little bit easier to live in. 

&gt; Most importantly though, if you are depressed or you know someone who is depressed, talk about it. Talk about it today, talk about it tomorrow, and continue talking about it. Depression is always present in a person’s life, but it doesn't have to control them. Do your part, help someone out, and don’t be afraid. 

&gt; The picture I attached to this post captures what suicide can seem like for some people. It can seem like a way out, but I know now that it is not. (http://i.imgur.com/UvxTx.jpg)

This is compounded by the fact that I'm disabled and unable to work. I desperately want to work, so I can help to dig us out of this bottomless pit, I just can't.

I was severely depressed a few months ago. I never thought depression was real, and then it hit me like a ton of bricks with no friends to be there for me. Some couldn't be there, some didn't care to. All the people I had that I trusted were unwilling to do anything and no one cared.

The whole experience left me hating living, hating waking, hating sleeping, hating everything. I spent hours, days, weeks, months doing nothing. Trying my hardest to believe that people were there for me, but they weren't.

Nothing I did made anything better until I decided to make a special effort to help people. I went out and I helped people who felt sad or were having troubles. There wasn't much I could do. Sometimes it was just offering my attention to a stranger on facebook who had just gone through some hard times. Sometimes it had to be buying things for people because I had nothing substantial to give. Sometimes it was listening to someone venting. Every little bit of help you offer to other people opens opportunity for more ways to help. Before a month or two, my depression was behind me completely. The months I spent in that awful feeling was an experience I truly learned from.

Go out and help people. There are tons of people who are feeling as bad or almost as bad as you are. You can sympathize. You can lift their hands. Before too long, you'll feel the love of the world that feels the love from you.

Get rid of the people that don't make you feel good. Don't let those who don't care about your well being make the decisions about how you feel for you.

I tried to commit suicide two years ago. in fact, using another reddit account I found help with this community before, and people was really nice!..

So now I want to write this just to i dunno... maybe put some hope in at least someone. 

I've been battling depression since I was 16, went through pretty much crappy years, not caring enough about myself or anyone because the way I felt. Had been taking lots of meds since I was 19 (Fluoxetine, Venlafaxine, Carbamazepine, Clozapine, Olanzapine) because I had different diagnoses with time. To make the story short, 2 years ago I had the worst depression ever... feeling like a pice of shit, not caring about the future, because to be honest, nothing matter to me at that point. Had a bunch of pills and my mother and sister found me  and  they took me to the hospital.  I stayed in the mental facility for one week till I got more stable. 
I was really angry at everyone.. including myself.. because I failed my attempt and because they saved my life. Spending time in the hospital made me realize how fortunate I was, I was sleeping next to people that had really weird mental stuff going on, not being able to to things for themselves... So that pushed me to try harder, try to make my life beautiful again, it was a long process and im still a work in progress! 

So it was therapy, new meds, being closer to my family, get away from bad relationships, and focus on getting my bachelor degree in marine biology. It's a long way, Im not here to tell you what I did, because It probably won't work for you, because the beauty of this is trying to find your own path, to discover that there is more to live for... Somehow we are in this world, who knows why...maybe we are not supposed to change the world, but at least we can change and love ourselves.

The thing is... im about to get married in a couple of hours with the most amazing guy in the galaxy! and I know I still feel like crap every on and then, but 2 years ago I wouldn't even believe the fact that I would get married, and that I would become a better and happy version of myself!

So now... if you read all this, let me tell you, there is much more to live!! and we still don't know what the future brings! So if you feel crappy, look for help! its ok to do that, because you never know thats next for us... Like I said, I'm still in progress but now when I look back, I'm so glad someone stopped me from doing what I thought ""was a good plan"".

It's hard and a looong way but it's possible, at least it was for me. So It can be for you!

While I am generally not brave enough to talk about myself in public, it seems like maybe I have a story that will help. 

My parents were drug addicts/dealers. I was sexually molested for the first time when I was five. I was neglected, physically and verbally abused. The first time I attempted suicide, I was 11. No one found me. I just got lucky. It permanently damaged my stomach, and to this day I still get sick easily.

My classmates killed my dog. They tortured my cat to death. They stole my bike (my mom blamed me and refused to replace it). I was picked on for having cystic acne, being fat, and too poor to afford new clothes. When I fought back, the teachers beat me (corporal punishment is legal in Texas public schools).

My mother remarried a man who was more abusive than my father. This man stole the money I had saved up to buy a car so that I could leave when I was 17. When I confronted him, he changed the locks and told my mother I'd run away. I was intermittently homeless until I was 25.

As I write this, I am 44 years old. I went to college. I worked in Switzerland and traveled around Europe. I am married and have two healthy, happy children. My bill rate is something like $265/hr.  I learned to weld. I am learning to skate roller derby. I am writing my own software product to learn go (tour.golang.org &lt;-- this is fun, give it a try). 

In short, I got away. I did not do this alone. There were people who loved me. They helped me get into college, gave me a place to sleep, got me jobs, fed and clothed me. 

In hindsight, my life wasn't all bad. It made me independent, resilient and resourceful. Being homeless taught me a lot of good habits. Trying to teach my own children to be this strong without exposing them to the distress I experienced is the hardest thing I've ever done.

My mom has asked for my forgiveness. And I guess I've forgiven her because I am worried that this post will hurt her. But if it helps just ONE person get through how overwhelming it can be to endure the colossal impact other people's stupid bullshit choices can be, it's worth it. Better, it means that everything I suffered finally has a use and a purpose. 

When I read your posts, it tells me that you feel like you have no one to talk to and no place to go but here. It sucks to be that lonely and alone. It was only recently that it dawned on me that this loneliness is a silent handicap, and that it's behind more of the faces I see every day than I ever realized. It's not cool to talk about it. Our culture denies us the intimacy of being vulnerable, and that's isolating. Next time you go out, look at the people you pass (don't stare, that's rude) and think to yourself, ""Maybe that person is just as sad as I am.""

Lingering. Every day I still think about it, but it isn't as pervasive as it used to be.

It's my birthday tomorrow. Its currently 11PM and I'm counting the hours to my birthday while downing bottle after bottle, which I'm free to do as all my family left me. They all went out to have fun and left me without even asking. That's fucking great.

The truth is, I'm only ever really happy any more when I'm drunk. Tonight is a bit of an exception but earlier I was absolutely buzzing. Then my friends went to sleep, leaving me to my thoughts. I can't cry anymore, I find it impossible to fucking cry. Just emptiness.

I'm ranting again, with no real objective. I just want to share. I shouldn't be sad, my life is fucking great. A rich family, loving mother,  comfortable lifestyle, I'm succeeding at school and have quite a few great friends. But I'm just fucking miserable.

I'm excitable, kind (for the most part) and I don't mope too much. But the reality is it's all a fucking façade. I don't want to seem like a downer and lose the only friends I have. When I get home, I browse reddit  and sleep.   It's all I fucking do.  I talk to my  two friends, the only people who know what I really feel like, save for my mother, almost daily but stay quiet.

I would be happy to cry. I want to cry, but it seems almost impossible. I want to feel a true, strong emotion but all I ever fucking feel is emptiness and sorrow.

In 2006 I was admitted to a stress unit for suicide attempts. Not only that, I was a severe cutter. I walked into the hospital feeling like ""this is bullshit. They don't know anything."" After a few days of therapy and one on one with a doctor, my doctor and I came up with a plan. I cut my leg 71 times. She asked me ""why 71?"" Because I sliced for every reason that made me the depressed person I was in that hospital. A slice for each bad memory.

She then asked me to write all 71 reasons. By then I couldn't come up with 71. The next step was her asking me to write 71 reasons why I should live. I looked her with a ""are you kidding me?"" kind of glare. 

She left me alone to write. I jotted down some cliche nonsense just to get it over with. But, once I got to around #20 I started realizing that she was onto something. I wrote things like ""watch my baby brother get married"" or ""having my OWN child."" I came up with so many reasons to live, that I surpassed 71 and until this day the list is still growing.

I was severly bullied my entire life, I had no friends, nobody to turn to. I was never given a chance, and I didn't understand why it was happening to me. I became a bitter and cynical little girl, I hated the world and at a young age wanted nothing more than to kill myself. I would come home from being bullied, to only be bullied by my own family. Made fun of for the fact that I was bullied, because I was an emotional individual and my family wasn't. I always felt sorry for myself because if I didn't, who would? fast forward to highschool, I was anorexic, and cut myself constantly. I hid it from the world, and had social anxiety. eventually I grew out of it a little. I met my ex boyfriend of 3 years on and off, little did I know he was selfish, manipulative, controlling and cruel. I stayed with him because no one had ever loved me before or cared for me as much as he did. He had these tendencies where I wasn't allowed to be independent and he convinced me he was all I had. at the age of 16 I lost my virginity, he was the first guy I ever slept with. Unintentionally and foolishly I became pregnant. I decided to keep it, I figured why should this baby be punished for my mistakes, it wasn't their fault. I had no one to blame but myself, and I was going to take responsibility. My son is of half asian decent.. My family would use racial slurrs on a regular basis, call me a slut on a regular basis, make fun of me publicly. All while pregnant and in school, having to also deal with other students finding out about my pregnancy. but at the end of the day, all I cared about was my baby. Giving him the life I never had, giving him the love and understanding I never had. I passed grade 11, and summer time came. I gave birth in august, it was a traumatic experience. I spent 3 days in labor, 18 hours in active labor. 2 hours spent pushing with no success. exhausted and in excruciating pain I had to be cut open, and I felt everything. my son was at risk, because he was born face up and when they broke his water there was meconium in his lungs because he was stressed and stuck inside me. to this day I feel guilty, I feel like somehow it was my fault. I may not have been ready or mature enough for him, but I was willing to try. I began to die. I went into shock, and lost a lot of blood. I remember feeling my eyes begin to roll and everything sounded muffled. (If you were under water, and heard noises. exactly like that) and my vision became blurry. all I saw were lights. I was almost dead, 2 seconds or so from actually being so. I remember hearing the doctor yell at me saying my baby was going to die if I didn't wake up. It was an out of body experience, and out of no where I jolted up and came to. I pushed as hard as I could and he was out. I saw him for 2 seconds and he was perfect. everything I had been through was worth it, that someone like me could make something as beautiful and innocent as my son. they took him off to x-ray immediately and afterwards had him on an IV for 3 days and was kept in an incubator. I was sewn up and sent on my way to recover. fast forward to today, I haven't graduated highschool i'm one credit short of doing so, I have a part time job at a grocery store. My sons father has nothing to do with him anymore, doesn't even ask to see him or pay child support, and my family is still the same.. still incredibly emotionally abusive, I have no one to turn to. All I have is my son, and I feel like I'm failing him.

I don't want to feel sorry for myself, I'm incredibly depressed and I'm not the mother I should be for him. My entire family hates me, no exaggeration hates me. they've said it to my face, but they are good to my son so that's all I should ask. I have low self esteem and social anxiety. I don't want to be a piece of shit anymore. I want to change, I don't want to be depressed. I don't know how and I don't know what to do.

I've had a pretty shit life, period. But I try not to let it get me down. Being upbeat is how I keep my sanity, but these days it's too much.

I'm 28, divorced, jobless (for the most part, I freelance and babysit currently), and constantly in more and more debt. Life was getting so much better late last year, and then shit just hit the fan.

Every moment since then has felt like a lie. Every smile, every laugh since then has hurt because I know that it's all been false. At 26, no college degrees, nothing but retail experience and no job since getting laid off last year, and with Christmas coming next month, I haven't felt more useless or pathetic and I can't see any point in trying anymore.

I've tried and given it my all to get past or forget that depression crippled me so badly that I was bed ridden for a whole semester and subsequently failed and lost my scholarships and am now saddled with debts that I can barely pay for, especially now that my unemployment benefits have been pulled. It's just impossible not to feel stuck when no job calls back, when the best you can hope for is part time retail at a job that won't give half a shit about you, when you see your friends on facebook improve their lives, get farther in their careers and relationships. 

In the end, it all comes back. I've tried to ignore it all, but it just comes crashing back again and again. I can't stay motivated long enough to keep exercising and have any effective change in my body to be happy about, hell, the saying that exercise releases endorphins and makes you feel good is a complete myth as I've never felt it and even when my mind can be taken off of it all for 1-2 hours, I still have 22 hours of the day where it all comes back. I've lost my focus. I don't enjoy writing or playing video games or even watching the shows I downloaded anymore. It all feels like a chore. 

Therapy isn't an option. It hasn't been an option, even when I had my piddling, minimum wage job as it's all been too expensive, but even the ""free"" options that I've been given on sites like this, suicide forums and suicide hotlines have all required insurance, which I don't have.

I've been dead since 2006, the year I had to drop out of college. I look at my face and body getting fatter from having no where to go, my social abilities and relationships have deteriorated because of lack of money to go anywhere and because everyone I know are having the time of their lives advancing because they didn't have the depression of having to live with a drug addicted mother and brother and suffer the constant mental and emotional abuse follow them through school and kill them. I'm going to lie down now. I really want to be alive again.

At first I was taking medication, but I hated it and quit as quickly as I started. 

I haven't really found a healthy way of coping with my depression, and I hate talking to my friends about it. - I've tried several self destructive coping methods, but they only work for a short period before I feel worse than I started. 

Growing up I had a good life, great friends, and loving family. I've always been a bit socially awkward and struggle a bit with social anxiety, but I never let that get in the way of getting involved in school, my community, my church, etc. What I'm getting at is that I've always have had people around me that care about me and would do anything for me. I have friends, I have family, and yet I feel so alone. 

Currently I'm a college senior and will be graduating in may with a pretty good future ahead of me.

Here's where the problem is. Lately I've been so depressed it's a struggle to get out of bed. It's a struggle to go to class and do my assignments. And it's a struggle to care about my job. 

But I have no reason to be depressed. 

When my friends notice something is wrong, they can't accept the fact that I can't pinpoint a problem, and think I'm lying to them when I tell them I don't know why I'm depressed. So I've just started telling everyone I'm just tired or stressed, because that is something they can relate to and understand. 

I live near train tracks and can't shake the thought of taking a nap on the tracks. 

I can't share this with my friends though because they would freak and not know how to respond. I can't share this with my family because there is a strong history of suicide and depression in my family and I don't want to add to their worries. 

I guess I'm looking for advice on how to cope with depression because I can't reach out to my friends because they don't understand, and I can't reach out to my family because I don't want them to worry about me.

But one of the thing is loneliness, frustration of having no one who could understand, relate to and care for us. 

After quite a few terrible things had happened to me recently, I just lost hope in people in real life. I think if there is a place where there can be someone who could understand, relate to people like us, it'd be this subreddit. So, why don't we make friends here? I'm fully aware we're a depressed mobs and sometimes two depressed person can't help each other. What if I can't/don't make another person feel any better? But well, if life is so shitty now anyway, what else do we have to lose?

Let's start by commenting on this thread to show you're interested. Just write a bit information about yourself, then PM other commentors, whoever you like, talk, and make friends. Let's try actively seeking out for friends and for something more than just a once-off off-my-chest chat.


Let me start, I'm a guy, 25, socially awkward penguin (social anxiety).

**EDIT 1:** More about me: I'm in Melbourne, Australia. I'm a web programmer. I started to have a slight interest in psychology lately, given how much stuff's been going in my head all these years. 

I like to think I'm the male version of Amelie in the movie Amelie, or The Fox character in The Little Prince (this (being like The Fox) is not my original idea, I saw someone else described themselves that way), or Mr. Darcy (without being rich or handsome- just the awkwardness and being misunderstood part I guess). And sometimes, I'm just a DOG.

I play Starcraft 2 a bit, not very good (Silver league), I'm not very competitive by nature.


**EDIT 2:** I hope you all make some friends. The most important thing is keep it going, don't stop after one chat, some of us are very sensitive.., of course unless it really did not go well.

I thought of doing this in a more organised way.. but let's see how you guy like this idea.

**EDIT 3** Thank everyone for your interest. As this thread is getting long. We're thinking if we should start a new subreddit.. Well, I actually like the coziness and moodiness of r/depression as it reminds us to treat each other  first as friend and with extra care. I wouldn't want this to turn into like r/r4r or r/4everalonedating where it even feels more alone. Also, this has been great but I don't know how long our interest will last. So I like to keep it small and slow for now. If we do start a subreddit, we need a strict guideline and proper dedicated mod. If any of you feel you are up to it, feel free to start one.

**EDIT 4:** This is the internet so please do exercise caution when making friends with strangers. Hope you all have some fun. 

**EDIT 5:** Many of you like having a group rather than just 1:1 and do Skype Group or video chat. By all means, please do, mention it in your post, make an bold **EDIT** if you have posted already.

And, unless you have already made too many awesome friends, come back to check out the new comers.

**EDIT 6:** This thread is about 1 day old, seems like it's slowing down and is about to die. To liven thing up, IF YOU FEEL LIKE, let's add images and links to your post. Nice photos you took of ~~yourself~~ (I'm not sure about this), your pets, landscapes.. or artwork, anything cool you made and want to show off. Links to your blogs, music you created etc.

DON'T put up your photo with you in it if you are Ridiculously Photogenic Guy! You'd make everyone feel insecure! :)

Do these descriptions fit you, too?

I think too much, that's always my original problem. My thoughts turn to the bad things that happen to people - from small injustices to genocide, I dwell on the whole scope of human misery and can't escape the downward spiral of thought.

How can any of the stupid shit I do possibly matter when people are hurting each other, people are starving, people are losing their loved ones. Who gives a fuck if I go to college? The world will still be full of suffering.

What if it's not an imbalance in our brain? What if it's not whatever the therapist says it is? Our overly complex, impersonal society tries to make us care about things that don't really matter. We're not wrong for being this way - we're just empathetic and we feel helpless. The way humans live these days is unnatural. We are so disconnected from everything - other people, nature, the food that we eat - we become tiny cogs in an infinite machine, and that is why we feel purposeless. How can anything you do matter, when you're a part of something so huge and ugly?

(edit: [here's a pretty (in my opinion) landscape to help break up my wall'o'text](http://i.imgur.com/40hW1.jpg))

We are not MEANT to be one of a million puzzle pieces. In most jobs today, you don't do anything where you feel like you legitimately helped someone, because the whole system is so big.

The bigger the system, the less power each individual has, and less control over their own fate. There is just too much pain, too much injustice, how can one person expect to help? So no one does, because we all feel helpless. 

I think we are meant to be in small, close knit communities, where you can see the effect of what you do, where you can grow your own fucking carrots and eat them and feel responsible for your own welfare instead of having to rely on so many other people. And if someone in your community is lacking, you can help them, face to face, and know that you made a difference in their lives.

We are not happy because our society is unnatural, we feel helpless because it has made us helpless, we are not necessarily wrong to feel this way - it's just that our brains are not made for this kind of life and we recognize that something is seriously wrong but we don't know how to fix it.

...Anyway, maybe this is just me. But I was thinking, maybe it describes you, too.

I thought my life was going nowhere.  I had trouble in college.  I felt like I didn't have any close friends.  I didn't know where my life was heading.  I was unhappy, I was socially stressed out and felt awkward in most situations.  I worried all the time.  I had anxiety.  I was upset at life, upset at myself.  I was a bottled up mess of all these emotions.  I went to counseling, took meds, etc..

I was a stressed out anxious young adult male from basically the age of 15 to 22.  I'm going to give you a few tips to help you through things, because trust me -  People told me ""it's going to get better"" AND I HATED HEARING THAT.  This wasn't their struggle, this was mine, and I 100% knew it wasn't going to get better.

...Well I was wrong.  It will improve.  It may not be perfect, but it will get better.  

**Tip #1** - Life is like the stock market.  There are high points and there are low points.  I've had many low points like I'm sure you have had.  Remember, it goes up.  Your stock may not hit high points like Google's, but no one's stock really does.  Trust me, you do have value. People will buy you, people will sell you, and you may need to make some difficult choices and reinvest in some different paths in life.  That's also what makes life so damn fun.  You are the stock broker at the end of the day, and **you** control it.    

**Tip #2** - ""Look at things from a far away distance"" ....confusing right?  Trust me, train your brain to do this.  It will take time, but hear me out.  Whenever I start feeling depressed or anxious I picture myself standing up on a high mountain, looking down at whatever current situation or interaction is making me feel this way.  That ""looking at it from a distance"" helps my brain realize this little process of worrying, anxiety, or feeling of worthlessness isn't the end of the world.  It's a tiny speed bump in life.  The more you can train your brain to keep things in perspective, the more it helps.

I'm now in my late 20's.  I have a girlfriend I thought I'd never have, A job I never thought I'd like, a social life I never thought I'd have, and a combination of other enjoyable things...

...And you know what - when I hit my 30's, I may not have that girlfriend anymore, I may lose my job, My friends may move, etc.. But I'm not worrying about it.  My stock will turn around again, because I'm the one that's buying and selling it the way I want to do it.",,False,self,t5_2qqqf,False,,,True,t3_u18vb,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/u18vb/depressed_unhappy_read_this/,

I'm not close to her at all, or my stepmother, but my dad just married my stepmother and he really wants me to go.

One problem-- I feel like utter and complete shit right now because of recent events, and I know I'm gonna feel like shit tomorrow. I guarantee he's not gonna want to hear any of that, though. But if I was in the house coughing up blood, vomiting and having a fever of 102 degrees, I bet you he wouldn't give me shit about not going. Those physical ailments I just described are pretty much analogous to how I feel psychologically right now.

* ""Man up and go.""

* ""Stop making excuses.""

* ""You're being ridiculous.""

Would you say that to someone who was extremely sick physically? Of course not. But if you feel like shit psychologically, for some reason, it doesn't count.

Also note that I'm 24 years old and I live alone, so he made it clear that since I'm an independent adult, the choice is up to me. It's not a ""If you don't go, I'm gonna beat your ass"" or ""I'll kick you out of the house if you don't go.""

My dad is a really tough guy, and he doesn't show great sadness and such very often. But if I don't go, I get the feeling he'd be as close to heartbroken as he's been recently, because he (like many people) doesn't understand what depression and anxiety are like separately, much less combined.

I'm terrible, I want to change but don't want to do any of the work to change myself to do it, and it's fucking disgusting.

I feel like I'm a complete waste of resources and time, yet I'm in no way suicidal, or even considered self-harm, it's pointless.

I feel like there's no way for me to change, and there's no real point in trying because I'll always give up, because I give everything up, because I suck.

There's no reason for a girl to even like me. I'm overweight, covered in acne, and have no reason for a girl to consider me. I'll be a programmer one day, sitting and wasting my life away. I'm also very pessimistic and have no self-esteem or self-confidence, as you may have seen above.

Yeah, I just suck. I have two contradicting personality disorders, Dependent and Antisocial, which makes doing anything social stupid but necessary, and I revolve around it way too much, but I'm terrible at it.

(Huge wall of text warning.)",1005fft,147,24,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1flttj/i_fear_that_im_broken_and_quite_probably_beyond/,"I know before beginning this that it's going to be massive, I can't think of any other way than to start from the beginning, and give as condensed a version as possible of what ails me, and hope against hope that someone will say something that helps me. I want to say up front I have been under the care of 13 different psychiatrists, and tried a myriad of pharmaceuticals with no improvement in my condition over the years. I'm 28 now, and saw my first psychiatrist for depression/suicidal thoughts when I was 11. Medicine does not work for me, I've been prescribed over 30 different anti-depression medicines, and even after going through the courses exactly as described, varying dosage, etc - the results were terrible. I respond to every drug I've ever taken in one of three ways: 1) Absolutely no effect at any dosage, 2) some anti-depressants I've been prescribed made me extremely short tempered, hostile, and borderline violent - they were scary, and 3) completely numb, which while it might sound like a reprise from misery, feeling no emotions at all is a prison that scares me worse than death. I only preface my story with this to say that I have seeked help, and it seems that pharmaceuticals are not the answer for me. However I have been diagnosed repeatedly as depressed, and with disassociative personality disorder.

So, from the beginning. I have to admit that my childhood was not bad, I grew up upper middle class, the youngest of three. My older siblings are productive and fine - however we don't speak (more on that later.) My parents divorced when I was 6, however I never really had issues dealing with it. They lived 6 blocks away, were friendly and helped each other for years, and we were allowed to move freely between them with no problems. 

I was relatively popular in elementary school, had no trouble making friends, and was in all available magnet/advanced programs. Supposedly I'm fairly intelligent, or at least have the aptitude for it. My first IQ test was when I was in 2nd grade, and I have had 7 since - I've never scored below the 160s. The only thing I struggled with in school was behavioral issues. I finished my class work quickly and would talk and get in trouble for interrupting other students who were not done yet. This started a damning trend with my teachers however. As the years went by, I found myself in trouble more and more often (and the out of school/in school suspensions started racking up). I wasn't attacking or abusing anyone, and I wasn't a bully. I was constantly in trouble for not following directions (like talking when I wasn't supposed to be, as mentioned before), and as I got in more and more trouble at school I became the scapegoat for any problem near me. At first I welcomed this role, even taking the heat for other people because I was used to being in trouble for things I didn't do.

This however followed me to Jr. High school, where after our first report card in 7th grade (all As) I had no less than 3 teachers tell me I was the sorriest excuse for a student they'd ever had. Why? I didn't do homework or keep a notebook, and I talked in their classes. This infuriated me, and when a week later I was suspended for 10 days for damaging school property (a window was broken on the 3rd floor of our school, and I was with 2 teachers at the time, who vouched for me, yet the principal still suspended me and claimed I did it.) I simply stopped doing school work. I would go to school every day, and any assignment in any class that I received, I'd simply write my name, the date, and 0/F at the top of the paper, and then go about doing whatever I felt like doing. This, as far as I know, was the beginning of my lifelong downward spiral of apathy.

I failed 7th grade, and received a letter from the school that I had failed to meet the requirements of the magnet program, and would be enrolled at my zoned traditional program school the following year. The same day my parents received a call from the school, which boiled down to my SAT score being so high that the board had decided something was going on, and were willing to give me a second chance. 8th grade miserable, the teachers hated me - they had failed me and couldn't understand why I was back. I didn't do a single piece of classwork my entire 8th grade year. I hated being at school, I hated being in class, I was miserable - this is when I first started thinking about suicide. 

My parents were divorced by this time, obviously. So I was a latch-key child no matter who I was staying with, and growing up in the south we had guns in the house. 8th grade was so miserable for me that most days I would come home, before my parents, and spend a few hours sitting alone in my room with a pistol, unloaded, pulling the trigger against my head over and over - trying to convince myself it wasn't scary. At the end of the school year, finally, I thought it would be over.

The board of education and my parents decided I had a learning disability, so I was required to take placement tests to find out how far back they needed to move me in my classes, and what kind of school to send me to. When I then took my 2nd IQ test, still in the 160s, and my placement tests placed me at the college level, there was much confusion. This is also when I began seeing psychiatrists, it was obvious to everyone something was wrong. When I was 14, I completed my placement tests, I required one class (trigonometry) in a classroom setting, and graduated that year.

During that time, my mom started drinking heavily (to the point that my step-dad left her over it at some point), she was always coming home with new dings on her car, because she'd get trashed at the bar and drive home. I was accepted to several universities on full ride scholarships based on my SAT/ACT scores that year. However my parents refused to let me leave town to go to school, because I was so young. I lived at home, and started at a local university. I thought the worst was behind me.

I lasted less than 2 years in college, and I've never gone back. I was an outcast in every direction. I lost all the friends I had from K-8th grade, because we never saw each other, and I didn't fit in at college because I was too young. When I started getting too depressed to focus, I started failing my classes. My mom also started to give me encouraging little tidbits when she'd drop me off at the campus every morning. She was furious that I was failing yet again, and so constantly would tell me things like - you might as well not even try, you're going to fail. So I listened, I quit trying, I quit going, and I dropped out.

I spun downward quickly, and in a last ditch effort moved several states away to live with one of only 5 friends I had left at this point in time. Things were looking up for a while, I got a good job, my own apartment, and a girl I'd been head over heels in love with for 6-7 years (she was my best friends girlfriend, so I of course never made it known before hand, but after they broke up - it turned out she had always liked me too, supposedly.) She wasn't my first girlfriend/sexual partner, but she was the one I always wanted. I was 22-23 and things were going great.

Less than a month after we started dating, on christmas eve (I'd gone home to see my parents/siblings for christmas, I did for every holiday), my dad collapsed and I took him to the ER. The following day, christmas day, he was diagnosed with terminal cancer and estimated at a year to live. He died 23 days later. I've always hated that he had to go so early in my life. He said something pretty hurtful to me after I dropped out of college, that he 'rememberd when he was proud of me'. It was something he regretted saying, he apologized for it many many times, but to this day it's all I can think of when I think of my dad. Because he's right, my dad died before I could ever do anything for him to be proud of, unlike his other children - I was the failure. This of course put a heavy weight on me, but I had made a lot of friends in my new city, and my SO was very supportive and loving. I was going to make it.

Three months later came the biggest shock of my life. I was woken at 6:30 am to the police at the door with a search warrant. I was about to find out I was being arrested/charged with distributing child porn (something I've never done in my life), a felony carrying 10-25 years at the state level where I lived. My SO was not in town, and I had no family in the area, and all my friends were in college, no one had a home phone, and you couldn't call cell phones from the jail. It took a week before I finally caught my boss at home, who found my sister on facebook, to contact my mom, who came to bail me out. My bond was 100,000$ (so 10,000$ cash to get me out), which the only reason anyone had was because I had the life insurance from when my dad died.

What followed was the most demoralizing endeavor I've ever been a party to. I did not meet the requirements for a public defender (you have to make less than 400$ a month...), 80% of attorneys wouldn't touch the case, and the big name ones who would (the only ones who would) wanted between 50,000 and 250,000$ to take the case. It took every penny I had to my name, my mom had to her name, and my stepdad had to his name, to get a lawyer on the case (I still owe him 16,000$ today.)

The prosecutor offered me plea deals for the next year, 20 years, 18 years, 15 years. I had a preliminary hearing where the detective flat out lied about our interview, and claimed I said things that I never did - I told my attorney, who brought it up. The judge refused the line of questioning, because it was a 'preliminary hearing, and those are facts for trial', and refused to allow the tape of the interview to be played for him. The judge and prosecutor, after the hearing, launched a verbal tirade against me, my mother, and my lawyer for not forgoing my right to a pretrial hearing, they had already decided my guilt. 

When that didn't work, the court 'sent paperwork to the wrong address' of a court date for me. There was nothing on the docket for me for that day other than to show up, and it was sent to an address I never lived at, and my attorney wasn't sent a copy. Of course I didn't show up to court, and the US Marshals arrested me at my job for failure to appear. Now everyone who didn't know already knew, and I was in jail on a no-bond charge. It took 3 weeks for my lawyer to convince a judge to let me back out. This is when the great shedding of ""friends"" occured.

Now that everyone knew the charge against me, the worst of my 'friends' left immediately, a slow trickle followed them - shamed in being seen with me by others who knew about it, which turned into a river. My SO couldn't handle the flak she was getting from people, and although she'd stuck by me for 2 years of it - she left for the comfort of one of her friends who'd been helping her deal with it. After another year, I was done. I couldn't fight anymore, I left my job, defaulted on everything, was evicted, and the court allowed me to move back home (out of state), where 7 months later - they sent a letter informing me that during the process of setting up my actual trial dates, the police were unable to find any corroborating evidence, and the case was being dismissed as nolle pros ('we do not wish to pursue'). So many years, every penny I had to my name, all of my friends and family (my brother and sister stopped speaking to me after my arrest, which hurt me and made me so angry I've never tried to speak to them since, I cannot believe they thought I could've even possibly been guilty), and my SO - who I loved dearly.

As I sat reading the letter from them, I just started bawling. I had dreamed of this day for years, and the feeling of elation that would come with it, but it didn't come. Nothing did, and nothing has since. I got my job back at my previous employer, they are the only person who will hire me. Every other interview I get extended a job and then fail the background check (my arrest still shows up, the court refuses to remove it until 10 years has passed, and a direct quote from the solicitor here, 'because people deserve to know what you were suspected of, so you don't get away with it again.') As you can imagine, when you see a charge about sexual abuse of a minor, every conversation is over, jobs, dating, anything. That's it, end of story. Even though I didn't go to prison as an innocent man, my life was ruined.

I now work from home, I make decent money, low 60s. I'm still in a mountain of debt from a court case that never went to trial, and I was innocent of from the beginnig. I've gained 130lbs, I don't go outside, I have no friends and no drive to make friends. I can't quit smoking, drinking, eating shit food, nothing. I tried hard drugs, I tried pharmaceuticals, I tried therapy. I'm at my wits end.

I don't leave my house because I'm ashasmed of how I look, I say every day that I'm going to start exercising, but I never do - it's always tomorrow. Today I'm going to quit smoking, but I've said that every day for the last 2 years, I never do. I'm so broken that I have no willpower, no motivation, no nothing. I'm terrified to make friends because I don't want to explain my past, and because I'm convinced they will be taken away again. I've lost all my friends twice now, and have truly been betrayed and abandoned by every person that I've ever loved. I can't get past it having to be me. There has to be something wrong with me that I can't function correctly. The few friends I managed to keep through the ordeal I've lost since, no one wants to talk to someone who's always depressed, and I've lost the ability to pretend to be happy anymore.

I don't even know what I expect by posting this. I've taken the medicine, done the therapy, read books and motivational bullshit, and nothing is helping me. I am a prisoner in my own mind, and I'm so tired of it. I used to be a loving person with a huge heart, I've been robbed twice stopping to help a stranger change a tire on the interstate. I've given literally my shirt off my back, and I always try to give food to those less fortunate than me, even when I couldn't pay for my own food, but as time goes on and I die a little more inside every day, I'm just an asshole now. I hate myself so much that I hate everyone else too.

I'm sorry for writing such a long post, and am truly appreciate of anyone who read this far, whether you choose to comment at all or not. I don't know what to expect, but I'm running out of options.

1368629366.0,122,self.depression,1edv5k,Isn't it interesting that people find comfort in the knowledge that those who have attempted suicide have immediately regretted it?,ReticentRaccoon,147,25,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1edv5k/isnt_it_interesting_that_people_find_comfort_in/,"There are stories of people who have attempted suicide and have immediately regretted it. A person tries to hang themself, but once the noose tightens around their neck they struggle and try to reach up and release it. A person jumps off a bridge and while falling in midair immediately regrets their decision and hopes to survive (the documentary [The Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bridge_%282006_documentary_film%29) is based around this idea). Moreover, people who hear such stories seem to find comfort in it somehow, such as ""[this really reassured me](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1ecfs8/redditors_who_have_died_then_been_resuscitated/c9z3edf?context=2)"". Why is it so? How true are these stories? Why are they perpetuated? Who is more likely to repeat these stories: depressed people or regular people?

I feel that it is regular people, those who have not been depressed or suicidal, who like these stories the most. It is as if they *want* suicide to be regretted, and not just by everyone else, but also specifically by the person who attempted it. For them to imagine anything else would be a threat to their worldview. To even consider that in some situations suicide may be legitimate is a grave danger to their belief that life is worth living at all costs. To try to understand and emphasize with the thoughts of a suicidal person would drive them to the edge of insanity. It seems as if these people have a heightened predisposition to selectively pay attention and spread stories such as these because it brings them comfort. ""Of course they regretted it! It could be no other way. World order is restored!""

Myself, I find these stories interesting, but am wary of taking them entirely at face value. First of all, the human survival instinct is extremely strong. We spend our whole lives not dying, and we ourselves are the legacy of millions of generations of other living beings that have spent their entire lives trying not to die. The thought of not existing is incredibly terrifying, as is the thought of the physical pain the transition would entail. In that view, the act of suicide - the deliberate decision and the follow-through action - is incredibly courageous. Is it really all that strange that once the decision is made irrevocable, the person immediately regrets it and struggles against it? That doesn't make the decision itself illegitimate or make all the reasons that led up to it suddenly disappear. And yet the regular people use the fact of the struggle as evidence that the person didn't *really* want to kill themselves in the first place. They find comfort in the illusion that no such reason could exist.

The other reason to be wary is survivorship bias. Those people who survived long enough after their first attempt to tell their tale are precisely those who are more likely to have changed their mind than the people who have tried again soon afterward and are no longer around to justify themselves. There are stories of the second kind too though, of people who regret to have failed, or of people who continue to suffer for years and decades from depression despite having survived, but these are not as popular, or are even outright [censored](http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1cdon5/called_depression_hotline_closed_called_suicide/c9g53bw).

So, is there a way to analyze these stories in an objective quantitative way, without observer bias or survivorship bias? Even I myself cannot be trusted, for maybe I *want* these stories to be false, to justify my *own* worldview. Is there a way to discuss suicide without cached thoughts and preconceptions, without trying to escape into comforting platitudes? Is there a way to deliberate whether life is worth living without presupposing the answer to begin with?

You feel muted. The same thing that made you happy yesterday may not make you happy today. Your life is somehow different in your mind, what was okay yesterday you like less and less progressively. Things don't change. You change. It feels a bit like you're a swing or pendulum. You swing up and down, a whole week might be a down swing. Food doesn't taste as good as it used to. You stop enjoying everything. You would rather spend time in your own mind than face the outside world. Interacting with others in any meaningful way beyond simple exchanges feels draining. Sometimes it is so bad others might mistake you for being stoned or something. I wish.

Insomnia or hypersomnia sets in. I've been through both. I don't know which I think is worse. Up all night contemplating shit with constant anxiety or sleeping your life away. Sometimes I would come home from school or work and just... sleep until the next morning. Others I will go for 2 days without sleep. It's like different kinds of torture. Numbness vs hypersensitivity.

Sometimes you get angry at how things are, but you can't summon the willpower to actually change things. It's not really anger, it's more like frustration.

Sometimes it gets so bad you just start thinking... wrong, there's no other way to put it than minor delusionality. Sometimes you think it would be okay to die. Not to kill yourself, but to just kind of fade away. You convince yourself of silly impractical things. I remember in one of my worst bouts I read 1984 and was for a few days thinking that I was being monitored or something.

She was in a manic state for days previously. I talked to her two days prior, she had been awake for 34 hours at that point. She's on disability for bipolarity, but she hasn't received her medicare card. 

30+ cuts to the inside of her leg. 80 stitches. She's in the psych ward right now, and I know it won't do her any good, because it hasn't done her any good in the past. How is everything always so fucked up. I can't cope with anything anymore, it's nothing but bad news all the time and there is literally no goodness to be found in my life. 

I don't know what's going to happen to her after she gets out of psych. My mom can't take her in, if she does my asshole ex-stepdad is going to immediately pounce on my mom and take her back to court for full custody of my half-sister, who is 4. My dad has been giving her money over the last 5 years, and is sick of trying to support her when she evades communication and doesn't seem to take any initiative to improve herself. He's also not very understanding of mental illness, it seems. I don't think he's in the wrong, really. But my sister is not going to suddenly ""get it"". I can't take her in either, I can barely take care of myself and I cannot handle a manically-depressed suicidal possible drug addict when I'm dangling on my own threads as it is. Everything is fucked every which way. 

Everything is fucked. I'm afraid if I try and appreciate anything in my life, something will swoop in and take it away, like always. It takes all of my energy just to function as a barely competent slacker working a shitty job for $8.95 an hour. Pure anhedonia. I don't even want things to get better, just to not get worse. That seems unlikely. I can't afford a fucking therapist either, and if I see a sliding scale volunteer therapist I'll get one hour a month after sitting on a waiting list for 2 months. I don't trust a general practitioner to prescribe me any drugs for my mental health either, one of my sister's suicide attempts was the result of a bad drug interaction brought on by a quack who didn't know what he was doing. I feel like I was built to suffer, as melodramatic as that is. Overwrought, but it feels accurate. All I do is worry and suffer anxiety attacks all of the time and punch the stone wall on the side of my house and gouge my car keys into my arm. 

No one is going to read this anyway. Don't bother PMing me to talk, I've done it before and it doesn't fucking help shit.

""I love you and care about you, but I give up and it's up to you now.""

""It's up to me to do what?""

""To be happy.""  

And he left to play computer games.  

For the past hour I have been in our room feeling like I'm spiraling into a yawning black hole in the middle of my chest.  My life is a series of motions that I can go through on some days and fail to accomplish on most days:  wake up, go to shitty minimum-wage job, go home, sleep until husband gets home from real job, hope desperately that he will make me feel better.  Lately his heart isn't in it.  He's frustrated and annoyed, tells me he ""doesn't get why I'm so sad when I have everything I need"".  Despite all this he is what I cling to when my depression goes into rage mode and threatens to tear me up and make me do something stupid.  

I've tried to explain to him that being happy is not a choice I can just make.  I've tried getting out of bed, putting a strained smile on my face, and eventually it becomes so exhausting that I begin to cry anyway.  Or worse, at the end of a day of posturing and laughing at other people and pretending I don't have a gnawing despair eating me from the inside out, I look back on the hollowness of my day and want to kill myself.  I *wish* that feeling better were that simple.  And I wish I cared enough about myself to want some kind of permanent recovery.

It might last a couple of minutes, the entire morning, or, if it's really bad, it can casue that entire particular day to become extremely hard to get through. 

It's obviously some kind of fucked up process happening in my brain, but i really don't know if the dream is causing the bout, or vice versa.

So, did  anyone else experience anything similar?

You need to remember that the way you're feeling now isn't necessarily the way you're going to feel tomorrow, or in a month, or years from now.

There's a terrifying ebb and flow to depression, and the worst thing you can do is forget that you have this disease in the first place. I've found that I fall back into depression so much quicker if I let myself forget for even a moment that I've suffered from depression since I was 12 years old.

I don't think that real depression ever truly goes away, but that doesn't mean that it's always on the forefront of your mind. You must remember that you have the ability to feel happiness despite having depression. Even on the worst nights, when the world has never felt more meaningless, know that, eventually, you'll have the strength to get out of your cold bed.

I was born on July 15th, 1996.  My favorite color is blue, and I like to paint.  The events in the last few years of my life have pushed me over the edge, and I've given up hope of ever being accepted, feeling happy, or feeling loved.  The first time I realized my mom was actually a psychotic bitch was in the first grade.  I had gotten in a fight with my sister, who was at the time in 4th grade.  My mom dragged us both into her office and started screaming at us.  It escalated to a point where she slapped my sister hard enough to leave a bruise on the side of her head.  She then screamed at us to get out.  I ran at light speed out of there and hid under my bed.  I sobbed myself to sleep, and spent the majority of the next 2 days under there.  In the 3rd grade, my best friend moved across the country.  After that, I didn't find a truly good friend until around the 6th grade.  It was around the 6th grade where I started noticing that I felt sad, I had a hard time smiling and laughing, and when I first wished that I was dead.  In the 7th grade, it all went to hell.  Because I did something stupid, no girl would talk to me.  Nobody wanted to be around me.  I failed a majority of my classes because I didn't care anymore.  I got into a fight, and saw my crush cheering as my head was bashed into the cafeteria floor.  In 8th grade, I put the first cut into my wrist.  I now have 15 cuts.  I tried to be reclusive.  At home, I was hit, screamed at, and I ran away for the first time.  I became addicted to World of Warcraft, and the concept of being someone I was not.  To fellow players, I had 7 level 80's and ran Ice Crown Citadel with my guild every week.  I kicked the addiction and then filled that void with a game called Minecraft.  After making a model of Castle Town from Nintendo's Legend of Zelda, I kicked that addiction too.  I have an eating disorder, and I'm overweight.  My mom takes every opportunity to make fun of me for it, calling me a pig and a lazy fatass almost every day.  In the 9th grade, I sunk into a deep depression.  I felt like things were hopeless.  I kept hoping to not wake up in the morning.  I was constantly bullied at school and at home.  My mom made me sit outside for an hour in my boxers during the winter because I failed a math quiz.  I had a girlfriend that year, and we had a breakup which involved girls texting me at random times during the day and calling me an asshole and a douche and that I didn't deserve her.  I watched what little of a social life I had go down the drain.  No one wanted to be near me, or to talk to me.  I couldn't even ask someone for a pencil.  At home, it was no better.  My mom was angry at me one day, and beat me while I was naked on the floor of my bathroom.  My purpose in life is meaningless.  No one around me gives two shits about me.  My life is a constant hell.  And in 2 hours, I will be hanging by a rope in my basement.  

My first, and final edit: the time elapsed on my post has been 2 hours. As if on cue, my parents just left for the movie. Thank you, everyone, for the kind words. Thank you for sharing your stories, and your words of encouragement. I'd be lying if I said that I didn't tear up a little bit while reading them. Thank you.

All this time I thought that my self-hatred, low self-esteem, uselessness, worthlessness were just in my head and that people actually can/do like me. Well, now all these things are confirmed - I am a person that nobody likes and will never like. Nor does anyone cares/will care about me. I'm so quiet and shy that it literally kills me. At that party I felt like a fish that has felt out of the water. I basically counted every minute waiting to get home. Nobody showed any interest in me, I was the weird guy. The ""best"" part is that the group in which I hanged out (they were mostly my brother's friends) didn't know we're brother. Once we told everyone it was a nightmare.

I'm tired of wondering how heartbroken my boyfriend would be, he'd have no difficulty finding someone else. I have accepted these things. I'm too tired to finish my work, and too scared to make something of myself. I don't want to have children just so they can end up with the same mental malformations as I have.

I'm a financial burden, I'm a selfish and timid lover, I can never do enough without falling on my face. Those aren't self-pitying moments, they're facts. 

I'm sick of this subreddit, which just attempts to wallow in their own tears of feeling bad about themselves. I don't have anyone to talk to, and I don't want anyone to talk to.

My life now is in no way perfect, but it is considerably better than what it once was.  Just the fact that I am able to go to my college classes and put in some effort to pass is a huge improvement.  I still have bad days but I remember where I once was and use that to remind me of how much progress I have made during my moments of self-doubt.  It takes a conscious effort, but I just remind myself that it will pass.  

My younger brother tweeted yesterday that it was the worst day of his life and I couldn't help but cry.  Thinking of the pain that I put my family through helps keep me moving forward.  So even if you think you're completely alone there is someone who cares and would be absolutely devastated if you were gone.

I know that this will probably not get through to a lot of you.  I have been where you are and know how easy it is to ignore any advice and give up hope.  But if by reminding you all that what you are feeling will pass helps even one person everything that I have gone through is worth it.

Last February, after attempting to kill myself, he was the only person who was there for me, not physically, but that doesn't matter, right? He was a really fucking awesome friend. 

I wasn't. Soon after he told me about his depression, how he felt, and, well, didn't feel. The same as me, really, except that I couldn't help him. 

Or wouldn't.

I could have easily messaged him a few more times a week, checking up on him. I should have done something for his recent birthday, but I was too busy doing nothing.

And then I noticed, that he hadn't logged in days. Then weeks. I wondered, but I was too scared to confirm it. 

I still am. But I finally messaged someone and they confirmed that he had been taken to hospital and hadn't heard anything else. 

So, the past few days have been the shittiest of my life. Flipping between feeling completely numb to bawling my eyes out. And the guilt. Holy shit, the guilt. 

It is my fault, and because of that, I don't deserve to be happy. 

But then, surely he would have wanted me to be happy. 

Maybe.

All I know is, deep down, I'm somehow happy for him.

Here's my story.",deertribe,116,6,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/10mn04/i_went_from_feeling_like_i_was_at_the_bottom_of/,"**I know this is extremely long, but please read it, or at least the bold print!**

Growing up, I lived in an abusive household with a father who was diagnosed manic-depressive, and a meth-addicted mother. There was constantly yelling, fighting, breaking dishes, etc. **I never had a single friend I felt was really my friend. Literally not one, I'm not exaggerating. I felt like every single person except me got a guidebook on how to be a human, and I was some foreign creature that belonged in another universe. I have always been extremely anxious and stressed out, but all internally, so nobody ever knew.** I started seeing a therapist in fourth grade and was diagnosed with ADD. I never took medication for it because my mom was against it. I never did well in school, I never cared, I never felt the need to succeed in my life. I switched schools a lot. I went to five different high schools in four years, and I believe four different middle schools in three years.
My parents divorced when I was 6 months old. My mom stopped doing meth when I was 1, but moved 100 miles away and I lived with my dad.

When I was twelve, I started smoking cigarettes and drinking my parents' alcohol, and also started cutting my wrists. I lost my virginity at 14 to a guy I had dated for a month because I just wanted to get it over with. I realized sex got me attention and started to use it as a means of fitting in. I started dressing really sexy, investing a lot in my physical appearance, and slept around a lot.

**My room had rotting apple cores, dishes everywhere, boxes of shit piled up, dirty clothes everywhere, sheets that had been on my bed for months. I even found a rat nest nestled into my clothes, with baby rats curled up. I would go weeks without showering or leaving the house, never going outside or speaking to anybody unless I absolutely had to.
I got into a relationship that I was in for two years that was extremely verbally and mentally abusive. He wanted to build muscle and I wanted to lose weight, so we started dieting together and he would remind me that I didn't want to eat that much food, or that I should really go work all of that off. 
I weighed 85 pounds when I was admitted to a mental hospital and first put on medication. 
That medication sort of helped, but I was still not nearly okay. 
After I got out of treatment, I shaved my head and continued to sleep around. I decided to stop taking my medication and went totally crazy. I drove away all of the friends I had managed to gain, and dove right back into the black hole of depression.
I also never really felt things, instead reacting to whatever situation I was in with how I saw others react. I almost got in a car crash, and felt no fear, but acted afraid and started crying because that's what a ""normal person"" would do, right?**

I eventually met this guy named Trevor and started sleeping with him. We slept together more and more, and since he was at my house all the time, him and my dad got pretty close. My dad asked him to move in, so he did. At this point, we were kinda close, but I still felt cut off, and too anxious to actually have a friend I was comfortable around. Him living in my house was good and things around the house improved a lot. My dad didn't want to show his real self in front of Trevor, so he stopped breaking dishes and yelling and saying awful things to us. He'd still do it if Trevor wasn't around, but it was pretty pleasant in the house for the most part. 
Trevor and I continued to get closer and he was planning a trip to Europe and invited me. I had been saving up money so I decided to go, even though I was aching with anxiety. 
In Europe we got extremely close and I felt like I had a friend for the first time, even though I was still super anxious and uncomfortable. I couldn't understand why he would want to be friends with me. I hated almost everything about myself, aside from my art and my philosophy of life.
When we got back, we were in love and eventually got together as a couple. On New Year's weekend of this year, we hung out with a friend from the other side of the country, who Trevor knew from college. He jokingly asked us to replace his room mate who was moving out, and I was dying to get out of my dad's horrible household and away from his abuse, so I said we should do it.
Trevor was uneasy about just packing up his whole life, but realized he hated where we were anyway. So we left.
We moved in with his friend and it was fun, I was enjoying living on my own for the first time (at 19) and was happy to not be around my dad anymore. Trevor helped me start to get ready for college, as I had no help from my parents, who dropped out of high school in tenth grade.
I still felt incredibly anxious and depressed, but less depressed than before. I started medication again with a new psychiatrist and it was semi-working, but again, not that well. 
After a few months of living in our new home, I started feeling less close to Trevor and thought about whether or not I wanted to be with him anymore. 
**I got irritated super easily all the time, and jealous of everything. I didn't want to have sex or go out with him and his friends. I still had nobody except him, so that was incredibly rocky.
Things continued in this fashion, and my depression took a nosedive to the bottom of the ocean and I thought daily about suicide. I didn't want to hurt Trevor or my mom and sister, so I never went through with it, instead praying for a terminal disease or a brain tumor that was inoperable so I could die without it being my fault. 
I cried every day, heaving sobs choking me and weighing me so far down. I was at my absolute worst.
My psychiatrist upped my dosage but it didn't do anything, so I went to someone else.
My new doctor immediately put me on a different medication and gave me meds for my ADD. 
Within three weeks, I felt better than I had EVER felt in my ENTIRE LIFE. 
I started recognizing my good qualities, and letting go of all of the self-hate. I started loving myself and realizing that I'm actually a pretty cool person. I was able to control my emotions and feelings, and rationalize my thoughts.**
""Oh, I didn't get the class I wanted for college? Better hide under the covers for three weeks as usual. Oh wait, why would I do that? I can take that class next semester. I have enough for now anyway."" 
Stuff like that.
I quit my shitty job and got a better one, I realized what I wanted to do with my life and started heading there. I organized everything I needed to do for college and enrolled at my local community college, planning to transfer to a better one after I finished my missing requirements.
I am absolutely in love with my boyfriend. We have amazing sex almost every day, sometimes more than once. I have a sense of humor and make witty comments.

**I'm not ""cured"" and still have my old psychological issues, but I can recognize them and sort them out. Organize them and work on them one at a time when they arise. 
I still feel socially anxious and don't have ""real friend"" friends, but I'm getting closer to some people I really like. 
I love myself and am hopeful for my future, excited to be alive.
Amazed by the beauty of nature and determined to constantly better myself and do anything I can to be exactly who I want to be.
I refuse to ever go back to living in mediocrity or the putrid pit of depression. I don't allow anyone to do anything bad to me, whether it's make a rude comment, try to insult me, or try to get away with some bullshit.
I'm not going to sit here and just wait to die. I'm alive and life is beautiful. Life is the greatest gift you will EVER receive and you can do anything you want with it.**

To end this ridiculously long post, I'll leave you with an old indian proverb:
A child and his grandfather are talking, possibly about the evils of the world or about how hard life is, I'm not sure.

The black one represents agony, evil, depression, and everything negative you could possibly think of. The white wolf represents love, happiness, peace, beauty, and everything positive you could possibly think of."" 
The boy asks, ""Grandpa, which wolf will win?""
The man replies, **""Whichever one you feed.""**

**You deserve to be happy and to love yourself. 
Please don't give up. It gets better. I promise.**

Please feel free to message me, I am here for each and every single one of you. I know, I *know* how astonishingly difficult it is to be alive, day after day after day. I know the pain, I know the weight, I know the chains that hold you down.
But I also know how it feels to shed all of that, to feel the most immense relief imaginable.

There is hope for you, always.

**EDIT:** The medication I'm on is called Pristiq. It's an SNRI (works with the chemicals Serotonin and Norepinephrine.)
My ADD medication is called Vyvanse, and it's an amphetamine. (lisdexamfetamine)

During the Summer Steam Sale, I bought a few four-packs of games for my two good friends and I to share, simply because buying a four-pack was the same price as buying three of the games on sale.  I still have that fourth game sitting in my Steam gift inventory.

I love meeting new people, now.  It used to be really tough, what with social anxiety on top of overall general depression, but after forcing myself into online gaming and trying to strike up conversation with someone in a cooperative atmosphere, it's become easier and easier.

I want to meet *you*.  My friend(s) and I want to game with you.  I would like to gift you a game--currently, I have Borderlands, Left 4 Dead 2, and Shoot Many Robots (never played this one)--and spend this evening playing it, the three of us.  Maybe four, if someone else wants in.  Hell, I'll stream it on twitch.tv if the community wants to join in or observe.

We will laugh and have fun.  We will kill zombies.  Or psychos.  Or robots.  When you accidentally shotgun me in the face I'll spit my drink out laughing.  You'll have this game forever and we will play it again in the future.

The only thing I ask of you is to remember one time where you played video games and had fun, whether alone or with someone else, and to post here about it.  I'll be choosing someone entirely randomly, so you don't have to submit the best or funniest story to be picked, but I do want to read your experiences, if you don't mind.

If this is something that everyone enjoys, it is something that I am dedicated to continuing, even if I have to cut back on other financial expenditures so I can continue to buy new cooperative games and keep this going over the next few weeks and months.  I feel like depression is one of the most misunderstood common afflictions and deserves as much attention as we are currently giving diabetes or cancer.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.  I would have loved something like this when I was as low as I've ever felt, even just watching a couple of people to whom I can relate having a good time would have made an evening better, and I am going to enjoy meeting new people (*you*) and shooting the faces off of things together.

This being a self-post, I care not about karma.  Please upvote for exposure, and maybe we can turn this into a positive thing for the community to take part in together.

**EDIT:**

Guys and gals, I had something particularly troubling come up--the sudden death of a pet due to a blood clot and a previously undiagnosed heart condition--and really could not make it back for this evening's events.  I will be submitting another thread as soon as possible so we can actually do this.  I was really excited to do this, so let's get it done!

I've created the subreddit /r/CatharticGaming as a placeholder for domdest's idea, though I am open to any other subreddit name.  I really liked the idea of /r/GamingAgainstDepression, but reddit doesn't, of course.  I'll be posting here and in /r/CatharticGaming simultaneously (x-posts for the win), so you can catch me in either locale.

I've also created a [Steam Group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CatharticGaming) so we can start getting together as often as possible.  I hope to provide some game gifts to the community, but, as *nohassles* said, Team Fortress 2 is free to play and a wonderfully cooperative game.  What's better than hiding behind a heavy as a medic?!  Nothing!

It seems to be common consensus that one should not stick his dick in crazy. Simple rule right? But what about being the crazy dick sheath? I am the crazy dick sheath. 

I have never been to a shrink or anything, but I do think I might be leaning towards the whacko side of the crazy scale. I get affected over the smallest things and spend days and sometimes weeks over it. See dead cat, mope for weeks. Natural disaster and hundreds die, mope for weeks. See a homeless person with malnourished dog, mope for weeks. I don't know if it's normal but I'm guessing not. My SO gets it the worst. If he even goes out without me once I will be entirely convinced that he will cheat on me and leave me. He has never done anything to warrant my behaviour and suspicions but there is nothing he or I can do to convince my brain otherwise. Every time he is out without me I am practically crippled with ""hurt"" and am in tears in bed crying until the moment he comes home. And when he does I will be absolutely difficult and give him grief for weeks on end. During my good days I understand that he needs time with his friends and I know he will never hurt me. But when it comes down to it again I am the same crazy sobbing wreck that can't live without him by my side. He has since tried to never leave my side but I know that makes him unhappy and I don't want that either. Needless to say, I'm losing him.

Oh and that I torture him and myself by self-harming.I want to say that it's not something I can help but that's simply ridiculous. Of course I can help it.I can just NOT pick up the razor and cut myself. Right? Unfortunately my stupid brain doesn't process it the same way. It's a compulsion and almost an addiction. I think about it all day everyday every minute and I hate hate hate the scars and I hate how pathetic it makes me feel. Cutting yourself is for 16 year old tumblr girls, not a 30 year old woman with a respectable job and on paper, everything going for her. 

I know most of you, if any at all, who reads this post will ask me to seek help, but I'm asian, and living in my culture it is considered the deepest shame to seek mental healthcare and it is not something I am ready to explore. I'm not asking for help here either, I guess. Just needed a space where people can understand what I'm going through.

Sorry for the rant. Nothing makes any sense right now but thank you for listening.



edit:

hello. I just spoke to my SO and asked for a breakup. It's something that has been going through my mind and tonight I finally told him. He said okay, and to be honest, he sounded relieved and that hurt. But that's step 1. Maybe tomorrow I'll try to love myself a little more. 

Thank you for the kind words. I will think about seeking help. It's 6am where I am and I should try to get some sleep before I lose my mind. But thank you, thank you very much for showing me kindness. I wish us all, all the best. We all have our own battles to fight.

I have been very very down on myself for the past 3-4 weeks. Just...soul crushing weight on my shoulders.
I went to the grocery store at about 3am (I work nights). There was this kid, probably about 17 years old, really little scrawny guy. He is pushing a hand forklift with a MASSIVE load of stock on it, like 7 feet high. He tries to go around the corner with it and just like that, about 700 lbs of product is strewn across the floor. Suddenly, totally unlike my ""normal"" self, I walked over and helped the poor kid load it all back onto the lift. Took about 20 min total and I swept up the busted kitty litter bag that also made a mess. We didn't speak the entire time and it was a little awkward. 

When we finished, he looked at me, with tears in his eyes, and hugged me. I didn't know his name, or even what his voice sounded like. But I knew I did something really fantastic that day. 

When I got home, I busted down myself into tears, but they were tears of relief. Almost as if the universe said, ""Here pantzzzzless, lets take some of that weight off of your shoulders. I feel like I have been on cloud 9 for the past 24 hours.

I just need to rant, I don't really care if anybody reads this. I actually kinda hope nobody reads it, this is all pretty much a waste of time anyways.

I counted yesterday. It's been 70 days now since I've really said more than one sentence to anybody outside of my family or classroom. I'm not a shy person, pretty much the exact opposite, I've just fallen out of contact with everybody I know. None of them really were close enough to me to even notice. None of them are nearly close enough for me to get back in contact with, without me feeling incredibly awkward.

I only leave my house to go to the shop or university. I deleted Facebook because it was boring me, and honestly I was sick of people deleting me as a friend. I only use Twitter to shout at sports teams.

I only know a handful of people in my class, because the rest all did undergrad together. I can still pretty much talk to the guys in the class about sports during our 5 minute breaks, but as soon as class is finished, we all leave each other, and I'm alone again. That's about as close as my interaction with humans gets.

I hate doing homework. I just drift off, and something reminds me of how alone I am. Nothing I do matters to anyone. If I disappeared, I could count the number of people who would notice on one of my hands. I often fantasize about just hiding under my bed, or in my cupboard, until I waste away.

I tried to kill myself on Sunday, December 9th.  I took 48 Aspirin 500mg and a fistful of other over the counter painkillers too.  I thought I was so smart.  I did all the research in advance; I took two Claritin (benzos) an hour before all of the painkillers so I wouldn't cough it all up.  I drank to slow my reflexes even further and I hit my head until I put a big hole in the wall.  I hadn't eaten for three days too.  

But here's one part that my research never told me:  your mind drifts far away from you after you take that much shit.  I apparently dialed the boy that refused to date me and I cried and I moaned.  I don't remember what he was saying to me at the time but I know it sounded more genuine than anything he said to me while he had just wanted to fuck me.  He cried with me.

My best friend found me and shook me over and over while I kept trying to reassure her that this was what I wanted.  But I wasn't capable of saying what I really wanted to because of all the shit in my stomach.  The paramedics came and walked my sorry, almost successful ass out the door.

I was still wearing the red dress and push-up bra from the Christmas party in my house the night before. I started to throw up at this point and I noticed within the first three expulsions that the two Claritin came up entirely in tact:  failure.  Slow metabolism has always been a problem for me.

The next 24 hours were so awful that they would've made me reconsider, and even stop, my attempt in retrospect.  The heart monitors were attached, vitals taken, charcoal beverage.  And then my personal phobia:  blood tests.  Blood tests every fucking hour.  Each time I screamed so loudly that everyone in the waiting room could hear.

When I wasn't getting blood tests I was puking, crying, or bored out of my mind.  Another unpleasant effect of that many painkillers?  Your ears will ring for days.  You can barely hear a damned thing.

I'm a 26 year-old girl.  I have never had a boyfriend (even though everyone insists I'm pretty).  I was just used by someone that I had formed a one-way relationship with.  I can't get a good job or afford university anymore (tons of student loan debt).  I work all of the time to afford to live and I haven't had a vacation in years. But that night I learned something important:  it can always be worse.  

You can be too weak to walk, you can cry all night and have nurses and doctors look at you with mild disgust while they treat you.  You can be in a place where they won't let you eat, where you can't eat even if you want to.  Where you have to get blood tests until your lips are white and you don't even recognize yourself in the mirror.

Now it's two days later and my arms are very bruised up.  I'm constantly tired and I still have trouble getting down more than two bites of food at a time.  My friends are all either mad or concerned, and rightly so, I guess.  I feel even more lonely than before.

And one of the worst parts about it all though is that I can't talk with it about anyone.  I want to say what I was thinking, how I felt.  But the end result was all anyone heard or cares about.  Your reasons don't matter.

Well the last few weeks that started to change. I'm ready for a relationship again. So I've been going out more trying the bar scene. But I seemed to have lacked the courage to actually do more than make idle conversation with a woman.

Tonight was finally different. A few friends and I went to the bar after shooting some pool and drinking quite a bit (we walked don't worry.) Well this combination of a bunch of guys + liquor apparently brought the testosterone in me again. We were talking, dancing, and drinking with some pretty good looking girls and eventually I got the chance to have a nice conversation with someone. I ended up asking for her number and if she wanted to go out some time she seemed enthused and gave it to me. 

Well this number ended up being fake. But honestly. While it hurt to be rejected on my first real attempt back in the game. It feels so much better to have actually given it a go. I had a great night, had a good conversation with some beautiful women, and had a fun time with the boys. And frankly I don't really know if I just mistook her number or she deliberately gave me a fake one. Nor do I care.

I am feeling much better. Thanks to the positive comments people posted, I feel a whole lot better. I was very close to the edge and ready to do the worst thing I could have done. I was going to hang myself, and although that my have not been the quickest and easiest method I wanted to donate my organs to anyone that could use them. I am so glad that I didn't act on my feelings and had a lot of support because if I hadn't I wouldn't be here today. I've talked to my mother and she had told me they decided to stay a couple of extra days, when I told her about my birthday she basically told me to deal with it. I have then decided that staying here would not be very good for be, and have decided to save up anything I earn and move out when I am 18. After I had talked to my mother I was in a very rotten mood, so I decided to gather a rather large yield of vegetables and take them to a Women's and Children's shelter. They thanked me profusely, and I made my way back home via public transportation. I felt immensely better after that, and have been just trying to relax and really enjoy the peace while everyone is away.

I attended maybe 20% of the classes I enrolled in. I've already failed at least two of my four classes and still have the possibility of failing all four. I was already on Academic Probation, so this coming quarter everything will be even worse. Honestly, I'm not sure if they even let you retake that many classes. 

I'm posting because I'm confused. I'm on anti-depressants, I've been diagnosed, I've seen a counselor, but I'm doubting myself now. I feel like everyone was wrong and I'm honestly just lazy and unmotivated because that's who I am. 

I would say I'm depressed, but I feel like it would be an affront to those who have it worse than me. I've been in this sort of limbo (thinking I'm depressed but not depressed) since January. 

Since my depression hit only four years ago, I (like so many others) went from being intelligent, athletic, social, amiable, and confident to this ridiculous place I am now where I can't focus, I've gained forty pounds and six inches to my waist, I don't do anything besides school, reddit, and sleep, I am short with people and snap at them, and I lack confidence in who I am and who I want to be.

The first paragraph alone is a whole post in of itself when expanded. I already posted about it under a throwaway, and if you really want to read it, here is the link:
http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1atq9f/my_wife_cheated_on_me_last_week_and_then/

To make a long back story short, she started going to a doctor to get something for anxiety of flying because she was going on a trip to London. The doctor also diagnosed her with depression and prescribed her fluoxetine, so she started taking that about 2-3 weeks before her trip. She thought that our marriage was failing and that there was nothing that could be done to save it so she ended up cheating on me with someone else who went on the trip with her (it was basically one of those classes in college where you go somewhere for a couple weeks and write a couple papers on your experience and get credits). She had slowly been falling in love with him over the last year or so. When he was with her on the trip, he used her only to end his dry spell and broke her heart. When she came back, she was more broken than I've ever seen her. 2 days after she got back, she told me what had happened. My heart was broken, but she is the most important person to me in this entire world, so I vowed to her that I will right my wrongs, and I won't let this ruin our relationship. On top of all of this, she had been suffering through school for the last couple years, she didn't want to keep going and wanted to take a break but she felt that her family was pressuring her to finish as fast as she could so she has been overworking herself for the last 4 years. The trip was the final straw.

Fast forward a couple more days, I found her trying to dig into her wrists with a pair of scissors, and not just cutting across the wrists, she was trying to follow her veins ""to see if she could even feel it"". To this day she still doesn't remember doing that. She said when she looked at the mirror, and then saw the scissors sitting there, something else took over that wasn't her, and next thing she remembered is seeing me coming up the stairs and having scissors in her hand. Luckily the scissors were dull so she didn't even break the skin. She had a counseling appointment that day, and the counselor felt that she needed to stay at a facility for a bit. She thought it might be beneficial too so she went. I brought her things like pencils, her sketchbook, and some painting supplies because that stuff has always been therapeutic for her.

The facility discharged her a day later. The head psychiatrist had a one-on-one with her and told her that she felt she wasn't afraid for her life and that she believes what happened was only an impulse and that she wasn't truly suicidal. After I picked her up, I took about 2 weeks off of work. She told me about the place. They didn't really help her. Every time she sat down and was about to paint, they would pry her away from it to do group therapy sessions, in which she would listen to other people's problems, and then when it got to her and she explained what was going on, nobody had any type of advice for her at all and they moved onto the next person. Over the night she was kept up by someone screaming. When she finally did sleep, she was awoken early by an angry person yelling in the kitchen. It wasn't a very good experience for her.

I spent the two weeks with her and her counselor determined that she was only living her life for me, but not for herself, so all she needed to work on was loving herself again. I spent every second of every day with her, through ups and downs and I took care of her. But after that 2 weeks I had to go back to work. I was more confident in leaving her alone at that time because of the healing we had done, both individually, and as a couple. That week I had 2 days off immediately after the first day of work. My wife was at home, safe, when I got off work. She said she distracted herself all day, which is good, but also not good because I don't really feel good leaving her alone when she has to distract herself to keep herself from thinking suicidal thoughts. At this point, none of our family knows anything about what happened yet. The next day she spiraled down hard. She was talking about the suicidal thoughts and saying how she's trapped and can't get out and there's only one way, and then she had an anxiety attack, so I gave her some more of her anxiety medicine (clonazepam) and it took a really long time for her to calm down. Baths were always relaxing for her, so I got the bath ready and she sat in the hot water with me by her side. Then she put her face into the water and held it there as long as she could and expelled the air from her lungs and I had to yank her out of the water. She apologized profusely and said she didn't know what she was doing. I helped her dry herself and get dressed and we went back downstairs where she slept on the couch for at least 2 hours.

This is where I cracked. I've never had a panic/anxiety attack, and it caused me to make some bad mistakes because of a lapse of judgement. As soon as she woke up my breathing went into a frenzy. I tried calming it by taking deep breaths but it didn't work, it kept getting worse and worse and I was taking deep breaths and I was crying and I couldn't stop. I scared my wife, even though she had panic attacks herself, she hadn't dealt with anyone else having one. I've never seen her look so scared before. She didn't know what to do. She gave me one of her anxiety pills but even then it took me a long time to come down. She paced back and forth not knowing what else she could do. She sat down on the couch and cowered in the corner. When my attack was over and the medication had dulled me a bit, she took me for a drive through town like I did for her, just listening to music and not really driving in any specific direction.

After this is where I made the mistake that I regret the most. When we got home we decided to catch the bus downtown and we could go dancing and drinking. Mixing the alcohol and the medication was something that didn't even cross my mind at all....but I later found out it was on hers the whole time. We drank, and we kept drinking. We had lots of fun. I don't remember portions of that night because I did drink so much. We were able to stumble our way to a friends house where we stayed for the night. The next morning we woke up and began walking the rest of the way home and she was upset...and then she finally said it, the thought that didn't even cross my mind. She said she wanted to go peacefully last night. She hoped that drinking so much alcohol in combination with both of her medications that she would pass on during the night while she slept. Luckily, her depression medication was taken in the morning and the clonazepam was in the early afternoon, and we didn't drink until late at night, so it wasn't as if she downed her meds and immediately started drinking.

After this is where things got real scary for me. Halfway home, she completely forgot what had happened in her life. She suddenly reverted back to being 12 years old. She didn't know who I was, or where we were, and why I was holding her hand. She didn't remember where we lived but she instinctively knew which apartment was ours but didn't recognize it. We were greeted by our dog when I opened the door and she was excited to see a puppy but she didn't really know who the dog was. But she said she had a dream that her grandpa got her a dog around Christmas time and so she named her Noel (and that is actually what happened). After I talked to her for a bit she suddenly became very tired and fell asleep on the couch for at least an hour. When she woke up, she was back to herself but she didn't know how we got home and only remembers walking half of the way. She didn't remember reverting back to being 12 years old.

At this point her mom randomly showed up to run errands in town (she lives in a small town a couple hours away) and wants to have lunch with us, so we eat somewhere and then she dropped us off at the appointment we had for that day with her doctor. Her mom could tell something was up and noted that she seemed down, but she insisted nothing was wrong, and when we got out of the car, I told her that I can't hold my tongue on this situation much longer and that she can't keep avoiding her family. She told me that if I felt I needed to tell her mom then I could do that. We talked to the doctor about the previous couple days and how she spiraled back down as soon as I had to go back to work. He felt that she wasn't safe to herself and needed to go back to the facility. This is when her mom found out because she was our transportation, so when her mom showed up I went and brought her inside and the doctor explained the situation. We took her to the facility, but upon getting there, they said there were no beds left but there were other places that were in the same network in some other cities. Her mother didn't think that bringing her to another facility was a good idea so instead we agreed to let her go home with her mom, where she, her brothers, and her grandmother could keep an eye on her at all hours of the day, whereas I am unable to do so. She can't be left alone for even a minute or else the thoughts could come flooding back.

I'd ignored a text from him earlier in the day asking if I war okay, so I guess he took it as a sign that I was up to no good. I finally opened the door after about thirty seconds of him frantically ringing my door bell, and despite looking like he wanted to sock me in the face, he calmly walked me over to the kitchen and helped prepare some tea.

We talked for nearly two hours. About our experiences in the first semester of university. About his involvement in student government and my work with the debate team. About his plans for the future, and what I should work towards once I learn to manage my depression. About why I wanted to kill myself, and all the reasons why I shouldn't. We listened to a bit of our favourite band, talked shit about people we don't like, and made plans to see each other again tomorrow afternoon so he can check up on me. As he was leaving I gave him my knife, and he promised to call me at least once every hour until he fell asleep, ready to call 911 if I didn't pick up.

I just got off the phone with him for the last time about twenty minutes ago, and can confidently say that he saved my life tonight. If he hadn't thought something was wrong, I wouldn't be here typing this right now. Thanks to him I've gained a goal to strive for, and remembered the people who would never forgive me if I took such a selfish way out. Thank you, Ryan, for being there when I needed you most.

Last Sunday my brother got into an argument with my mother. We'll call him Sam, he's 15. I'm a girl and I'm 17. It began with Sam asking my mom ""Why are you opening dad's mail?"" They're divorced and live separately. It ended up with my mom putting Sam in a choke hold, me pulling her off of him, and him having to ride his bike 10 miles to my dad's house. That day my mom yelled bloody murder at me. She hit me. To be honest, I can't fully remember everything she said. My mind blocks it out. But what I do remember is basically being told that I was worthless, I was wrong, and I didn't do anything right. It got to the point where she was yelling at me, then her stupid boyfriend was yelling at me, and I was just crying. I ended up going into the bathroom and cutting myself. I rarely cut myself. Last summer was the last time I did. She drives me to it. Last summer every day I was crying as she spit out words of abuse. She'll scream at me, calling me a whore, a bitch, anything she can think of. I can't explain it really, but it just gets to the point where I'm so miserable, my insides hurt. My feelings I guess hurt so badly that cutting is like relief. It hurts less than the hurt inside. 

The next day I had to go work, I work in a garden and it is the most terrible job. It's so hot, I'm so little and  I have asthma. I over heat and it's a really hard job for me. I come home and my dad has dropped Sam back at home. Sam is just sitting on the front porch because my mother won't let him come inside. I just sit on the porch with my brother because I feel bad. He's my brother, I love him, and I'm not going to ostracize her like my mom, her boyfriend, and my little brother. So I sit with him. Later I go inside and I'm eating cake. I try to bring some out to my brother and my mom flips out. She and her boyfriend yell at me that I'm ""undermining her authority"" and other crazy shit. She tells me she's so ""sick of me"" and she can't handle me ""bullying"" her. She makes me pack my things, takes away my phone and car keys, and drives me and Sam to my dads. 

Now my dad lives in a shitty house. He has a couple other really ghetto roommates. The house is falling apart and filthy. He has some financial issues and he goes without eating good meals quite often. Most weekends we can't visit him because he can't afford it. So we go over there and his shower and toilet aren't working and he has no food. So he drives us back over and tells my mom he really just cannot take us. My mom is pissed that we're back and she makes us sleep outside. Is that legal?? She fucking made me and Sam sleep outside on the fucking grass. Now my dad would've driven right back and taken us if he knew, but my brother and I didn't tell him until the next day because he needed sleep to go to work. He works at 5 AM and it was 1 AM when he dropped us back off. He drives a truck all day and if he had been too tired he could fall asleep at the wheel or he'd have had to call in sick. He can't afford to miss work... my mom already lost her job he can't afford to lose his. 

In the morning when we woke up we tried going inside but my mom wouldn't let us. So I changed my clothes in the front yard because I just didn't fucking care at that point and walked a few blocks and had my friend pick me up. She's a damn saint. By the way, my mom turned my brother's phone off and she had taken mine so we couldn't contact her. We didn't tell her anything, just left, and spend the night at my friend's. The next day we went home and she finally let us in after a long talk with my dad. But she went to the police. She told them a twisted story about how my brother and I ""bully"" my mom and she just couldn't handle us anymore and it ended up with the cop agreeing that it was legal for her to leave us outside. He told her to call them next time and they would pick us up and put us into foster care if she couldn't handle us. The whole time her stupid boyfriend is defending her and telling her to call the cops on us and whatnot.

Now this is so frustrating. I can't even describe it fully. Because I am NOT a bad kid. I get good grades, I take all the extra curricular classes that are offered, I'm president of my school, I drive my brothers everywhere, I do all the grocery shopping. Since I began driving I've taken over the role of mother. By the time I was 6 my mom stopped giving a shit. Our house was filthy. There was so much shit in out house that you couldn't walk around. The floors were grimy and matted with spilled food and drink. The table and sink overflowed with dishes full of rotting food and maggots. She never cooked us dinner. Since I was six I've been eating whatever I can find around the house and when I got old enough I cleaned the house so that it wasn't a dump anymore. Now my mom has a routine of go to work, come home, grab a beer, head straight to her bedroom, sleep. She doesn't come out to talk to us, she never cooks dinner, or helps with dishes, or helps us with homework. Before I could drive there was never food in the house and when we needed something from the store we would wait weeks to get it because she never wanted to go. Essentially I am my brother's mom. You guys might not agree, but I do everything for them. When they're sick I care for them, I help them with homework, I buy their friend's birthday gifts and take them to the parties. I cook food, I wash dishes, I help them with school projects, I talk to their teacher's when the parent's are supposed to. And I really don't mind. I know that my mom isn't going to do it and I'm mature enough to know it needs to get done. So I don't ask questions, I just make sure everything is running. I'm constantly stressed with my home life and on top of that I'm extremely involved with school and so I'm always always stressed. Driving has been such a blessing because I can go out and buy myself clothes and food when I/my family needs it. She won't even buy me clothes. Everything I have I buy for myself. She will  go out and spend hundreds on clothes for herself but when I ask for jeans or a coat she tells me ""No, you'll just grow out of it."" Mind you, I'm 5'2"" and I stopped growing quite a while ago. 

So please. Imagine how frustrating it is when I practically run our household and then I'm berated constantly. I do everything I possibly can and yet I'm told that I'm a bitch, a whore, a liar, lazy, that I never listen, I'm irresponsible, I'm good for nothing. 

Lately, I just feel empty inside. I want to leave. I want to jump on a train and never look back. My mother drives me to this. She is the reason I cut myself, she's the one who makes me hate living. I feel helpless and unloved and I hate everything about my life living with her. She makes me feel crazy. Do you have any idea how much it hurts to know your mom has no problem calling CPS to take you away? It hurts so badly that the one person who is supposed to love you, your own mother, doesn't really care about you. 

I don't know what I expect from posting this. I guess I just want to know if you've experienced something similar and what your advice is. I just need to let this out.

I'm using my High School and University chemistry (and biology &amp; anatomy) education to its fullest potential in ending my life. I feel like this is a new low for me. 

There was a moment when I was looking up this information where I realised 'Holy fuck, if I had the reagents right now, I would have been dead 15 minutes ago...'
It was then that I looked down at my laptop and my notebook and realised I was genuinely taking notes on how to kill myself. I was planning it right down to the minute detail, like how to safely store the syringe after I had injected myself and safely dispose of any excess poison. 

I looked at all my scribbled formulae and notes and just laughed for half an hour. I was dux (aka: valedictorian)  of my school and I had a 3.95 GPA. Yet it's been six months of university (my first year) and I feel miserable all the time, my family literally hates me and wants me out of their lives (they don't care how that happens) and no workplace will hire me. I can't even just get through the day by putting one foot in front of the other because I literally can't even afford my train ticket to university, I've been unemployed so long...

So now the kid who was described as having 'excellent potential' and 'a bright future' aspires to do nothing more than die. Promptly. 

I suppose the point of this post is just to let everyone else have a giggle at the irony whereby the people who told me I would have a wonderful life are the very people who taught me the skills to end it.

1366154751.0,103,self.depression,1chuk0,I thought about how I'd be able to vaguely explain what depression is like to someone who has never experienced it.,FoxDown,121,18,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1chuk0/i_thought_about_how_id_be_able_to_vaguely_explain/,"I apologize in advance for being a shitty writer. There are many pieces that are missing and the whole thing could be vastly expanded upon, but the idea was to at least be able to create a rough outline of what depression and the fight against it can be like. 


I view my depression as a very large lake with a small island in the middle... it's always dark and dismal there, the thick water is pure black and reeks of failure and lost hopes. The island has one tree that grows nothing but rotten fruit- sure it'll get you by for a while but it makes you ill and isn't pleasant. 

The island is where you start. You generally spend your time sleeping or doing nothing. Occasionally other people will come floating by on small rafts, chattering about some sort of sunny, joyous mainland. You want to ask them to take you there, but there's never any room for you on their boat and the mainland is not visible from the island; you can't swim in the water and you don't have your own boat, so you eventually pass off that dream as a lost cause as well. 

Some people spend their entire life on this island,  either dying of old age or being swallowed up by the water. You can try sending out messages with passing boats, but there's no guarantee that the message will ever make it back so a lot of people don't bother, as to not annoy or inconvenience the passer-bys. 

If you're lucky and your message does make it to someone, it's said that there are strangers that come by at times and leave you supplies or magic seeds. You're told to drop one seed in the water every little while and if you get even more lucky, the result will be an escape off the island. This doesn't always work, and sometimes backfires; getting people too close to the water than they're prepared for. You try it, you feel as though there's nothing left to lose, so why not give it a chance, right? 

One day you look out	at the water and it doesn't look the same... there's a film of white on the top of it- something must be happening, so you continue with the seeds. Eventually that film starts solidifying; you try touching it, just to make sure you're not seeing things. 

It's cold. 

Taking a chance, you try stepping on it... with an air of surprise you find that you can. You start sprinting- the white substance isn't very comfortable, but its better than being on the island. This is your chance to make it to the ""mainland"" that everyone has been talking about so much. While you're daydreaming you suddenly hear a loud *crack* and stumble. The surface is breaking under your feet, giving way to the murky black bilge. You fall in and feel like you're drowning; the rushing current pulling you further and further away from your destination. 

In a flash, you're back on the island, not knowing what happened or why. What did you do wrong? Maybe you're meant to be on the island forever... no, that can't be right, there's more out there than just the island, and you want to experience it. You take some time to gather yourself and prepare to try again. 

Running back on to the icy coating, you see that there are hundreds of other holes along with the one you made (maybe they were left by other people just like you?) and you make a conscious effort to avoid them. Its going to be a long journey, you can tell, but you want to get to the mainland.

Thank you for letting me share this... it's probably the most productive thing I've done in the past few days and... I don't know, I just felt like I had to.

I've been depressed since I was about 13. I shrugged it off as just hormones and ageing, but as the years progressed I felt myself getting further in depression. I was homeschooled from about 5th grade until 9th grade which gave me social anxiety. When I was about 6 or so, my sister(2 years older than me) and I started playing around. We had sleepovers in each others rooms often and played ""Private Parts Touch"" and ""fake sex"". This eventually evolved into penetration. This all lasted until I was about 12 and then we stopped. I've told this to my counselor, but did not include the part where there was penetration. My counselor is the only person I told about this.

The previous paragraph has led to some of my depression. When my sister's first child was born(years after we stopped) she was living in another state. My family and I went to visit so we could be around the new baby. All the time we were there, my sister would not let me in the room when my sister was changing the baby. On the last day my mom finally asked her why I wasn't allowed near the baby when it was changed, and my sister finally admitted that she thought I would molest it. This crushed me that my sister actually thought I would do this. My instant thought was that because we fooled around as kids, she thought I would want that with her child.

In High School I had met a few friends. I went to a christian school. My mom decided I should go there, instead of being homeschooled anymore, after she found out I had cheated a whole year of math. So I get there and this is where I start to turn into an asshole. I don't remember how it happened but it was discovered that I have a small penis, and this became a recurring topic. The were times the guys at the school would want to see it, just to see how small it was and not in a gay way, so we go in the bathroom and I'd show them. The second year of high school there was this really annoying kid that nobody liked, except the principal. He would always get in my place and I did nothing. One day he started punching me, and right as I shove him off of me, the principal comes down the stairs and sees me push him. I get ISS, he gets nothing.

It was also during my second year that my grades went down. I passed senior high with ease, though I could've had a lot higher grades.

Fast forward to me in college. I went to college out of state, barely any friends from high school, none at my new school. I went to a Christian college and met some people there. Still with the social anxiety, it took me a bit to warm up to them there, but eventually I was back at my old habits of streaking through the dorms, sack-tagging people, and generally being a lazy asshole who didn't go to classes. I had a group of friends that I hung out with, and even with them I was expected to be the asshole...so that's what I was.

The group of friends I had tolerated me, but I always felt I should take it to the next level. If someone told a dirty joke, I wold tell a dirtier one. I felt as if my friends didn't want to be around me because of their expectancy of me to be the asshole. So I began to separate myself. At this point, I feel I have no friends, and really I don't, I am sleeping non-stop, not doing any homework, not going to classes, hardly eating but overeating when I do. I thought I was at my lowest point. One night I even cried myself sick. I started drinking, not much, but the only reason I drank was to try and escape myself.

I eventually failed out of that college and moved home to attend the local one. I started taking anti-depressants and they worked, but I felt that the feeling of happiness they gave me was wrong. I new it was just physical happiness and not mental, so I stopped taking them. My depression hit me like a ton of bricks and I eventually failed out of that college. My mom was so disappointed. I had put her $40,000 in debt and had nothing to show for it. And on top of that, both times I failed out I lied to her and said I was doing fine. That went well until they sent certified mail that told of my failures. My mom was so upset, both angry and sad, because she knew I could do better, but I never told her of the depression I felt.

After I failed out of college a second time, I moved back close to the college I went to out of state. I moved in with my old roommate and lived there for a while. It felt good to be independent, but I neglected to find a job for the first six months I was there, living off of the parent loan refund my mom let me have. I eventually got a job and all was well. Then I started drinking again. This time it was copious amounts in short intervals. I drank because I hated myself and didn't have the courage to get help. Through all of this I never harmed myself physically, but there were plenty of suicidal thoughts.

Eventually things fell apart with my roommate, and we decided to part ways. I loved it there, and enjoyed my job, but I felt as if my best friend no longer wanted me around, so I came home. I decided to try and re-enroll in college back at home. I was/am 24 and had to fight to get my gpa up above a 2.0 last semester. Since I felt as if my best friend didn't want me, I had already failed college twice, and I was back home living with my parents, I felt at an all time low. I finally sought help from a doctor and a counselor. I have been on meds since last semester, but they don't seem to help. My counselor doesn't help because I refuse to tell her the whole truth. I'm terrified that if I truly open up to her that I will spook her or something, because she's such a nice lady. I am lonely, I have no friends around here. My best friend who is still the roommate I was speaking of, is also depressed and slightly suicidal, but not as bad off as I am. We get along again, but I have no comfort in him.

Now we come to tonight. The reason I finally decided to type this is because I just finished masturbating to a mixture of pedophilia and incest. The pedophilia is not as common for me to masturbate to as the incest is. I have successfully masturbated to several types of porn, some of the worst stuff you can think of. I hate myself afterwards to the point I want to kill myself, but my belief in an afterlife keeps me from doing this. So I just sit here in my shame and cry, masking my tears so my parents don't here. I still lie way too much, and if I don't lie I just don't say anything. I have lusted after many women, most of them were married or engaged. I wanted them so badly that when I couldn't sleep at night, which is every night, I would lie awake and dream about them. I would plan or lives out. I also dream about my death. I wish so much that I would get a rare disease or incurable cancer and I would just die. I would imagine my funeral and see all the people mourning. They would talk about the good old days that they secretly hated, but would pay their respects because of some sort of social obligation.

Sometimes when I masturbate, I think of the times when my sister and I would fool around. I think of rape. Rape is one of my most visited subjects when it comes to masturbation. I know I couldn't do it, but I think of it. I think of ways that I could kill people. Even in social situations as I'm listening to their talking to me I can visualize me killing them and then others out of necessity. I dream of a day when I can take over the world, just to simply blow it up. I think of how others are so evil, and how evil I am and I can help but feel it should be eradicated. I go to church out of habit. I maintain my beliefs, but have no faith. I don't know why I do or think the things I do. I want to believe it's a scientific reason with my brain, but I also want to blame the God that I still believe in. I want to blame God because if He does exist, how in the hell could he make someone like me? I hope one day this thought process will lead me to lose my beliefs, and I'll finally be able to kill myself, but I can't see that happening. I have an ideal suicide if I ever decide to do it. I want to jump off of a tall building and land directly on my head. I know that my will to kill myself will allow me to land head first. But, again, my beliefs are between me and that utopia.

Well, if you've read this, then I thank you for your time. I need to end this book before it gets too out of hand. I don't care if you comment, I don't care if you vote. I mainly just need to have my story out there. And I'm ashamed to say, but this is nowhere near the full thing. Thank you for stopping in.

**tl;dr: I think of myself as a horrible person that has no reason to live, but will never kill myself so long as I hold on to my belief in God and an afterlife...**

Some slight back story:

WoW addict since 06.
Failed college
Quit my job. 
Got evicted last Thursday.
Been suicidal for almost 7 years. 

I'm really at a loss for what to do. Its pretty simple when I spell it out, but for some reason, I just cant bring myself to get another job. I know it won't make me happy, and ill find myself in the exact same position. Last night I spent the night in my car for the first time in 20 degree weather. 

I have no family to fall back on, they accused me of breaking into their business and stealing tools and computers, so I haven't talked to them since mid November. I was cleared of all charges once I agreed to a warrantless search of my apartment and a polygraph test. They still don't believe me. If I did do it, I wouldn't be homeless. 

I'm too scared to ask any of my friends for help, all of my friends come from wealthy families and don't understand how someone can fall through the cracks of society. 

So here I am, crying my eyes out in the middle of an Arbys, typing this out because out of all the 12,000 people in my town, I feel comfortable talking to 0 of them. I don't know what to do anymore, life has turned into an uphill battle that really isn't worth fighting anymore. Ive had my experiences, I've been across the world, and I've felt love. There really isn't much left for me to do, especially if I do not have the financial capcity to do anything. 

I tried guys, I really did. But the more I try, the more I realize that I do not fit in this world full of optimistic, hard working people. I do not want to work for anything, I would rather die.",,False,self,t5_2qqqf,False,,,True,t3_16yfa2,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/16yfa2/officially_homeless/,

It’s like I’m standing in a forest. There is no one within anyone in ear shot. There is a wind blowing. It’s blowing harder and harder. It’s screaming at me, telling me I’m worthless. The wind is pounding me. It’s lifting my up and slamming me against the trees. And whenever a person wanders into the forest, the wind blows away my scream before it reaches them. 

The few times that a person hears, they come to me. But they tell me that they don’t feel the wind. All they see is me running into the trees. They wonder why I’m doing it. They tell me to stop, not realizing that I can’t. They try to grab me, but the wind is stronger. Except that they don’t feel the wind. So they think it’s me. Then they let go. Sometimes they yell at me. That it’s my fault, that I’m doing this to myself. 

I try to scream to them, to tell them about the wind. They try to listen, but since they don’t know, they either doubt or don’t know how to deal with it. I’m the only one who can see the demon wind attack. And I’m not strong enough to fight it. No one understands enough to help. So I’m going to feel pain again.

Sometimes I want to give up because whatever I'm trying to learn seems so difficult, but feels like it should be easy. I've lost my ability to do basic maths, I can't understand basic directions or instructions. I feel like a complete moron all the damn time. Surely this can't just be because of depression? How can it affect my mind so much? How can the most basic of things now seem to be so difficult or impossible? It's ruining my life, I don't have any confidence any more. 

This can't be me, I used to be bright in school, got fantastic grades, always ahead of the class, I passed my degree with a great score, yet now it feels like if someone asked me what 2+2 was I'd struggle to answer them. 

I was talking with my boyfriend and he had to explain something to me three or four times, after the fourth I just pretended to understand just so I didn't feel like an idiot.

Maybe we can get this subreddit more active (I'm aware that it is pretty active now) and help others as well.

Okay, so now onto my personal struggle. I'm a single mom, 22, living with some supportive family members and other family members who I feel contribute to some of my depression and anxiety. Yesterday I had what I think was the worst day so far. I can't really explain how I felt. My emotions were a jumble, my heart was racing, and I just didn't feel *right*. Today I went and talked to a counselor and got some therapy sessions set up. She advised me that it might be a good idea to stay in a psychiatric ward for a few days, and I considered it, but I don't want to be away from my daughter that long and I think getting help from my therapist and doctor is a good step for me. 

I'm not one to talk to people about my emotions. Ever since I was diagnosed and tried talking to my family about it, they let me know that it would be in my best interest not to tell many people because they were afraid my daughter's father would find out and could potentially use it against me sometime in the future. My hope is that since this is an anonymous site and this subreddit has a good community, I'll be able to talk with others going through what I'm going through and help myself and others here.

I know advice doesn't always help depressed people, but here's some anyway.",DidntClickGuy,118,22,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/dnknr/i_am_experienced_with_depression_i_know_advice/,"I just learned about r/depression.  I'm so glad it's here.

I have had experience with depression since I was 12 or 13, and I'm 36 now.  I have had a long history with the Black Eyed Dog.  I want to share with you some of my experiences and some things I've learned along the way.

I have suffered a lot over the years from this illness.  I missed a lot of valuable adolescent experiences and growth opportunities.  At the time I saw several reasons that this happened: they weren't worth my time, or I didn't have the energy, or they were associated with people I hated.  I wasn't until much later that I put the pieces together and realized that all this negativity had a root.

I'm still learning how to deal with it.  I don't consider myself an expert by any means, but I look around here and I see a lot of people who are really struggling.  I figured some of this stuff could be helpful to someone, so here goes.

* Many of the things you need to do in order to deal with depression involve things that depression makes especially difficult.  That's why it's such a bitch of a condition.  Understand that if you intend to undertake a path to health, you will need to do a lot of things you really don't want to do, and exert energies you feel like you don't have.  It will suck...temporarily.  Face up to the suck.  Know the suck is coming.

* Get into counseling now.  Don't wait.  You're missing out on some things if you don't start facing up to your depression with seriousness.  You may not realize how badly it has affected you - accurate self-assessment is hindered by depression.

* Not every counseling experience is equal.  Cognitive therapy is very popular at the moment, which is a kind of therapy that tries to point out to you that some of the things you're thinking don't line up with reality.  And that's good, it's important to see that.  People respond to reasonable discussions.  Depression, however, doesn't always do that.  So if you don't think you're being helped, KEEP LOOKING until you meet a counselor who says things that resonate with you.

* The fact that you experience serious depression makes you different from most people.  That experience is valuable.  When your self-esteem is at its lowest ebb, keep this in mind.  Just because you choose to do something about your depression, it does not mean you have to be Susie Sunshine (thank Christ).  You are still you, and you don't have to be like everyone else, as long as you're not suffering.

* Don't reject medication just because it's medication.  Talk to people who have used antidepressants, and get a feel from them what it's like to use them.  They really do help and can be lifesaving during your worst times.  I had an argument with my shrink about taking them.  I said, ""I don't want my joys to be dulled by a chemical.""  She said, ""When was the last time you experienced enough joy to make this a valid concern?""  ""Touché,"" I said.  I refer to my meds as ""shock absorbers"" because that's really what they are.  They just set a soft limit of how much negativity I can exert in response to any given situation.

* Depression is a condition of the body that can influence the condition of the mind.  Your health habits can influence your mental state enormously, and they can be incredibly important to whether or not you have a good day or a bad one.  Keep close tabs on your feelings.  It sounds incredibly dismissive to hear that ""life is not worth living"" can sometimes directly result from the 3 Diet Cokes you had at lunch or the 2 hours of sleep you got last night, but this is just the way things are.  The sooner you can accept that, the sooner you can move on and start living.

* There is a difference between *depression* and *despair.*  Depression can be effectively managed; despair is deadly.  Watch one so that it does not become the other.

* Get out and take a walk.  Step away from the Internet.  The Internet isn't a solution to your problems, it's another problem.  Except for this post on Reddit by me.  Trust it implicitly, it is pure goodness.  :)  Fresh air and exercise can't hurt you if you are depressed.  They can only help.

* Some of us have had very bad times indeed, where the despair has taken control and driven us to the breaking point.  And then it recedes and we can pretend to be normal again.  But when you experience some of the most intense blackness, you can't just bounce back and expect everything to be all right.  You need time.  Suicidal thoughts are traumatic and like any other trauma, they need to be healed.

* Above all, monitor your condition.  Recognize that every one of those times when you were in such despair that only cutting or drinking seemed to help, it started off with a mood change that was barely noticeable.  If you can just catch these things before they spin out of control, you can save yourself a lot of grief, effort, and recovery time.

Also, most likely she will call my doctor and try to get my help or whatever... But I am really scared to talk to someone.


Have you ever tried therapy, or talking to a psychiatrist? What was it like? I really don't do well with meeting new people, making eye contact, or holding a conversation so the idea of talking to a complete stranger that I am not comfortable with is kind of terrifying.


And on top of everything else I am just really worried she won't understand. I don't understand myself, so how in the world am I supposed to attempt to explain myself? Half the time I feel numb, sometimes I feel high (like really excited, happy, and hyper but also more sad than ever all at the same time- yeah I know that sounds really crazy) And then the other times I just feel sad and want to sleep all day, not talk to anyone, or try to find some distraction. And it's not that I am incapable of laughter, it's just that those feelings are so fleeting it doesn't even matter.

It is just so confusing. If I could describe myself in one word, that would be it. Confused. I feel cloudy in my head, numb half the time, in pain half the time, constantly looking for distractions. I find it annoying to talk about emotions and crap like that, tedious even. I also feel hopeless sometimes. Like this is going to just go on forever. And even in the brief moments that sometimes last for a few months but never longer than that I cannot feel truly happy because I am always waiting to feel sad again. It's like it always comes back.

Depression has an intense hold on my life that I cannot shake, but I think getting help is a way I have to try. I need to be free.

**EDIT 1:** I just sent this post, edited a bit, in a text to my mom. I was too scared to tell her in person. I tried but couldn't. Now I am waiting for her to respond. I am shaking I am so scared. Oh gosh. Everything may be about to change.

**EDIT 2:** My mom and I had a good heart to heart last night. Turns out she has been on anti-depressants since she was 23 and she understands completely. They have helped her wonders she says. She set me up with a psychiatrist who also does therapy and specializes in adolescence depression/ anxiety. I am reluctantly optimistic.

""Any review is biased. Here is my biased review from just one meeting. Dr. Brink is a Horrible psychiatrist. No social skills, none. Very cold demeanor. Gets frustrated with the client when her suggestions are not applicable. Tells the client he is ""all excuses"". God forbid the brain be more complicated than just one 30 minute session. Doesn't like the client to voice concern over strong medication suggestions, like Lithium. When she deems the client to not be compliant because a solution hasn't been met in the first meeting, she interrupts the client, stands up abruptly, and waves her finger to the door while coldly saying ""thank-you"". Yup, my opinion is biased, but I still would say she is a detriment to anyone who suffers with mental illness and a danger to anyone who is suicidal (not myself right now, thank goodness). I waited 9 months for this appointment. I walk away from this experience feeling like a failure and a quitter to all my pursuits. I walk away feeling my illness is my fault""

***Update***
I asked my cousin who is a counselor for his opinion. Here is what he wrote. 
***Ok. You ask me, ""was she right to treat me that way?"" to which I say no... I want to go a bit ""meta"" here so you can understand what happened. What you're describing is a power struggle. She is making some suggestions on why things are not working for you, you are saying that her suggestions don't work for you [things are ok at this point], THEN she basically tells you you're not trying hard enough/have a personality disorder/are fine and exaggerating your difficulties (which has an overall shaming affect). A good therapist will never get into a power struggle because it is never helpful and is rather harmful, as you are acutely feeling.
The thing is, she's not a counsellor and her education is primarily on the medical side of mental illness. In other words, she is not strong in the relational side of support which is actually the greatest determiner of success in psychotherapy.
Btw, I don't suffer from depression or anxiety to your degree but could not write a text book.
Let's redeem a bit of what happened. She was hopefully trying to encourage you by showing you the accomplishments of someone who struggled with mental illness? Though, in fact, it had the opposite affect of shaming unsure I would have been discouraged by that example too. So, fail.
Also, I know what you mean about jobs like Starbucks. Honestly, I've been confiding in others that Starbucks is a bit humiliating for me (it is also more anxiety producing than my other job). Actually, having a degree makes it worse. I have an M.A. and I'm making minimum wage? Twice clients have come in for coffee and how does that make me feel? Like a failure.
I think there is hope for you cous'. Look for the needle of truth in the haystack that psychiatrist threw you in. You said it kinda made sense when she said it's a career or no job for you, the all or nothing mentality. Is there anything you can glean from that?
Again, I'm sorry to hear about your horrible experience. She really needs to learn her some empathy. Hrmmm...what if you found a 'sliding pay scale' therapist in your area? I really do think it's your best option right now. I know the money part of it sucks, but what if it allowed you to work even part-time? That would pay for itself pretty quickly. Anyway, let me know what you think of all I said, especially if any of it was offensive.

So my primary problem is actually anxiety which then fuels depressive episodes.  A huge part of my anxiety problem is that I need external validation to be okay.  Everyone needs that to some degree but sometimes I need it to an extreme degree.  As such, when people are dicks to me on the internet (or in real life) it just makes me really sad.  It doesn't matter that I know they're the ones being the assholes or that they're the ones who look like jerks.  I all of a sudden start to doubt myself and wonder if I really am stupid, if I really am a bitch, if I really am worthless (none of these things are true). 

I hate that I let assholes get to me. I especially hate it because it is a double whammy.  They are being rude to me and also they're not living up to the standards that I have for my fellow human beings.  If I were having a conversation with someone in person there's no way they'd use the language they do on the internet.

It just frustrates me on multiple levels and I end up feeling like shit warmed over.

Reminds me of the first time I played Morrowind. I built for archery and sneaking, but later realized I only rarely did either one. 

I'm about to graduate, I'm older than most of my classmates (27), I lost my apartment after my roommate unexpectedly moved out and left me with six months of a lease I couldn't afford, I live in a three bedroom apartment with my mom and sister. I've gained about thirty pounds since I moved back, I don't even recognize myself in the mirror anymore. 

I'm good at a lot of things, but passionate about none of them. I'll probably be starting grad school this time next year and working part time in my chosen field, but I won't finish grad school (full PhD track) till I'm like thirty five. 

I just feel like I pissed away my twenties doggedly pursuing a degree I don't really know that I want. 

I started college at 23, a high school dropout. I didn't get to choose my undergrad institution, just went wherever would accept me, so I've spent the last four years busting my ass in order to make damned sure I can choose my graduate institutions. 

I've got all the right references and letters of recommendation, owing to the fact that I never once really went out with friends when I could have been studying, interning, or picking up volunteer hours in the labs. But even so, I'll be lucky to finish my PhD before I'm 35. Now I'm here, I've ""proven"" I can do it, and I feel like I'm going to be half dead before my life even begins. 

I've put everything aside for school, figuring I can just do it later once I've got my shit together. But I'm here, three years away from my thirties, I haven't had any ""college relationships"", I haven't even had a girlfriend since high school, I haven't done any partying, I've pushed all my friends away in favor of internships and lab volunteer hours. 

But even after all this time, all this work, I've basically just worked my way to the middle of the pack, I don't have a resume strong enough for the really competitive programs. 

The worst part is, I don't even like my field.

All my skill points are in archery but I fucking hate bows. I've worked really hard for a life I don't want, for a life I don't think I've ever wanted. Not to mention all my early mistakes (dropping out, not going to college when I should have) are coming back to bite me when I'm almost always the oldest dude in my classes. It's really hard to like yourself when you're almost thirty and you're living in an apartment with your mom (and your 18 year old sister who's moving out and starting college in the fall).

It's a confession that I don't care if anyone reads. 

I'm not sure where to begin, I'll just start with the facts of my life. I'm a guy, 19, at the second semester of my freshman year at a state school. I have a scholarship for all tuition and fees for my entire degree that I know I am going to lose. I've been unable to work on my assignments and have fallen massively behind in all my classes. Only now that I've been unable to even attend my lectures do I realize that...

I am a liar. 

I've lied to my professors. I told them I was sick, or I'm fine. I've denied that help that I've been offered because I was unable to tell the truth.
I've lied to my family. I told them I'm fine, that school was going well, that I had no problems that needed airing. 
I've lied to a counselor. I couldn't even be honest to ask for help for my real problems from the one I approached for help! 
But mostly, I've lied to myself. I denied my own problems. I've denied  my depression from the moment I began attending this school. Even more, I been denying my own emotions for most of my life. 

But now I feel like I'm getting ahead of myself.

I can't think, yet I can't stop having thoughts. My mind is a clouded distracted mess that I can't get to focus. 
My mind keeps me awake. I lie in bed at night for hours, tired yet unable to relax. When I finally do sleep, it never lasts long. I wake up every few hours and lie there, thinking. I stay like this for far longer than I should, lying in bed for most of the day yet never getting enough sleep.
I can't bring myself to get food. I've gone five days with out eating so much as a snack, and yet I still can't bring myself to get food. I've gone to the store and returned with only water and soda, despite knowing I need to feed myself. I've lost so much weight that I've had to convince my family I have been exercising.
I've felt moments of severe guilt over what I haven't done, yet I still can't stir myself to action.
I've felt moments of severe moments a panic and impending doom, yet I sit paralyzed in my chair.
I've sought comfort in my hobbies, interests, and books. Yet I grow bored of them all, and I can't finish five pages of a *comic* book.
I've watched my dad, the only one observant enough in my family to notice something might be wrong, worry that I'm only distant because he wasn't a good enough father while I was growing up.
I've felt truly alone for the first time despite having been alone so many times before and enjoyed, and blame myself for it.
I've stopped being who I thought I was, and hate who I am now. 

I haven't told you who I was...

I was a ""smart kid"". I truly enjoyed learning and remembered almost anything that I found interesting. I enjoyed school and schoolwork. 
I was shy and awkward and didn't have any close friends, but also had no enemies. I got along with almost anyone, but could never relate to anyone more than shallowly. This never bothered me, I was content.
I was the youngest of five boys. I was behaved, I never did anything I thought was wrong. I did not go along with the group. I was an individual long before it was expected of me.
I loved nature, biology, and everything to do with life. Ants fascinated me in particular. I spent many days alone in the woods, and this moments still feel the happiest in my memory. 
I was never a disappointment, to my parents or myself. 
I rarely lied, and I stunk at it.
I was someone I liked, and I don't know when that changed, but it did.

I was once that person, I'm not anymore. 

I can't ask for help, not yet anyway. 

I don't know what I'll do.

The last decade for me has been mostly persistent sadness interspersed with episodes of depression while I fought to do 'normal' things like working and having relationships. I've recently finally started fighting it and seeking help - at least 10 years too late but I feel I'm turning a corner now. Here are some things I've learned. Hopefully they are of some use to fellow sufferers.

1. **There are remedies for depression but there is no QUICK fix for depression.** It will take a significant amount of time and effort from yourself and from others to drag you out of it. If we're talking about medication, it can take several months to try out a particular antidepressant (and the same again for every subsequent 'brand' your doctor prescribes). It can also take months to wean yourself off of antidepressants. With talk therapy it also takes at least a couple of months to see results. A lot depends on how committed you are to beating depression, and how much energy you can invest in fighting it.

2. **Depression and being prone to depression is something you will need to learn to live with.** Work on accepting that depression is a part of you and then work on getting better at living with it. Example: ""I'm very good at baking cakes. I'm not so good at being happy but I'm working on that."" It is possible to develop coping mechanisms but those of us who are prone to depression will always have to work just that little bit harder than 'normal' people to maintain a positive mood.

3. **Depression is not caused by other people or their actions, but by how you react to them.** You are not depressed because of that recent event/relationship breakup/family problem/financial problem/work problem but because of how your mind processes, overanalyses and exaggerates these issues and converts them into negative emotions.

4. **Depression will affect your perception of EVERYTHING.** It is a bit like being under the influence of alcohol or drugs. It will colour all your reactions. It will distort how you think about things. It will distort how you talk about things. Keep this in mind because it will help you identify negative thought and behaviour patterns and work on them. When you say 'No one can help me', that's depression talking. When you think 'I'm worthless', that's depression thinking. Depression wants you to stay depressed. The toughest thing about fighting depression is actually ignoring the sabotage and paralysis caused by depression and taking steps to work on getting better.

5. **Depression is not a sign of weakness or failure.** Struggling with depression in silence on your own is not a sign of strength. Don't let your depression tell you otherwise.

6. **Depression affects your self-esteem.** Try to stop being so hard on yourself. You are not an ugly loser, depression just makes you think you are.

7. **Being in a relationship will not solve your depression.** Dear foreveralones and 25-year-old virgins; I'm terribly sorry you're having problems getting it on with someone but please don't expect finding a boyfriend or girlfriend will magically cure all your problems. Also, when you're only 17 and you obsess about how you're never going to find someone, you are letting depression and negative thinking take the wheel. Don't expect someone else to fix your problems. The only person who can start kicking depression is YOU. Once you have your depression under control, you will be more confident and therefore more attractive to other people.

8. **You NEED to talk to someone about how you feel, if only because it will help you vent and gain some perspective.** The best place to start is someone close to you, family or friend. Don't wait for someone to notice something is wrong. Depression is good at hiding, and non-depressed people are quite boneheaded when it comes to recognising someone might be depressed. Don't think about 'being a burden' or 'not wanting to upset them' - ask for help. They care about you and will want to help you. If the situation was reversed, you would be there for them if they asked for help, right? Get help. Rally the troops.

9. **Depression and anxiety can be inherited.** If your mother or father has a history of depression or anxiety, talk to them about how you feel! They will understand because they've experienced the same feelings. They may also have valuable insights on how to deal with it. By the way, getting closer to your parents, even if it's over something as horrible as mental problems, is always a good thing.

10. **Know your enemy.** There is plenty of material on the internet about depression. Read up and know what you're up against.

11. **See your doctor.** There might be an underlying physical or hormonal problem that is causing your depression. Your doctor can also prescribe medication and refer you to mental health services so you can get some professional help. Keep in mind that medication alone does not help you work on your depression, it just helps you live more easily while you work on your depression. Try to always combine medication with a form of talk therapy (1-on-1 or group). Don't be satisfied with a prescription without a referral.

12. **If you REALLY want to get better, you will be willing to try anything to get better.** If you say things like 'I don't believe in medication/therapy', chances are you either are not quite ready to work on getting better yet; or your depression is making you think nothing will help or that you don't deserve help.

13. **You deserve nice things. You also deserve basic things like meals, showers and clean clothes.** Neglecting to do these things is not only a form of self-punishment, it also makes you feel even worse.

In crowds I just sink into a corner and disappear if nobody says anything to me. Which they never do.

My problem is I can't make new friends. I think perhaps I internalized certain social stigma that I never learned to get over. Even if I have someone's contact info on phone, or facebook, or whatever, I don't contact them because that would be weird. Too forward. Why would anyone hang out with a loser like me anyway. (I understand the flaws in my logic, but nonetheless that's how my brain seems to work). Can't contact guys because it might be interpreted as gay (what the fuck, brain stop it. you know better). Can't contact girls because the only two girls my age who I actually know, are one friend's girlfriend, and another friend's girlfriend. 

Tried student groups and organizations, but the vanish-into-the-corner phenomenon inevitably occurs and then I don't bother going back because nobody noticed me, why should I go spend another few hours mulling over all the reasons why I am incapable of talking to humans even when they're right in front of me.

I'm sitting here watching AMC's ""The Walking Dead"", on my day off of the gym that I rarely take, I'm watching it, and it is the episode where they discover the walkers in the barn. It's a very emotional episode dealing with many side affairs and emotionally charged tangents of the story. Anyways. I'm watching Maggie and Glen, and how she really seems to be falling for this guy, and how they are growing together with eachother. And each kiss you really see the passion that is there. So I pause the episode, to go upstairs and make a shake, and realize, I need to turn the lights on. I'm actually a bit scared, worried about the complete darknss upstairs and it hits me.. I'm feeling.. things. emotions. anything at all. Before, for a few years I've secretly been going through some depression, but holding it in, with things that normal people take as sad or passionate, I rub off as basically what the fuck ever, big deal, give me a break.. When now I see it is because I was wishing the whole time, I could feel those things, and actually care about them. I never cared about outcomes or what would happen, and to be completely honest, about much at all. I know that's not much of an amazing thing to alot of people, but for me, it truely was amazing. I've been literally waiting years for this moment, and moment to show me there is still hope, and to hold tight and maybe somebody good will come my way too. Not to try so hard to make everything perfect and be happy with the little things in life. I really honestly.. am happy.

1365265130.0,92,self.depression,1bsul6,My depression had been getting better. And then I had a birthday party last night and nobody showed up.,billie_holiday,106,14,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1bsul6/my_depression_had_been_getting_better_and_then_i/,"Female, 22 as of yesterday. In the last six months I've been getting a lot better. I'd been more optimistic, I'd been giving myself more praise and compliments. I wasn't letting people, or bad karma in the universe get me down. I had been telling myself that things just happen as they are supposed to, even the bad. I was being outgoing and letting people ""in"" with the very open fact that they could hurt me. I was just trying to be optimistic about everything. 

I should also note that being depressed had instilled a very negative attitude towards my worth. I was trying to take the ""fake it 'til you make it"" stance and just assume that if I pretended that people cared about me, then they did. If I pretended I was worthy of love and attention, then I was. I was trying to be confident that I deserved as much love as everyone else.

Last weekend I decided to make a facebook event for my approaching birthday at a club. All week I got excited about seeing all my friends in the same place, many of which RSVP'd that they'd be going and then telling me they were excited. I hadn't had a birthday party in ages, mostly due to the fact that I felt like I didn't deserve one... that my existent or birthday wasn't important to anyone else. But this year I felt differently. I'd ask people when I saw them if they were coming, and they'd all respond with ""most definitely"" or something like that, and it would just build me up to be happier. Despite it being uncomfortable to accept that all these people would be coming to see *me*, I was excited.

Yesterday was my birthday. I message the group telling them to text me if they need directions to the club or any help. At this point I'm expecting 15-20 of my closest friends. I got excited and put on my new outfit that I bought. I was excited. I showed up to the place with my boyfriend and his roommate. And we wait. My friend E shows up and hangs out with us. I'm calmly excited for everyone else to arrive so we can start dancing and singing our brains out to 90s music. This night, for one day a year, as supposed to be about me. Me and my boyfriend are getting texts about guests arriving, but needing directions or something. All of them say, ""okay, I'm on my way, I'll be there soon.""

It's about 10:30 now, and my friend F arrives. F and myself aren't really close friends, in fact I've never hung out with her outside of school. But I invited her, and it was nice for her to show up. My friend E says that she has to leave early, so she buys us a round of shots and leaves. So now it's this girl I hardly know, F, my boyfriend, his roommate, and myself. I'm still holding out for my friends to arrive. I start text messaging them, asking when they'll be there and they either give me the go-around of, ""I'm still on my way,"" or ""Yeah, sorry for the late notice but I can't make it."" I am starting to get discouraged.

F wants to dance, so we go out there and dance. Then she basically asks for me to wing-man for her so she can find a hot person to dance/go home with. I repeat, I *barely* know this girl. I tell her I'm would like to go back to the table where my boyfriend and his roommate are talking and watching our bags. She whines that I should hang out with her. I get the ""this night is not about me anymore"" thoughts into my head and suddenly I'm wing-manning and being a bathroom companion. I go back to the table to check my phone several times to see that nobody has gotten back to me and therefore I just assume nobody else is showing up.

It's approaching midnight now and we'd have to leave soon to catch the last subway back. My boyfriend asks if I'm having fun and I drunkenly shake my head no. He makes some comment about how weird it was that nobody showed up and I couldn't hold back tears. So I hug him and suck it up. I tell F that we are leaving and ask her if she wants to come with us. I now felt responsible for this wasted girl I hardly know, and felt obligated to make sure she got home safe. She said she was staying behind with some people, and that she didn't want to go with us. I told her to text me when she got home safely, or I'd worry. She says fine, and we leave.

As we walk back, I become the Mama Goose because my boyfriend and his roommate are more sloshed than I am. We get on the subway all right, and go home. My boyfriend comes back with me. It takes about 10 minutes before I start crying. I had held it in for so long, basically since E left us. I reflect on the night. Most of my friends just never responded. Others told me they'd be there soon and then never showed. Others canceled at the last minute. One of my closest friends tells me that she's in a completely different state and wants to get lunch with me when she's back, even though she TOLD me she want coming.

It just made me feel worthless and not worth anybody's time or effort. My boyfriend, bless his heart, is just constantly my optimistic rock who just kept telling me that I could now see who my *real* friends were and the true colors of my other ""friends."" I also found out later that my boyfriend's roommate felt obligated to go, but didn't necessarily *want* to go. But it still doesn't explain the crappiness it feels to put in effort into these friendships, and be willing to do anything for these people, for them to not give a shit about me. I wasn't even upset at the people who clearly told me they couldn't come. I was pissed off at the people who only upon me texting them, did they admit that they weren't going or lied to me about being on their way. I put myself out there fore *one* day, just *one* day I wanted to be about me, as I *never* expect anything ever to be around me. I never expect to win any awards, or be selected for anything, or have any confidence that I deserve people to care about me... except for this one day. And now I just feel like crap.

**tl;dr** Invited a bunch of people to my birthday party and only 2 showed up. The friendships I was trying to have with people totally feel worthless now, and I don't feel worthy of anyone's time.

 --  from [my blog](http://fnirt.blogspot.com/2012/09/thick-world.html)

Sometimes you wake up and it takes a moment to settle in, like a fog.  Other days you wake up and feel as if you've been buried in it.  It's the thickness of the air and the world that makes it hard to move.  Every effort is exhausting.  But there is no sleep to rejuvenate you, and by the time it's proper sleeping time you won't be able to.

It's not a sadness or a despair, nothing that satisfying.  It's a grey plasma that you have to push through to get to the normal goals everyone else takes for granted.  Sitting.  Showering.  Talking.  Pretending you're fine.  Luckily, the grey takes away the desire to do most things, so you don't have to push as hard.  But to everyone else it looks like calmness.  Like quiet stillness.  Or laziness.  But there is something in the background yelling at you to keep moving, that where you are or what you are doing isn't right, but that something never tells you where you should be. It never tells you what's right, only wrong.  No sitting this one out.

If you live in the thick grey world for too long, it begins to look normal to everyone else. But every moment that you are stuck in the muddling mess is like the first and last moment.  Every moment is like every single moment.    You cannot see out of it, it's not a cloud following you around, it's the world your way, and nobody else seems to be caught by it. 

Eventually it will pass.  Some wind will blow and it will clear away. Some morning you will wake up and it'll be receding slowly.  Slowly enough that you can't see it move.  But eventually you don't feel it anymore.  But the gray takes away the satisfaction of knowing it's gone.  Just like you can't see out of the thickness, you can't see into it.  When it's gone you won't be able to remember how it felt or didn't feel.  You won't be able to even believe it happens as intensely as it doesn't.  So when it's gone it's business as usual.  And nobody congratulates you for clearing it, because they could never see it.  And to be certain, the thickness never mentions it.  The thickness just sits there and waits for the next day it finds you.",,False,self,t5_2qqqf,False,,,True,t3_101ql6,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/101ql6/as_a_therapeutic_exercise_last_week_i_wrote_how/,

It's been really hard. The 1st anniversary of my rape was in December, the 10th anniversary of my dad's death is in a week, I'm newly single and I really only have 1 or 2 girl friends that I can lean on for support.

But nobody that I really care about. Someone to hold me and bullshit like that.

I was in the deepest fucking pit imaginable. I had 2 stints in the psych ward for suicidal thoughts. I was cutting and I hated my body with every fiber of my being. I cried for 2 hours after I got out of the shower and saw myself for the first time in months in the hospital bathroom mirror. I was absolutely miserable.

It cuts like a knife. I feel sick to my stomach. I want to scream and cry and tear at things, at myself. It must be me, right? Something in me must be terminally wrong and it must push people, everyone I love, away. Right? It's got to be me. *Fuck*

But no, I've got my mom. My Mormon mother, who just told me last night ""Fuck him!"".

I've got my two best girl friends, one of whom I just moved into an apartment with. They played Cards Against Humanity and got drunk with me last night, too. We're going clubbing tomorrow and we're going to live it up.

I've got my grandparents, who are going to help me with my apartment and buy my bed because right now I'm sleeping on the floor. They gave me a car for fucks sake and they're not rich by any means.  

I've got boys everywhere, showing me that if I was a shallow bitch I could do anything that I wanted. But I won't, because that's not fair and that wouldn't just hurt them, it would hurt me. And I'm obviously pretty selfish. *stop that*

I've got my apartment lined up, my financial aid a week from being submitted. I'm so excited to go back to school to study something that I love.

One foot at a fucking time, one step a day. Closer and closer to actual happiness and finding someone who isn't a total bag of dicks. I'm so close. Being close makes me happier than anything. I have hope. I've got wonderful people around me. And you guys have me, if you ever need me.

1336260249.0,92,self.depression,t8z9b,"my dad thinks I have an eating disorder, and has since stopped providing me with food",throwaweighmeow,102,10,112,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/t8z9b/my_dad_thinks_i_have_an_eating_disorder_and_has/,"To start this off, I just want to say that even though I am suicidal, I'm not to the point of suicidal ideation, and you don't need to worry about convincing me not to kill myself at this time.

I just honestly don't know how to deal with this anymore. All of my life, I've been underweight. I was referred to a specialist when I was born because of it. I have continued to gain weight as I grow taller, and even though I have always been underweight, I have never been considered unhealthy or malnourished by any of my doctors.

My father always was the family cook growing up. I didn't like his food, and he would always force me to finish, sometimes to the point where I would throw up afterward from overeating. If I did not finish my food, I would be told to stay at the dinner table until I did. I still recall staying at the dinner table by myself until around 11pm at around 8 years old. If I left the table without finishing, I would be punished.

I am now 16 years old. Around November, I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. I have enough issues dealing with the stress of life, and my body image has never been a problem with me.

Around December of this year, my dad got fed up with me refusing to finish his food. He has since stopped cooking for me altogether. For the past few months, I've been eating around 800 calories a day. I have some cereal in the morning, a meal at school, a snack when I get home, and that's it. School is the only place where I am provided with real meals, like pasta or pizza. At home, for snacks, I usually make myself a cheese sandwich with whatever cheese and bread is in the house. The only food my parents ever need to buy for me is cereal, cheese, bread, peanut butter, and apples.

I'm currently 5'9 and 115 pounds. Since my dad stopped making food for me, I've lost about 5 pounds, so it hasn't been too drastic. However, I got a letter from my school saying that my BMI was below the 5th percentile for my age, and that I was required to see a doctor.

I saw my doctor, who came to the conclusion that I am not restricting my diet in any way. My dad, however, argues that I have an eating disorder. We were referred to a nutritionist, whom I saw yesterday.

The nutritionist also agreed that my diet is not psychologically fueled, and decided on a meal plan with me. When relaying this information to my father, he angrily stormed out with me. He told me that we would not be following the meal plan she provided because he has already given up on me, and that this would not help.

When I got home around 4pm, I helped myself to a cheese sandwich like usual. Afterward, I cut myself a piece of cake as dessert, since I considered the cheese sandwich my dinner. My father then came in, picked up my plate from under me, and dumped it in the garbage.

That was yesterday. This morning, I woke up to see all of my cereal thrown out. I took the SATs on an empty stomach. When I came out, my mom took me to buy food, and told me that my dad had told her not to. When we returned home, he scolded her for buying food for me. He has since given her instructions to never buy food for me again, under any circumstances. 

My mother's birthday is tomorrow, and he has gone so far as to prohibit her from buying a cake, because he doesn't want me to eat any. My birthday is this month as well, and knowing him, he'll refuse that to me as well.

I honestly do not know what to do about this. I understand this is a huge wall of text, and thank you for reading. These recent events have caused me to relapse with self harm and suicidal thoughts. My dad continues to argue that I have an eating disorder, and he ignores me when I ask which one he believes I have, or when I ask for his intentions when he throws out my food. I literally have no idea how to continue in this situation, and there is no food for me in the house anymore.

This is what helped me.",,113,21,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hsedo/i_was_diagnosed_with_depression_at_age_12_and_was/,"I posted this comment a while back, but I don't know if the author of the parent comment ever read it.  I thought I would share it here, as it is one of the practices that has helped me to heal the most.  I don't suggest doing it, however, if you are suicidal.  If you are suicidal, please call 911 or go to a hospital right away.

A little about me: I was diagnosed at age 12 and was placed on a regimen of anti-depressants and therapy.  That regimen barely helped me to survive for 18 years.  Now, at age 30, I am almost finished going through withdrawal from stopping my meds 2 months ago, and am no longer in therapy.  I feel fucking amazing, and I am more in love with myself and my life than I ever imagined I could be. 

Note: I'm not saying taking meds or going to therapy is inherently bad, but I realized that I had been flailing about in anguish for 18 years and that clearly what I had been doing wasn't working.  I also don't presume that this method will help everyone, but maybe it will help someone.

THE COMMENT:

I have learned through some painful trial and error that I have to let myself sit with those yucky feelings if I am to help myself put an end to my suffering. I mustn't act on them if they are especially volatile, but if I sit down in a quiet place and recall all those painful emotions, it often helps me to get through them. I practice this recall in a very specific way, and maybe it will help you too:

-Find a safe, quiet spot where you won't be disturbed for as long as you need solitude, and where you can be comfortable crying, screaming, laughing, etc.

-Get rid of all distractions: no TV, phone, music, loud pets (I mention this because my dog has this obnoxious habit of barking when I'm trying to concentrate), or computer. Just you and the silence.

-Sit comfortably, but upright.

-Gently close your eyes.

-This part is REALLY important: Take a deep breath down into your belly (diaphragmatic breathing) such that your belly expands when you inhale and deflates when you exhale. Breathe slowly and evenly in through your nose and out through your mouth. Keep doing this slowly, and pay attention to how your belly and lungs feel, as well as the temperature difference of the air as you inhale and exhale, or the sensation of air rushing past your philtrum. Do this for as long as you like (ideally we should breathe like this most of the time, but it's hard to be mindful of it). Imagine that you're inhaling positive energy from The Universe and exhaling any negative energy stored in your body (I know it sounds cheesy, but it works for me).

-Close your eyes and do a body scan: what's going on in every part of your body? How do your eyeballs, toes, knees, elbows, etc. feel? Try to silently verbalize the descriptions in your head (i.e. ""I have a cramp in my thigh.""). If you feel any tension, mindfully tell that body part to relax.

-Now for the hard part (but also the most important and gratifying part if you can push through the pain): actively call up any negative emotions you might have felt throughout the day, or are feeling at that moment. Make sure you get them good and riled up. You may want to explode with rage or agony at some point, but try to keep breathing and stay in place. If you need to cry or scream, that's perfectly okay, but try to pay attention to how the crying or screaming physically feels in your body. Just don't hurt yourself or anyone else. Keep pulling up the negative emotion and sit with it. Imagine that it's a big, nasty monster and that you are about to stick your head in it's mouth. I like to say, ""bring it on, fucker,"" at this point. Let the feeling wash through you, and let yourself feel it to the fullest. Try to remain aware of what you are feeling, and describe it to yourself (i.e. ""I am feeling anger right now, serious fucking anger, and it feels like a ball of tar in my stomach. It feels like someone is twisting my stomach into knots. Now I feel it in my chest, as if someone is poking me with a sharp stick,"" etc.)

If at any point you feel overwhelmed by the feeling and believe you may act on it, turn from the feeling for a while and go back to focusing on your breathing until you are calm enough to dive back in.

You may find that the feeling dissipates considerably after doing this.

Of course, this is only what works for me, but I have studied this process for a while now, and have read about countless others for whom it has worked beautifully. Your mileage may vary.

The practice is based on a Buddhist tenet called Radical Acceptance, which is bit complicated to get into here. 

For now, you might try this exercise and see how it works for you.

EDIT 1:  [This](http://www.amazon.com/Radical-Acceptance-Embracing-Heart-Buddha/dp/0553801678) book helped me to hone my skills with this practice.

EDIT 2:  I am heading out to my yard to enjoy the sunset (this is another simple practice that has helped me immensely) but please feel free to PM me if you have any specific questions or even if you just need someone to lean on.

I am tired. I am always alone and I am always tired. Does everyone feel like that? Do you? Are you tired? Are you alone? Not lonely. alone. 

Alone in an empty room or empty house. Alone in a crowd. alone with people you want to believe are friends. Family. Other people you interact with and smile at and maybe if you smile real hard your brain will think you're happy. But all you can hope for is that maybe your fake smile will make them feel happy, or they'll fake smile back and  maybe the whole word is just fake smiles from birth to death.

I know you can't be happy all the time. I'd like to feel it once in awhile though. I think happiness has always been hope. Hope that never ends. Hope that never really leads to anything except hoping, sleeping, waking up hopeful. I hope this day
today I hope they
I hope

it's hooplah. It's cheap talk to yourself that something will change, something will matter. That whether you're stagnate or working your ass off you're going to be different or better. Happier. That word that really just translates to I hope I HOPE I am happy. I want to be happy. Happy isn't human. Hope is very human. Because our brains can't really grasp the inevitability, can they? The expanse of it all. The micros and macros of existing and thinking and being. That's why we forget and we forge and we fake  by nature, by design. We're too fucking simple to be this fucking self aware. What ever you think it is. Were all broken and hoping for a quick fix. The only thing that is quick is your life. And I never got it. I'm either far out in the future where i'm dead and nothing matters, or i'm holding my hope in the present so hard that it can't get away, it can't change and become a reality. Or maybe those are reflections of each other and i'm just this tangled thought of a person and i'm never going to be whole.

Hope is the worst drug. Idiots can hope. The poor can hope. People who have everything hope. No one is ever happy. And I want to accept that. I really do. I want to know it's natural to feel suffocated and sad sometimes. Sometimes. This is why people kill themselves. It has nothing to do with life. It's all about hope and you need a lot of hope to keep living, but that same hope, that urge to keep going is what is keeping you back. You off yourself, you give up hope. But you also stop lying. So who wins, the devil or your gods? The horror of nonbeing or the torment of existence? I see the patterns of human morality. I see the religious arguments and existential allusions in them. I get that you need something. I just wanted someone. Just one. In the end i'm the simplest, stupidest person. All I wanted was what i'm programmed to want. To keep going. To make others keep going.

She gave zero feedback of any kind and just told me the name and dose of the anti-depressant she was prescribing.  She didn't even say whether she agrees that I have depression, so I'll just be content to diagnose myself.

My husband completed suicide on April 2nd of 2012. He was up and down, wouldn't take his medication. He refused help and tried to fight his depression himself. Finally, he stopped the voices in his head that Monday. 

We have a child together. His little boy was the last person he saw before he died. His son said,""Bye Daddy! See ya later!"" He never knew he wasn't ever going to see his father again. Our son turned two that following month.

He has dreams about his daddy, and screams his name at night. He misses him and there is nothing I can do. I how him pictures and try to soothe the pain, it seems to be going back and forth.

I want to reach out to spouses, mothers, fathers, family and friends of anyone who is struggling with depression or suicide or those impacted by it. Feel free to PM me if need be.

Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t’ and ‘Hang On!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.""  - David Foster Wallace

Depression is often linked to a chemical imbalance in the brain and runs in the family, which would explain a lot seeing as your sister was diagnosed with depression a while back.

You should view your onset of depression as the medical condition that it is, and try to treat it early before it gets worse. Talk to your parents and make an appointment with your general physician TODAY and take things from there. Even if your parents don't take you seriously, AT LEAST make the appointment.

Anyway, like everybody here, I am depressed atm and I think I need to get this out of my chest and maybe talk to someone so... Why I'm depressed right now?

Well, because I have this friend that I haven't seen in around a year since we finished school. When I first met him, we were both very socially awkward teens, by the end of the school we both progressed together really really really fucking much, lost that SA thing. 

Backstory on me. I've had a really lonely life because I always lived far away in a desolated area and my parents work their ass off all day everyday, we don't have much money, my friend is pretty much rich. After I finished school I spent a whole year inside home because I couldn't get into college yet, didn't have a car, dumped my cheater ex, and for other reasons. He got into college while that and started dating a gorgeous girl. Anyway, sure I did a few things in this time, but I was at least 6 days a week ALL the time inside home doing nothing. I also lost most of my friends because I didn't really bother, people tell me It's pretty common once you leave school but I dunno. Anyway, pretty much in this whole year I got depressed and didn't progress one bit, same looks, same skills, same everything, nothing new. Instead I'm noticing my SA coming back. While this, I can see that my friend is progressing pretty much by the constant facebook posts, pics of travels and looks really happy.

Please don't get me wrong, I don't envy him, instead I'm happy for him. But for me, I feel just like useless shit.

After this year, I got into college, started going out a little more, made good new friends but not close ones, trying to get a job atm, pretty much started from the scratch again.. everything was ""ok"". Until yesterday, when I got the notice that my friend is moving away with his sister, because his parents bought them a condo in the city I, since kid, dreamed of living. He also got into college there and will be doing what he always liked. While that I'm stuck here in this place I hate, without a job, without a car, studying for something I hate because I don't know what I want to do in the future and couldn't choose something else, with no close friends, spending most of my weekends at home, not interested in any girl, and to put the icing on the cake, my parents are having financial problems and I can't even help. I will get better eventually, but I just wanted to take a moment and make a rant because I have no one to talk to.

Thank you if you read till here.

Anyway

I care more about others than I do myself. I care about the well-beings of others in front of my own self. I want others to be happy and I can't control my minds desire to make everyone happy. I care far too much for my own good. I just end up hurting myself in the process and at home sitting alone staring at my computer screen with no interest in anything. 

All I can think about is how lonely I am. 

I had a girlfriend of three and half years, but I have been single since may of 2012. I was the one who ultimately ended it. Things had been going sour for over a year now. She hit me.. a lot (not abusively I should say...) and I am twice her size. I just... can't hit anyone or anything. I can't physically and mentally stomach bringing pain to anyone. I used to have anger issues as a child but I have since controlled it, and now making anyone feel anything other than pure happiness ends up having a 10 fold negative impact on myself.

She was my first for everything. I did so much for her throughout our relationship yet I hardly got anything in return. I love her and I still do. When I say it I **mean** it. Its not something I just flaunt around. I live by the saying ""Love has no past tense, because love is forever. So if you have loved someone, than you have never loved them at all."" I just don't love her how I used to. But that's not what I worried about here and I have since moved on.

It's just the fact that I am not like other guys. 

To me, having someone else in my life is what makes me whole. I can't even fathom the idea of having sexual contact with others without having something more. I can't go out and have a one night stands like every other guy. I can't have sex with just anyone because the emotions are just too great and I would just end up crying. I can't just leave it at that and walk away. I don't want just a one time thing. The memories of happiness play back over and over again in my head and I eventually succumb to sadness and depression. I only find myself attracted to an extremely few amount of girls. There is just certain characteristics that I find really attractive. So finding those girls to share those moments are rare and far between. Throw in actually having an attractive personality, and the numbers drop even fewer. If I like you, you are what I am looking for. It's that simple. 

I just feel like I am the only one who actually cares and respects women the way they are supposed to be, but the one most overlooked. I'm just your stereotypical shy introvert guy who gives dating advice to everyone else and lets everyone walk all over him, but stays single. 

So here I am, sitting alone wishing I didn't care so much about others or how other viewed me. Wishing I wasn't so shy. Wishing I wasn't so introvert. Almost wishing to just be ignorant of it all, like it seems most others are. Wishing I could tell others how I felt about them without being at a total loss for words when it come to that crucial moment. Wishing others (Strangers and close friends) feel for me as I feel for them.

Today I woke up feeling like it's gonna be a pretty ok day. While my depression isn't severe, it usually takes some effort on my part to bring myself up past apathy into neutral (and unfortunately sometimes I can't be bothered). But today I just woke up feeling neutral, in a good way. A peaceful ""today's gonna be an ok day"" kind of neutral.

I've got some cool stuff for today. I got a neat screen/touch shield for my arduino, so that'll be fun to play with. I got [Faster Than Light](http://www.ftlgame.com/) last night, which is exciting because it's the first video game I've gotten in quite some time. Most exciting, I've got a really interesting and challenging (but doable) programming project I'm doing with my uni that'll actually help the scientific community.

So all in all, I think it's gonna be a pretty ok day. I even feel ready to take on a few unexpected challenges today. This is the first time I haven't had to bring myself up to feel like this. It just happened. I figured I'd tell someone.

But I really wanted to share with anyone who is in a similar place.

I'm really proud of myself, and I feel really good. I also air dried because I had time, and used lotion so my skin felt and smelled nice.

Yesterday I planned on showering, but I was too depressed, so I told myself I would today, anytime today - and I actually did it.

My hygiene has gotten so bad I developed 8 cavities which i now need to find the money to pay for, and would go over a week without showering, and avoid going outside because I hadn't showered. it is a really bad cycle I have always very prone to.

I have to try to remember to be brave about this, and just take this one day at a time.

So far today, two huge things for me - a shower and brushing my teeth.

*EDIT:* Thank you all for your ongoing support, it's made my day so much brighter :)

*EDIT2:* I heated lasagna and green tea for a late lunch, made an egg and onion sandwich for dinner, and treated myself to a few oreos - and then I washed up and brushed my teeth for the second time today!

**EDIT3:** *Thank you all so much, I never would have made it through today without your support and encouragement. I hope I have the strength to have a similar day tomorrow. We will see. But today at least made me really proud of myself.

After yesterday telling me he loved me and, today, telling me he still loves me.

We've been together for 2 years. He made me a better person. He helped me become more of a person, helped me quit smoking, and helped get me interested in something other than death. I owe my life to him, and he doesn't even know it.

I don't know why he split up with me. I don't know why he doesn't want me anymore. It's only now, 4 hours later, that I feel calm enough to say it. Although, that could very well be the alcohol I've had tonight.

I'm afraid that if I let myself think then I will start to cry again, and I've been doing that for hours. 

I'm posting on /r/depression because this isn't just your run of the mill depressive episode. I have suffered long and hard with manic depression, and after being off my meds for two nearly three weeks (due to lack of funds to get a new prescription), I am back on them. These past three weeks have been difficult as all get out, but with his help I managed without fucking things up. 

My ex-partner, too, has depression. I don't think he's doing anything about it. I did ask him to go see someone a few months back, I just don't think he did. I'm going to ask him to go see someone again. Whether or not we get back together is not the issue.  In the space of a day and a half he demolished his self-run company and dumped me. He dropped faster than an atomic bomb. It scared me so I said some things the wrong way, and he misunderstood them. His hurt hurt me more than this breakup. I was going to ask him to marry me when we were away at Christmas.

I just wanted to vent. Upvote, don't upvote. I don't give a flying fuck. Talking helps, and I'm talking.

**TL;DR** Nearly killed myself, have two options left to finish the job, because my future fiance' left me for a reason I don't know. Am sad, very very sad.

**EDIT 1: A DAY ON**
It's about now I feel like I need someone to tell me how well I'm doing. A day on, I re-read these comments, and the words feel empty. I know they aren't. Thank you to all who replied, your words helped me through the night, and I'm positive they will help me through tonight too. God knows how I'm going to survive work tomorrow.

We continued to talk. I kept asking him why. I got the answer. Because I didn't support him, and when he was standing infront of me with tears in his eyes I didn't support him. He took off a minute after i noticed the tears, he'd done a good job of hiding them as we walked through the packed city streets, him two steps in front of me.

In my defence, he took off before I could react. And it's been killing me inside ever since.

We talked it out, came to an understanding. Then the next step, should we get back together? I told him I would if I got the apology I deserved. He said that him admitting he made a mistake would be a weakness to him. I don't know how to feel about this. He is the man of my dreams, do I back out of it and forgive him without the apology, or do I tell him no, I need the apology. The apology itself doesn't mean that much to me, I need to know I mean more to him than his pride.",,False,self,t5_2qqqf,1353243300.0,,,True,t3_13cr41,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/13cr41/ive_tried_killing_myself_once_already_tonight/,

A year ago Saturday, someone else I knew committed suicide. That person and I weren't on speaking terms at the time, but I was still heart-broken, and I still am. I woke up this morning thinking of her, and I knew the date of her death was coming up...I was going to try and look at the world differently for her, and imagine her at peace instead of imaging the pain she must have felt when she decided to end her life. 

But then, another friend of mine committed suicide. I found out today. About 2 or 3 weeks ago, I talked her down from suicide. I only knew her through the internet, but she was more of a friend than most people in my real life have ever been. I thought she was doing better. I hadn't heard from her in awhile, but that was normal. She'd pop up on LJ every few weeks. I just can't believe she's gone. From the world. She'll never... be... anything again. She'll never breathe or sleep. 

It's terrifying. I'm so afraid of losing people to mental illness. I have two people in my life right now who are struggling with depression and suicide more than they ever have before, and it scares me. I worry about them so much, because I truly don't know what I would do without them in this world. Lately I've been so worried about them, and then this happens. Reminding me, yet again, that life is incredibly fragile and that I can't fix everything. And I don't like it.

I was suicidal earlier this week. I'm suicidal on a regular basis. But not to the extent that I used to be. I used to want to kill myself every. single. night. I never thought I'd make it past 18, but now I'm 20. I never thought I'd have any nights where I could lay in bed, in the dark, and not want to die. But I have them now. Things changed. They did. Not without effort, but they changed. I still struggle with depression (Bipolar II) and suicidal thoughts and other things--I don't believe any of those things will ever go away (and who knows, they could come back full-force someday)--but right now, I am okay. I never thought I would be, but I am.

So please... don't give up. Not just because losing someone to suicide is an absolutely horrible feeling, especially if you KNOW what they felt before they attempted (I've attempted suicide 3 times), but because it can get better. I HATE it when people say that to me when I'm depressed, but... I have to remember to tell myself that feelings past. They don't last forever. Even if they only let up for a few moments each day, live for those moments. Live for the days when those moments won't be as infrequent as they are now. I promise you, that someday, things will be different. I promise you, I do understand. So many people have come back from worse things than I could ever imagine--and they're okay today. It is possible. So please... just remember, in those moments where everything feels absolutely hopeless, that it isn't. It truly is not. Even if you usually can't see that, deep down, you know. You know that things can be different someday.",,False,self,t5_2qqqf,False,,,True,t3_thlrr,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/thlrr/i_lost_another_friend_to_suicide_today/,

In my +40 years I have heard every pep-talk, cliche, and ""it gets better"" speech that has ever been thought up. I've been on so many different medications that I've forgotten which I've tried and which I haven't. And I've tried every self-motivating thing I can find - including diet, meditation, exercise, etc. etc. etc. ad nauseum.

At this point in my life I have given up the hope of things ever getting better. In fact, it happened on Monday night and I felt it like the air leaving my body, leaving me deflated and done. Of course, it was the words of someone that did it - pulling everything into perspective in one cruel, thoughtless remark and I realized that people don't want me happy for me - they want me happy for them.

I can't be happy. I've tried. It eludes me. It is not in me. Maybe I was born without the capacity - or maybe there is just too much pain from my past to get over. Maybe I am just weak. But either way, I fail at being happy.

I spent all of yesterday trying to think of a way to take my life that would look natural, but just couldn't come up with anything. So instead, I just have decided to let myself give up on the idea of being happy - and just letting life play out as it will, without giving a shit.

I feel dead already to be honest. Now I guess I'll just stop fighting my depression and ""live"" with it. Maybe battling it just makes it worse. Maybe accepting it is the only way to live with it. I'll die eventually - either by nature or by choice, but until I do, I'll just be what everyone wants me to be - I'll exist to make them happy.

Someone will say ""that is the key to true happiness"" and maybe it is. I have no idea what true happiness is so really can't debate that point. To me it makes me feel like a player in other people's plays, and I'd rather just be written out of the story altogether, but whatever. If I can't be happy *WITH* them, I'd rather not pretend to be happy *FOR* them.

**TL;DR:** I have decided to stop fighting my depression and just accept it - and it feels like dying a little.",,False,self,t5_2qqqf,False,,,True,t3_1c249c,http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1c249c/accepting_depression/,

I have gotten to this point once before. I took control of my life I lost loads of weight dropped down about 5 dress sizes! I felt in control of my life and I felt like I could make plans for the future, something I had never done before. Then my Grandad died in a way that he did not deserve and it was so sudden and complete that I turned off. I completely shut down and reverted to my safety protocols. I moved back home and started overeating and watch tv online. I ruined myself over his death. I could not cope and thought about ending my life so many times. I wanted to get away from my family especially my little sister because she was picking up on what I was doing. She was only eight but she started eating loads of crap and sleeping in her clothes and that terrified me but it wasn't enough to get me back on track. My mum noticed as well and started being very argumentative and telling me how I was making my sister lazy just like me and all sorts of misguided things. My parents had never known anything at this point. They honestly thought it was just laziness and that I didn't appreciate what I have in life. 

A week later I decided to move to London. My parents were against the idea completely but I had no other choice I wasn't getting any work in Ireland and all of my friends had moved to different countries. The country is depressing to be in and it just wasn't helping. I went to the doctor, got on some medication and started saving money for a deposit. I decided about two months into having the medication that just knowing I had the potential to feel good again was enough for me and I didn't want medication to fake that for me. Fuck that was hard and is hard! SO after the meds I was a bit all over the place emotionally and my parents started yelling at me for something I hadn't done and it all just came out I had gotten so wound up I had a panic attack. If it wasn't for my mum I would have ended up in hospital for sure. Everyone started crying then and they told me that actually this is in the family it wasn't just me. Some of my extended family had been even worse. I had NO idea they could understand as much as they did. Certain things they don't get. They don't understand the no motivation thing or that its really more complicated than just feeling sad. But dammit they try their absolute best for me. My Dad is a bit of a nightmare still but I have to just get over it. He isn't going to change his ways. He's a bit aggressive verbally and I have just learned to keep out of his way. I know he loves me but damn sometimes he can just devastate me in a couple of words! 

Anyway I gathered up my money and moved to London. I got a job, I started renting a room in this big house where theres about 14 other people living as well. It forces me to be sociable which is good! I have lived here now since July and at first I felt better if a lot more stressed out but I felt like I was achieving something. So the stress wore off and I was back to being a bit down and lonely. I haven't many friends here and thats something thats difficult for me to do much about. The friends I do have here are fantastic and I love them to bits but they have their own lives to lead and I feel like I can be a bit of a weight on them at times. I have spent probably the last few weeks sitting in my chair watching tv and eating when I'm not working or visiting friends which is a LOT. 

Yesterday I suddenly realised that I am slowly but surely crippling myself physically, emotionally and mentally. I have started doing sit ups! Running for me is just not an option yet but I want to get there. I really want to run again its been years since I ran and I remember how good it feels! I will once again lose the weight. Losing it made me feel so happy and proud of myself before. I will do it again. I am writing a journal everyday and im going to confront my weaknesses and shortcomings in order to improve myself. I will live my life. I wont put so much pressure on myself to be perfect and do everything right. I will accept myself and make the most of what I am. Above all else I'm going to be nice to myself. Go me! I am awesome! hahah fuck that feels odd but the little things can make a big difference.


Also i am planing shit to do like visit every tube station with my mate before march! fun bonding time with picnics! YAY!

As a 26 year old male with mental health issues I am in need of some peer advice from people who have been in a similar position.

I believe I have reached an impasse. After graduating this summer I have been unable to find a job, moved back home and subsequently slipped in a pretty serious depression (suicidal tendencies). 

After living in my parents basement doing nothing I finally reached out for help last month and I am now being tested by a team of psychologists. Hopefully a correct diagnosis will be made soon and I can start medication or therapy. 

In the meantime I don't really know what to do. I'm experiencing bouts of feeling normal/good interspersed with episodes of worrying, panic and depression. I want to find a job and move out of my parents house to live closer to my friends as I am sure this will help me in recovering from this depression faster. Also, it's going to be harder to explain a one year gap on my CV than a six month gap. 

However it's hard to find a job when my emotional life is so unstable. I apply for jobs, then cancel interviews because I panic and feel I am not good enough for that job/company anyway. I get interviews but I'm just not really there, unable to convince the interviewer why I am the right candidate for the job and thus fail to get the job. This, in turn, increases the terrible feeling of missing out on life and losing valuable time to find a good job. 

It's making me sick. There are times when I feel good and just want to find a job and move on with my life, then I remember the way I feel can change tomorrow and I am back to square one.

I am a good person and I seek to spread goodness.

But, I'd give it all to a random stranger to free me from self-loathing, self-destruction, and despair. 

I'll drive back home and think of the beauty of crashing through the guard rail and careening off the bluffs into the sparkling ocean. I'll imagine how freeing it might be to fly for an instant before calmly and violently being struck unconscious by the impact and sinking slowly into the water. I long for that split second of peace before I die, an oasis in a sea of regret and sadness, the feeling of truly *knowing* that nothing matters now.

I'll fantasize about hanging off the edge of a bridge, admiring the vast sobering distance below me. I'll feel the wind in my hair, and let the chain link fence slip from my fingers. I'll feel the Earth's weight bring us together, and succumb to our final meeting. Together, at last. 

Maybe more violently, I'll blow my brains out. A final joke to play on everyone who thought I had it all figured out. I'll imagine myself madly laughing as I descend to hell, my punishment for whatever I did to deserve to feel this way. 

Perhaps I'm so obsessively vain to enjoy a story where I'm the center of attention. 

I hide it well. No one knows. I let it slip last night when I was plastered and started blathering to someone about the futility of seeking goodness. I think he was scared. I'm not scared. I'm probably a crazy person. If anyone found out, I don't know how well my relationships would last. They will probably send me away. I think I might enjoy being sent away.
