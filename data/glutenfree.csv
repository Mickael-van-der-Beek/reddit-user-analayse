My name's Eric, and with the help of my friend [Chef Andrew Doyle](http://www.eattastelive.com/#!chef-drew/cfvg), we launched a 100% free and 100% gluten free online cooking show. We think the show's a fun, entertaining, and educational resource for those struggling with Celiac disease or gluten intolerances, or those who just want to eat healthier. We're currently sponsored by several major companies, including Logitech, Cuisinart, Wüsthof, Ancient Harvest, Namaste Foods, and more. Check it out:

[www.eattastelive.com](http://www.eattastelive.com)

We air weekly on Saturdays at 2PM EST/11AM PST on our website. You can find all of our past episodes on our [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/EatTasteLive) or [directly on our website](http://www.eattastelive.com/#!past-episodes/c2on). For each episode, we have [recipes](http://www.eattastelive.com/#!episode-recipes/c11vt) for everything we make on our site, too.

Beyond just working on the show each week, we're also working on getting funding to start a 100% gluten free food truck in Los Angeles. With all of the food trucks rolling around L.A. on a daily basis, we thought a 100% gluten free truck would fit right in. That way, Celiacs or people with gluten intolerances, wouldn't have to worry about any gluten cross-contamination, since our truck would be 100% gluten free! You can view our sample menu, along with our business plan and other information, at the link below.

[www.foodstart.com/eattastelivellc](http://www.foodstart.com/eattastelivellc)

If you feel like this is a great idea and would like to donate some money to get us started, we would greatly appreciate it! Please also share it with your friends!

We'll be around to answer any questions you may have about either the show or the food truck, too. Thank you!

I have started going to Epcot for my birthday which is around the food and wine festival and disney usually can help produce a list that makes it easy to pick from. (Cross contamination usually doesn't effect me that much as that is super helpful)

But last June, when I went to the Magic Kingdom it was frustrating trying to just get a burger with no bun.

So when I made my way this year for valentines day I braced myself when I ordered my burger. The cast member who was taking my order (at the tall tale burger place) asked if it was an allergy and I said yes he told me to stand aside. All I could think of when he called an allergy on the walkie talkie was another ordeal  that I dealt with last year. 

I cold only be wrong. They had a cook come out and ask me my allergy. I told him gfree and i would just like a burger no bun. He surprised me, he asked me if I wanted a bun? Not only did they have buns, they had fries in their own frier and cookies and brownies. 

Everything so amazing! They had a separate area where they took care of their food. I was so happy to see that they took my health issues as serious as shell fish or peanuts. 

But that wasn't it some how I magically gotten into be our guest. The gfree options they have are amazing.
French onion soup, gfree and amazing.One thing that got me a bit to excited was the bread I got to have with my boyfriend before dinner. I can't tell you how jealous I am every time I see people get bread. And hot damn the bread was great.  What topped off my dinner was  a gfree lemon raspberry pastry puff

Just thought people might like to know that if they travel to disney in just one year there has been such an improvement for people who are gfree. All you have to do is ask and you'll get wonderful care.

I decided to cut out all forms of gluten, including any cross-contaminates. On day 6, I woke up for the first time in 6-8 weeks without a migraine! Success! I'm already noticing that I have more energy and just feel better in general.

I've read in many posts, and even some comments on my post, that a lot of you catch some flak from your physicians and the medical community when you approach them with this subject. On behalf of my profession, I apologize. Last week, I actually got in an argument with my own physician. On day 2 of going GF, I had an appointment to check on my migraine status. I told her that I was cutting gluten, and she looked at me like I was a crazy person and informed me that there was no reason to try such a thing; that I was just depriving myself. I politely told her I believed it would and that I had the research to back it up. I couldn't believe it! So now, sadly, I've experienced what many of you have, and, well, it sucks. I now have the results to back me up, but I highly doubt she'll accept it. I need to find a new doctor. Thankfully, I know some who are more open-minded.

As I said in my former post, medical school education is deficient in nutritional information. We graduate knowing very little. Sure, we learn a little here and there during residency, but nothing substantial. It's up to us to do the research, and sadly, most of us just don't take the time. I still have much to learn.

So I get a call at work a few minutes ago from the school nurse. My kiddo is sitting in her office and she proceeds to read me the entire ingredient label from a carton of yogurt (without my asking) and then list off the other items they rounded up for my daughter to eat.

I have never met or spoken to this person. It isn't like my daughter has a sign on her or something... she just flat out recognized my daughter, remembered her celiac disease, and acted accordingly.

I started to do the usual ""oh, sorry, but I can't eat those"" speech, but she interrupted me and informed me that the cupcakes we gluten free! Apparently she made some gluten-free baked goods for her bake sale because she knew that there were people (like me) who were allergic to it.

She doesn't seem like the kind of person who's particularly aware of things like gluten-free cooking, so I was a little skeptical, but I didn't want to interrogate her about what mix she had used or whether they could be cross-contaminated and all that, so I took them and thanked her. I don't usually have a problem with small amounts of cross-contamination, so I decided to risk it and trust that she had actually made gluten-free cupcakes.

****

I would wake up in the morning with staggering pain inside my lower and upper abdomen. When I'm talking about staggering pain I'm not saying 'tolerable pain', or the kind of pain that if you take pain killers you'll feel nothing.

I'm talking about the kind of pain that made me prostate, hold my stomach and feel a sharp knife carving my innards, I would look up and ask ""Why do I suffer so much?"".

Other than pain I would have frequent diarrhea, extreme weight loss, hair loss, lethargy, high blood pressure, high glucose (borderline diabetes).


Day after day my suffering went on, I was certain I had a fatal disease such as STD or Cancer, I was certain I was dying, (for the first 4 years). Doctors couldn't figure out what the fuck was wrong with me, and they did every exam in the book (save for celiac).


I became depressive, anxious, had panic attacks, quit 3 different colleges, didn't take anything seriously because I figured I was dying. And I went to so many doctors that they started telling me it was all in my head. I was losing my mind.

But I didn't give up, I knew I had something and that all the dozens of different doctors I went to were wrong and I was determined to prove them wrong. Went to the library bought myself medical books (biology, microbiology, epidemiology, histology, handbook of symptoms, etc). I studied day and night, trying to make a connection between my symptoms &amp; a possible cause. For a while I was sure I had Fibromyalgia, but that's something women get so I crossed that off. 

Then I started making a connection to everything that causes Malabsorption, and Celiac was among the possible causes. I cross-referenced the food I ate with the symptoms I felt and slowly cut gluten off my diet, voila, problem solved? No, I had to prove it, so I wrote everything down using medical jargon and took it to a different doctor. I gave him my paper, he read, ""Makes sense, let's do a biopsy to confirm"" was his answer. I was happy beyond belief.

I was addicted to blood pressure medication, labeled as Hypochondriac, went to a psychiatrist (didn't help), suffered alone in silence, and I finally had my answer to prove 'em all wrong. Joke's on me though. Took me more than 5 years to do so.

I don't take blood pressure medication anymore, my hair loss halted (but it doesn't grow any thicker), I no longer have panic attacks.

I was diagnosed when I was 19 with an intestinal biopsy after growing up chronically ill. Like many of you, I went through test after test, doctor after doctor, medication after medication. I was misdiagnosed several times. Finally, a GI doctor told me he thought I had colon cancer and that he wanted to do a biopsy. That's when they found out I had Celiac disease. 

Skip forward 11 years. Instead of applying for disability, I was able to go to nursing school and graduate at the top of my class with a 4.0 GPA (I was so sick in grade school that I had to have a teacher come to my house to teach me so I wouldn't fall behind). I now work as a charge nurse and love my career. 

Today, I was at the nurse's station and one of our regular doctors offered me some random baked treat. I reminded her that I had Celiac disease but thanked her for offering me the treat. She then proceeded to go off and tell me how Celiac disease is all in people's heads. Another nurse stuck up for me and chimed in saying that she has a niece with Celiac. The doctor didn't want to hear it. I told her that I am not following some fad and that I was truly diagnosed with a biopsy, years before the gluten free diet became what it is today. She told me she didn't care what the biopsy said and that Celiac disease doesn't truly exist.

I was diagnosed last year (after years of misdiagnoses, months of blood tests/biopsy to confirm, you know the drill). Shit sucked.

Anyway, I told a few co-workers about it after a while and one of them, who is a complete jackass hipster (steampunk tattoos, jesus beard, thinks he's awesome) decided to go gluten free because I was.

Seriously, a week after I told him, he goes, ""What was that disease you have? I think I have it! I went gluten free last week and I feel better!"" Mind you, he eats McDonald's french fries (they contain WHEAT) and Taco Bell, despite the fact that both of those things would make me incredibly ill. 

Since I'd been working really hard to embrace people and not feel ""better than"" anyone, I just let it go. Then, his overweight, super obnoxious hipster wife decided to go gluten free too. 

Whatever, right? Lifestyle choices are fine. Except... they (edit for clarity: THESE TWO PEOPLE, not all gluten free lifestylers, jeez) are all up in everyone's face about it, all the damn time. I try to be quiet and I research restaurants before I go out to eat and I ask very discretely about the gluten free menu. These turds make a huge deal about it all the time and do stupid things and make all gluten free people look like assholes.

For example, we had a co-worker's birthday party at Dave &amp; Busters. Ugh. Of course, I did my research. I ate beforehand because I knew I couldn't eat there (there is a small gf menu, but nothing appetizing to me and honestly, it's just easier to eat at home before going out sometimes). They both demanded the gf menu, made a HUGE deal about ordering Stoli (because it's gf, allegedly), and then HARASSED the waiter because there were only 5 options on the gf menu. Seriously, the wife bitched about it like it was the end of the damn world. She was extra rude. And didn't even tip the waiter, like it was his fault or something!

Then, about 2 hours later, they both ordered a beer at the bar. The wife tried to hide it from me, and the jackass co-worker was all, ""oh well, beer is good!"" 

I just felt like such an asshole at this point. The poor waiter had been abused by these rude hipsters, then they're sitting there drinking beer like it's no big deal. It was embarrassing and definitely made me feel like it reflects incredibly poorly on the gluten free community. I know it shouldn't piss me off, but it does. Does this ever happen to anybody else?

1361840903.0,61,self.glutenfree,1988co,Realizing that I have a gluten sensitivity helped me to solve an old mystery.,diabolotry,70,9,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/1988co/realizing_that_i_have_a_gluten_sensitivity_helped/,"I've always been a big girl. I didn't really hit the fat stage until my 20s, but I was always a little overweight. I was also rather involved in sports, but I always struggled with keeping my energy levels up. My parents always attributed this to my being overweight and since I didn't know any different, I agreed. 

So my whole life has been filled with watching portion sizes and trying to work out more and counting calories and *dieting* and **never** seeing much in the way of results. Still, I was never all *that* big and honestly didn't mind too much how I looked once I started dressing well. 

After a couple years in college something happened. I dropped a lot of weight and I wasn't sure how I'd done it, but I was pretty happy. I got back into exercising and was really liking how I looked. I kept that up for another year or so and something happened again--suddenly I'm gaining weight like crazy. I wasn't eating any more than I had been, wasn't moving any less. Hell, I was the most active I'd ever been. 

After about nine months of steadily gaining weight I gave up. I gave in. I just stopped caring. I gained a little more weight, but it was slower. I figured I was just meant to be this heavy. I had no explanation for why I gained so much weight, my doctor was stumped.

A couple years ago I decided it was time to fix things. I was unhappy in my marriage, I was unhappy with me. So I start going to a trainer, split up with my husband and made some very slow progress for a year. 

Last July I decided to switch up my diet to lowish carb, high protein. I start losing a ton of weight. I'm working out, I'm doing really well, then the winter holidays hit and I slack off. I accepted that I'd gain a little weight back and I'd just work it back off. I actually did really well, didn't really gain more than a couple pounds and it made me think, hey, I can just eat whatever I want in moderation. 

So I'm counting calories and including in all the things I was denying myself. Wraps, bagels, the occasional cookies and cake. Pasta. All those things that were too high carb, but I kept under my calories so I thought I was good. And I was for a short amount of time. 

Then I got a wicked stomach bug and everything changed. Suddenly I'm having all of these stomach problems. But I'm not sick anymore, the bug is gone, my doctor is stumped again. Not once does ""gluten intolerance"" come up, since although I'd had stomach problems my whole life, they'd never been this bad. I get tested for all sorts of scary things that my symptoms fit and nothing is conclusive. And in the mean time I'm eating like normal and still in agony. 

A few weeks ago I made the decision to do an elimination diet. My doctor had pretty much dismissed the possibility of it being food related and wanted to send me off to more specialists and more scary stuff. But I wanted to try this first. So I start the diet and I start taking a probiotic. 

After two days my stomach pains are already better. My stool isn't the scary yellow color anymore. Not quite normal yet, but much, much better. After a week I am feeling a million times better. Two weeks gluten free and I'm feeling normal again, so I start testing. 

I had a mild reaction to lactose, but it took a lot to get it. Liveable. I test a few other things just to be sure: Coffee, eggs, fruits, all things other family members are allergic to. Nothing. Then I test gluten. 

Holy crap it was like I was trying to pass glass. It wasn't immediate, but I knew right away. I felt like absolute *crap*. So that was it, I stop eating gluten. I drop 7lbs in a week, all that bloat weight I'd been carrying. I feel like a new person again. I have so much more energy. 

Thinking about it today made me realize a few things: 
1. I've had chronic diarrhea my whole life. Cramps, low energy, aches, often sick. Growing up pasta and chicken nuggets were my main staple foods, but when I was young I really didn't eat a ton. I was always on a calorie restrictive diet, but always overweight. 

2. I lost weight in college during a time when all I was eating was omelets, baked potatoes and sushi. My class schedule prevented me from getting to the chow hall during most meal times. Only breakfast. So for lunch and dinner baked potatoes were about the only edible things there. I was mostly gluten free except for the weekends for over a year. I was very active, hardly sick. 

3. I started gaining weight again after I started living with my now ex-husband. After I met him my diet went from salads and protein to pasta, pizza and mcdonalds--because that's all he ate. So I ate like he did, but watched my portions. I felt so bad about my weight gain because I *thought* I was still keeping things in control. I still think I was, for the most part, but it was the gluten heavy diet that killed me. I went back to feeling crappy and fatigued and always being sick again. 

For years I've looked back on that time with guilt, because I thought I *must* have been counting wrong. I felt like I was making excuses. But it's not like I was overeating. I wasn't eating a ton of food. I never had snacks. I skipped on the french fries and soda, I only had a slice or two of pizza, I didn't have big bowls of pasta. I still ate nothing but salad for lunch. Eggs and toast for breakfast isn't that bad. 

I've come to realize that *what* I was eating really impacted my weight, my activity levels, my mood. Of course there are other factors. I'm not trying to say it was all the gluten--but it was a big factor. One I'll never go back to, because I don't want to feel like that ever again.",,False,,t5_2qx1l,False,,,True,t3_1988co,http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/1988co/realizing_that_i_have_a_gluten_sensitivity_helped/,

We are not sure if he is celiac, but we assume so. Bob never took the time to find a specialist just went to a general practitioner. He just ignored the whole thing all together. My wife and I are friends with him. My wife is a full blown celiac with sever gluten reactions. So it angers her to see people like Bob who are so unwilling to take the effort to fix their diet.

Anyway, we havent heard from Bob in while so we asked our other friends about him. Our other friend, ""Betty"", who is a nurse told us some shocking news about Bob. She had gone on a camping trip with Bob and a large group of friends. Betty's thoughtful husband brought plenty of GF foods for Bob. He even bought GF muffins and bagels for him knowing how sick Bob gets after eating regular food. Bob, with attitude, blows off the GF foods and decides to eat regular pancakes, muffins, and whatever else everyone was eating. Even with strong reactions, Bob doesn't follow the GF diet at all and is unwilling to change his ways...that's about to change. 

So the group goes on a few hikes and afterwards Bob complains of possibly pulling a muscle around his inner thigh. A week after the camping trip Bob calls Betty, the nurse, and ask her about the pain. He said it keeps getting worse and now his inner thigh is turing BLACK! Betty says to go to a hospital asap.
Bob goes to a hospital looking like death. His eyes have black rings around them, he had lost weight, and was mentally becoming unstable. The pain in his leg, now crotch, is growing and the black area on his leg is expanding. 

After a few days at the hospital they find out what's going on. Bob, not following the GF diet, has worn a hole in his intestine and the black liquid from his intestine was oozing out in his body, collecting around his crotch. He had done so much damage from eating whatever he wanted, he literally ripped a whole in his intestine. He is now septic with a tube coming out of his side. 

He came near death while in the hospital. He lost considerable weight and looked like a skeleton. Fortunately, his body started to heal after staying away from gluten and after a few weeks, he was able to leave the hospital. He takes the GF diest pretty serious now and is doing better.

He was very kind and polite and apologetic.  
He did also say that he would pass my interest for a GF cider up a few levels and see if it gains any traction.  I explained that I encountered the cider on Reddit and that a number of us were interested, and it wasn't just one person, which he added to the note. So there is that.

I and some others are working on an app for the Austin area - with hopes of expanding to help travelers - that identifies restaurants with real gluten-free options (personally validated) and what menu items they are so you know ahead of time what you can order.

Would anyone be interested in something like this? Would you pay for it? Is there something else you'd like to see?

Rant follows:",extremerohit,59,5,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/153pio/after_actively_browsing_reddit_for_a_few_weeks_i/,"All my life i've suffered, alone. 
Even recently now that gluten-free has become a big thing, I realize that there must be others like me, but I've not found anyone, to talk to about *our* problems and the shit we've been through and discuss recipes and stuff. I never found anyone who could understand me.

Now that I've found this subreddit, I have heard, for the first time, what other people with GI/Celiac go through. I now know what kind of experiences other people have had with this obnoxious condition and the feelings that come with it. That's all I ever wanted in my life... thank you. THANKYOU THANKYOU THANKYOUALLFORCOMINGHERE!!!!! I am a grown man and i'm in tears (actually im only 19 but i like to think im a grown man :/    )

Here's why I'm soooo grateful for finding you people:

I've never actually been diagnosed with celiac, just stamped with wheat,oats,rye,barley allergies [(what?)](http://qkme.me/3s94no), but according to my mom, I have been throwing up shit since &lt;1 year old. Nobody I ever met in my childhood life ever heard of a gluten, and so for 14 unfortunate years **I never even knew what was wrong with me, all I knew is that I would VIOLENTLY VOMIT almost any food that I ate** And whats worse is that I had a crappy allergy test when I was 4, that didn't include wheat. So I had to narrow down which foods were available to me by process of elimination. &lt;&lt;This is the reason why my childhood sucked.

It wasn't until 14 that I finally made the connection between all these foods, it was wheat. Another series of tests concluded positive for wheat and those other grains (negative for celiac though) and that was some closure. **However, I still never got to meet another person like me...**

Anyway, now since this life has been forced upon for all my years, I've gotten pretty damn clever with what limited foods I had to eat. And since my mom gave up trying to make me eat new things and just let me loose, nobody formally taught me the culinary norms of this country, which allowed me to experiment. Example: peanut butter and rice? Normal americans would think that's disgusting (I assume) but its delicious! 

**if tl;dr :**
What I tried to make out of that last paragraph is that I would be honored to join this community, and would be overjoyed to contribute everything I've discovered due to experimenting on my own including **how i've actively started to develop a tolerance to gluten** and **all the wonderful things i've baked in the past 5 months after discovering that [this thing is available in my local supermarket now](http://www.bettycrocker.com/products/bisquick/glutenfree)**.

And I'd love to share the stories of how I found out about wheat, and how being GI without knowing what a gluten was affected my life, but I guess that would be more for self-esteem. And since I'm not really seeing that here as much as recipe contributions, I'll just stick to the recipes instead.

I've been eating gluten free again after a year and a half of testing a few months off, a few months on ad nauseum in order to compare how I feel on vs. off, and my conclusion is that I feel much better off. That being said, I test negative for Celiac (the blood test is all I ever took), and often, as horrible as it sounds, I almost wish it was positive (I know that I'm actually very lucky it's negative).

I say this because sometimes I'm scared that I'm just psychosomatizing. It's hard to think of never eating so many delicious foods ever again just because of my suspicion, which COULD be wrong. My doctor says she agrees that if I feel better off it, I'm probably intolerant, but I feel like a ~HARD SCIENCE DIAGNOSIS~ would make it so much easier to put up with the minor disappointments. 

After feeling much better eating GF, this week I've had a shitshow of stomach cramping and constipation and diarrhea and brain fogginess, and I've identified 4 foods I've been eating a bit this last week that are specifically identified as not gluten free by the manufacturers, even though none of them contain actual ingredients with gluten. I feel embarrassed and stupid for thinking that I could be so sensitive as to have issues with cross-contamination when I'm not even Celiac. I feel like a phony and some of my friends/family roll my eyes when I attribute my symptoms to trace amounts of gluten. Does anybody else have trouble with ""trusting their gut""? Thanks so much!!

I had an interesting experience at Olive Garden earlier this week, and wanted to share.

I ordered off of their gluten free/allergen friendly menu. (Mind you, I just have a sensitivity, I am not fully Celiac) When my meal came out, I was not sure it was what I had ordered. I double checked with the server and she assured me it was. Being the trusting person that I am, I enjoyed my meal and went on my merry way...flash forward to the next morning and I am sore, itchy, and doubled over with GI issues. After further investigation, and re-reading the menu online; I realized I had gotten the wrong thing served to me. 

Lessons Learned: 

1) REALLY pay attention to the menu and understand what you are ordering.

2) NEVER completely trust the wait staff, and double check everything when eating out with a food sensitivity 

Because of my experience, I wrote a pleasant email to Olive Garden letting them know what happened. It really was nice and I told them how inexperienced I was, and new to this whole thing. I was very excited about their menu, but my only concern was the lack of knowledge or awareness by the waitress. 

I was very pleased and surprised by their response. What do you all think?

This really shows how much bad information gets out there.  

by The University of Chicago Celiac Disease Center on Monday, September 10, 2012 at 4:33pm ·

I was quite surprised to see that CBS news would provide unquestioned credibility to Dr. Davis, the author of Wheat Belly, on CBS This Morning on September 3rd, with no knowledgeable physician on the program to present a more accurate, balanced viewpoint on such an important issue as the role of wheat in nutrition and disease.
 
The assertions made by Dr. Davis (a cardiologist, not a nutritionist nor a gastroenterologist) are not grounded in fact, let alone any evidence-based research. Gliadin a new protein? Gliadin proteins are major components of gluten and their existence has been known since Dicke and Van de Kamer studied wheat in the 1940s. It is not a new protein created by genetic modifications; and it is indeed a poison, but only for those with celiac disease. Gliadin an opioid that binds to the brain? Sure this is a stunning statement. What is the evidence? Aside from an obscure article that appeared almost 30 years ago reporting an opioid-like activity for some gliadin fractions, nothing else is available in the literature and certainly no data are there to show any binding to the brain.
 
There is enough confusion around celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and the issue of who benefits from a gluten-free diet (only those with wheat allergy, celiac disease or non- celiac gluten sensitivity, I might add). Regrettably, CBS This Morning has added to the confusion and did a disservice to its viewership to allow such questionable information be portrayed as fact.
 
I have no ties at all to the wheat industry, nor do I have any interest in “protecting” it. My interest, as a physician and specialist in celiac disease lies only in protecting my patients and the public from those who would perpetuate unsubstantiated health claims as fact.

I have celiac disease and am usually fairly sensitive so I am pretty sure this is a really bad idea, but I love pizza, and if this works out I will be the happiest gluten-free college student ever. I'll update you guys on my condition as the night goes on. So far I am halfway through my third slice and about 30 minutes in, and I feel fine!

If you are eating/have eaten one today too, please share your experience!


**update!** Finished the pizza. Still feel fine (but very full).

**update 2!** It's been a little over two hours since I started eating the pizza, and I still feel okay! I have a bit of stomach pain but I'm pretty sure it's due to eating a lot more at once than I usually do and not to being glutened. I'd typically have a serious reaction by now if I'd been glutened. I'm going to go to bed now, and if all is well in the morning, I'll let y'all know!



**final update!** It is now the following morning, and I can safely say that I did not have a reaction to the pizza (although, as many of you probably know, this doesn't necessarily mean that it was completely gluten-free or that my body didn't take any damage)! The pizza was really good and I will probably order it again.  
Some thoughts: I don't think I would order a pizza from a store that I knew was really busy - my local Domino's is usually pretty slow since most people prefer one of the 4-5 local pizza places in the area, and knowing that made me more comfortable because I figured there would be time to wipe everything down and less of a chance of cross-contamination. A safer option that I have been thinking about would be to ask to buy just the raw crust dough, which I could then bake and prep in my own gluten-free kitchen, because the crust was *really* good.  
The only thing I was not super excited about was the price - $20 ($17 plus $3 tip) for a small 10"" pizza. That is the same price I've paid for larger frozen/premade GF pizzas and for larger GF pizzas at nicer, independent restaurants. So, you're basically paying for the convenience of the pizza coming from Domino's. Also - I only ordered vegetables on my pizza. I would not recommend getting sausage or pepperoni, because it seems very likely that those toppings would contain gluten.  

All in all, I am okay, the pizza was delicious, and the only thing I didn't like was the price!",,False,,t5_2qx1l,True,,,True,t3_tc9ld,http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/tc9ld/decided_to_risk_eating_a_dominos_glutenfree_pizza/,

Needless to say, being new, I put the words gluten free in the search bar and got all these threads to restaurant servers who HATE customers who ask about GF ingredients, etc. Their comments have really made me think twice about eating out. Maybe I should see if there are any threads to cooks in restaurants and what they think about GF customers. I never thought that servers were that hateful towards us. I ate at PF Changs two weeks ago and even though they have a specific plating procedure and supposedly separate cooking area, I still got really sick from GF lettuce wraps. We had to get a manager about our server before our food came out (about a separate issue) and now I am wondering if our server tampered with my food.

Sorry to beat a dead horse, but there is literally no one who understands like I know this sub will. 

I work at bar and just got off, was having my shift drink when a man who comes in all the time was there. He always chats it up with the only worker there I dislike, so we've never gotten a chance to talk because I just don't converse with said worker. 

Well, he sat down next to me and so I introduced myself and we began to talk. 

His name is 'R' and turns out he works at the bar across the street and we end up talking about alcohol as we both work at bars. We get to talking about local beers and he suggests one to me, I bring up that I have an allergy.

 This is when he scoffs at me and tells me it's a fad, then the bartender that works with me chimes in to say it's all in my head. 

I told them both that I was genuinely sick my whole life, I was constantly at a gastroenterologists office that thought I had chrons (but he never found it, so I had scope after scope) or the hematologist due to severe anemia (thought also to be from chrons). But was never diagnosed so I did my own research and realized all my symptoms pointed to a gluten allergy. Since cutting it out, I feel much more awake, get sick less often, no stomach cramps, and rarely acid reflux. 
They continue to say it's a placebo. Seriously??!
How do you respond to people like this? I mean, I guess I should (and I will) just get over it. They said it was a fad diet because it never was a problem until recently. Really? Is a peanut allergy a fad diet? Because that wasnt a very common thing until recently either, and yet no one doubts somebody with an allergy to it. Do they think I enjoy giving up beer (my favorite thing ever), almost every fried food known to man, label checking everything, and generally paying two times more for food?! Always being afraid of eating gluten accidentally at restaurants because I don't want to feel insanely sick? Ugh, no. Sometimes I just want to slap people.

I work for an all natural frozen food company that makes amazing gluten free entrees. I have a book of free product coupons I need to use by the end of the year and I thought this community might be perfect! I will send out as many as I possibly can and will try to get to everyone who wants a bowl. 

I want nothing from this other than to raise awareness that there are amazing gluten-free options in the freezer. We strive to break down the mindset that quick cannot equal healthy. 

Check us out http://evolfoods.com/in-the-freezer/bowls/

Happy Holidays from your friends over at EVOL. 

[EDIT]: I have plenty of coupons. I will try and get to each of you over the coming days so bear with me! I will shoot you all personal messages as soon as I can. Thanks for the interest!!!

[EDIT2] HOW TO GET A COUPON!!!!! Ok so I figured you guys would come out in force but this will be a lot for me to handle. I am going to set up a generic email for EVOL that I will post as an edit tomorrow. I would PM each of you but I REALLY do not want to spend that much time if I don't have to. I'll make sure you all get 1 (maybe even 2) tasty EVOL bowls. I would highly recommend the Fire Grilled Steak or the Teriyaki Chicken. I hope this is acceptable, I can't think of a better way to do it. You're welcome to PM me your email and I will get to it ASAP. I may cap this at 100 for sanity's sake - we will see!   

[EDIT 3] Hello all! I finally got a new alias set up on gmail. E-mail me at iwantcoupons@evolfoods.com with your reddit user name and address and I will send you some love. Hope you all see this, forget the cap - you email me and you will get a coupon for a free bowl (assuming you posted here).

I say 'sure' because all of the places in close proximity are pretty celiac friendly and this was the only way of getting something to eat. However, we get into the car and it had evidently been decided, by folks who know I can't eat wheat, that we just HAD to go to a pizza place and there was no other way about it. I chirp up 'Well, I can't eat anything there' so they say 'well, we can go to the other pizza place! You can eat there! They have salad!'

Nope. Did not matter, people could not understand or even care.  Pizza place it was and I had to go along with. I sat and drank water and had some crasins I stashed in my bag for emergencies.

I have Celiac Disease, and I've been Gluten Free for 8 years now. I'm also allergic to milk and eggs, so I'm ostensibly vegan (I can technically eat meat, although I don't very often). Having been raised by a Grandmother who was a Gourmet Chef, I had the advantage of learning to cook a variety of cuisines and to use gastronomy, which has come in handy since I now have to do a lot of cooking kung-fu to keep myself from getting ill. :)



One ingredient I love to cook with is Sweet Potatoes. They pack a lot of fiber (and getting enough fiber is a challenge when you have Celiac and leaky gut and all that good stuff), and they also have a low glycemic index. They're a fantastic food, but I do notice that a lot of people seem to dislike them. From what I gather, it seems to come from bad experiences with Thanksgiving meals and those horrible Candied Yams all covered in Marshmallows. People either love or hate those!



What most people don't realize is that Sweet Potatoes work best in savory dishes. Their natural sweetness works best with savory foods, rather than trying to make them even sweeter! So, I'm going to give you my two favorite recipes that use Sweet Potatoes as the main ingredient. You can add meat to these if you want, but they are designed to be naturally vegan, so they'll work either way. And, of course, they are totally Gluten Free! The hardest part of these recipes is peeling and dicing the sweet potatoes, but once you've done it one time, it gets easy and fast.



(Just a warning: I normally cook in a Cast Iron pan on a gas stove, so if you use non-stick cookware or an electric stove, you may have to experiment a bit as you could have a different result at first.)



-------



Recipe #1: Vegetable Curry


This can also be made with meat. If so, I would suggest salmon or a poultry. (I used leftover turkey from Christmas to make for some friends; since the turkey was already cooked, I added it last and shredded it. They went crazy for it!) For uncooked meat, make sure it is diced in small chunks to add later.



1-2 medium-large sweet potatoes

1 each of your favorite vegetables. (You can use zucchini, yellow squash, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, even green beans! Whatever you like!)

3 tbsps olive oil 

1 1/2 tbsps curry powder and 1/2 tsp garlic powder (I like to use the powders because I am lazy.)

1 can of unsweetened coconut milk (the kind with no sulfites)

1 can diced tomatoes

brown sugar

dried pepper flakes


----


Peel and dice sweet potatoes into 1/4 inch pieces.

Dice your vegetables into small pieces as well. 

Add olive oil to a large pan with lid and distribute the oil evenly on the bottom.

Add the sweet potatoes to the pan. Cover with the lid and turn the burner to medium-high.

Every 2 minutes, remove the lid, let the water drain from the inside of the lid back into the pan (watching for splashback so you don't get burned), and stir the sweet potatoes so they don't burn to the bottom of the pan. Return the lid.

After a 5-minute head start, add the other vegetables. (Add the meat at this point, if you are using meat.)

Continue stirring the veggies every 2 minutes to prevent burning, and returning the lid back onto the pan. (Make sure to always drain the water off the lid back into the pan when you lift it!)

Once the sweet potatoes and other veggies are soft enough to cut through with your wooden spatula (but not mushy), turn the heat to medium-low and remove the lid. (If you are using meat, make sure the meat is cooked thoroughly.)

Sprinkle the veggies with curry powder and garlic powder. Mix to make sure they are completely coated.

Add coconut milk. Stir in well until the milk turns yellow.

Add brown sugar and dried pepper flakes until desired sweetness and spiciness is achieved. (I personally use a mango coconut pepper masala just to make it easier on myself!)

Once it just begins to come to a boil, turn the heat down to low.

Add diced tomatoes, stir in and let simmer for 1 minute. Turn off heat and serve.



You can also omit the tomatoes if you wish a spicier, sweeter flavor.



--------------



Recipe #2: Sweet Potato Ragout


A Ragout is a French stew. It's typically made with beef or lamb, and wine. I make mine with sweet potatoes and vegetable broth instead! This is a totally vegan dish, and can be used as a side dish, but is so hearty I typically eat it as a full dinner on its own. Although great for vegetarians and folks who do meatless nights, I tried this dish out on full-on carnivores (I took it to Thanksgiving this year with my friends) and they couldn't get enough of it! 



2-3 large sweet potatoes

1 each of your 3 favorite vegetables (I typically use  zucchini, a yellow squash, and 1/2 cup of white corn, but use whatever you prefer.)

3 tbsps olive oil

1 tbsp garlic powder

sea salt to taste

black pepper to taste

1-2 cups low sodium gluten-free vegetable broth


----

Peel and dice sweet potatoes into 1/2 inch pieces.

Dice your vegetables into small pieces as well. 

Add olive oil to a large pan with lid and distribute the oil evenly on the bottom.

Add the sweet potatoes to the pan. Cover with the lid and turn the burner to medium-high.

Every 2 minutes, remove the lid, let the water drain from the inside of the lid back into the pan (watching for splashback so you don't get burned), and stir the sweet potatoes so they don't burn to the bottom of the pan. Return the lid.

After a 5-minute head start, add the other vegetables.

Continue stirring the veggies every 2 minutes to prevent burning, and returning the lid back onto the pan. (Make sure to always drain the water off the lid back into the pan when you lift it!)

Once the sweet potatoes and other veggies are slightly mushy, turn the heat to low and remove the lid. 

Add the garlic powder. Add salt and pepper to taste. Mix to make sure the veggies are completely coated. Taste the mix to ensure the appropriate amount of salt and pepper has been added.

Turn the heat to its lowest setting.

Pour the vegetable broth into the mix, 1/4 cup at a time. Mix in thoroughly. The vegetables will soak up the broth quickly. Continue to add the broth this way until the ragout has a stew consistency (thick, with possibly a small amount of liquid). Stop adding broth if the consistency becomes too much like liquid (it should not be like soup). If you run out of both cups of broth and the consistency is like mashed potatoes but there is no liquid, do not add more broth. Taste the ragout, and add salt, pepper, or garlic powder to taste if necessary. Remove from heat.




This recipe is tricky and can take some experimentation to get the texture and consistency right. But, once you do figure it out, it is actually easy to make and I've yet to find a person who doesn't love the way it tastes!

[a follow up post].,halfbloodsnape,46,8,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/lukkx/a_warning_about_sushi_being_gluten_free_a_follow/,"A little while ago, I posted asking about how to eat sushi GF. Everyone told me to switch to plainer rolls, sashimi, etc, and bring my own sauce.

So, being the little japanophile that I am, I've been getting sushi 1-2 times a week, being careful and making sure that I wasn't getting imitation meats and nothing was being contaminated.

However, I've been GF for a little over a month now, and while I have steadily improved, I still have really major dips back into awful symptoms. It had me believing that I might not be gluten intolerant.

Last night, my boyfriend and I went to my favorite sushi place, and for a change we decided to get some appetizers. I wanted to make sure that all the ingredients that went on my Filet-Mignon skewer were GF and not going to be drenched in sauce, so I asked and was persistant about making sure each and every piece was gluten free. The guy was extremely helpful, looked up every single item and it was really nice. [it ended up being okay for me! and delicious :3]

However, the problem came when they were about to make our rolls. Knowing that I was allergic to gluten, the guy came over to me and was like ""you know that our rice isn't gluten free, right?"" He was a little confused at this point, thinking that rice on it's own is glutenous, but upon further inspection and investigation, we discovered that they used glutenous vinegar in their rice.

I called a couple other sushi places that I go to on the regular, and they all said the same thing- they used vinegar that contained gluten in their rice.


I checked my original post- only one person warned me that this was a possibility, and I feel like more people need to read this and know, because everyone was telling me that it would be okay, and now I've basically wasted the last month thinking that I was being perfect and meticulous.

Right now I admit that it's not working because the server has many changes in it that the application cannot recognize. I realized that if I am expecting users to enter in information about a product I should do some stuff to help, like:

* Do a Google product search for each item before being entered.
* Ask a user their level of confidence if the product has gluten.
* Show the user how many other users have voted if a product contains gluten or not.

I haven't been updating the app for a few weeks since no one was really interested in it, but that is before I learned about this community.

Here's my review. ,Geohazard,35,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/qdvn7/just_tried_dogfish_head_tweason_ale_glutenfree/,"First off, I myself am not gluten-free, my girlfriend is. I always try to go out of my way to find gluten-free beers for her and for myself since I'm a pretty avid beer drinker. Dogfish is one of my favorite micro-brews so I was excited to try their first gluten-free beer. 

The label touts that it's sorghum-based brewed with strawberries and buckwheat honey. It wasn't any sweeter than any other GF beer I've had. I was expecting a nice fruity/berry taste but got none. It does have less of a ""grainy"" sorghum taste but since it does have a little higher ABV than other GF beers, there isn't much taste to cover up the alcoholic ""bite"" to it, making it a little tough to drink. However, it's still good for a GF beer...better than most others I've had. 

It's worth a try, but that's it. It was $9.99 for a 4-pack of 12 oz. bottles. And it took forever to find. I'm glad other micro-brews are branching out into the GF realm, but there are plenty of better options such as ciders, wine, and mixed drinks to keep the gluten haters happy.

For as long as I could remember, my sister and I have always had problems with headaches and migraines.   It was rare for my head to feel completely clear.  I was always worried I was going to trigger a migraine if I didn’t drink enough water, didn’t get enough sleep, didn’t eat right when I got hungry.  No matter how much I tried to prevent them though, they would always happen.  A migraine would mean all day in bed.  If I stood up, I’d get nauseous and dizzy.  All I wanted to eat when I had a migraine was toast and crackers…no wonder they never seemed to go away!  
One day Tracy (my twin sister) read an article online about how gluten might trigger migraines.  Bread being my favorite food group, the idea of giving up bagels and pasta did not sound fun. But we were desperate to feel better, so we decided to give it a try.
The day I was starting my gluten free trial, I had a killer migraine.  I just wanted to eat some toast or crackers so bad.  Gluteny foods were always my “comfort food” when I was feeling sick.  I fought the temptation though and ate some rice instead.   We kept a food journal and rated how our heads were feeling on a scale of 1-10.  Over the two weeks, the intensity of my headaches/migraines decreased greatly.  There was no turning back now!  I was feeling so much better that the thought of eating bread again sounded crazy.   I did have my challenges though.  Eating out in the beginning was not fun.  I'd also get sad if everyone else was eating something that I couldn't eat.  It was nice having my twin sister going through the same thing as me though.  We supported and encouraged each other, which really helped.  All we would talk about was gluten free this, gluten free that.
A year later, my head feels wonderful!  Most days are clear.  Every now and again I get a small headache, but I don’t stress about it anymore. Before I went gluten free, if I got a headache, my day would be over, guaranteed!  Ibuprofen would do nothing to help.  Now I can take some pills and feel better shortly after.  I love my new life and can’t imagine ever going back to eat gluten!

1372641400.0,37,self.glutenfree,1heboe,I would just really like to share my story with you guys,SnakeTongue7,41,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/1heboe/i_would_just_really_like_to_share_my_story_with/,"Alright, I'm going to apologize in advance for the block of text but I want to thank you guys and feel I have to give you my background to understand. I'm a 21 year old female who previously had a diet consisting of not much variation from bread, pizza, and pasta. I'm a picky eater and bread is my go-to food. 

My freshman year of high school, out of the blue, I became extremely sick. I was vomiting everyday and had no idea what was going on. Tests on tests on tests - diabetes, Chrons, Celiac, any other allergies, I felt like my life was nothing but drinking disgusting things and getting pictures taken of my stomach. Nothing was coming up, nobody knew what to do with me. I lost about 20 pounds over the course of a few months; I was originally a healthy weight, so this was a bit scary. Well, eventually, it kind of just ""went away"". My symptoms became less severe and instead of having symptoms everyday, it would just be a week long of being sick here and there. I just kind of accepted it and still never knew what was wrong. I thought maybe I had Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome, it was the only thing that seemed to make sense. 

Fast forward to September 2011, my sophomore year of college: I wake up one morning, start randomly vomiting, and never stop. Every single day for 3 months I was vomiting at LEAST once a day - it was more like an average of 3 times a day. I couldn't keep food down and lost 40 pounds. No one knew what was wrong with me. My symptoms were nausea, vomiting, and extreme pain. A few months later in November I got a gastric empty study done and after 4 hours, my stomach had only emptied 70% of it's content. So, I was diagnosed with gastroparesis - my stomach was just simply not working. My doctor told me he didn't know why or how, it was idiopathic, and I would just have to live with it. I went on Erythromycin - a medicine that I used to make the food move through my stomach quicker, and then I was at least vomiting less often - my average changed to about once or twice a week. However, this was the only symptom that subsided. I was nauseous and in an INCREDIBLE amount of pain every single second of every single day and nothing helped. I tried taking anti-nausea meds but they gave me migraines - which still made me nauseous. I was completely miserable and saw no end in sight. 

In October of 2012, I was slowly getting worse and worse, my pain was moving to different areas, I found out that I had a B12 deficiency, I was faint all the time, I just didn't think I could get out of bed another day. One day I had extreme pain and I thought that maybe I had appendicitis. I went to the ER, they also thought I had appendicitis, but when they did the scan, I was fine. They discharged me with a UTI. A freaking UTI. I was out of my mind - I'm not crying in pain because of a UTI! I'm a tough girl, I live with terrible symptoms everyday, I'm not in this much pain because of a UTI.

This experience made me realize that my doctor was just not doing enough for me and went to go see another one (and this was the 8th doctor I've seen for my problems over the course of my journey.) Well, thank God, this new doctor was awesome. She immediately knew what was wrong with me - superior mesenteric artery syndrome. SMA Syndrome is when your SMA is squishing a part of your intestine, making it extremely difficult for food to pass through. Apparently, it is extremely rare, so I feel beyond grateful that I went to a doctor and saw a surgeon who were aware of this problem. This past March, I had surgery to bypass that part of my intestine. The moment I woke up, I felt SO MUCH better. I wasn't nauseous or in pain for the very first time in over a YEAR. I was absolutely ecstatic. My energy level was phenomenal, I was on cloud nine. 
Well, a few weeks later when I started reintroducing food back into my diet, I realized that every time I ate something with gluten in it, I felt faint and got brain fog (which is really hard to explain to other people!) and concluded that I probably had a gluten intolerance on top of everything else. Celiac runs in my family, so this wasn't really shocking. This was bittersweet to me - I just had surgery to relieve me of MOST of my symptoms that made me feel like I was going to go insane - if I didn't die first - and now I realize that I can't eat the food I love the most anymore. I was extremely grateful that my symptoms were mostly relieved, but at that point I just felt like I couldn't catch a break.

However, the GF community is amazing. You guys and everyone else out there makes this experience 100x better and easier and I am so thankful that when I made this realization, there were so many options out there to help me get through this. So for that, I thank all of you and everyone else outside of Reddit who has made what would have been an even more devastating realization, not so terrible. And every time I get frustrated with the GF diet, I just remember how miserable I used to be and am happy that this is now my only struggle. Again, I'm sorry for the block of text, but thank you for reading my story and being so awesome!

TL;DR - I was super sick, had surgery, realized I was allergic to gluten, but you guys rock and make it okay.

I'm going to go with taste, price, and how I felt afterwards:

**Taste**: I got a 10 inch pepperoni and cheddar cheese (yeah I went all out) pizza. So I'm going to get right to the point, this is hands down the best gluten free pizza I've ever had and I've had Against the Grain, Unos, Jules Thin Crust, Glutinos, Pizza Pizza... etc. I've basically tried them all. The crust tastes and more importantly, *feels* like a real pizza crust. I'm still so excited over it, it is definitely incredible. My girlfriend loved it so much she ordered her own.

**Price**: My pizza came to $11.66. This is not too terrible and I believe the convenience of having a gluten free pizza that can be delivered to you and tastes great largely makes it well worth the price.

**How I felt:** I only ate half the pizza first to make sure if there were any stomach aches that it wasn't from overeating. A few hours later... my stomach hurts a bit. To be clear, cross contamination usually gets me pretty good. I follow a strict gluten free diet, I haven't had one bite of gluten since I was diagnosed. My stomach pains were dull, and were there on and off but they were not strong enough to stop me from doing anything, merely just an inconvenience.

Overall, the pizza gets a 10/10 for being what it is. The Domino's employees even stopped and told me that it is not 100% safe to eat for those with Celiac, and that made me smile. Dominos is doing a great this and this is a huge step towards getting readily available food everywhere for us. Because of the slight stomach aches, I'll probably get this pizza for a Friday or Saturday night every month or two but I'll continue buying it to support the cause.",,False,,t5_2qx1l,False,,,True,t3_tdrb9,http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/tdrb9/another_dominos_review/,

Turned out it was a gluten-free haven of joy and beauty. After noting the gluten-free baked goods and the gluten-free products roaming freely around the store instead of being quarantined in one small aisle, we got to the beer section.

The. Best. Beer. Section. Ever.

I'm not much of a foodie, eating gluten-free has been difficult at times but I'm pretty content eating the same food all the time and I don't much mind what it is. But I loved beer and kept drinking it way past when it was clear I should give it up, and even now with me feeling better than ever, seeing people drinking a nice-looking beer that I never got the chance to try causes a pang of regret.

This store had almost every type of gluten-free beer I'd ever tried, and even one I hadn't (which is hard to find these days). This store had my very favorite gluten-free beer (brunehaut, they had the amber AND the blonde) which last I checked doesn't even have an Ohio distributor. I mentioned it to a guy working there, basically begging him to reassure me that it would never go away and he said that the woman in charge of buying their alcohol is celiac and it's been there as long as he's worked there.

The market is still a bit pricey but my fridge is going to be continually stocked with an actual variety of beer and for that, I have no problem throwing money at them.

After fighting for years with bowel problems, joint pain, fatigue like I can't even explain, and bouts of crippling depression directly correlated to my diet, I've managed to feel so much better about life. The bloating went away and I feel like a healthy person most of the time. 

But. 

Since I'm new to all of this, I spend a lot of time googling whether or not something has gluten. When I go out to eat, I have to be *that* person at a restaurant. ""Oh, hey, can you check if this thing has any sneaky wheat in it even though I can't think of any reason that it should? Oh, it does? Okay then. Can't get that either."" My boyfriend has been unbelievably supportive, but since we're both new at adjusting to this, a lot of times I have to remind him that I *can't* just split a pizza with him. 

This sucks, and I hate it, and I hate feeling like I'm faking because I've never been officially diagnosed with anything. (Though my grandmother, mother, and sister have all been diagnosed with Celiac and I display the same symptoms as them when they eat gluten.) I hate having to be that person who is aware of every single thing they put in their mouth. I hate adjusting to this lifestyle. Basically all of my favorite things are gone. Bread just isn't the same when it's gluten-free. Pasta isn't the same. Gravy is out of the question unless I make it myself. I know there are tons of awesome gluten-free recipes out there. I've already started adapting some of my favorite things--chicken marsala is still good when you make it with rice flour. Lentil crackers really aren't bad with cheese. But seriously, does it ever get better? Do I ever get to feel not guilty about having to refuse perfectly delicious meals because they're loaded in wheat? At what point do I get to eat things without having to read through an entire ingredient list and then Google all of the things I don't recognize? 

Seriously, I'm so fed up with this. I do so well and then I just hit this wall of guilt and hate. I want to just binge on some freaking breadsticks.",,False,,t5_2qx1l,False,,,True,t3_1ev7ar,http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/1ev7ar/does_anyone_else_feel_guilty_rant/,

I hadn't done all of my research and as a result I was only ""mostly"" GF for those first 6 months, but I didn't know that then.  I missed things.  A lot.  A lot a lot.  There were times I'd tear up at an event or restaurant realizing there was nothing I could eat/drink.

Then, last Thanksgiving I decided to test it.  I ate whatever I wanted - bread, pies, bread stuffing... and was horribly ill for more than a week after; maybe up to a month.  That's when I first discovered the brain fog.  Even after I physically felt better, it seemed like I had to churn taffy in my brain to have a thought   My eyes were heavy, and I slept a lot (now I recognize this lingers even after the intestinal signs of an accidental glutening have passed).  Okay, so even without an exact diagnosis (I wasn't about to go back on gluten after how sick I was then) I knew I had to get serious. 

I bought The Gluten Free Bible and lots of other GF books - I used those GF cookbooks a lot then, finding a lot of disappointment and only a couple really FANTASTIC dishes.  I joined groups all over the internet, downloaded Gluten Free apps, and began reading for non-obvious gluten ingredients (like modified food starch) and stopped drinking beer completely instead of ""one, once an a while"".

It sucked.  Oh, how it sucked.  I also gained about 15 pounds since I was a) no longer always sick and b) trying out every single new gluten free product I could find - most of which have extra fats added for texture and flavor...

I was traveling this past weekend, out for dinner with some of the boyfriend's family who I hadn't met before.  Instead of getting stressed out and looking at menus online ahead of time to see what had ""safe"" choices for me, I found myself saying ""oh, I can eat something almost anywhere, don't worry"".  I never would have said that a year ago, or 6 months ago.  I would have been embarrassed about putting people out and struggled to over-explain what I could and couldn't eat.  Now, it's fine, I JUST NOW realized I don't even think about it too much anymore.

But now, it's easier than it was - magically, it's become a (mostly) non-stressful part of my life.  I hate salads, but figured out I love greek salads and spinach salads.  I've found certain Chinese restaurants that use GF soy sauce - and they watch out for me, know I get sick, and tell me if something I order can't be made ""safely"".  When I eat out I know how to ask the waiter to *ask the chef* about ingredients or cross-contamination (the best piece of advice I've ever gotten; be clear that you are not asking them, you are asking them to ask the chef on your behalf).  If I feel a high degree of trust in a chef/waiter combination, I may go wild and ask if a particular dish can be modified for me.  So many people in the food service industry have a relative or close friend who is GF that it's getting easier and easier to do. 

I know how to avoid fries by ordering a fruit cup, and that my days of eating fries at most places are gone (tossed with flour so they don't stick together/fried in oil with breaded stuff).  I know to ask about marinades or dressings.  I don't feel embarrassed or awkward anymore and can assertively ask the exact questions I want to about gluten (including wheat, barley, rye, and most oats) to a food service person and usually notice whether or not they understand.

I don't carry gluten free crackers around with me anymore, but for the first while they were nice to have (they were like my safety net).  I didn't have to decline cheese (brie with crackers?  no problem, I have my own crackers) or otherwise ""safe"" dips (spinach dip, om nom nom).  Now I have no shame in asking for apple slices from the kitchen/waiter/host - brie, spinach dip (as long as it's GF), and most of that stuff go great with apple slices and I don't have to stare at it longingly wishing I'd brought my own crackers.  

I also used to carry gluten-free oatmeal with me when I traveled (I travel a lot) so that I could always have something to eat if a given meal absolutely would not work for me.  It was good at the beginning, but now I don't feel I need it.  I know how to get eggs and a fruit cup, and yogurt, even if I need to get up earlier to find it.  I used to mourn at ""free continental breakfast"" hotels that I could no longer have a donut or a croissant or cereal, but now I feel a banana, apple, and hard boiled egg is a fine breakfast (and 7-11, White Hen, or gas stations/convenience stores usually have them).

I'm getting into a good stride and it's no longer a daily/weekly cycle of confusion, frustration, and envy.  It gets better.

Here's the best advice I can give for those new to GF:

- Don't eat foods that are GF that you wouldn't have eaten before you went GF.  I didn't eat rice crispy treats regularly before I went GF, so why did I spend months with GF rice crispy treats in my pantry/eating them semi-regularly?  Just because they were GF, that's why.  I didn't have pretzles on hand all the time before, so why did I order a case of the ones I liked (Glutino are awesome) and eat them daily?  No more - if I didn't eat it daily before, why eat it now?

- GF products and recipes can be miserable.  If you try one that everyone else has rated as 5-star on your favorite GF site/forum and it's horrible, don't despair!  You will find things you like, and maybe those people have been off gluten far longer than you and don't remember what the original item tasted like.  Maybe they just had different tastes from yours. (for the record, there are still things that the rest of the GF community says are ""fantastic"" but I think taste like cardboard).

- Experiment.  Find one brand of GF pasta, one bread, one crackers, etc.  Then stop experimenting for a while.  Constantly trying to find yet another thing I could eat wore me out.  Now I have a pattern and it's much less a concern, much less exhausting.

- Make a rule: if you can't eat it, you're not making it.  No, not even if your kids love your shortbread, or your SO loves that homemade chicken noodle soup of yours.  It sounds selfish, but STOP MAKING THINGS YOU CAN'T EAT.  (this phenomenon may be mostly mommy bloggers who are entirely selfless, but they're torturing themselves and feeling angry, worthless, and frustrated all the time.  it sucks.  stop it.).

- Ask, ask, and ask some more.  Unless you're too tired.  Then take a break from asking.  Two weeks before the start of baseball season this year I started visiting and calling the ballpark.  I got transferred around and had to call back numerous times, but then I got ahold of the guy in charge of foodservice.  It turns out a lot of other people had been calling to find out if there would be GF stuff available so he made one bar/kiosk completely GF, with GF beer (Redbridge), GF hot dog buns, hot dogs cooked on a GF grill/roller, etc.  (San Francisco/AT&amp;T park, the bar behind home plate on the promenade!  Ask at guest relations and they'll point you there).  I do this for places I love and frequent whenever I'm in a good, positive mood.  I don't do it in an exhausted, frantic mood.  When that happens I just eat my apples and drink water instead of getting into frustrating situations where I end up tearing up hearing ""no, we can't accommodate you.""  Have a membership at a museum?  One day when you feel great, call up and ask what you can eat and if they're willing to make some choices available to you.  Going to a concert?  Call the venue a week or two before if you think of it :)

Anything else that I missed?  Any other veteran advice that makes things easier?  Any other newbie frustrations or confusions that some of us can help with?

For those who have been GF a long time, how long was it before it felt natural and easier?

1355700282.0,31,self.glutenfree,14yp3z,Top 10 Things To Know About Living Gluten-Free,camerondare,45,14,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/14yp3z/top_10_things_to_know_about_living_glutenfree/,"My mom currently runs a blog called: http://wheatfreemom.com that shares delicious gluten-free recipes!

Recently she put out a free report of her ""Top 10 Things To Know About Living Gluten-Free"", thought I'd share it with you guys on here:

1. Be Informed
Be your own advocate for living a great gluten-free lifestyle. Read the latest information so you have a better understanding of which foods and ingredients contain gluten. Talk to friends and family members who are already gluten-free. Follow gluten-free blogs so that you have access to great recipes as well as information on living gluten-free.

2. Know Your Ingredients
Read all your labels. Do NOT assume that any foods are gluten-free. Watch for words like: modified dairy, modified corn starch, or modified food starch, stabilizer, malted and hydrolyzed protein.

Go to www.celiac.ca (Canada) or www.celiac.com (US) for more detailed information.

3. Keep A Well-Stocked Pantry
Fill it with gluten-free options so that you always have food on hand. Examples: Cereal (e.g. Corn Chex or Rice Chex), Non-contaminated oats (e.g. Only Oats), bread (e.g. Udi's), Flour blends for baking, gluten-free baking power, xanthan gum, pancake mix, corn or rice pasta, gluten-free soy sauce as well as other sauces and marinades. Snacks (e.g. granola bars, corn chips, cookies, crackers), soup stocks (e.g. Kitchen Basics), peanut butter (Kraft), and rice. Also stock your fridge with fresh vegetables, fruit, meats and dairy.

4. Embrace Change
While initially the though of living gluten-free can be overwhelming, take this loss of convenience as an unexpected blessing: you can eat fresher, cleaner, better! Cooking gluten-free means using quality, unprocessed ingredients - whole foods, fresh vegetables and fruits, meats and fish. Take this time to (re)-learn how to cook. Try a cooking class or ask a friend or family member to help you. Get excited! What an opportunity to discover wonderful spices, herbs and flavors.

5. Explore Your Options
Get to know your local grocery and health food stores. I was surprised to find out London Drugs here in Calgary, Canada offers a large selection of gluten-free foods. Venture beyond the big box food outlets. Seek out local Farmers Markets for fresh produce, as well as local vendors and grocers carrying gluten-free baked goods, sausages, soups, etc.

Living gluten-free means shopping in a variety of places to get great food.

6. Ask Questions
More and more restaurants offer gluten-free dishes but if in doubt, ask. If the restaurant you are at does not have a gluten-free menu, emphasize that you are allergic to wheat - more often than not the chef will accomodate you. There will be times, however, when you've nixed the bread basket offer and the water will instead bring you crackers. Not everyone is aware of what contains gluten or wheat, so you might have to explain it more than once. Be leery of any establishment that downplays your Celiac disease or gluten-intolerance. Remarks like ""Are you actually allergic?"" or ""Isn't gluten-free just a weight loss fad?"" may indicate a lack of sensitivity to your special dietary restrictions.

7. Always Be Prepared
More often than not, plan to bring your own food with you - especially when travelling or being on the go all day. Insulated lunch bags are inexpensive and can ensure that you have safe food to eat nearby. Pack a gluten-free snack, a bag of carrots or nuts, a piece of fruit or even a small sandwich. Fast food chains are generally not gluten-free friendly. It only takes a few minutes before you leave the house to get prepared.

8. Beware of Cross-Contamination
Most of us don't live alone, and, in sharing a kitchen, cross-contamination happens. Things like a shared butter dish, toaster, cutting board or food preparation areas and communal condiments like mayonnaise, peanut butter and jam can all collect unseen crumbs that can make you sick. Have your own jars and label them as gluten-free so that no one but you uses them. Make sure cutlery, dishes and counters are kept really clean because even a few crumbs or flour dust can bother a gluten-free stomach.

9. Know Your Physicians
Forge a good relationship with your health professional(s): your gastrointestinal surgeon, primary care physician, naturopathic doctor or acupuncturist. I have found my health care providers to be an excellent source of knowledge and support as well as physical care. (Note: Not all doctors will be helpful, so if you encounter one who is being a pain, seek others.)

10. Be Empowered!
You have the right not to be sick. Fight for your health and clean, wholesome gluten-free food. Early on in my diagnosis I had a few people say to me, ""Come on, is it really a big deal to eat a little bit of wheat?"" At first I felt guilty not eating what others were eating or inconveniencing others to accomodate my dietary needs... until my friend and acupuncturist explained to me that what I had was an allergy to gluten, an allergy that was just as valid as an allergy to dairy or cats or pollen. She asked if I would give just a little bit of peanut butter to someone with a peanut allergy. I, of course, said absolutely not. Gluten should be dealt with in the same way.

Last week I underwent an upper endoscopy recommended by my GI Doctor. She's fantastic.

I went fully gluten free two years ago after realizing that ingesting wheat immediately makes me feel inebriated; my attention span is quite minimal for the weeks to follow. I will have bruises all over my body following a gluten attack from accidentally bumping into... everything.

I also have a plethora of indicators pointing to celiacs (Though I am self-diagnosed as having gluten ataxia) including poor liver function, history of anemia, and skin irregularities. 

My doc said ""endoscopy"" and I said ""awesome."" In the days leading up to the procedure three separate people encouraged me to cancel. One of which was my dermatologist (who is self diagnosed gluten-sensitive), my mother (who always has her opinions), and a friend from high school who was diagnosed celiacs by her endoscopy procedure. 

Why did they want me to cancel? Simple. I haven't purposefully ingested gluten in two years. The tests will probably came back negative.

Something told me to persist and go anyway.

Following the procedure, I found out they removed a tumor (waiting to see if it's cancerous), and they found excess bile, undigested food residue, and a plethora of other digestive issues.

If I hadn't gotten the endoscopy, they wouldn't have found all these problems.

Don't always listen to others when it comes to your own health. Follow your gut, if you want to do a procedure, don't look for permission or encouragement from others! Sometimes, mother doesn't know best :)",,False,,t5_2qx1l,False,,,True,t3_18ghz2,http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/18ghz2/dont_let_anyone_talk_you_out_of_being_tested/,

I have done a crazy amount of research into this. (No need to look too far into that kids)


To all you well drinkers - I found out about 7 years ago I had celiac disease. I don't know how much this will effect you if you are simply gluten intolerant but well liquor is usually *not* gluten free. 

Let me explain - my brother and I are big drinkers. Er, well I was just about to turn 21 and he was in his 30s and we were not giving up our whiskey any time soon for no damn disease! Anyhow, my brother took it upon himself to contact pretty much every major (and many minor) liquor companies to inquire about how gluten free liquor and alcohol is. And to our surprise most of them responded! With both of us being bartenders - over the years we have taken it upon ourselves to figure out if certain things were or weren't gluten free. 
 Get this - if the liquor uses wheat during the process that wheat will come out but if and only IF there is a high number of distillations. A cheap ass well liquor will most likely not have been distilled more than once. Which risks there still being enough gluten inside to make us sick. 


Helpful tips: 
Gin, Tequila, Mezcal and Cachaca should always be gluten free though I'm sure you knew that.
Random ones we were surprised by - Jack Daniels and Finlandia Vodka are not gluten free. What gives Jack?


It's a pain in the ass and I always having to spend way more at bars than my friends, but it's worth it not to have the tummy ache (excrutiating pain and bathroom visits) the next day (week).


Also - have noticed a few people asking/talking about gf beer. I found one at my local pub a few months ago. Daura by Estrella. I guess it's a spanish company and it's pretty delicious. By that I mean pretty realistic tasting. 


Anyhow, just wanted to put my two cents into the community. Thanks to all of you who contribute! I love this subreddit!

edit: JACK DANIELS IS GLUTEN FREE! Thanks to skepticalbutcurious for helping me see the sweet sweet gf light. 

From their website: What are the calorie, sugar, and gluten contents of Jack Daniel's?
Jack Daniel's Black Label Tennessee Whiskey has no carbohydrates (sugar or starch), gluten, fats, or cholesterol, as these are removed in the distilling process. One fluid ounce of Jack Daniel's contains approximately 65 calories.
EDIT 2: found this list. Yes it's been made by a lay person. But is helpful and always suggest to do your own research if something makes you deep bad. (includes other things besides alcohol)

First of all, they took the individually packaged bread out of some plastic in a freezer, and shoved in the microwave. They took it out, cut it with a (out of the package, new, clean) knife. So besides the icky microwaved bread, obviously they had been trained to not cross contaminate their knives, which is nice. However, the rolls are unappetizing and small. It's an additional dollar over the cost of a six inch, and if you want two sandwiches, you can't order a ""footlong"" gluten free roll and pay a dollar (or even two) over the cost of a footlong, you have to purchase two six-inch subs. Okay, so we're up to like 13 dollars for this sub at this point, because one ""roll"" was rather unappetizing and unfilling. And because they are so small, the standard amount of ""sub stuff"" that you would put on a sandwich was overflowing and really really messy. The bread left quite a bit to be desired. I've had a lot of good gluten free bread, and this was not it. You know how alka-seltzer tablets are supposed to melt in your mouth? Sandwich bread should not do the same. It just kind of.. dissolved upon contact with my tongue. On top of this, it took them a full extra 10 minutes to do all the microwaving and freezer retrieval for this sub, making me look like a jerk holding up the line. Overall, really not impressed. 

To make this even better, I'm apparently allergic to something ELSE in the bread (I was having an allergic reaction as I was leaving the store- my guess is there is egg whites in the bread. I couldn't find anything about this because there is no nutritional information available for this bread yet) so overall, really bad experience. I honestly feel less sick from just eating their normal bread.

this morning I got glutened on the last day of a cruise, then suffered the pain during the trip from south Hampton to London. I still am feeling the pain from eating gluten but I've been pushing past it to spend time with my family. naturally I've been grumpy, partially from the gluten making me so and partially from the pain and other problems that come with having celiac. sometimes I just feel so alone in a world of gluten eater regardless of knowing its not the case. I have a really supportive family but when I asked my mom to be extra careful these next couple days she kinda flipped. I know that this is my issue and that I'm the one who needs to be extra careful so maybe I was asking too much, but I felt like I was being yelled at for trying to be extra careful. 

it ended with my mom telling me I need to see a therapist because she's worried about my mental status because of having celiac and that truly sent me over the edge. she says I'm being obsessive and that it's turning into a phobia because its all I think about. but I kind of HAVE to be thinking about it all the time, right? I need to constantly be tracking the knives and hands of people touching my food, I need to be consistently careful at making sure the apple I just set down didn't touch a surface of bread recently. I need to always read the ingredients because they're constantly changing right? 

am I being too obsessive or not obsessive enough because I'm still getting glutened. she says she understands but I don't think that she does because she doesn't have celiac. 

there is always going to be a psychological component of celiac. a constant fear and worry that anything around me could be harmful, as well as a lonely feeling that no one around me gets me but I've only been gluten free for a year. I only just got diagnosed and yes I and the people around me are still worrying. but my mom and I have only been together for a week and this is the stress she feels after one week of being around me, so why can't she understand the constant stress that I'm in? 

I hate being celiac sometimes and yeah sometimes it's a huge bummer in my life but I also know that this diagnoses also saved my life so I'm incredibly thankful. I just wish that sometimes people would realize if they feel this stressed about my eating habits, imagine what it's like for me everyday all day.

I was only 21 and in the middle of trying to figure out EVERYTHING else in my life (college graduation, where I was going to live, work, how I was going to pay to feed myself and two dogs) I get hit in the face with this diagnoses that changed everything. (I was about to go to culinary school to be a baker in Chicago and then I find out my very passion is what is slowly killing me. so yeah I easily changed my focus towards gluten free baking in hopes of opening an entirely gluten free cafe so that maybe the future celiacs of my town don't have to feel like such food outcasts) after the diagnoses I've had to change EVERYTHING. everything I studied and learned about baking was mostly useless. I had to change the only thing I've ever known was solid, my eating habits. it's been really hard, amazing, but hard. I don't know where I'm going with this, I just needed to vent to a group of people who get all these things I'm feeling. I'm just a kid and this is hard. for my mom to tell me I need a psychiatrist because I'm thinking about gluten obsessively was too much for me. it just sent me over the edge and I copped an attitude. that was wrong I know and I feel bad but this is my life. reading labels and googling frantically before I put everything in my mouth, otherwise I may as well eat poison. while all my friends are at beer factory, and eating McDonald's to cute hangovers, I'm stuck with liver damage and a fucked up stomach. While my family enjoys our traditional stuffing on thanksgiving I'm googling to make sure the lotion and shampoo I use to avoid gluten through the skin. I miss my carefree life way more than a non-gluten free person will ever understand. 

I'm still learning, not only about gluten free eating but about life in general. i may be a legal adult but lets be honest I'm just a kid who still doesn't know who i am outside of the one thing I know is certain- I can't eat gluten.

Today, my mom thanked me since because of me she stopped eating wheat, and her belly flab just, disappeared! wooow... *squeel*

Well, GOOD FOR YOU.

Here I am, an avid food lover, not a junk-food eater mind you, an avid tasty, spicy food lover. I LOVE going out for dinner, it is something central to my life. Some of my favorite things you ask? Veggie pizza, lasagna, teriyaki chicken, Pad Thai with soya sauce - YUM. Oh, those double chocolate brownies from Starbucks, and their Javachip frap - HEAVEN! I feel okay, great even, no throwing up or anything, bloated sometimes - but hey, everyone has gas now and then. 

But turns out I have Celiac's disease. Okay well, I can deal with that right? Sure, ditching all my favorite foods will probably make me feel better since I have this disease right? NOPE. 

All I've noticed since I've developed this frigging new age disease is that I can't eat ANYTHING, and I still feel the same. Heck, I feel worse because I am SO ANGRY and depressed that this part of my life has just been tossed. Okay, all you people loosing weight and feeling great coz you cut out wheat, just because of me, to support me and all, well FUCK YOU ALL, coz I have NO OPTION and it doesn't do SHIT for me!

I weigh the same, I don't feel any different, I feel more tired now because I usually can't get the carbs I need unless I want to drive all the way from work to my house every lunch and cook for myself. While my skinny ass full of energy friends survive on Coke and chips and candy. 

oh and money? You want this tiny, full of fat and tastes like crap GF pizza? OKAY THAT WILL BE 2 MORE DOLLARS than that huge normal, delicious, pizza. Well, I don't have 2 more fucking dollars.

I am losing faith in the doctors who diagnosed me. Do they even know what they're doing? I have moderate-severe damage? I can get cancer from it? Oh, even a little bit can trigger it, like even a trace amount, but eating a whole butt-load of bread doesn't even give me gas?  What now?

Are you sure its not something else? Because I DON'T FEEL ANY DIFFERENT.

Sorry for the rant, I needed to get it out. I think I have have another problem as I am pretty depressed (day time sleepiness, random crying spells, bursts of anger etc.) and not getting the reward for a sonofabitch GF diet just aggravates it.

Makes 2 cookie-sheets

In a mixer, combine:

	2 Tble. softened butter
	1 Egg
	1/2 tsp. salt
	1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper
	2 C. shredded sharp cheddar  (8 oz.)
	
In a separate bowl, whisk together:

	3/4 C. brown rice flour
	1/4 C. potato starch (not potato flour)
	1 tsp. xanthan gum

Set aside for later use:
	
	Kosher salt for sprinkling on top of crackers

Gradually add dry mixture to mixing bowl of cheese mixture.  If crumbly, add water to the dough, 1/2 a Tablespoon at a time, until the dough sticks together.  

Divide the dough into two equal balls.  Wrap each in plastic wrap and allow to rest for about 1/2 an hour.  This allows the xanthan gum to absorb the moisture.  (If pressed for time, you can skip this step.)  

Unwrap and place one of the balls of dough on a 14.5""x19""(-ish) Silpat cooking mat.  (If you don't have one of these Silicone cooking mats, use parchment paper.)  Using your fingers, press as flat as you can into a rectangular shape.  Cover with plastic wrap.  Roll dough out as evenly as possible to less than an eighth of an inch thickness.  While this step is tedious, it is essential that you get the dough even.  Roll dough out to within about an inch of the edge of the Silpat or paper.  It may not seem like you have enough dough, but if you're rolling it thin and even you will.  Try to square your edges as much as possible.  

Once dough is rolled out, use the back of a butter knife (back of the knife so as not to cut the Silpat) to cut a grid pattern into the dough, making the crackers whatever size you desire.  Prick each cracker a couple of times with the tines of a plastic fork (plastic so as not to damage the Silpat.)  Sprinkle the crackers with the kosher salt.

Slide the Silpat onto a perforated support tray or parchment paper onto an un-insulated cookie sheet.

Repeat this process with the second pan while you cook the first pan.

Bake for 8 minutes.  But keep an eye on them.  You want the tops of the air bubbles on the crackers to be just brown, but not the whole cracker.  If you rolled the pan unevenly, you'll notice that the thinner crackers will brown faster than the thicker ones.  No problem -- just remove the pan from the oven, pick off the crisp crackers, and pop the rest of the pan back into the oven.  Repeat the process as much as you need.  If you have some really thick crackers, you can flip them over before you put them back in the oven.  This will help them crisp up evenly.

Cool thoroughly, then store in an air-tight container.  I don't know how long they'll keep fresh for.  I've never had any last that long.

Here's my experience!",alicia-peacha,32,6,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/1id0tx/ive_been_checking_out_rpaleo_lately_and_it_led_me/,"http://whole9life.com/start/ if you've never heard of it.

I have been diagnosed with Celiac for over a year and haven't seen much improvement on the gluten-free diet. 

So I tried out a Whole30 for the month of June, eating as many unprocessed foods as possible, mostly just veggies and meat. When it ended I lasted two days eating beans, corn, rice and sugar, and then I went right back on it! I felt uncomfortably full from those foods, and even got a headache and had trouble sleeping.

I went from 135 to 130 lbs, where I'm happy to stay. My motivations were to feel less fatigued from my Celiac, and to reduce how much sugar I was eating, among other things. I had mostly subsisted on rice and corn-based products, with a fair amount of legumes, some dairy, and moderate amounts of veggies and fruit. I pretty much used to eat a lot of eggs, bananas, Udi's bread, peanut butter, and processed foods.

I sleep better and feel stronger and less fatigued already. My only exercise has been walking a mile or two a day most days, some yoga, and hefting my 15 mo. old nephew around a bit.

As a former vegetarian, shopping for and preparing meat posed a challenge, but I am starting to get the hang of it. I get about a third of my protein from eggs, and the rest from beef, turkey, or fish (for some reason, chicken and pork haven't been appealing).

Aside from some stomach trouble at first, this has been a really great experience. It was extremely challenging, though. I felt so hungry at first, and had every carb craving imaginable. It was almost as bad as quitting smoking at times. Even seeing people eat certain foods on tv was difficult. And I won't get into the stomach troubles, but my digestion is a work in progress. There was a week where I didn't have the energy to exercise, but that's ok. Sweet potatoes/yams were pretty necessary for my proper functioning.

Celiac left me with a lot of nutritional deficiencies, and although the grain-free diet is spendy, I feel like I made the right choice moving to ""nutrient-dense"" foods. My favorite dish so far is guacamole on grass-fed steak, but every vegetable and fruit tastes way better than before too. 

I get most of my calories from fats, like meats, coconut milk (cream), some coconut oil, and olive oil. There is definitely a lot more cooking involved, but it has been worth it. We'll see what I choose to add back in, but so far I am happy with it!

I highly recommend giving the Whole30 a try, using their web resources. And check out the recipes on /r/paleo if you don't already.

IBS, depression, chronic fatigue, anxiety, anemia, chronic adult-onset cystic acne, chronic migraines, even anorexia.  (Notice that most of these ""diagnoses"" are just labels for the symptoms and have very little to do with a solution)  Beyond that, I had lost my sex drive (and I am married to the most wonderful and patient man in the universe who is very sexy and I love him very much), have had diarrhea for over 5 years, and missed almost every party, concert, or fun weekend away in my 20s because I had a migraine/no energy/stomach issues, etc. I knew something was very wrong, but no one could tell me what.  My ""treatment"" always seemed to come back to ""It's all in your head.  Just have a better attitude about it."" 

I was registered with disability services while a in college due to an inability to attend with class on a dependable schedule and inability to meet deadlines due to my many illnesses.  I even had a professor tell me when I asked for advice on a career that I was much too ill to work and shouldn't bother interviewing.  Despite these things, I graduated with honors and two degrees.  And I did go on to be a hard working, dependable employee and eventually even walk across a continent for charity.  But I have been sick the whole time with no real explanation.

Until last year while I was walking across the US.  Through a reddit conversation, some kind soul suggested that I look into gluten intolerance and celiac disease.  She was specifically referring to my loss in sex drive, but I had no idea that this could be the key to managing all my illnesses - that it WAS my illness.  Though I was unable to give up gluten in my present lifestyle (try finding 5,000 cal. of GF food every day while living out of a backpack on the road on a shoestring budget!), but it was a first priority when I got home and starting building a new routine.

I have been gluten-free, save a few accidental glutenings, since January 1 of this year.  The changes are overwhelming.  Some happened almost immediately - like the return of energy I hadn't felt since I was 17 - and other things have taken more time such as my skin.  It is healing slowly, but there is a lot of scarring that will take months or even years to fade.  Still other elements I have not yet seen a change, but have hope for the future as I continue my GF diet.

I have had issues with hypoglucemia - low blood sugar - that I suspect has something to do with a lack of carbs in my diet after going GF, damage to my digestive system from gluten, and irregular eating patterns.  Has anyone else had this issue?  Fortunately, I work with service dogs and have one that naturally alerts to my blood sugar when it is too low, so I have help in this regard.  Having a service dog is a little embarrassing (people say things/ask a lot of questions like ""you don't look blind or sick""), but its nice to be able to take her everywhere and have someone that will check in with me and remind me to eat when I need to.

Gluten intolerance - what could be celiac disease - has drastically altered my life.  (Testing is expensive and then I have a pre-existing condition on my health insurance.  Why go through that when the answer is the same? Don't eat gluten.) There are positives in knowing what is wrong with me and how to  manage it, but I am also having difficulty accepting that it is a physical problem and not just all in my head as I have previously been made to believe.  I feel both empowered and powerless.  

Thank you in advance for your kindness and support, or unfriendly, scolding commentary if that's what you're into.  I just don't want to be alone in this today.

The deep joint and muscle aches.  But about 36 hours after I've initially been glutened, the rage shows up.  The best way I can describe it is as a hot static foaming in my brain and over my skin.  It's like. . . standing in the middle of a crowd while wearing heaphones turned to a poorly-tuned radio station.  And someone's at the controls steadily cranking the volume up.

Low points include blaming it on the cat; boyfriend's sister proclaiming we must have passed a cow pasture for a smell that bad to envelope the family car. (*No, it's just me…*)

Slowly the problem got worse. Sometimes my belly would become so distended I could barely function or wear clothing. Heating pads didn't help, working out didn't help. The amount of money that went to super-strength over-the-counter gas relief remedies each month was insane…

Soon enough, I was gassy and bloated all the time. For **two years**, I was uncomfortable and swollen at *all hours, every day*- my midsection felt planetary. I thought everyone experienced this, that it was completely normal, and it was just that no one was talking about it. It would have been, after all, embarrassing to openly address my similarities to Walter the Farting Dog. My doctor finally prescribed me a daily Prilosec pill in an attempt to get a hold on my gastrointestinal confusion.

The worst part was when true pain reared its ugly head. Sometimes I would have this feeling like my intestines were repeatedly being punched, or ripped open. In the mornings I would wake up with stomach acid in the back of my throat, and sometimes it would make my voice hoarse. I often cancelled plans in order to consume my weight in digestive aids, heartburn relief, and gas eliminating pills.

Most disturbingly of all, my belly stopped having sensations that are normal for bellies to have. Or, at least, it was having all the wrong ones. One result of the aforementioned eating disorders was a great sensitivity to the feelings in my digestive system. But I stopped feeling hunger. There was no fullness. There was no satisfaction, only bloating and burning and pain. This freaked me out more than anything.

One day, a friend who was diagnosed with Celiac disease at two years of age mentioned that what I described was eerily similar to her experience when gluten accidentally makes its sneaky way into her food. So I went to the doctor, and he said, ""stop eating gluten,"" like it was NBD (and possibly also like I was crazy).

... fuck, you guys. I spent almost **THREE YEARS** thinking my body was alternating between attempts to turn inside out or kill me. Within a week of eliminating gluten I noticed positive differences. At six months I was amazed. Now, a year later, my relationships with both food and my belly are 1000% better. 

I'm at a place I didn't think I could ever reach; three years of being a human balloon was a much longer time than I thought. And when I consider the time I spent hating food and my body and my self before then… it makes me cry. But now I have had a year of goodness and I feel healthy and in tune and I am learning to like and appreciate my body. I feel like me. I feel like a human.

I won't say that cutting gluten from my diet solved all my problems (I'm an underpaid fine arts graduate…). It's just a grain protein. But still, isn't it weird that such a minute thing can make such a difference? I want you to think about this next time you have the urge to cheat.

I would like to hear your story.,CandyDish,30,4,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/1jc93m/having_a_major_case_of_the_sads_and_need_some/,"I'm sitting here in tears, just so overwhelmed with everything.
I am 6 weeks into a GF diet. I started it on a recommendation from my chiropractor, who does an adrenal massage and was worried that I always complained my stomach was tender. I agreed, and figured if anything, I might lose a few kilos, because I never planned on buying GF substitutes, just removing them. I didn't think it would have any effect. I cut out both gluten and dairy.

And then... I suddenly was feeling full after I ate. This is coming from the girl who, at a low point in my life, could consume a whole packet of pasta in one go. I was always hungry, I never understood proper portions because I just had insatiable hunger. 

I was sleeping better, and upon waking...actually feeling awake. I don't need to sleep 10 hours a night. 

I lost 3kg in a week from bloating. My stomach shrank, I could put pants on I hadn't worn in awhile, and it changed from a hard ball to a soft, jibbly bit of fat (I'm fat, I used to eat a lot of pasta, uncontrollably).

The one that makes me cry, is the one about brain fog. I always used to feel hungover, that's the best way to describe it. Like a literal fog was in my brain, blocking my view, sometimes making things jerky, like life is a quick succession of pictures rather than a flowing video. It was just gone one day. I felt GOOD.  

Then I got glutened. The first time, I didn't really put the two together. I woke up feeling terrible. I wanted to go back to sleep, I was bloated, cranky, felt like I'd had two bottles of wine. It took me a day to figure it out, and I felt like a fool. I always thought it would just be the runs, or vomiting. I'd always attributed the fog to spinal issues in my neck and lower back. 

Then it happened again, and again, and I noticed a pattern. All of the above. The bloating is awful, and happens within an hour of eating. I don't have gas anymore, but I get it, and it's painful. Then, the next night (slow metabolism), cramping. Sweet Jesus, the pain. It gets intense for about half an hour and then I get white cold, sweaty, and I want to vomit. Then I need the toilet. I haven't vomited so far, just get nauseated. 

It's not just one symptom, it's a complex system of issues that band together and rain down a torrent of horror on my body. It lasts for days. Now, I can feel if I've eaten any little bit, I get bloated. 

My chiro is also on a GF diet. I asked him what happens if he eats, say, a sandwich. He gets bloating and 'digestion issues'. 

I've done a bit of reading, googling, and redditing to peice this all together and I feel like a fraud. I'm not willing to eat 3 peices of bread each day for 6 weeks (which is what I read is needed for the test). The thought is terrifying, I won't do it. So I have no test, no conclusive evidence. People ask if I've been tested, and I say no, and they automatically assume I'm on a fad diet. I've had that said to my face. It hurts, they don't get the pain, the fog, the bloating, the cramping.

I don't feel like I belong here, because I haven't got a test with a positive result. I'm a science girl. I want the stats and the numbers. 

Yesterday, I must have eaten something with gluten, because I have all the symptoms. So, I'm sitting here reflecting on how I got here. I would love to hear your story. Maybe, just maybe, yours is similar to mine, your symptoms are the same, something, to make me feel like I really do belong on this path, and I'm not lying to myself or to anyone else. 


**TL; DR: Tell me your story, how you were diagnosed and how you react to gluten now. In a bit of a downward funk about it all.**

I told her I would scavenge the breakfast room and have a report prepared for her in the morning. 

I spent about 20 minutes in the breakfast room to find that we have a very very small selection of gluten free foods. Rice krispies, yogurt, and fruit. I couldn't be 100% positive about our eggs/sausage because the boxes that they come shipped in, get thrown away and that's where the ingredients info is. 

I wrote her a nice letter explaining our gf options, and apologized for not having a better selection.

So I'm well aware that this post is going to come across as kind of weird. 


I've been gluten free for a little over a year now, I was never diagnosed properly but after years of acid reflux, perpetual exhaustion, upset stomach and the doctor having no clue what was wrong, I did an elimination diet and when I removed gluten felt 10billion times better. I could never face the idea of submitting myself to the torture again to get diagnosed so I just continued on eating gluten free and feeling fabulous. 


It's become a part of my lifestyle now. I read labels on EVERYTHING, I know the restaurants I can eat at and I carry snacks with me just in case. I hadn't had an accidental glutening in about 8 months.. Until yesterday. 


I was sitting at a KFC, a place I haven't eaten at since before I stopped eating gluten, waiting for my dog who was being groomed across the road. It was really hot and I decided to go inside and get a bottle of water. 


I ordered my water and some food, ate, picked up my dog and walked home. 


.. Walked through the door and realised what I had done. Wtf? I ate a wrap which includes the bread, obviously, but breadcrumbed chicken too. Their fries/chips which are coated in flour to make them crispy AND the seasoning contains gluten.  What? I can't even. 


So it's the next day and I feel absolutely disgusting and I have no one to blame but myself, so I'm not complaining. I am just so bewildered that I could have autopiloted through an entire meal after over a year of meticulous GF living. 


Has this ever happened to anyone else or am I just ""special""?

Of ALL things to get sick over it was a KFC wrap and some chips I can't even remember.

I had to investigate.  This is what I sent Pepsi; response pending.  


Dear Pepsi,
I found an article on Reddit about a new type of Peps bottle that will be made from 100% plant material and therefore will be biodegradable.  While this AWESOME, I have one slight concern about the bottle.  The fine print states that ""The bottle is made from switch grass, pine bark, corn husks and other materials.  Ultimately, Pepsi plans to also use orange peels, oat hulls, potato scraps and other leftovers from its food business.""  

The concern revolves around ""oat hulls"" and the potential for those who have Celiac disease or who are gluten intolerant to inadvertently be exposed to the adverse effects of gluten.  

Can you confirm that this new wonderful advancement in biodegradable materials production will not contain gluten, potentially contaminating your Pepsi product contained within this new container type?  My wife and I thank you for a swift, accurate, and honest response.  :)



EDIT: Pepsi Response:
Dear [Jayheart],

Thank you for contacting us at Pepsi-Cola and for sharing your comments about our Green bottle. We always appreciate hearing from our friends.

This bottle is non-allergenic since it's the same exact material as the current PET, it only it comes from plants. There are no plant remnants in the bottles, and it is completely safe for food and for ALL our consumers. 

Thanks again for thinking of us. We appreciate your friendship and support.

She explained that most of their menu could be made into a gluten free dish, and that they had a special place on the grill and in the kitchen where they prepared those things. They even had a special type of corn pasta.

After a lively and fun discussion, I decided to try the chopped salad (which comes with no bleu cheese, no croutons, and special dressing) the chicken parm (grilled and no breading) the corn pasta with marinara (such a delicious texture) and creme brulee.

When I was just a little boy, my mother asked: ""What will it be? Will it be gluten? Will it be coeliac? What is his destiny?""

Doctor: ""Coeliac, a drag. Whatever he eats will be free; of gluten and you will see; he will regain a good health track .""

I have bad music taste and worse poetry skills.

I also had the privilege of not having to eat gluten from age 3 to age 11 , diagnosed as coeliac. However, apparantly either the doctor was slightly wrong, or a miracle had occured, because after a gastroscopy and related pleasant -scopies, in 1990 specialists concluded that, hey, it should be fine now. And then I stepped into the vast world of gluten-containing food.

Fast forward through gluteneous puberty, adolescence, adulthood and generally about a quarter of a century carefree feeding, and I find myself with vague symptons of tiredness, light dermatitis, weight gain, some migraines etc. All attributable to lifestyle, stress, mundane external factors, right? Right. 

Enter my skin-specialist sister. 

S: That dermatitis? Food related. You should retry gluten free.

Z: Are you absolutely kidding me?

S: Nope. Do it.

Z: Hell no.

S: Seriously.

Z: NO! I AM FREEEE. I NEVER HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

S: Maybe you should try it anyway.

Z: NEVER


So another month later, here I am. 

I went to a bio-supermarket to stack up and did not really know what to expect. 

My childhood memories mostly contain the well known untasty bread, vacuum prepacked or frozen. Nothing else existed. Later on this was supplemented by crisp bread, and near the end even oven-ready frozen croissants and chocolate buns were obtainable (though we had to drive about 3 hours there and 3 hours back to get those). But 75% of the time, just the bread. With that taste. 

The supermarket I went to last week had gluten free food. 32 shelves of it; I counted them. There was regular fresh bread, raisin bread, 10 varieties of crisp breads, hamburger buns, hotdog buns, granola, flour, rice puffs, cereal-stuff, biscuits, cakes, cookies, pastas, baguettes, sandwiches... I felt like someone in the Klondike Gold Rush who discovered A Big One.  

I got a cart full of goods and went home to rearrange my pantry. And restarted my diet. It's going much better than expected. 

When I was a child I couldn't go to a party, a camp, any social event at all without having to be the one with the special food and the separate tray that noone else could eat from, making me stand out. No cake for me. No biscuits. No treats. Evil gluten inthere.  I'll just sit here with my foul defrosted dry bread and crisp breads, looking at you munching pie and cake, thank you very much. No problem at all.

Today, I can just bag some cookies, cakes, granola and other treats for the occasion and even share that with others as well! My cinnamon cookies are a favourite by all.  Some hamburger buns for a bbq, some ciabatta for a brunch. A huge difference comppared to 25 years ago. I'm very happy the choice is so elaborate nowadays, making it so much easier to avoid gluten. I even had gluten free pancakes on sunday. 

I do have to adapt to the lack of fiber; but that's a small price. Already my skin is getting better (that, or my eyesight is going), my headaches less and sleep seems deeper. I told myself I'm going to at least do this a month and then evaluate how I'm feeling and faring.  But so far, so good, and less adaptation needed than expected. 

This little story just to say that from my time-warped perspective, gluten free today is not as restrictive as it was, easier and little to none social awkardness. I'll be checking this sub a lot, because I see I haven't found all the new stuff and possibilities by far.

The most fun part about the casein sensitivity is that even if something is labeled dairy-free, it can apparently have a casein derivative in it (thanks, non-dairy creamer).

Consequently I've basically decided it's too much effort to explain my food problems to people (although I did make [a chart](http://i.imgur.com/xv1f26g.jpg) for people who are super curious) and ask people to not compensate for me when planning things to do with food because it's hard enough for *me* to compensate for me with food.

I still have very high anxiety when it comes to being ""forced"" to eat food that I haven't seen prepared because of some very nasty reactions I've had and since some people - including my grandparents - think it's okay to give people food with things *they are allergic to in it* as long as you just don't tell them, I personally prefer to just be left out completely.

Also, I still get disappointed when people say I can have food and then I can't :p I wasn't expecting any candy for Christmas or Easter but my mom got me some anyway and going through the packages this morning was just depressing. Curse you hidden milk and wheat ingredients!!

I'm almost 17 now. I've learned how to deal with it and I do realize that there are other people have it worse, but it doesn't make the situation any better. I still get so frustrated about the fact that I can't eat the foods that everyone else can. 

My mom just made chicken alfredo and it smells so good. I want it and I made GF noodles for myself but I can't bring myself to eat them. I made them right and as soon as they were done they looked like regular noodles but 10 minutes later as I'm about to eat, they are clumping and sticky and unattractive. I'm just so tired of having to eat this shit while I watch the rest of my family eat fresh gluten pasta that looks good and actually has flavor. 

It's not fair. I didn't ask for this stupid disease. I'd rather be fat and eat the foods I want than to be skinny and suffer watching everyone eat what I wish I could. I hate celiac. I hate it so much. I hate it when I tell people I can't eat wheat and they straight up ask me if I can eat WHEAT bread. No you stupid fuckers. 
I hate it when people come to school with baked goods and I have to say no and watch everyone sit and chow down. I hate cullinary class where all we make is quickbreads and while everyone else is sitting there eating I have to sit and watch them, wishing I could eat the tasty treats I just made. I usually go home and make the same treats, just GF, but its still frustrating as all hell. 
I play it off like its no big deal most of the time but it really gets to me. Like right now. I'm so sick and tired of it. I wish they would develope a pill we could take.
 Sorry for the long read, I just needed to get this off my chest and I'm hoping some of you can understand.


Edit: thank you, everyone, for your kind words and and advice. I should make it clear that most of my family is pretty supportive and understanding. I just had a little breakdown last night. My grandma, one of my brothers, and my sister all have celiac as well and react to it a lot worse than I do. My mom will cook gluten free for the most part and I understand that it's hard to accommodate everyone, so I appreciate her efforts. As for my culinary teacher, I'll talk to her about it and see if I can arrange something. After I told my mom how upset I was she made me more GF noodles. Her trick is pouring some olive oil on them right after draining them out, it keeps them from sticking. Celiac really gets to me sometimes, but I'm feeling a lot better now.

So this is how my conversation with Starbucks went. (I can provide images if anyone wants proof, I just figured copy and paste would be easiest for now.)

ME: I'm looking for your allergen information. I was recently diagnosed as gluten sensitive so I want to find out which of your items are gluten safe. Many of your drinks have cookie bits in them, which usually contain wheat flour which is a gluten product. Can I find a list anywhere of your gluten free drinks? ***Next part of my message was removed as it is unrelated***



Thank you for contacting Starbucks.

Starbucks is unable to guarantee a ""gluten-free"" environment in our retail locations due to the potential for cross contamination with gluten-containing products. The open environment and operating procedures of our store locations may present additional risk for gluten-sensitive customers aside from the gluten-containing ingredients themselves. ""Gluten-free"" is a claim with specific requirements defined by government agencies and industry standards. We are unable to make this claim on a product unless the item is specifically formulated and manufactured to meet the definition of the claim.

Thanks again for writing us.  If you ever have any questions or concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to get in touch.

Sincerely,
Ronin M
customer service



OK-Not as helpful as I would have liked so I responded: Hello Ronin, 
I understand the risk of cross contamination, but I was more looking for a list of ingredients so I can confirm which products for sure contain gluten. I'm not sure what ingredients that are used besides cookie bits that would even contain gluten- which is information I was hoping I would be able to receive from you. Knowing which items are completely off limits will help me make my own decisions without holding Starbucks responsible. 

Thanks



And the response I get is:Hi (my name),

My name is Frances and I'm from Starbucks Customer Service.

Unfortunately, the information you are requesting is proprietary information, which we are unable to divulge.  I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
 
Sincerely,
Frances P.
customer service


What?? Ok so my final reply:Frances, 

Allergen information is proprietary? It seems like if people are purchasing your products they have a right to know the ingredients. 

You apologize for the inconvenience? I apologize for the business you are losing.

Just a few random highlights:

* The first day we hiked up the Grouse Grind (1-hour very very intense hiking trail close to the city) and the cafe at the top had some really great gluten-free cakes and brownies.
* The tiny supermarket at Whistler was packed with all sorts of gluten-free options.
* There are 20+ restaurants downtown with gluten-free menus.
* Ed's gluten-free specialty had literally hundreds of products I had never seen before.

Here are the places I personally tried (I didn't get sick at any of them):

* [Ed's gluten-free specialty](http://www.edsglutenfree.com/), a small store near downtown with hundreds of dried and frozen gluten-free products.
* [Rocky Mountain Flatbread](http://www.rockymountainflatbread.ca/), gluten-free pizza (REALLY good). All toppings gluten-free and I think they cook the gluten-free crust in a segregated area of the oven.
* [The Fish House in Stanley Park](http://www.fishhousestanleypark.com/menus_dinner.html). Their menu is marked with gluten-free options, and their fish was pretty damn good.
* [Gorilla Food](http://www.gorillafood.com/menu-2-2/). A vegan/raw food restaurant where every item on the menu (including the deserts) is gluten-free. WARNING: Everything there is very very healthy, not safe for carnivores.
* [Shizen Ya](http://shizenya.ca/). A very good healthy-sushi (brown rice) place that served me gluten-free soy sauce :)
* [Bayshore Hotel - Seawall Bar &amp; Grill and Currents](http://www.westinbayshore.com/dining), hotel restaurant with a gluten-free menu. They made me a lunch box before I walked around the seawall.

I used the following to find a lot of these places (I wish I had had more time to try them all T_T):

Also some bakeries and cafes:

Does anyone else do this?,,25,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/iv45c/ricewich_does_anyone_else_do_this/,"I've been making an effort lately to eat gluten-free (I'm told I have Crohn's Disease, rather than Celiac, but I heard going gluten-free would help, and I think it has) but of course there are foods that I miss. So my project lately has been to re-create the essence of these foods in a rice cooker, using a little creativity and some spices. I just wanted to share a recipe and ask if anyone else has done likewise.

Tuna, lettuce, pickle and tomato on rye:

My normal lunch is a cup of rice, made in a rice cooker with 1.5 cups of water and a little salt or part of a bouillon cube. Instead of using only water, for this I use half water and half leftover brine from a jar of good dill pickles. The rice will look unremarkable, but taste pleasantly of a deli-style pickle. Rye bread is my all-time favorite, but much too fibrous to digest easily. So, to simulate the rye, I add a sprinkle of caraway and a little fennel to the rice before starting the cooker. For the tomato, a couple fresh slices alongside the finished product, along with a little canned diced tomato (with a little of the juice) transmits tomato-ness to every grain of the rice, just as with the pickle brine. 

Top with a can of tuna and mustard to taste, and that's all there is to it. I'm not much of a cook, but this was so effective that I really wanted to share it. Completely cured my craving for a deli sandwich, without upsetting my digestion. If anything, I'd say that rice is even more effective than bread in transmitting the wanted flavors.

I'm not proud of the moments when I slip, like tonight. I slipped tonight, but that's not important at the moment. What's important is that I'm not doing it for weight loss. I'm doing it because it makes me feel better. It makes the heartburn go away, my BMs regular and less painful and embarrassing, and the stomaches less.

I'm still learning about how to go about this the right way, and learning what foods are naturally gluten free, what foods aren't and what processed foods have unnecessary gluten added. Up until last night I believed Pinkberry was one of those companies that added flour to their yogurt to help it stick. But apparently, they don't. And I got excited, so I posted that on my FB: ""PINKBERRY IS GLUTEN FREE!? That should not have been brought to my attention.""

When I woke up the next morning I was met with this comment from a college acquaintance: ""Yogurt never had any gluten to begin with. This is about as dumb as gluten free hotdogs or gluten free dried fruit. **Seriously, do I have to hit you?** Not to rag on you in particular but I'm so sick of the food industry promoting misleading information. **Gluten free does not equal healthy**.""

Are you serious? I know this girl well enough; she was serious.

What followed was myself and a few GF friends commenting on the fact that we know it isn't the healthiest. And I insisted that this wasn't for weight loss. 

She responded: ""Ok, but dairy, meat, fruits, beans, herbs, spices, and vegetables don't have gluten. It's a wheat product. It's only when you add something to them like cookie dough ice cream that you would have to look for gluten because that's in the dough. But **lauding something for being gluten free when it never had gluten is retarded**, but I get that they do that b/c people don't understand what the hell is in their food.
I honestly believe if people in this country would make their own food rather than eat prepared meals, most health problems would go away. People don't have a varied diet anymore. **Food allergies were almost non existent until after the Green Revolution**.""

She then described her dietary habits to prove why she was healthier than all of us. A friend then told her that when she makes ice cream, she puts flour in it as a thickening agent. My boyfriend then swooped in and told her off, as he was not thrilled with her calling me ""retarded"" (in a roundabout way) and threatening to hit me. She yelled at him, and followed with: 

""And most people don't think about their food choices, don't bitch at me for stating the truth. Clearly Heather is getting informed. 
Personally I think the gluten free diet fad is overwrought. Humans have bred (pun!) wheat for millenia and our bodies have adapted for wheat digestion. I think its more likely that the chemicals we spray on these crops are causing these problems not the crop itself.""

I then told her that I hope she phrases her arguments better if she ever meets someone with Celiac's Disease, as they will rip her face off.

I would post the whole conversation, but it's sooooo long. I can though if people think it's bull. I just needed to tell someone because I'm pretty upset about it. She always speaks to people like this and this could have been a healthy debate where she learned about my gluten free lifestyle and I learned about...her dietary habits...perhaps to make mine better. But she was insulting and it left me hurt and wondering if this is what I'm going to have to deal with as long as I continue to try to fix my insides.

I love this subreddit. It has made my gluten free journey easier and I feel that I'm not alone. I know I'm an idiot for slipping, but I'm trying my best.

Thanks for reading, if you did. If not, **TLDR; I was insulted on FB for not knowing yogurt was gf and that the diet is ""retarded""; proceeded to get yogurt later, no regrets**

I've been sick, like horribly continuously sick my whole life and when I started college 2 years ago I got a lot worse and fatigue started to get in the way of daily life. My blood work is all over the place, but negative for celiacs (low IgA levels however). 

Doctor told me it seems like I have an autoimmune but they can't pinpoint what with the tests they have right now, so they suggested gluten free as most of my symptoms match up. (Save constipation instead of diarrhea) 

I went gluten free in April and after the month went back and got so sick. Since being gluten free my fatigue is almost completely eliminated, my joint pain gone, bloating and pain gone, bowels almost normal again and head fog gone. My doctors are all amazed.

I'm not extremely sensitive to cross contamination, and soy sauce for the most part doesn't bother me, or xanthan gum, but it makes me feel like I'm faking.

He refuses to believe that all the issues are related to diet.  We've been multiple doctors and all have dismissed my concerns saying he may have food triggers but its likely just a migraine disorder(his migraines are very severe).     His MRI results were normal.

I am gluten free due to an intolerance to gluten but not full blown celiac.  I have stressed that it would be worth attempting an elimination diet cutting out gluten but he is pretty unwilling to do so.   He eats a lot of wheat, breads, wraps, and snacks.  He cut dairy for a week before giving up on that. He hardly ever eats what I make because he is pretty picky. 

Does anyone have any experience with this problem?  How do I persuade him to even consider cutting gluten?

Started pretty typically for me.. about 20 minutes after my first bite, the waves of fatigue set in.. and I can only describe them as rolling waves...  all my energy is gone, and I'm practically knocked over by these waves or pulses of fatigue.. to the point that I feel my legs be rubbery, and sitting down seems like a great idea..

Then the pain... like my intestines are being wrung out like so much dirty laundry, but someone who REALLY doesn't care if he wrecks the clothes.. 

Okay.  All typical. I expect this.  I get back to the office, grab my ""gluten buster"" enzyme bottle, dose up, and call the rest of the day a loss. Go home, rest, sleep.. whatever. 

Except.. I can't.  Not really.  I toss and turn a bit.. maybe doze here and there.. but no real rest.   It's now 8 hours since my exposure, and I'm in a horrible mood.. I'm irritable, the idea of ""doing"" anything fills me with apathy.. the idea of ""doing"" nothing annoys me.. I'm a generally pretty upbeat guy these days.. and the best I can manage is a resounding ""meh"" -- and I know this feeling.. this is the way I feel when I'm ""depressed""... which.. I used to feel a lot, before...  

I know that the papers say that mood changes can come with an exposure.. but I never noticed it before.. but now I'm wondering.. I feel like an observer, watching a younger version of myself.. and wondering if what I went through back then was just a long standing, constant side effect of exposure, before I knew any better..

I've been off gluten for about 6 months now. My symptoms are limited, I don't really get any of the gastrointestinal problems that most people do. It prevents me from sleeping by causing leg cramps and restless legs, and it causes aches and pains in my muscles that feel at times like they're penetrating my bones. I also get brain fog, and negativity/irritability. I definitely do have some degree of an allergy to gluten, because when I don't eat it, I don't get these symptoms. When I tell people about it though, most just roll their eyes. I'm starting to realize that there is as much of a struggle with people as there is with gluten itself. It sounds bad, but sometimes I wish my symptoms were a little more severe so they'd understand. I feel like I have to prove it or something. They just don't get it. I'll sometimes get this look as they dismiss it that they are coming to the conclusion that I'm just a hypochondriac. It's all very frustrating. Either they think that I am annoyingly health conscious (which I don't really have reason to be, I could do with gaining a few pounds), or that I am imagining things.

I went through my phase of eating nothing but wings or nachos at restaurants, then I started missing different foods and tried to branch out.

After eating at Cafe Rio for a while I realized I was reacting to something, after careful evaluation I realized that the ""corn"" tortillas were not in fact only corn, but half flour, half corn. Upon further evaluation, this time googling them properly, I found that ALL of the meat marinades have flour in them.

Why? Who knows, laziness maybe?

So share, what have you felt most betrayed by for not being GF?

*Edit*

This is copied from a comment reply, because betrayed is the wrong word when they're doing what they can, but emotionally annoyed that it couldn't be that simple.

I guess the word betrayed was the wrong one to use. Should I have check deeper than the guy on the line. Absolutley, was I certain cross contamination would be a thing? Yep. Had that ever affected me before? Not really, but at this point I had developed relatively safe habits with a my level of cheating going way down.
I had hoped against hope. Gotten lax in being paranoid.
I can loose tortillas, and did, because ignorance was not bliss. The salads they have? Fantastic. Got one with the pork, and reacted again. I guess I had been spoiled by chipotle for imagining that meat will all be as close to GF as a cross contaminated kitchen can be.
So maybe betrayed has the wrong connotation. I use it because my SO just made knock off at home, it was apparently easy to make and didn't call for any gluten products, without having to look for specifically GF. Betrayed because it would have been easy, and that'd be somewhere I could go out to with coworkers, we often do 12+ hour days, and not have to seem needy food wise.
This was 4 months ago, I've gotten better, and have developed a good fast food relationship with red robin. Know the waiters, get everything sorted and have read thier menu and nutrition info.
I come from a family of people who are very bad at being GF, being wiped into shape by my SO. :)

I noticed last year that Marks and Spencer (UK and Ireland) had a very small gluten free section of breads and cakes and most of these contained glucose-fructose syrup (high fructose cornstarch) which I don't eat as I gained a huge amount of weight when I was eating it.

Recently I noticed that they had chicken nuggets and breaded chicken breasts with the gluten-free symbol on them. They are delicious! Then I bought their Angus burgers and again, saw gluten-free on them. Every time I went through the check out, the person serving me would remind me to look at their other gluten-free products. The deli ham has a gluten free crumb, the sausages are the same and more and more 'regular' items have been subtly made gluten free. People still buy them, they still taste the same as they always did but now I can eat them again!

I found a list on the website of all the foods NOT containing gluten. This is a huge step for Ireland as most of the gluten-free products here are disgusting or just loaded with sugar. It's so nice to just have some real chicken nuggets for a change!

Hi all,

I need some advice. My fiancé (who is GF, while I am not strictly) and I are planning a June wedding with about 130 guests. In our research, we have found only a handful of bakeries in our area of Greater Boston that will do gluten free wedding cakes. The problems are as follows: 1) wedding cakes are astronomically expensive even when they are not GF, but make them celiac-friendly and we're out of our budget, and 2) I am not a bride who even feels the need for a wedding cake. I just am not attached to the idea and would be content to forego the cake altogether. Especially when we're looking at $1500...for dessert. 

Now, I'm hoping someone here can give me some food for thought as to how we should proceed. We are planning to only serve GF and allergen free foods at our reception so the groom can just eat as he pleases without fear- so we'd prefer to avoid the whole ""give the guests regular cake but feed the groom a GF cupcake"" thing. 

Can we do a fake cake and feed guests something different for dessert? Is fake cake even a thing? Do any of you have some creative ideas for me that won't force us to take a 2nd mortgage?

I tried to find a link to verify this or add more source information, but I wasn't successful and have to get off Reddit (gasp!) to get some stuff done.  If someone else has more info to share, that would be great; if not, I at least wanted to share my excitement!

I am newly diagnosed as Celiac and have pretty much figured out how to keep myself safe when I'm controlling what is ingested and what products I use on my skin and hair. This week though, I've been absolutely dumb founded on how to keep myself safe through my up coming surgery and the treatment of this kidney infection I have. 

I informed every nurse and doctor I saw in the ER that night that I was in fact Celiac and unable to ingest gluten of any kind. I was given several different drugs and with each one I asked if it was gluten free. The responses from the medical staff for bewildering. One nurse just flat out said she had no idea. When I asked her to check to see if it was she basically said she didn't know how and asked if I wanted to feel better or continue arguing. I was in immense pain so I took the medicine. 

Later I expressed my concerns to the doctor and her idea of making sure I didn't get sick was to give me an arsenal of anti-nausea medicine including a suppository. By the time we got me home I had a 1000 mg anti biotic a prescription for the suppositories and another for percoset and another for vicodin. I woke yesterday with a screaming head ache and sever abdominal pain but had to get myself to my pre op appointment (I'm having surgery on the 12 of Sept. for a hysterectomy to treat severe endometriosis.) At the doctor's office I got sick twice and the doctor asked me what was wrong I informed her that I suspected being glutened at the ER last night. I asked her if she could check on my medicines because I think they were the cause. She responded by telling me to eat a piece of bread or some saltine crackers to help me keep the medicine down and tried to prescribe me more medicine for the migraine. I was just blown away. 

How on Earth do you get through a situation like this without being poisoned when it is quite obvious that not even the medical field is fully educated on Celiac disease. Any suggestions? Similar stories? Lists of drug alternatives for medicines such as antibiotics and pain medications? Thanks in advance for any and all feedback.

No, she did not have celiac and yes, she did walk back into the store after getting into her car just to complain. 

I have two questions for you, reddit: 
1) Can a piece of pasta used as a stirstick contaminate coffee to the point that it could cause someone with celiac to have problems? 

2) As a gluten free community, do you believe that the burden in this situation of avoiding the gluten stirstick falls on you, the consumer, or the coffee shop? You are quite a minority, so my initial instinct is that as long as the shop marks our stirsticks ""Pasta Stirsticks,"" the burden of avoiding gluten consumption falls on you, especially when spoons are also available.

I got a call from my doctor Tuesday afternoon telling me I'd tested positive for Celiac's.  The news was a total shock.  My mom had been diagnosed a few months back, and she recommended then that I get tested even if I wasn't feeling any symptoms since she'd been told you can have a genetic predisposition.  My doctor didn't think I really needed the test, since I wasn't feeling any symptoms, but I had it done so my mom could stop worrying.  Against everyone's expectations, the test came back solidly positive for Celiac's.  An hour earlier I'd been eating some leftover Papa John's for lunch, and now I was staring down a lifetime on a GF diet.  

After a couple days of processing, I'm still trying to figure out the emotions and the protocol here.  Part of me is still in denial that it's happened, and that my diet actually needs to change long term.  Part of me also feels weirdly phony about the whole thing, since my symptoms have been so mild compared to what so many people go through.  I realize now I've been having digestive irritation for a few months, but it had never been serious enough for me to even realize anything was out of the ordinary.  I'd never have even been tested if my mom hadn't been on my case to do so.  That makes the /r/skeptic subscriber in me feel like I'm one of the ""fashionably"" GF people who does it for BS pseudo-scientific health reasons without really needing it, even though I've been handed a clinical diagnosis.  Add to that I'm worried about being a burden on the people in my life, forcing them to adjust their lives to accommodate me.  

I know this is far from the end of the world, but sorting through everything's had my concentration shot and my moods swinging pretty widely between super-optimistic and super-anxious.  At work yesterday I went downstairs for lunch, realized I had absolutely no idea what was safe for me to eat at any of the places nearby, and just felt completely lost.

I figure this will all even out after a while, but any wisdom or perspective you've got to share during these first few days of adjustment would be deeply appreciated.  This seems like a really positive, supporting place, and I'm looking forward to becoming part of the community.  I could just really use some guidance on what the next couple days or weeks will hold, or better yet some definitive action items I could work on to help me feel a bit more in control.  Thanks, reddit.  Really looking forward to what you have to say.

I've suffered from ME/Chronic fatigue for years and have tried so many different attempts at treatment.
As a vegetarian (I take supplements) I fell into the habit of eating wheat based meals generally at least twice a day. Lots of bread and pasta.

After some research I decided to try to cut out wheat for a while and see if if helped my energy - after about 2.5 weeks I've noticed a massive improvement in my sleeping patterns, brain fog and also my face is less puffy.

I don't have any intestinal issues however - never had any stomach problems, and I am wondering if cutting out wheat could almost cause me to develop an intolerance. Like if I stopped for a long time and then had some whether my reaction would become more severe? 

Sorry if that's a foolish sounding question.

Has anyone else had any success with cutting out wheat for health or fatigue reasons as opposed to an intolerance?

I'm suspecting tomatoes/potatoes/nightshades, onions, rice, peanuts/legumes, beef?  I'm kind of grasping at straws.  It's not a big deal, I'm mostly ok here, but if I'm already restricting my diet so severely then why not go 100% and get it perfect.

It's not super extensive, but it does have things like rolls and bruschetta for appetizers.  There was also pizza, which he recommended, but I was in the mood for a specific pasta instead so I had that.  

I did get the rolls, which were expensive but giant.  I brought three out of an order of four home.  Warning: apparently they are baked twice, so they take almost as long to come out as the food.  I wanted the bread early so I could have it as the other people I was eating with were having regular bread, but it took too long.  They were so good I didn't mind, though.

I ended up getting my entree off the regular menu with gluten free pasta, which was also fine.  The waiter warned me about a $2 upcharge to do so.

Never once did I think my sore joints, back pain, dizziness, and sleeping problems could be connected to what I ate. I was just a sickly person...right? 

Then toward the beginning of this year I passed out in the middle of the night for no reason and was rushed to the hospital. Diagnosis, after NUMEROUS tests, *probable Celiac Disease with Thyroid complications.* It sucked, but at least I knew what I was dealing with. 

I immediately stopped eating gluten and day by day became more and more myself again. Even the burping stopped, which I didn't even realize was excessive until I went full on gluten free. I haven't touched a SINGLE gluteny food since a mishap in June and was well on my way to recovery. 

Until two nights ago when I mistakenly trusted Perdue's claim that their chicken strips were 100% Gluten free. I know better then to go by the big bold letters on the front and just assume everything is alright. I turned the bag over and sure enough there was yeast extract and a few other questionable ingredients in there, but I've always played by the rule that if the company claims it's gluten free I'll at least give them a try. 

I kid you not, after only two days of having these Trojan Chickens for dinner, every time my body tried to digest something it felt like a giant was crushing my skull between his freakishly enormous hands.

My boyfriend wanted to take me out for dinner last night so we decided on sushi. I called ahead to check what kind of vinegar they used in their rice, checked if they had GF soy sauce or if I needed to bring my own. All clear. The menu is the kind you fill out yourself. I picked three rolls that looked good and wrote in big black letters across the top and bottom GLUTEN FREE. I explained it to the server and asked that she double check my order in case there were ingredients not listed. All clear. 

After eating the first piece, I notice something crunchy...and suspicious. The waitress sees me poking around the roll and comes running over. 

Yeah...they forgot to remove one ingredient. I think the server thought I was going to freak because she was super apologetic, remade the roll and gave it to us for free. My heart just sank when she confirmed my suspicions as I know that means the next few days will be rough but it's too late now and I didn't want to ruin the girl's night as well as my own...So I didn't say much. Nothing to be done at that point.

You all know how frustrating it is to take all precautions and still get glutenized. I feel like wait staff should be better trained and often don't take it seriously. This frustrates me to no end. 

How would you have handled this with the wait staff?

Would you have said something to her so she understood how her mistake (or the chefs) effected you? Would you still have tipped her? I don't want to be an ass and I know the only way to ensure my health is to cook myself...but I also don't want to allow or encourage negligence.

My main reasons for eating gluten free are to help with my skin issues and hopefully encourage my weight loss (40lbs down, 60 to go!!). 

I haven't really liked the things I've made with GF flour thus far, so I decided to look into other alternatives. I came across this recipe on [Mother Thyme's blog](http://www.motherthyme.com) and just had to try it!!! Here's the recipe copied and pasted (link at the bottom).

NOTE: I am really new to eating GF so if I am wrong about this being totally GF *pleeeeeeeeeeease* let me know! The only thing that was questionable to me was the pesto, because I used store bought instead of making my own. But I'm sure you could sub out GF products for anything that might contain gluten. Since I'm not Celiac, Im not overly concerned with eating small amount of gluten (rather Im trying to avoid eating breads and pastas, which I used to eat in mass quantities pretty much every day).

**Caprese Pizza with Cauliflower Crust**

Ingredients:

*Cauliflower crust:*

1/2 head cauliflower (or 2 1/2 cups coarsely grated cauliflower)

1 garlic clove, grated

Pinch of salt and pepper

1 cup part skim mozzarella, grated

1 large egg, lightly beaten

1/2 teaspoon dried basil leaves

1/2 teaspoon dried oregano


*Caprese topping:*

2 tablespoon basil pesto

1 cup fresh mozzarella, cut into 1/2 inch pieces
2 roma tomates, chopped

1-2 tablespoon fresh basil, chopped

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Spray cooking spray on a large baking sheet or pizza pan and set aside.

2. Remove stems and leaves from cauliflower and coarsely grate cauliflower florets to resemble rice to make 2 1/2 cups.

3. Place grated cauliflower, garlic and a pinch of salt and pepper in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally until heated through and just tender, about 7-8 minutes.

4. Place cauliflower in a medium bowl and cool slightly. Add in mozzarella, egg, basil and oregano and stir until combined.

5. Spread on baking sheet and press down forming crust about 8-9 inches.

6. Bake in preheated oven for 12-14 minutes until brown.

7. Spread pesto on top of cooked crust. Top with mozzarella, tomatoes and basil. Bake for an additional 5-7 minutes until cheese is melted.

8. Cool slightly, cut and serve.

I used the crust recipe and topped mine with pesto, shredded mozzarella, mushrooms and olives because I wasn't feeling the tomatoes. It came out SO SO SO GOOD! The texture of the crust is very close to pizza dough texture, and the flavors were very fresh. My only gripe was that the crust was a little soggy in the center after I baked it with the toppings on -- but, I think that maybe I didn't cook it long enough during the first bake. Next time I'm going to cook the crust itself a bit longer before I add toppings.

I went gluten free in Feb 2012, and I've noticed that sometimes, if I have more than, say 2-3 drinks with liquor, I go from zero to completely hammered in like 1.2 seconds. It doesn't happen with wine or GF beer/cider. Last night, I don't even remember if I kissed my husband at midnight because I had three mixed drinks and a small shot of rum over the course of 4 hours (I was sipping, not slamming, ya know?) and right around midnight, my memory gets hazy. I passed out before 1, and woke up at 3 and puked my brains out. I'd eaten a nice, unhealthy dinner of nachos to get all carb-loaded before drinking, so I can't blame drinking on an empty stomach. This is the third time since February where I've had liquor and gotten this wasted very quickly. The first time, I blamed allergy medicine and not eating carbs. The second time, I blamed drinking too quickly. But this is the first time I've thrown up from drinking in years. I don't remember calling my best friend. I'm shocked that I was able to send coherent text messages. It's not like a drank a bottle of Jack in 2 hours (like I did in college once) but I feel like I got just as drunk. Is this related to a gluten free diet? Has anyone else experienced this? I'm seriously freaked out by how drunk I got last night, and how quickly. And a bit embarrassed. Thankfully we were at home with just a few close friends.

TL;DR, don't eat gluten, sometimes get insanely wasted from not very much liquor, wondering if anyone else has experienced this as well.

*EDIT:* Ok, so I'm definitely not the only one experiencing this! Not everyone does though, but I suppose everyone's body is different and processes things differently. I've mentioned this in at least one comment in the thread, but I feel like the common denominator is dark liquor - whiskey (Crown) and spiced rum (Kraken). Not always those brands, but usually.

1375255828.0,16,self.glutenfree,1jeplb,I have officially resorted to punishing my body for being so ridiculous! [RANT/QUESTIONS],Jazzerciser24,18,2,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/1jeplb/i_have_officially_resorted_to_punishing_my_body/,"Let me preface this by saying I'm extremely frustrated, so this will be jumbled and very long. I will try not to leave out anything important. Also, TMI warning!

Mid-May, I started having really bad stomach issues. I was so constipated for two weeks I thought I might die. I didn't go to the bathroom the whole time until I took several laxatives, and even then I couldn't go for two to three more days. When I finally did go, it was in spurts.

I talked to my primary care doctor about my symptoms and asked if she thought it might be due to gluten. She said it was most likely dairy so to give that up first. I cut all dairy out of my diet for two weeks but didn't feel better. I still needed to take laxatives to go even a little, and every time I ate I felt like I was going to die. My stomach distended an extra several inches, I gained over 10 pounds, and I was just all-around miserable. So, next I cut out gluten.

Within a day, I started to improve. I stopped taking laxatives, although my movements never did return to normal. Instead of fulfilling bathroom sessions, I could only ever go a little at a time, sometimes hard, sometimes soft. However, the feeling of extreme fullness went away--for about two weeks. I started to get sick every few days at that point, and then almost every day. I wasn't constipated anymore, but the constant fullness was intense. I also always felt gassy without ever actually being able to pass gas. I could hardly even let my SO touch me because I felt too bloated. The few times I attempted sex I had severe pain.

Finally, I thought I might have additional food intolerances. I was a little worried to cut out more food groups without doctor supervision, though, because I had lost 15-20 pounds within the first three weeks of going gluten-free. So, I called my PC doctor to get her opinion about whether or not soy could be causing my discomfort. That was the only thing I had really changed in my diet; I started putting soy milk in my coffee as a substitute for half and half. However, my PC doctor said no one is allergic to soy. She prescribed me an antacid and told me to take it for a month before making another appointment to see her. I thought that was ridiculous, though. First of all, who is to say I have a stomach acid issue? And even if I do, isn't an antacid a temporary fix? I decided to ditch my doctor at that point and see a naturopath.

My naturopath agreed it could be the soy, so I cut it out. At first, I did feel a lot better, but the good days would only last for two to three at a time before I got sick again. At this point I was only eating at home and keeping a food journal. I also started having my SO brush his teeth before kissing me and cleaning his crumbs off the counter. But still I got sick. It got to the point where I'd react to the most random things, like vegan pesto, steak, or guacamole, so I decided to do a full elimination diet to finally identify the little bastard that was ruining my life.

For an entire week, I only ate anti-inflammatory foods like chicken, vegetables with the exception of nightshades, and fruit. I also cut out alcohol. And for the first time in a long time, I felt great for more than a couple days at a time! However, I also felt myself missing my favorite foods, particularly nightshades. (I love tomatoes and jalapenos so much that they are literally the only plants I grow in my garden.) So, a week into the new diet, I talked to my naturopath about how miserable I was. The next day was the 4th of July, and I was dreading hanging out with friends and not drinking. I was also having a potluck and had no idea what to make for everyone. My naturopath said to try just leaving out gluten, dairy, soy, and corn for now--that it probably wasn't sulfites or nightshades anyways.

That night, I went home happy and made really spicy guacamole. Within 10 minutes, I had diarrhea. I spent the entire night and next morning on the toilet. I also woke up with five whiteheads on my chin, even though the acne that had plagued me for the past year was starting to improve. Still, I stupidly decided to drink cider and make spicy quinoa patties on the 4th. I was in and out of the bathroom all day, and then I got constipated again.

Ever since, I thought for sure my intolerances are nightshades and gluten, but I also  have not knowingly ingested soy, corn, or dairy since eliminating them. I started getting sick less frequently, but still I would get that full feeling sometimes and have no idea what it was from. Recently, I felt great for like 7-8 days in a row. But then exactly one week ago today, I saw my very first ripe cherry tomato of the season. I ate it, without having any other breakfast, and felt uncomfortably full within an hour. I had more whiteheads on my chin later that night as well and got extremely congested. (I also realized that the stuffy nose and watery eyes I had every day since I was at least 10 years old had disappeared sometime during the past couple months without me noticing.)

On Sunday morning, I still didn't feel 100%. To make matters worse, I arranged a surprise brunch for my SO. I called around 10 restaurants (and I live in a very gluten-free friendly city) before I found one that would happily accommodate my ridiculous list of potential intolerances. Still, the only thing that seemed safe to eat was a side salad and fried eggs. And to my utter frustration, something made me sick! I also broke out with five deep red pimples on my chest later that night/the next morning. (I usually only break out during my period or ovulation, but this was smack dab in the middle of both.) I spent all afternoon in bed feeling at the end of my rope. I mean, there's no point whatsoever attempting to be social if I'm going to get sick off a side salad (maybe with white vinegar?). Or, maybe I should just eat my favorite foods if I'm going to be sick regardless!

So, last night I actually resorted to hurting myself I was so mad at my body. I went to my favorite restaurant and ordered a glutenous pizza with cheese, tomato sauce, and hot peppers. And? I don't feel any worse than I did. I'm still hovering around 70% like myself. I thought for sure I'd have to be hospitalized, but I hardly even got cramps. The only extra symptoms I even notice (and these may be in my head) are itchy skin (I was so itchy I thought I had a rash when I woke up), an itchy bottom, and an itchy vagina. I also can't really go to the bathroom. Constipation has been the norm, though, lately, and the fullness has actually gone down.

Now I'm just really confused. Is this even a gluten intolerance like I had originally thought? Or is this more likely a parasite, ulcer, or stomach cancer? If so, I should probably see someone other than a naturopath, right?

And, here's one last bit of information: my SO informed me that he wants me to get tested for Celiacs. I frequent this thread a lot, and I'm under the impression that this is a waste of money--especially if I hardly had a reaction to a whole pizza! His thought process is that he wants to know if I have it so I know how careful I need to be. He said he will support me whether it's positive or negative but that if it's positive, we should remove all gluten from the kitchen. Is this something I should consider? My insurance sucks, so I'd rather not take this test if it's not necessary.

Sorry for the long post. But can anyone help me? I know many of you have been battling issues like these for years, and I just really need some insight/answers!

I was wondering if I could get some help with an interpretation of my Celiacs diagnosis journey.

In 2009, I went to the doctor for stomach pains and I was tested for food allergies. The blood test came back highly positive for a wheat allergy.

At the same time they performed a blood allergy test, they performed a Gliadin Antibody test (IGA and IGG). The IGA was negative but the IGG was positive (a negative range is &lt;11 but my result was 28, not really sure what that means?).

Because the doctor advised me that a wheat allergy and a gluten reaction are two entirely different things, she wanted me to get 1.) An allergy scratch test for the wheat allergy and 2.) A biopsy for the gluten intolerance. 

Well....the allergy scratch test came back NEGATIVE for wheat and from what I've read on Dr. Google, is that a scratch test is actually more sensitive than a blood test so my blood test must have been a false positive?

And then of course... the biopsy came back negative as well (just stomach inflammation but no damaged villi) so the end result of that was the blood test was a false positive for gluten intolerance as well. 

All of this is SO BIZAREE to me! How can both of these come back positive at the same time and be so related but so different at the same time, isn’t it just a ""coincidence"" that both happened to be possible on the blood test? Even the doctor was like, ""yes this is just a huge coincident because wheat allergy and gluten intolerance are two entirely different things...."". But then for BOTH of them to result in a false-positive? That seems even more bizarre!!

I know this is a lot of medical rambling but I am feeling confused. I did do a GF diet for about a year. I didn't notice too much difference in how I felt, but I did lose a good amount of weight. Not sure if that was related to just being forced to make healthier choices or if it was de-bloating from actual celiacs-bloat? 

I kind of feel like at this point, I may just never know. Any advice? Thoughts? Help :(

I suspect I may have some sort of gluten intolerance, but my symptoms are so odd I'm unsure if they're related. I started noticing about 18 months ago that whenever I overindulge in beer, the next day I have terrible soreness all over my upper body and face. This isn't the normal kind of muscle exertion soreness. It feels like I've have bruises covering me and my skin hurts to touch, but there are no visible signs of anything. I get drunk off beer so rarely that I've pretty much just ignored this, but I would say it's happened about 3 or 4 times.

Over the past month or so I've noticed that whenever I eat any sort of carbs, almost immediately my heart will start racing. This has occurred with tortilla chips, wheat bread, and pasta, and it does not appear to matter how much of it I eat. Non-carb food does not have this effect on me. 

According to the Internet, both of these symptoms can be the result of gluten intolerance. I guess I'm just hesitant to make that connection because my adverse reaction to beer started way before my adverse reaction to carb foods. It does seem like quite a coincidence that two things stocked with gluten make me feel ill though.

At first, thrilled to have an answer to my health problems, I strictly adhered to the gluten free diet. I prepared the majority of my meals myself and gave the few restaurants I ate at the full run-down on what precautions I needed during my food preparation. All was well. 

Today, I'm wavering. I don't *cheat* on the diet, per se, but I'm no longer meticulously careful. As an overworked graduate student, I eat out a lot more often than I should. I've stopped giving the full spiel, instead just adding a half-hearted ""and it's a wheat allergy..."" when I order my gluten-free food. I don't bother asking for a glove change at burrito-bowl places. 

Partly, I'm sick of explaining my personal health problems to strangers. Partly, I'm tired of being a troublesome and needy customer. Mostly, I'm running low on care. I'm fairly certain I do not get the acute ""glutening"" symptoms that many on this board complain about, so there's no immediate reason to be super careful.

I let her pick where she wanted to go for dinner. We went to our local Applebee's which normally is fantastic about her dinner and we've never had issues with cross contamination or anything. I stopped at the grocery store on the way to pick up some gluten free cupcakes for dessert. At the resturant, I handed the cupcakes and candle (BIG 7!) to the waitress on the sly and she said she would bring it out lit at the end for us. 

Dinner goes great, no problems with dinner, etc. I can see into the kitchen and our waitress is gathering everyone to sing. They come out clapping and singing, everyone happy - my daughter's face is lit up like a Christmas tree. Until they put the plate down.

Our sweet, well-meaning waitress decorated the plate with whipped cream (no problem)....and oreo cookie sprinkles. We salvaged things with the other untouched cupcakes, but my daughter was initially pretty upset. I spoke to the manager (after we paid, not looking for a freebie) and he was extremely apologetic and recognized the issue as soon as I said oreo sprinkles. He said he would speak to her about what gluten free means so it doesn't happen in the future.

So heads up, make sure even if you say GLUTEN FREE, and you explain that your dinner can't touch anything, no bread, etc.... that you don't entrust your gluten free items to wait staff who might not realize that no bread products includes cookies.

Not only does gluten cause bowel and stomach pain and problems. It also causes skin problems, extreme depression, bodily pain and makes me borderline psychotic. 

Going gluten free has changed my life in a positive way i never even dared to dream off. I have made mistakes a few times and got poisoned. Those few times were horrible and a real nightmare to get trough. 

I find myself increasingly obsessive about the food I eat. I don't trust anyone or anything. 
Both my boyfriend and mother love to take me out to lunch and I love going but it really scares me to death every time. My boyfriend wants to take me out for dinner this week and I have bin looking up restaurants but I simply don't trust them! even when they say they can do gluten free if you say so in advanced. 

I just spend 2 days in a row eating at my parents for Christmas dinner. Both nights I got gluten poisoned. I did not tell my mum cause I know she really put a lot of effort into making sure that everything I ate was gluten free and it will break her heart if she knew I got ill. 

It just seems so much simpler and peaceful for me If I make my own meals at home so I can control everything. But I am disappointing so many people with doing that.
 
I am going a little to far with my obsession I think. At the dinner table at my parents house I had a small panic moment as I saw People touching stuff with their gluten filled hands and I was afraid I would then touch it as well and get sick. How realistic is this anyway? How easy is it for gluten to transfer?

Maybe its just me going trough current gluten poisoning but how do others deal with this?

I've been diagnosed lactose intolerant, and as having IBS. My doctor once suggested to my parents that I try eating gluten free to find out what was giving me stomach pains, but for one reason or another we never did. Over the last year my stomach issues started to get really severe. (Throwing up a little bit nearly every time I ate mainly.) The real catalyst was when I decided I wanted to try getting drunk for the first time, and we found out that not only does most alchohal not really give me any sort of buzz, but my body actually rejected it instead of my being able to get drunk. I basically spent the night throwing up, and the next week I wasn't able to really eat anything, at all, without most of it coming back up. So after monitoring what I was eating, and finding out the only common factor was gluten, I decided to go gluten free. Well it immediately alleviated my regurgitation issues, but after a month or so of not eating it, I accidentally consumed some wheat, and went into anaphylaxis so severe I had to be rushed to the hospital. It's happened a few times since then as well. 

I'm really struggling with resulting depression. Every time I'm reminded that there are so many things I can't have anymore, and having gained weight as a result of going gluten free, it just kind of hits me. I keep slipping up, and making really stupid mistakes like buying things without looking at the labels, or eating something marinated in alchohal made with wheat, and having to OD on benedryl to keep my throat from swelling too much. I feel so painfully awkward ordering food anywhere, and having to send it back a couple times either because I forget to ask for it without something, or the server forgets to tell me about an ingredient. I keep holding out hope that maybe I'm just imagining things, since I haven't been to an allergist yet (no job, and no insurance), even though I know that it's unlikely based on the way my body reacts, and it's probably not helping me cope. I really just don't know how to cope right now, or what I should be eating, and how to make sure I'm not accidentally getting a hold of wheat. I'm so lost right now. I guess I mostly needed to rant, but if anyone can offer me advice I'd appreciate it.

English Translation:

&gt; Gluten-free brewery finally launches the Glutenberg

&gt; Situated beside the Lachine canal, the industrial gluten-free micro-brewery Gluten-free Brewers anticipates shipping their first beer in mid to late June. Their other products - all gluten-free of course - made from millet, buckwheat and sorghum, should be commercially ready soon afterwards.

&gt; It took more than a year of research and development to create the final recipe for the Glutengerg. Brewed by Gabriel Charbonneau, this beer made from millet is lighter and more easily digestible than a beer made from barley. Its unique taste sets it apart from similar conventional beers.

&gt; This idea of starting this project has excited Julien Niquet, the director of development, for some years now. In January of 2010 after much reflection on the potential of this idea, himself gluten-intolerant, decided to seize the opportunity offered by this newly growing market with his partner David Cayer. ""I think we have a fairly unique product in a rapidly growing market"" explains the director of business David Cayer, who admits to having a lot of education still to do concerning his gluten-free product.

&gt; The owner recently learned of a study commissioned by the Canadian restaurant and food services association (CRFA) that identified gluten-free beer as the number one product to watch in the coming years. Even though the product targets individuals with celiac disease or a gluten intolerance, beer enthusiasts can appreciate it as much as a more conventional barley beer. The Glutenberg will be available for purchase in supermarkets, convenience stores, natural food stores and even certain bars and restaurants.

&gt; This is the first exclusively gluten-free Canadian brewery, which will rank it among only 20 or so in the world. As this will be a uniquely industrial operation, unfortunately there will be no on-site tasting offered.

I've suspected Celiac Disease to be the culprit for awhile now. After some begging and pleading to be tested, one of the nurse practitioners at my student health services finally ran my blood through several rounds of tests, which required fasting. I'm pretty sure I hadn't eaten anything with gluten in it at least a day or so before they drew my blood; I had been trying not to eat it because it made me feel instantly better when I abstained from it.

The results came back negative, which I was extremely disappointed about considering I was CONVINCED that this was it--my ""mystery disease"" I've had for the past 21 years would be solved. They also did a whole allergy panel on my blood, for everything from fish to nuts to wheat, and everything came back negative. Just out of curiosity...if I do have Celiacs, or even an intolerance/allergy to gluten, wouldn't that have a huge red flag on the wheat allergy test?

It's my first time posting here, but I do love it here. Because of my various issues all culimnating in yet another painful night in the bathroom and me missing two shifts at work, I decided that clearly something has to be going on. I can't afford to go to a doctor (Poor college student working two jobs, yadda yadda) so I decided on the elimination diet. I'm about three weeks in, feeling pretty decent about it. 

I decided early on to keep nuts in my diet, because I've been eating them FOREVER and haven't had a problem. I bought some natural peanut butter and almond butter (PB was Smuckers Natural, I googled it and came back gluten free no issues) when I first started, and tossed it in my fridge.

One afternoon, I had a couple slices of deli meat, some raw carrots and peanut butter for lunch. Got a decent amount of pain, and work that night was rough. Cramps and bloating all the way. I thought it was because I had made my roommate a sandwich (Bread) before I ate my food, and we used the same bag of deli meat. I had NEVER experienced that level of pain at such a small point of cross contamination. It was only a few days into the diet! I suspected the peanut butter but couldn't imagine it being an issue. Each time I had a few bites of almond butter I felt a little... icky, but nothing I could pinpoint.

Now, last night after dinner (Baked chicken) I had a couple spoon fulls of that natural peanut butter for dessert. And holy cow, was I in pain. Cramps, hot skin, cold fingers... the whole shebang.

My issue with the peanut butter is... I can eat peanuts just fine. I have a jar of 'party peanuts' (No 'made in a factory...' crap) that I snack on from time to time at school, and haven't had any issues at all. So is it possible that it is something else?? The same knife that I cut my chicken with, I put mayo on bread (Didn't even occur to me until I was eating the chicken), but I've never gotten pain from such a low amount of cross contamination. And my pain came as soon as I ate my peanut butter, both times.

Any thoughts?? I appreciate in advance you reading my longish post, and any help you could offer!

Garlic bread was one of my favorite gluten-y foods to make since damn it tastes amazing. I see him making it and I seriously almost cry. I can never have this again unless I want to get incredibly ill. 

I realized today just how much I miss being able to eat some of my favorite foods. I don't want to risk getting sick and eating it, obviously, so I am sitting here pretty much wallowing in how bad this sucks.

One of the things that I always miss about Ireland is the brown bread. Irish brown bread is unsurpassed. In America we don't have anything that's even a rough equivalent. This bread recipe is as close as anything I've had outside of Ireland to the classical brown bread. It just so happens to also be gluten free.

Ingredients:

* active dry yeast - 1 Tbsp (7 grams)

* sugar                 - 3 Tbsp (40 grams)

* warm water        - 1+1/2 cups (not so boiling. just warm. like 110 deg)

* buckwheat flour - 1+1/4 cups (150 grams) 

* sorghum flour    - 3/4 cups (97 grams)

* potato starch      - 1 cup (130 grams) (I substitue arrowroot starch)

* tapioca starch    - 1/2 cups (60 grams)

* xanthan gum     - 2 tsp (4 grams)

* sea salt              - 1 tsp

* olive oil             - 3 Tbsp (45 ml)

Instructions:

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine yeast, sugar, and warm water. let proof until foamy (like 10 min).

2. lightly grease an 8x4 inch metal loaf pan

3. In a separate bowl, stir together buckwheat flour, sorghum flour, potato starch (or in my case, arrowroot starch - for some reason the country I live in has all these ingredients except for potato starch), tapioca starch, xanthan gum, and sea salt

4. add olive oil to the foamy yeasty sugar water. stir so the olive oil is roughly evenly distributed as you slowly add the dry ingredients. mix until smooth (it never gets particularly doughy - it's really more sticky than doughy) 

5. spread the dough in the loaf pan. (this is way easier if your hands are soaking wet. when your hands are coated in water the dough doesn't stick to them and is easy to manipulate)

6. preheat oven to 450 degrees. leave the dough in the pan on top of the stove to rise. let rise for 40 minutes

7. place the pan on the center rack. bake for 15 minutes at 450 degrees

8. reduce oven temperature to 385 degrees and bake for an additional 30-35 minutes or until golden brown on top and hollow sounding when tapped.

9. give it ten minutes to cool in the pan before transferring it to a cooling rack.

I'm a 42 y/o male, and have always had bowel and digestive issues since as long as I can remember. Often a meal is followed pretty immediately by a trip to the bathroom with loose stool (sorry for the graphic description).  Dr's never seemed too concerned or mentioned possible allergy. Somewhat typical path (as I've learned from posts here): ignored it, thought was maybe lactose intolerance, ignored, etc...  Always thought I was maybe not getting all nutrients out of food b/c food seemed to trigger a loose bowel movement so not spending much time in my body. Also experienced lots of sluggishness and tired feeling around mid day, have had some strange unexplained rashes over my body a few times (went to allergist, who mentioned gluten but never diagnosed as reactions never happened that often) etc...  Also, I had been eating mainly pescatarian diet since 1994, do to wife being veg/pesc.

Just over a month ago, was talking with friend who was recently diagnosed with cleiac's, and hearing symptoms etc made me wonder if my trouble as well. Did some reading, found it couldn't hurt to eat GF diet, and have never felt better. I'm still learning where gluten hides, but am fairly convinced this is helping me (GF diet).  I have a dr appt in a couple months and am going to ask for test for gluten sensitivity or cleiac's (no family history that I know of).

And, sorry this has taken so long but want to give background.  Now my question: I ate at a Thai restaurant last night, and pretty immediately had the bathroom problem a few times through the night and this morning. I ordered a green curry with tofu, and my wife and i shared a couple of salads...I suspect maybe the sauce or dressing in salad had a gluten ingredient.  Also generally feel not great. I also have a slight feeling of depression. I'm not really a moody or depressed person (rather I have what I consider appropriate responses to positive and negative things, and never really have brooding thoughts or anything like that).  However, today, I feel kind of depressed. Not suicidal, but a strong sense of woke up on the wrong side of the bed and a little bit of I want to crawl under a rock and hide from everyone/everything. My life is good.  I have a wonderful wife and beautiful son.  Money is a little tight, but generally not having much reason to be sad or feel hopeless. But today, that's kind of how I feel. 

Does anyone have experiences like this?  Feeling depressed after probable gluten exposure?  Not really looking for much other than to ask that question.

Well, after a month of as little gluten as I could possibly ingest, I ate pizza and cake tonight (two things I will miss greatly) and I feel horrible.

Please help!,Britannica,16,0,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/t7gim/how_did_you_know_you_were_gluten_intolerant_and/,"Hi guys, I think I may be gluten intolerant but I don't know where to start. Sorry, WALL OF TEXT. TL;DR is at bottom.

About me: I am female, age 22, living in the Pacific NW. I have suffered from a plethora of symptoms literally daily for my whole life:

* 
Depression, panic attacks, anxiety, severe fatigue, headaches, vertigo, constipation, severe joint pain and bloating/gas...you get the idea. Very similar to hypothyroid symptoms.

For my whole life doctors can not give me a definitive answer or diagnosis. I settled with a diagnosis of ""depression and anxiety"" and have been on Celexa daily. In 2010 I had a huge bout of digestive problems and finally caved and got a colonoscopy. They tested for Celiac and it came back normal. I was then given the diagnosis of IBS. I didn't do anything with this diagnosis because I didn't know what to do.

Fast forward to this month. I am sick and tired of feeling sick and tired. I researched online and convinced myself I was hypothyroid. Got tested and it came back normal. Mono, negative. Vitamin deficiency? Negative. He tested me for SO MANY THINGS and nothing was abnormal. Again, I was told that I was just depressed and anxious. Left there back to square one. 

I recently got a new job and my boss recognized my symptoms as the way she felt before she was diagnosed with Celiac. I told her I was tested in 2010 and it came back negative, but she told me that I could still be intolerant to gluten without having Celiac. My doctor never mentioned this.

My questions are, can I be gluten intolerant even though my test for Celiac was negative? What symptoms prompted you to go GF? Do my symptoms sound like a gluten intolerance?

**TL;DR I think I may be gluten intolerant but I am not sure. How did you know you were, do my symptoms sound like I am intolerant, and where do I start?**

1323886611.0,15,self.glutenfree,ncmud,I think you guys saved my life.  Trying cutting gluten and processed sugars.  One week in and I'm feeling so much better.,Delirious5,16,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/ncmud/i_think_you_guys_saved_my_life_trying_cutting/,"For some context, I'm a professional dancer and run a circus.  I got into bellydancing 7 years ago because I blew my back out in college and wanted something to do to help my injury.  And for a long time it worked.  But I just turned 31, and this year has not been good.

I had a conversation with one of my body workers last week about the frequency that my back has fallen to pieces this year. Usually I have a blowout once every year or two. This year, it's been five. My bodyworker has celiac disease, and she suggested that gluten and processed sugars act as inflammatories and may be one of the causes of my episodes this year. I thought about my diet over the last year, and it all clicked into place. Over the last year, I was working retail at a fun and fair food store (junkfood, candy, popcorn and fair food). Six months ago, I lost that job and moved in with my mom, where I've been on a steady diet of macaroni, toast and pizza. I had a lightbulb moment. No wonder my body's in pieces.

So that week , I went largely gluten free: guacamole, corn chips, baked chicken, eggs and yogurt with bananas for breakfast. I got a lot less stiff, and my joints were moving better. 

And my mood improved. I've been under a particularly dark stormcloud this year. But the last few days had been great, to my relief.

Last Thursday, my mom went grocery shopping, and in my rush to eat something before I had to teach dance, I grabbed a couple poptarts and ran. By the end of the night, I was in one of the blackest moods I've been in for a while. And that says something.  It was bad. It was bad enough that I spent two hours researching mental health clinics that work on a sliding scale, with the intention of calling in the morning and asking to try SSRI's. I've been struggling with depression for a long time, but I've chalked a lot of it up to the grief I've had to deal with in the last six years: hurricane Katrina, bad jobs, bad relationships and deaths of close loved ones. But looking at it that night, I could trace symptoms of my depression back before the hurricane, back through college, back through high school, and back through middle school, if not earlier. Something was just not right. And it got to the point where shit's just been falling apart.

After that, I came across an article on a friend's FB feed about gluten intolerance and depression, and had another eureka moment. The photos of the skin outbreaks matched the ones I've developed the last couple of years. My depression has gotten worse this year. My brain has felt more and more foggy. My speech has also gotten worse this year. I've been quietly noticing how much I've tripped over my words, stuttered and used the wrong words this year, and I haven't had insurance so I couldn't consult a doctor about it. But it's noticeable.

After more research, I'm finding a lot of people with celiac's disease or gluten intolerance anecdotally sharing symptoms really similar to mine. I don't have any of the gastrointestinal problems, but my father died of stomach cancer four years ago.  I found this subreddit, and started to cry in relief.  I don't think I'm crazy anymore!  I may just have been poisoning myself my entire life!

So I cut gluten.  And for good measure, processed sugars.  I'm also cutting way back on dairy and soy, just in case, to let my body rest and reset.  I'm obviously engaging on a level of self-diagnosis, so I'm taking my own self with a grain of salt and treating it as an experiment. I'll give this some time, and if this doesn't work, I'll try the meds.

After a week, my mood feels much better.  My head feels clear.  I'm getting work done.  I'm picking up the house more.  My back goes back and forth, but it's largely better, and I can feel muscles that have been seized for years starting to let up a little bit.  I think I may still have sugars and gluten sneaking in.  I'm not sure how much cross-contamination is a problem for me.  But I feel positive, and I'm looking forward to feeling strong again, being able to put on muscle, and training in aerial arts.

Our community deals with a medical condition, and so we're often tasked with offering advice on meeting dietary requirements, treating certain symptoms of the associated disorders, and other such things. These are acceptable topics of a discussion, up until a certain point.

The line in the sand that we have to be careful not to step over is at the point where the person asking for advice has some uncertainty about why certain symptoms are occurring. For instance, someone might ask for suggestions on how to treat depression that they think originates from their condition, or (more recently) whether others in the community suffer from canker sores when glutened.

In these cases, it is essential that we not offer suggestions such as taking a multivitamin. The reason for this is that we do not have medical training, and we do not have all of the relevant medical history for that person. By taking a multivitamin for symptoms, the affected person may be masking an undiscovered condition such as severe iron deficiency anemia.

If you're unsure about whether or not what you're saying is medical advice, the safest thing is to coat your advice in a heavy layer of ""I am not a doctor. You should consult yours before taking any steps to treat yourself.""",,False,,t5_2qx1l,False,,,True,t3_lz93q,http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/lz93q/a_note_about_medical_advice/,moderator

I am a drug and alcohol counselor and I have a bit of a conundrum. I have a patient who jas been clean from opiate addiction for 2 years, shown by monthly random drug screens (saliva samples, not urine). In May this patient was diagnosed with celiac and started on a very strict gluten free diet. Since that time they have had a significant number of positive drug tests for methamphetamine, and these have been done weekly. It isn't every week, and can he up to 2 months between a positive, but they continually show up as positive.

Now normally as a counselor I am a pretty big cynic and would usually just assume the patient was using meth occasionally and lying about it. However, this patient has no history of meth use, and is showing none of the classic signs of relapse that we almost always see. In addition they have even self reported use of cocaine without it showing on a drug test. I have no reason to believe that these positives for meth are not false positives.

Have any of you had any experience with having false positive drug tests for meth, or anything else, that have been linked back to either celiac or gluten free products? The drug tests are conducted using Immunoassay, which tests for antibodies created by the presence of certain drugs, so I could see a potential method for a false positive with celiac, but some of them have been confirmed by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy and that looks for the specific drug molecule in the sample. 

I am at a complete loss, I truly believe this patient is not using but all evidence points the other direction and my coworkers are starting to think I am insane. I just know drug tests are not in any way perfect and choose to see the best in people rather than assuming the worst.

If anyone has any experience with this happened I would love to hear whatever you have for me.

In place of half the water, I use chicken broth (Campbell's makes a GF broth in Canada), and then use a stir fry sauce or soy sauce.

I have been primarily gluten free for the last two years, with occasional screw ups... I'm sure we all have those. Over the past 10 months I've been very good with my dietary restrictions, however, over the past month I've experienced symptoms I would have if I had eaten gluten; e.g. horrible stomach cramping, horrible gas, diarrhea, etc...

I've been keeping tabs on ingredients I've eaten prior to these terrible gastrointestinal reactions and I've come to the conclusion that I have recently developed an allergy to Soy.

Also, I have increased the amount of soy in my diet, as I have taken a liking to sushi, and many GF products contain soy..

Does anyone have similar experiences, an allergy to both gluten and soy? Do they relate? Do soy allergies develop quickly over time? Also, the symptoms I have from eating gluten and soy are exactly alike, minus the rashes I get from eating gluten. And, my mental health has been in the dumps lately (depression), which may be caused by a lack of nutrition in the diet, pointing again to another food allergy.

Here's what I (a college student) recommend: (It helps that I have a kitchen now)

Start your meals with a cheap starch - Potato or Rice. Use cheap veggies (I like carrots and zucchini for decent price/filling) instead of using lots of meat.

Build up your kitchen. I bought one new seasoning each week - I worked my way through italian to mexican to asian seasonings - there's a lot of overlap (garlic, onion, cilantro, oregano,) and there are myriad flavor combinations to be enjoyed.
This list http://homecooking.about.com/library/archive/blherb2.htm is decent for what seasonings to get.

Use Mark Bittman's suggestions for kitchen equipment: http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/09/dining/09mini.html?pagewanted=all - although a rice cooker can be your best friend every (google 'rice cooker recipes' - most are gluten free, cheap and easy.) - I saved up for a pan every month or so, until I had what I needed.


This recipe is my 'go to' - It's cheap, easy, and quick.

•••••••••••••••••••••••••••Super Easy Ten Minute Meals•••••••••••••••••••••••••••

•••••••••••••••••••Prep rice first to allow lots of easy quick meals•••••••••••••••••••

Cook up a large pot of rice (just water and rice, maybe salt) then spoon it into ziplock baggies (99cent special baby!) and freeze it - make sure they bags are only about two inches thick at their thickest part so they freeze properly. To thaw, sprinkle with about 2 tablespoons of water and microwave until hot.


•••••••••••••••••••Ten minute meal (base)•••••••••••••••••••

Throw a bag of rice in the microwave (or put it in a pot if you don't have a microwave (been there!))

Take a boneless chicken thigh (available bulk, juicier than breastmeat, boneless because I miss more meat than I save money if I buy bone-in)

Chop the chicken (½ inch cubes,) throw it in a pot with about a ½ tablespoon of veggie oil. Medium heat (not so hot it burns if left alone for a bit)

Take a zucchini (½ pound for $1.25) and chop up. Add to the pot.

Cook until the chicken looks 'done', add (Flavor ingredients from below here) then stir and cook until the flavors have combined.

By now the rice should be warm - add it to the mixture, stir it all up.

Delicious!



•••••••••••••flavor ingredients options for the ten minute meal•••••••••••••

••Tex-Mex - add a half cup of salsa and a teaspoon of cumin (it's the 'taco' flavor I can't resist!)

•• Italian - add a can of diced tomato ($1.08 at Wally-world,) some garlic, onion and oregano.

•• Asian - Tamari Soy Sauce (no wheat!) and a bit of cilantro, a squeeze of lime. (If you're feeling adventurous add a tablespoon of peanut butter for a Thai-like flavor)

•• OTHER - look up recipes online, use their seasoning palettes to make up new meals.

So - lots of different meals, that take ten minutes to fix, if you pre-make the rice, and can be made in a single pan.

If I'm a bit poorer in a month, I'll make this without the chicken, or use extra rice to get a couple more meals out of each chicken thigh. 


••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••



•••••••••••••••••••Simple Substitutions•••••••••••••••••••

I use my pre-cooked rice in place of noodles for most things - I've worked up 'mac'-n-cheese, used with spaghetti sauce, alfredo, etc… If needed, make the topping separate, the family can have wheat based pasta.


•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••Cheap snacks:••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

••Google the cheapest chip brands (potato and tortilla) in your grocery market - most likely at least one of the brands is gluten free. Mix sour cream and seasonings to make a variety of dipping sauces. 

••Instant pudding - make sure your store-brand is gluten free, mine is, so a giant bowl of pudding is only about $1, and is good for two or three deserts (or one good movie)

••Popcorn - google 'brown paper bag popcorn' for a bunch of recipes


•••••••••My go-to snack:••••••••••

Open a can of black beans, drain the liquid out - open the rest of the way, dump into a bowl, add a glop of salsa, and a bit of cumin (like I said, I love that flavor!) - stir it up, dip your chips - best thing ever - I use it as a snack or as a meal.


••••••••••••'Ramen'•••••••••••••••

Use bouillon and make two cups of broth - throw in some vermicelli rice noodles (or other cheap rice noodles) and cook - when the noodles are almost done, stir it up and crack an egg in - keep stirring until the egg is cooked. Add a splash of Tamari soy sauce, and you have something even better and filling than ramen - and actually takes just about as long to cook.


••••••••Super easy, flavorful, filling, baked potato recipe••••••••

Stab a bunch of russet potatoes with a fork several times - they only needs a few stabs, but the stabbing is therapeutic. Rub each potato entirely with veggie oil, sprinkle with kosher salt on top and bottom, cook in oven at 350º for an hour on a wire frame (I'm lazy, so I just use the built in rack)

This yields perfect baked potatoes with delicious skin and flakey guts, that fill the stomach cheaply.  I don't even use toppings. BUT if you want toppings - most are super easy, and, used sparingly, cheap. Store in the fridge up to a week, takes just a few minutes to microwave and enjoy.


•••••••••••••••••••My guilty (lazy) pleasure•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••

Frozen indian food (some of the brands are gluten free) - I microwave it up, and add a bunch of rice (precooked from earlier) to bulk up the meal.

•

•

•

•

•

Lastly, a more labor intensive recipe, that will require that you've stocked up your kitchen more fully to make - but you can still make a simplified version of it before then. 

•••••••••••••••••••Shepherd's Pie (A lot more work, but so. damn. good.!) (and if you use lots of potato, the price/meal is actually pretty cheap) (and you get lots of meals out of it)


•Mashed potatoes•

Chop up potatoes (a bunch, enough that once they're mashed they'll cover your casserole dish about ¾ to 1 inch deep.) into ½"" cubes (approximately,) throw into a pot, add water enough to cover them, plus about an inch. Put onto the stove on 'hi' heat. Start on the meat mixture, but after about 10-15 minutes, try stabbing the potato cubes with a fork - if the fork 'cuts' through easily, they potatoes are done cooking. Drain in a colander, put back in the pot, add about 2-4 tablespoons butter, some salt, pepper and some milk. Mash it up. It doesn't have to be super-smooth, but should be enough that the flavors are throughout the potatoes. If you like, stir in an egg yolk - it thickens the potatoes, adds a little flavor and color.


•Meat filling•

Anyway, while your potatoes cook: 

Chop 2 to 5 carrots up (cheap, tasty) - I like about ½"" cubes, but larger's okay too. Throw them in a sauté pan with about a tablespoon of oil, cook on medium heat (high enough that it cooks, low enough it doesn't burn while you're chopping up other things.) 

Chop up an onion, add to the pan. Maybe throw in some butter - it tastes good :-) If you have whole garlic, dice some up and throw that in too.  Cook that until the onions are translucent. 

Add a pound of beef ( I like 80/20 because it's not ALL fat, but doesn't have the price of 93/7) 

Cook, stirring frequently enough the mixture doesn't burn, until the beef is browned. 

Add enough chicken bouillon (or better than bouillon) to make a cup worth of chicken broth. Don't add the water for that, since we aren't going to use flour to soak it up. 

Add a tablespoon of tomato paste.

Add a teaspoon of GF worcestershire sauce, a teaspoon of rosemary, a half-teaspoon of thyme. If you like, add fresh or frozen (or canned then drained) corn and/or peas to the mixture. If you didn't have whole garlic, add about a ½ tablespoon to a tablespoon (to taste) of powdered garlic.

The mixture should be about the consistency of a thick stew - if it's pretty watery cook at low temp, stirring occasionally, until it thickens up. 


If it just won't thicken up (I don't know why, but occasionally this happens,) take a small pan, use about a cup of water, bring it to a boil, then add about 2-4 tablespoons of corn starch, whisk it until it's all dissolved, you should have a gel (if not, add a bit more corn starch, whisk it in) - as soon as it gels turn off the heat, whisk until the cornstarch is all dissolved. Add the gel to the meat mixture and stir in - it should help it thicken up.  


•Assembling the pie•

Take your casserole dish, cover the bottom with all of the meat mixture. Use a serving spoon or rubber spatula to spread the mashed potatoes over the meat mixture. Do this starting at the outside edges, then fill in toward the center - the potatoes will 'seal in' the meat mixture.

Throw this into the oven at about 400º for about half an hour. 

Serve hot, or let it cool some, cut it into serving size pieces, container up and freeze. They microwave up easily, and you'll get many meals for the work you've put in to make this treat.",,False,,t5_2qx1l,1370507705.0,,,True,t3_1fs2xy,http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/1fs2xy/here_are_my_ideas_for_cheap_quick_easy_gf_food/,

After discovering my gluten intolerance issues last Nov, I worked really hard to overcome my food related anxiety. But sometimes, the anxiety comes back when I go out to eat at a restaurant or order some takeout. The stupid fear of being sick because of food. It's not so much about being scared to eat gluten but rather to get some type of food poison. I spent 3 years of agony with eating food. Always full of nausea, shakes, anxiety, the shits, fast heartbeat, etc.... after eating a meal. I fear to relive those events. Like I said before... my anxiety is nearly gone compared to the state I was in before and I tried so very hard to not form some sort of eating disorder/controlling issues with food. I've come a long ways and I'm proud. But now I find myself avoiding meat...

My question to you guys would be if this is a normal process? Is it stupid to fear getting sick from food? How common is it to actually get food poisoning? Have you guys went through something similar?

Recently some friends and I have started working on an outreach project called ""Eat. Taste. Live."" ""Eat. Taste. Live."" is our attempt to not only help those with a gluten-intolerance but to also educate other people about celiac disease. In doing so, we are hosting an online, interactive gluten-free cooking class.

www.eattastelive.com

ETL came about when our chef's father was diagnosed with celiac disease several years ago. Since then, our chef's been cooking gluten-free and has come to realize hey, you know what? There really aren't as many options out there as we think. The goal is to make this available for anyone who wants to learn to cook delicious, homemade meals that are not only good but good for them. As long as you have access to an internet connection? You're right in the kitchen with us interacting with our chef and our guests, nationwide and internationally.

The actual class functions on a pay-what-you-want system. Our chef made a helpful video explaining that: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PUcAR6vYqQ However, we are also offering recipes and resources online for free.  We plan to create PDFs of the recipes we will be cooking each week along with short little videos for quick snacks and other fun things.

For samples of what kind of food we'll be making, check out our instagram: http://instagram.com/eattastelive. 

We're also bringing in guests to our studio to be on air with our chef.  The guests for our premiere are actress Taryn Southern and entertainer Joel Bryant. You can find them on Youtube, too.

We're trying to reach as many people as we can to let them know this resource is out there for them and we're willing to help. We're ready to prove how easy it can be to make amazing food that's still healthy.  

If you have any questions and/or suggestions let me know.  

EDIT: We heard your feedback loud and clear and have agreed that the previous hosting site was too complex and misleading.  Therefore we have since moved so that our class is strictly pay what you want.  No $5 minimum purchase required. We will be running strictly on the pay-what-you-want system to make it even more readily available.

We are now streaming our first episode online for rebroadcast.  If you'd like to see what we're all about, check out http://www.eattastelive.com/#!kitchen-studio/c1bcs. We are available for streaming via computer and mobile devices.

I was diagnosed with a wheat sensitivity, yeast allergy, and a severe mold allergy (can't eat anything fermented/aged/etc) when I was 7. My parents didn't really understand the seriousness of my dietary needs and love to eat everything I can't so I never ate in accordance to them until I went to culinary school two years ago (baking and pastry; gluten everywhere). I got tested for celiac disease last year and was diagnosed. 

Now, I've always been thin but I've been trying to gain weight for the last two years. When I was 15 I reached my heaviest point (125 lb), and at 16 is when I began to really get affected by my allergies. I was exceedingly tired all the time (missed a year and a half of high school due to fatigue), had a constant yeast infection, stomach problems every time I ate, you know. By the time I was 18 my weight fluctuated between 115 and 120 lbs. Since then I've just been losing it. I was 110 when I started college and have just gone down since then and cannot put on any no matter what I do. As I've gotten older my appetite has also gotten smaller and smaller and I can go over a day without eating and not really consciously feel hungry. I'm not depressed or anything and don't have any other medical problems. I do force myself to eat at least six times a day and eat at least 2000calories per day, but when I eat it always ends up going right through me coming out only a few hours later no matter what it is.

The other people I know with celiac disease seems to have the opposite problem; they've gained weight and can't lose it. I don't think my other allergies would contribute that much (my diet is much more limited but I can still eat things that would make me gain).  I know it's not completely uncommon for someone with celiac disease to have weight loss, but this complete inability to gain weight is annoying.

However, when I do dream nowadays, ever since I was diagnosed I've had nightmares, which I haven't had since I don't even know how long ago. 

Gluten Nightmares. Quite vivid too, which makes it that much more terrifying.. I'll be out with friends and go in a store and grab something to eat and start munching down, after I go through half the package i'll look at the packaging (something I would never do, I always check BEFORE eating..duh) and bam! Wheat Flour. I am then gripped with this indescribable fear, and the whole rest of my dream is spent cursing myself at how I could be so stupid to not check the ingredients, and how I'm going to absolutely hate life for the next 3 weeks.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I'm not exactly looking for advice because, what advice could there be, I was just wondering if this was a common thing.",,False,,t5_2qx1l,False,,,True,t3_14fjd4,http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/14fjd4/gluten_nightmares/,

I just got diagnosed and I am doing my best to stick to this as carefully as possible. I just was wondering what it would actually do if I did eat gluten say less than once a month type thing? 

Would it make me even sicker than gluten already does? I'm thinking if my body adjusts to not eating gluten and then once in a while I do the results of eating it would be even worse than they currently are? However, if that is not the case, I don't see what the huge deal would be if I did eat gluten once in a blue moon. I already know what the consequences would be (pretty bad diarrhea) but I've lived with that for a long time already. 

I also know the increased chance of developing other diseases and cancers, but it's not like every bit of gluten i have would increase that 

I know I'll probably get attacked for asking this, but I'm just curious what would happen exactly.

I've been lactose free for 9 months now, I've been gluten free for 1 month. 

Two years ago I got very sick with gastritis for a few weeks. Ever since then, my digestive tract has been messed up. I went through an insane amounts of ups and downs with food. It was a huge struggle, it felt like anything I ate I couldn't digest. Within 20 mins, I would have the need to empty my bowels, would be extremely nauseous, need to puke (never did), the shakes, heat waves, head fog ( I cannot concentrate for shit, my vision feels foggy) dizzy, exhausted. Once I pass a bowel movement, my nasau gradually starts to go away and my tummy bloats for what feels like never-ending inches. It's painful and uncomfortable. For the rest of the day, I'm exhausted and have a general sick feeling. The bloating doesn't go away until a few days later.

Some foods that I remember making me really sick were hot dogs with the buns, pizza and cheese. This is what made me think I was lactose intolerant. But the problems still occurred with what seemed like random food. I finally went to the doctor and she diagnosed me with IBS. I had never heard of it before and was pretty much told that I needed to find a way to deal with stress. But, it still felt like it was linked to something food related. I did everything in my power to handle my stress. Of course, anxiety began to form with the act of eating. I was scared to be sick after eating. There were probably reactions that were emphasized by the anxiety.

Some days, I really wanted to die it was so bad. I feel horrible thinking that but it really made life miserable. Since then and now, I've been doing so much better but I still have bouts of reactions. I decided to go gluten free about a month ago and I've never felt better. The anxiety is slowly going away, I have not experience any symptoms yet. ( Apart from today when I ate yogurt salad dressing and I had a reaction to it). I went to get blood tests done to confirm a gluten sensitivity and the results came back negative. So I'm really confused about the whole situation.... is it just anxiety? I know I can't eat dairy but gluten seems to trigger my symptoms too... 

I would appreciate any answers and advice.

I've got all the powders necessary to combine into whatever mixture is required (save Captain Planet, I'm fresh out of Heart).  Bette Hagman has a number of different flour types.

She gave me the recipe and I tweaked it a little to make it healthier and easier since I didn't want to make a homemade gluten-free cream of chicken soup.

**Ingredients:**

*2-3 cups brown rice (that measurement is before it's cooked; I used about half a regular sized bag of rice)*

*1 small bag frozen spinach*

*~ 3/4 small bag frozen onion*

*3/4 cup mayo*

*12 oz gluten-free cream of chicken soup (Kroger now carries this)*

*1 teaspoon salt (I use no sodium salt)*

*1 teaspoon lemon juice*

*1/2 cup butter*

*1/2 cup chopped walnuts*

*~ 2/3 cup Chex (I used Rice chex)*

**Instructions:**

1) Cook brown rice until finished -- about 45 minutes if not using a rice cooker. Spread into casserole dish (I spray with cooking spray first).

2) Thaw spinach and onion and mix into cooked rice.

3) Mix mayo, cream of chicken soup, salt, and lemon juice together. Mix into the rice, spinach, and onion mixture.

4) Heat butter, walnuts, and Chex together in a pan until butter is melted. Sprinkle on top of mixture in the casserole dish.

5) Bake at 350F for about 30 minutes until hot. 

**Disclaimer:**

I'm not a big salt fan, so this was perfectly seasoned to me. You will obviously want to taste it and add salt until it is to the level you prefer.

**EDIT: For those that are unable to find a gluten-free cream of chicken or cream of whatever soup, here is the recipe my MIL gave me to make it home-made.**

*Melt butter and add rice flour. Stir constantly and brown very slowly. Add 3 chicken bouillon cubes and water a little at a time until the consistently of cream of chicken soup.*

I had been having mild GI symptoms for a few years (! shame on me for not getting to it sooner) and finally it got bad enough that I went to see a GI doctor.  I am thankful that the first test he ran was a Celiac blood panel, as from what I understand there are tons of doctors out there that would have just told me I have IBS and sent me on my way.  I just got an endoscopy/biopsy yesterday, and I'm waiting on the biopsy results... I did have a superficial ulcer in my small intestine and some visible signs of mucosal changes, which isn't the best news ever.  I have a followup with my doc later on this month to discuss the results and where we go from here.

My problem is, I'm only 24.  I don't know anyone else with Celiac in real life, and all I can find on the internet are horror stories about people that went decades undiagnosed and now have serious and permanent damage to their body, or have symptoms that never abate, or a laundry list of other food sensitivities and allergies.  I feel like I'm in a weird no man's zone for this disease, and the only other people out there who have it are much younger or older than I am, and have had very different experiences from mine.

I've been gluten free for just short of two weeks now.  I am a bit in food mourning, but I've always been a huge home cook and I love cider, so that's not my biggest issue. 

I just want some hope.  I need to know that some people get better and live a normal life that's not filled with fear and sickness.

My mom's been gluten-free for a few years now, I'm more of a quinoa-and-rice than a pasta fan, I think my gf bread recipe tastes better than most store-bought breads...whatever.  I don't have an issue with that.

What I have an issue with is the seemingly incessant need to *get stricter* in order to maintain the results of the initial cutting-out-of-gluten.  As my mother encourages me to try out gf for my own digestive troubles, I'm having a hard time looking away from her trend over the last three years (and the trend which appears online): oh, okay, I'll just find gf substitutes and everything will be fine (and maybe I'll have cheat days!) --&gt; okay nevermind no cheat days --&gt; whoops, gluten is in more things than I thought!  Gotta be careful about that oatmeal --&gt; cross-contamination is an issue, so no restaurants ever --&gt; nothing is acceptable to eat or put in mouth unless it has been tested for gluten --&gt; must be another food allergy, cut out another food (and repeat from beginning, but now with onions).

I'm not arguing that that progression has really been what my mother has needed to keep herself from feeling ""glutened"".  I don't even care if, at a certain point, it's biological or psychosomatic.  I just know that she's calling up floss companies to ask if they test for gluten, and she still has the runs every day...and most gluten-free fora are not giving me a much more encouraging picture.  Seriously, her doctor recommended completely renovating our kitchen to avoid cross-contamination.

Even if, hypothetically, I am gluten-sensitive, I'm not seeing a lot of reason to cut it out.  I've obviously built up some sort of tolerance (the state of my bowels is already substantially better than the state of my mothers'), and the idea of losing that tolerance to the point where ""naturally gluten free"" *bags of rice* are possible contaminants is...remarkably unattractive.

I've gone gluten free on and off for a while (the longest period being about 3 months or so), but always lose the willpower to continue because I'm in my 20s, poor, and I like cake/pizza/pasta.

I'm starting to question my diagnosis because I don't really exhibit many of the symptoms that are the bane of everyone else in this subreddit's existence. No explosive diarrhea, no heartburn, no migraines, etc. The only gastro-intestinal symptom I really seem to get is **severe** bloating. I can gain as much as 10 lbs/5 inches in one day in bloat alone, which at this point in my life I've just gotten used to. It has become so normal that it's not much of a gluten deterrent. My major symptom was (and still is) pretty severe fatigue and frequent brain fog, which going gluten-free doesn't seem to help.

I'm just curious if there's anyone else out there that is almost asymptomatic but has tested positive for Celiac's. Has anyone heard of a case of a false positive?

",,14,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/10urw6/improvements_to_bobs_red_mill_pizza/,"**Q: How do you activate yeast and why?**

**A:** Activated yeast prevents gas or at least not as much, and causes the dough to rise when baked. The directions tell you just to mix with warm water and let it sit for a few minutes. This leads to mixed results. 
   
   Add a pinch of sugar to the yeast mix and let it sit for 30+ minutes. 

   It should start to bubble (meaning the yeast are alive). 

**Q: It sticks BAD, is there anything I can do?**

**A:** Rub some olive oil on the aluminum foil before putting the dough down. 

If you still have trouble use Reynolds Wrap Non-Stick Aluminum foil. 

**Q: I have made several pizzas, how do you spread the dough and make it round?**

**A:** Sandwich the dough between 3-5 overlapping sheets of Stretch-Tite Plastic Wrap. As the name suggests it will stretch, and if you don't over work the dough, it will peel easily. 2 over lapping sheets on top, and 3 double over lapping sheets on the bottom. 

Flatten the dough starting in the middle, until in a pie shape, if you did it right you will have slightly more dough at the edges than the center and get a rising crust.

**Q: How long can you store it, and how?**

**A:** Generally I make a pizza that day and only store it in the refrigerator if I am going to use it the next. Any longer and you should cut it into portions, and store it in the freezer.

1 package makes 3 small pizzas (fits better on the tray)  and I wrap it in the Stretch-Tite/Plastic bag.
