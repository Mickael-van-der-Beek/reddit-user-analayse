EDIT: Holy shit! I guess there is some interest. Today, I had no installs so I don't have any pics of anything recent. It also occurs to me that I don't think I have ever taken a picture on the job. I am currently working and am driving a big ass delivery truck so any updates will be a couple hours. I work like 13 hours a day so I will do what I can.

**Demo discs**

Demo discs are made of clips of movies or music that show off different aspects of your home theater, whether it be the bass, the visuals, the surround sound, or the musical aspect. I'll list a few here.

Superleo at avsforum has made a demo disc and is currently in the process of releasing another:  

[Reference Blu Ray Demo Disc 1](http://www.avsforum.com/t/1391873/reference-blu-ray-demo-disc-bd9-dvd-dl-media-bd50/0_100) is the first one, with all of the instructions on how to download and burn it. It has categories for visuals, surround, bass, animation, and music and a pretty nice menu system as well.

[Reference Blu Ray Demo Disc 2](http://www.avsforum.com/t/1469192/reference-2-blu-ray-demo-disc-bd9s-bd50/0_100) is the second one, which currently has the bass and surround categories released.  Coming up are superheroes, visual, animation and music.  You can download each segment as it releases, and then there will be instructions added to combined them all into a Blu Ray.

[Ultimate Bass Demo Disc](http://www.avsforum.com/t/1412846/the-ultimate-bass-demo-disc/0_100) is a compilation of a bunch of clips with fantastic bass.  There is something wrong with the folder structure in the torrent, but once that's fixed (and there are instructions) it is a great disc.  The menu structure is lacking, but Jindrak (the creator) is already working on a second volume with much better menus.

**Reference Blu Rays**

Why hold yourself to just a clip from a movie, when you can watch the entire thing and be blown away?

Over at avs, there are three thread of Blu Ray rankings: audio, visual, and bass.

[Picture Quality Ranking](http://www.avsforum.com/t/1425519/official-picture-quality-rankings-for-blu-ray-the-tiers-list-updated-through-march-9-2013/0_100) and [Picture Quality Discussion](http://www.avsforum.com/t/858316/the-new-pq-tier-thread-for-blu-ray-discussion/0_100) are the threads to see what are the top of the top of picture quality on Blu Rays. The discussion thread contains all of the summaries as to why Blu Rays are where they should be, and the ranking thread is just the averages of the ranks of submitted reviews. These people spend a lot of time watching blu rays for the picture quality, and are extremely nitpicky, so if something is in Tier 0, it's definitely fantastic quality. Note that the link to the tiers in the first post of the discussion thread is outdated and the updated tiers are in the link I put.

[Audio Quality Ranking and Discussion](http://www.avsforum.com/t/1190265/new-audio-tier-thread/0_100) is not as active as the picture quality thread, but any movie you watch from the top tier will surely blow you away with it's audio, and probably it's picture quality.

[Bass Movies](http://www.avsforum.com/t/1333462/the-new-master-list-of-bass-in-movies-with-frequency-charts/0_100) are something a lot of people can smile at just feeling the low frequency. These guys have subwoofers that go below 10 Hz (human hearing only goes to 20 Hz, and so you actually only feel it).  They discuss the good and the bad from Blu Rays and even have waterfalls that show the relative magnitude of the difference bass frequencies.

**Audio Tracks**

I have not seen a demo disc or reference thread on avsforum, but I don't really go on there very often. 

[Zeos Demo Music](http://www.reddit.com/r/Zeos/comments/1caxzd/great_demo_music_master_list/) is a list compiled by one of the mods here and it definitely has some great stuff for all varieties.

Really though, demo music is music that YOU are familiar with and can now hear the nuances with.  

So there you have it, different ways to show off your home theater. Enjoy!

1356668138.0,35,self.hometheater,15k18v,How can I soundproof a living room?,Zangeith15,44,9,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/15k18v/how_can_i_soundproof_a_living_room/,"Back story: Have a job lined up for August and will be renting a house. It will be a relatively small house very likely in a neighborhood where the houses are pretty close. I will be getting a 7.1 Aperion Intimus 5 system with a denon or marantz that is a better fit for me at the time, if that information matters. I realize it is far away, I am just excited to finally have my own place and of course a major upgrade to my HT system.

Issue: I want to know what I can do to properly soundproof my living room so I don't have to worry about my neighbors complaining. Sound traveling throughout the house is fine, I just want to be able to have my system loud with no worries of a noise violation, if at all possible. I understand there are limitations. 

Current idea: I have googled this on the internet and found a whole bunch of things. A family member recommended I buy sound cancelling/light blocking drapes at a store and cover my walls in it. I think that it is a great idea in that it could make my living room look pretty cool and possibly soundproof. My family member insists that it would work fine with what I need.

Question to you guys: Is this a viable option (covering the walls of the living room in sound drapes)? Or is the idea not viable at all and a novice mistake on my part.

TL;DR: Would covering the walls of a small living room in stylish soundproof drapes mitigate the sound enough for neighbors not to be an issue? Or, is there someone with experience in this with a better idea?

Edit 1: I notice I said things like soundproof drapes, I am aware there are no drapes that completely block out the sound. I do believe they help mitigate as they have material to absorb the sound. 

Edit 2: Thanks everyone for the information.  Glad I made this post and hopefully others found it valuable. I'm going to try my best to get a house with a finished basement.

I mostly lurk in this subreddit and take a lot of advice because I'm installing my first ever home theater. I did my research and bought my projector (Optoma HD20), my HDMI cables, and a new receiver. I've run the HDMI cables and have the spot where I want my projector.. I've run the numbers in terms of throw distance, but now that I'm invested and I'm nearing the point where things are going up.. I'm concerned.

My projector will be 13 feet away from my wall; the throw distance says my screen can be 110 inches diagonally. I have a 1080p projector; will the screen still by crystal clear? I'm getting nervous. The largest TV I've ever purchased is 52 inches, so this is quite a step up and I don't know exactly how it's going to look. I used a tape measure and realized that this screen is going to be huge. I'm excited, but now becoming unsure that all of this will work out as planned.

PS - another random question, I'm mounting this sucker to the ceiling. The only wires I need are two HDMI cables and the power cable, right? Is there anything else that I'm missing? (assuming I only need two HDMIs)

Thanks guys!",,False,self,t5_2rof6,False,,,True,t3_1aex06,http://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/1aex06/help_put_me_at_ease_first_timer/,

Decided to order a [Denon AVR-1513](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007R8U5VM/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and [a pair of Micca Motion MB42s](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009IUIV4A/ref=oh_details_o02_s01_i02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) from Amazon based on the advice in that thread, and while the receivers are still in the mail, the AVR came in today.

Except it wasn't the AVR-1513. 

No, I was instead sent a [Denon DHT-1513BA](http://www.amazon.com/Denon-DHT-1513BA-Channel-Theater-Acoustics/dp/B007R8U5RG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367097080&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=dht-1513ba); so I got the same AVR as I'd ordered plus [a 5.1 speaker set from Boston Acoustics](http://www.amazon.com/Boston-Acoustics-MCS160-Theatre-System/dp/B0078LQQFW/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367097675&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=boston+mcs+160). 

Now, it's not all positives here, the AVR is a refurb and so only has a 1-year warranty unlike the 2-year warranty I'd get with a new one, and there's been a lot of back and forth emailing and I'm up to three different people at Amazon customer support, but it sounds like they're just going to call it good and let me keep it all.

I just thought I'd share, and I wanted to say thanks to this community as a whole and especially to /u/samuswashere for the advice that led to this bit of serendipity.

**Update:** I was just about to hit submit when I got another email from Amazon customer support apologizing yet again for sending me a used product, promising they'll investigate the source of the problem, and now **offering a $75 refund on top of all that.** So, yeah, holy shit...

**Update 2:** They're definitely giving me that refund, say it should show up on my gift card balance in a business day or two. I'm in a low-level state of shocked disbelief here - to recap, I told them I was happy to call it even, but no, instead I get even more apologies and am more or less told ""happy's not good enough, we fucked up and we want you to be ecstatic so have some free money to go with your free speakers!""",,False,self,t5_2rof6,1367106626.0,,,True,t3_1d8iwn,http://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/1d8iwn/unbelievable_luck_from_an_amazon_screwup_while/,

i have a small apartment and want to add a little system but deciding that a blu-ray HTIB was not the best move for me, i have now entered the world of individual components.

bluetooth, hdmi passthrough, wattage, amperage, crossover, 4k, upscaling, resistence, impedence, amplifiers, receivers, channels, subwoofers, optical connections, blah blah blah. i am in way over my head. i need some sort of basic ""explain it to me like i am five"" primer of all the major points that i need to understand. 

all my googling has ended up with extremely in depth articles reviewing each individual component, and so they make assumptions that the reader is relatively up to speed on these terms and how they affect one another. i am not even there yet so i feel overwhelmed.

I ordered the UN40EH6000 and was sent the UN46EH6000. I think it was a warehouse mistake since my order number is correctly written right on the box. I was charged for the 40 inch version. 

I really don't know what to do in this situation. If I tell the seller, (online retailer I had never used before) they might just tell me to keep it, but I'm worried they'll want to send me the right size. 

**UPDATE:** I called them, and was put on hold while the representative talked to his manager. They had it listed as a $150 price difference, and the offer was to split the difference at $75, otherwise they would do an express exchange (about a week). I mentioned I opened it since their policy clearly states to inspect it before accepting delivery. I was really on the fence about paying $75, so the rep said he could do $70 and I decided to do it. 

I don't know if that summary does the actual interaction justice. It was a very pleasant call and the representative was very nice and helpful. If he wasn't, I wouldn't have done it. I'm happy to pay it (total price I'm paying is $610) and they really were appreciative that I even chose to call. The sales rep joked that he might not have if it had happened to him. 

**EDIT:** I should also mention that the rep said this ($610) was actually below cost for the TV, which I believe. The samsung site lists it as $1,080 suggested retail, $850 actual price.

Is one a more 'higher-end' design?  What's the philosophical difference between the two (if any)?

For me

**Wall-e** - The intro and the scene where the spaceship first lands. INTENSE BASS

**Jurassic Park** - When the t-rex is approaching DAT BASS

**The Fountain** - The last scene. If you've seen the movie you know which one im talking about. It has so much going on in terms of colors and sounds, its fun to pick out the different instruments.

**Ratatouille** - basically the entire movie is music to my ears :)

**Finding Nemo** - I use this movie to reveal any banding in colors. Always works like a charm. The scene I most look out for is when they sink in that trench and they get chased by that angler fish with a light on its head.

I was cool with it. It sounded fine, not crazy loud but for the price especially, I was satisfied. I happen to have my chill out area in the basement. It's a finished basement; carpet, drywall, lots of furniture and stuff, but it's big. I had moved my sub around a few different places, but my options were limited. Everywhere I tried sounded the same. I tried to keep it in or near a corner. So, for whatever reason, last night I put it in the corner behind my couch - which happens to be about 3 feet away from a wall. Holy fucking shit! It sounded like someone doubled the size of the amp! I mean this thing is booming, and rumbling,  and thumping my back on the couch. I'm amazed - and happy!

The cheapest I've seen is the [Emotiva UMC-200](http://shop.emotiva.com/products/umc200) at $600. But I find it puzzling that a [$200 receiver](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16882115373) can include all the DACs necessary as well as amplifiers.

And so they are.. all the same. Same spec's, Same Shape, Same I/O panel on the rear. So the real question is who is actually making them and selling the rest to competing companies?

One piece of pre-finished 24"" particle board shelving for $3.99. (I've got a nice chunk of real wood I'm considering cutting and painting for a little extra strength.)

Screws - $2.00 
Fender Washers - $0.89 (these aren't pictured but were used so that the smaller screws I used to attach the shelf to the brackets wouldn't slip through the large holes in the brackets.) 

I did end up painting the screws and washers black because I couldn't find the size I wanted in black.

I already have them set up and have been playing around with them all afternoon, but I've been reading some warnings online suggesting that these are actually 4 ohm speakers (even though Infinity advertises them as 8 ohm) and that one should be very careful when pairing with a midrange receiver. 

Apologies in advance for my lack of understanding, but from what I've gathered, the lower the ohm (rating? number?) the more power the speaker is trying to pull and if the receiver can't handle it, you risk damaging the electronics (or at least lowering the audio quality). 

What I'm trying to figure out is if my receiver (Pioneer VSX 919) is okay with these new speakers. I just found out how to switch my receiver's impedance from 8 ohm to 6 ohm, but there is no option for 4 ohm.  At the moment I have these in a small room and I'm certainly not cranking the volume levels (but I'd like to have that option in the future). I don't know if this is relevant information, but the 919 outputs 120 W per channel.

Also, assuming everything is okay, will having it set to 6 ohm effect the sound on my rears (which are 8 ohm)?",,False,self,t5_2rof6,False,,,True,t3_w7p6x,http://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/w7p6x/ohm_i_have_a_question/,

First one I bought, I had messed up and didn't get the proper throw ratio down.

Room has a fixed mount (spot) in the middle, on the ceiling: 14'6"" from the screen. Screen dimensions are 45""Hx80""W. Throw ratio: 2.175

Ceiling is 7'7"" - Screen is vaguely centered on the wall, but there is an auto drop down of the screen using a 12v trigger (headphone jack connector). Optoma doesn't use this trigger port standard, so they're out. BenQ's are all too big (but *do* use the 12v trigger port), so they're out.

1365288911.0,15,self.hometheater,1btkuu,This my plan. Any thoughts or recommendation? Home music/theater. $5000 budget. (Suggested to post here from r/ audiophile.,helpforhomeaudio,63,48,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/1btkuu/this_my_plan_any_thoughts_or_recommendation_home/,"i just turned 40 and I’ve decided to finally spring for a home audio/HT system. I’ve been doing research for the past few months and it gets pretty overwhelming so I’m posting here in case someone might find it fun to figure out the best use of current equipment and what to spend the rest on. I would like to begin putting together a good home audio set-up the right way. I have some budget and some existing gear that could be used to start out and upgrade later. 


* Budget: up to $5,000 and I’m thinking that would go into the receiver or preamp/amp set up and speakers, using the existing equipment to fill in until I can upgrade. 


* Right now I am thinking of spending 1,000-1500 on the receiver and around $3,000 on speakers. The reason I’m at this number on the receiver is my credit with Paul’s TV, and the reason on this number for the speakers is I demoed the B&amp;W CM9’s and really liked the sound and that’s what they cost. I also listened to some Martin and Logan motion 40’s and liked those too. The B&amp;W’s win out on aesthetics which is important for my wife. If I have extra I’m thinking a subwoofer. 


*I have a $1,350 credit with Paul’s TV. Don’t ask why...ok but please don’t judge... I bought a soundbar on the urging of my wife when I got my TV, my wife loved the look of it and it demoed pretty well. I got it home and knew it was a mistake right away. They charge a 15% restocking fee so instead of losing the money I might try to purchase something from the lines they carry. They carry Denon, Yamaha, and Pioneer receivers and Kef and Definititive Technology speakers. 


* Use: this will be used for music and surround sound for TV/movies.  I listen to rock, blues, acoustic, soul, hip-hop and some electronic music. Volume is not my primary concern, I have a pretty good set up in my car and that’s where I listen to hip-hop electronic when I’m by myself and can crank it. This in-home set up will be more for classic rock on vinyl, acoustic, soul, concert dvd’s and surround for movies. I’m not an audiophile so this is going to be difficult to explain but I prefer a warm, rich, full sound. I like feeling music. I like to go loud every once in a while but what I really want are those full, deep, articulate qualities, being able to hear the finger squeak on a guitar string or the return of a piano key as well as being able to follow the separate instruments, I was listening to Friend of the Devil last night and loved trying to follow each instrument. The first time I really felt this (outside a concert or live music show) was when I upgraded my cars stereo to an alpine receiver, hertz speakers, and a JL audi sub. I felt enveloped by the sound, this is what I’d like to  shoot for here. 


* The room: 13x15ft with a 4’x1.2’ bumpout. 3 windows, two in the rear of the listening area and 1 on the side opposite the bumpout, and 2 doors. ceilings are 8’6”. wide-pine floors, small area rug. I’ll post pictures if I can figure out imgur. Any suggestions on room treatment welcome. 


The primary questions are:

* Should I go for a pre-amp and amp set up right out of the gate or go with a receiver? I was planning to go for a good receiver but then started hearing how separate components is the way to do it right (down the rabbit hole we go...). I don’t really want to spend a lot of time fine tuning and setting up a bunch of different connections but would be interested to hear the pros and cons for each. 


* If a receiver only any recommendation on a Denon, Yamaha, or Pioneer? I was looking at the Marantz SR7007. Honestly I like the aesthetics and thought it would be cool to have a modern marantz next to my vintage one. That said I’ve read mixed reviews on the modern marantz. Secondly I can’t use the paul’s tv credit towards anything marantz. I looked at the Pioneer Elite and the rep recommended the SC-68 because the lower model didn’t have a phono input which I took to mean I would need that to pass through the phono from the marantz. So recommendations on Denon, pioneer, or yamaha. If I can get something fantastic for less than the 1200 great. I would like it to have Audiseey or some other EQ room calibration. 


* Any ideas for other ways to use the existing equipment that I have listed below. Also any feedback on whether you think I’m making the right decisions in what to invest in first. Right now, before any feedback from Reddit, I’m thinking of buying the B&amp;W CM9’s floor standing speakers and a Pioneer Elite receiver. Then from my existing equipment using the Kef as a center channel and the little technics cubes as the rears (ooh, i just wondered if I could use the JBL’s as rears and the technics and the 6th and 7th)

Existing equipment:

* Marantz 2230 vintage receiver, I use this for my turn table, like the experience of using the older system for vinyl. I’m hoping to be able to integrate this into the set up. Not sure how the newer receivers work but hoping you could input from the marantz and pass through the new receiver to play through the speakers vs having to have two sets of speakers. I could just plug the turntable into the new receiver but I do like having the marantz as part of the system. 


* Bose model 360 turntable


* Panasonic DMP-BD30 Blu Ray player, i think this is at least 5-6 years old, not sure how advanced blu ray players have come but I was planning to use this as my DVD/CD player in this set up


* Apple TV


* Samsung LED 800 Smart TV - I just got this TV and I love it. It’s got wireless, web browsing, and netflix and other apps right on the TV. 


* I also have an old Technics receiver SADx940, it doesn’t have HDMI inputs. it’s labeled as Dolby Digital and DTS. I’m thinking this isn’t useful here but wanted to include it in case it could be used as a component or something.

 
Speakers:


* Kef model 90 Type SP30178 center channel


* pair of Bose 301 floor standing - these are a little beat up after lending to a friend but was considering these are rears until I upgrade


* pair of Klipsch KG3.5 floor standing - these are too big to pass the wife test so will likely stay in the basement
an even bigger pair of Kenwood speakers, basement bound


* pair of JBL 2600 bookshelf speakers, light wood grain veneer, in good shape but doesn’t go with aesthetics I was looking for but could be the set of rears?


* Technics SB-C80 center channel


* pair of Technics SB-S50 cubes these and the above center were part of an old surround set up

What they're looking for is something to run the satellite box/cd player/DVD/Radio, as well as take an input for an external mic (maybe instrument input. That never came up).

Basically, my folks like to have ""house concerts,"" and wonderef if it was feasible to use their already reasonably swanky in-ceiling speaker setup to carry the vocals, and maybe a guitar or two.

From my current level of understanding, I believe they need to run the mic/instruments into a preamp before hitting a receiver.

As their current receiver bit the dust last year, they're in the market for a new one, and were wondering what would be the best bang for the buck.

For my TV I have the Panasonic 60ST50 which is just amazing on its own.

I bought the Denon 1713 receiver to power the audio.  This little box is amazing as well with its ease of setup and many many options to play with.  Its heavier than I expected and well crafted.

Using Zeos's tips, I bought 2 pairs of the Dayton Audio B652 6-1/2-Inch 2-Way Bookshelf Speakers to use as my fronts and surrounds.  They sound great and I highly recommend them.  I will be making some good speaker stands in the next week or two to place them on as right now they are sitting on old stools.

I was going to also use a B652 as the center channel but ended up buying the Dayton Audio CCS-33B 3-Way Center Channel Speaker instead.  I built a shelf behind my TV in which the speaker sits flush with the edge of the screen and aimed down towards ear level of the sitting area.  I am still tweaking this a bit to get the right volume level but will need to do it all once again once I have the speaker stands in place.

For the Sub I purchased the Dayton Audio SUB-1200.  It was actually a few dollars less than its smaller brother the SUB-1000 so I couldn't go wrong.  This thing is a beast with its 12"" speaker and heavy.  I have this sitting between the TV and the front right speaker.  I thought it was defective at first as I would not get any sound from it at all until I realized I needed to turn it on and not just plug it in.  oops.

I had a PS3 attached for Blu-ray but since its remote is bluetooth and I wanted a universal remote, I ended up buying another Blu-ray player from Panasonic.  I know I could have bought an adapter but now I can move the PS3 upstairs and use it on the 42"" Panasonic in the bedroom.

I bought the Logitech Harmony 650 remote.  Easy online setup and does what I want it to do.  Its nice having one remote instead of 4.

First movie I put in to test it all out after setting everything up with the Audyssey feature was the Blu-ray version of Avatar.  As much as I didn't think it would matter all that much, the incredible sound quality coming from all around me and the deep booming base levels gave this movie an all new experience!  I sat there with my mouth hanging open in awe of the true theater experience I was getting.  

I just now need to pick up a wireless bridge so I can get internet access to the Denon and I will be all set.

My Dad is finally building his ""man cave"" and decided to go to the mall to get a home theater quote.  He sat in their demo room and they gave him the ""ultimate setup"" pitch.  I wasn't there, but just listening to what he was saying, it sounds like these were just running up the bill.

Here's everything that was included in the $27,000 quote (along with installation and setup):

* Runco Premium 1080p Single-chip DLP Projector

* Stewart SNDQ123HFHG3WezX 123"" FireHawk Film Screen

* Panamax M5300-PM Power Management with Line Filtration

* Integra DBS-30.3 Blu-Ray Plater with Marvel QDEO Video Processor

* 3 SpeakerCraft Profile AIM Cinema Three In-Wall 5-Way Front LCR Speaker

* Netgear GS608 8-Port 10/100 Ethernet Switch

* Kordz Cabling HDMI Cables


There's no way he's paying $27,000 for a system... not going to happen.

*  Is the stuff listed above any good?

*  I saw a bunch of these components are ""dealer only"" - are these better quality?  Or is it a way to get higher prices for them?

Used an infocus lp350 I got free with a burned out bulb, and a set of nice standalone PC speakers to provide the stereo sound.  Laptop had wireless, but I ran a cat5 up the hill to avoid potential streaming issues.  Would've been easy enough to copy files to the laptop, or use optical media.

However, VLC's default configuration settings don't seem to do a very good job.

Although I've found guides online (from reddit, AVS Forums, Lifehacker, and others), many of them offer conflicting configurations and don't lead to any better results. A few I've found: [Adjusting Audio Dynamics in VLC](http://www.ab9il.net/digital-audio/vlc-audio-dynamics.html), [Watching a movie and the dialogue is too quiet and the action too loud? Use VLC's built in Dynamic Compression tool - Some starter settings.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/vdrlq/lpt_watching_a_movie_and_the_dialogue_is_too/c5vtgva?context=2), and [Fix movies that are really quit, then really loud](http://lifehacker.com/5920290/how-to-fix-movies-that-are-really-quiet-then-really-loud).

If you could throw audio fidelity out the window and just optimize for the best compression, so I can just sit and watch a movie without hitting my volume slider up every minute, that would be wonderful. Or, if you think any of these sites already have the best settings and I'm expecting something this feature can't truly deliver on, let me know.

In case you are wondering, small room, Logitech Z-2300 (2.1) speakers, using my computer as a media management/playback device. Lots of MKVs, web video. I already equalize for less bass because the sub is over powered compared to the L/R for my room size, and it helps with dynamic range.

The home theater includes a PS3, which we currently use for Youtube, Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Instant. Are the SMART features on the Samsung worth the price bump? It seems like those features, plus Wifi and an extra HDMI port are the only advantages.

The theater is about four years old. We put it in when we finished the basement. Because of the location of the furnace, columns  and the door to the garage etc. I was somewhat limited in the size and shape of room. But it mostly worked out. The room is 11’x 20’ and 7’6” high. The platform for the second row of seating is 9” high.

http://imgur.com/a/SKHQc#2

I bought the seating new on EBay. I paid about $1800 for it. They have butt-kickers but I am not a fan and don’t use them all that often.  The basement is a walkout type and there are two big windows in the room which I cover with a pair of blackout shades.

The projector is a Sanyo Z5. I am very pleased with it. Live sports over cable look great. I watched the new Mission Impossible blue ray last week. Even though the movie was as bad as I expected the opening scene in Prague (?) was gorgeous. Deep blue sky with well detailed architecture. Sometimes some images just jump out at you.

http://i.imgur.com/GWXMf.jpg

It hangs from the ceiling 13’ back. The screen is 106” on the diagonal. It wasn’t anything special. I don’t recall the brand but I bought it from Tiger Direct for under $200. And yes I know my ceiling needs to be repainted. 

http://i.imgur.com/KNfRP.jpg

The speakers are all Polk. I believe they are Monitor 30’s in the front and Monitor 20’s for the surround. I followed the guidance of the experts and put the speakers on the side instead of the rear. I am not sure I am happy with this, especially sitting in the second row. I always said I would buy a pair of proper “side” speakers and move the 20’s to the rear and make it a 7.1 system but never have. 

The electronics are a Pioneer receiver , and Panasonic blue ray. Nothing special but it all works well together.

http://i.imgur.com/fhC7s.jpg

And this is a great feature.

http://i.imgur.com/nnblO.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/NYROG.jpg

Not exactly cableporn but it makes life easier.

If I were to change anything I would like to have the LCR speakers mounted behind the screen. Whenever I have the opportunity to hear a system like that it just seems more realistic.  I would also like it to be just a bit wider so getting into the rear row was a bit easier.

I hope some found this useful or interesting.

So i was reading this article - http://www.flatpanelshd.com/focus.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1366264710 - about 4K and how the HDMI cable is currently limiting the ability to convey UltraHD signals, at the required frame rate and colour depth.

However as I was reading this, I was thinking that current PC gaming video cards can run super high resolutions and very high frame rates - and so I was wondering if the limitation is simply with the standard/agreed HDMI specification, or is the limitation really with the physical HDMI cable?

My old LCD shows none of this motion blur and it is 5+ years old and cost just little more than this one did today.

My 3 way bookshelf speakers claim 50-50K Hz response— does this mean I set my SUB x-over to 50Hz? The sub also has a gain, which seems straitforward enough (more gain is more vibration) but i don't want to flush my quality down the tubes with garbage quality just b/c I like the deep frequencies. Ideally I want to hear what PIXAR wants me to hear.

Can one ""clip"" or ""raise"" (via receiver) the lows of the main Left &amp; Right speakers to let the sub do more of the work? This sub really is a 53 pound beast and right now it seems to not even be breaking a sweat.

I can send specs via PM or PM if that is OK in this thread. Just wasn't sure when I read the sidebar. I work for no company and am only hear to learn.

I didn't quite know what settings to set the DSLR up to shoot it so you may see some grain from the 400 ISO. I can try again later.

If anyone ever worried about what pure white looks like on a grey screen I can guarantee it is very white. Blacks are very black and I am running in ECO mode @213watts vs BRIGHT mode @264watts. The brightness drop is so small(+5% maybe) I wouldn't even consider the full bright mode.

My situation is a bit odd. Since my monitor (CRT Sony GDMFW900) requires some gamma tweaking in software I had those tweaks carried over to the projector when in clone mode. So I had to hammer for about 3 hours to get perfect color and gamma matching on the projector via the RGB and Gamma/Skin tone/Color Temperature settings of which this projector has more settings then any TV I have ever used. A tweakers paradise(or purgatory?) 

There is a 1 pixel convergence issue with red on one side and red and green on the other edge. These are NOT noticeable from a normal distance and without single pixel lines that actually test for it you won't see it. Just the price you pay with a 3LCD setup.

I recently had a break-in and my LG [50PS60](http://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-50PS60-plasma-tv) was stolen. Now that I have some money from the renter's insurance policy, I need to replace it.

I'm a big believer in plasma TV's picture quality, but I had serious image retention problems with the LG I had, so I'm really not anxious to spend another $1200-1500 (that's the budget I'm working with) and have the same problems. I'm really tempted by the lower price of the plasma's, though. Plus, I was really happy with the picture quality I had, excepting the image retention. I've read all the stuff about break-in and thought I took the necessary steps with the LG I had, but maybe I didn't...

That said, I've looked at a few LED's, and I'm worried about the picture quality, especially with moving images. I noticed a difference when I was at Best Buy between 60, 120, and 240 Hz refresh rates, and I don't think I'd be happy with anything other than 240 Hz. Could it just be Best Buy messing with the settings to make me buy the higher-end models? Also, I've got a (possibly) irrational fear that I'll be missing out on something with the edge-lit vs. local-dimming LED back-lights. Pro's for the LED would be that sexy ultra-thin profile, and no image retention.

I'm looking to stay in the 50"" or higher screen size, but I'm kinda stuck as to which direction to go.

After some browsing, I like:

[Panasonic TC-P55ST50](http://reviews.cnet.com/flat-panel-tvs/panasonic-tc-p55st50/4505-6482_7-35118300.html), even though it is a bit out of my price range. I've read Panasonic makes the best plasmas, so maybe image retention won't be as much of an issue?

Also, this [Sony I found] (http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Sony+-+55%26%2334%3B+Class+-+LED+-+1080p+-+240Hz+-+Smart+-+3D+-+HDTV/4756881.p?id=1218522131355&amp;skuId=4756881). Even though it is more than the plasma, I'm willing to invest in something that will last me a while.

Before I forget, 3D isn't important to me. I think it's kind of a gimmick, and my stupid Korean head is really wide and the glasses don't fit me. Also, despite me listing all the model numbers and stuff, when I visited avsforums to try and get some advice, I just got a wall of threads with ""Model #XXXX official owner's thread!!!!11!!"", I'm not really all that familiar with the various manufacturer's and their line-ups. I just don't want to have to try and decipher all that crap if I can help it. Plus, these guys seem to be super-serious about picture quality and having the deepest blacks, etc. I just know that I can see a marked difference between plasma and LED.

Help?

Edit: thanks for the advice everyone. I pulled the trigger on the ST50 today. BB was running a sale with a free sound bar + sub. It'll be delivered Thursday!

It seems like every HTPC-ish program/device is missing something (xbox/ps3/windows media center etc).




[XBMC](http://xbmc.org) is FREE &amp; Open source. It is able to stream off of any network type (windows, mac), and (almost) any format. 

Set up a shared folder, and it will find it.  It's laid out very logically with many addons/plugins/ways to get content.  

I'm sure we've all fussed with streaming from specific devices (media center, inoi.. etc).  It's nice to be able to just have something that simply works without a hassle.

When I say any OS, here's a list:

* OSX
* Linux
* Windows
* Apple TV 1 &amp; 2
* iOS
* (perhaps android? if not, soon).  

It can even run on a raspberri pi ($35 board running linux).


 
I've had an AppleTV for a few years, and I discovered it's worthwhile to jailbreak and 'free' my device.  Now I can stream anything from my windows network (down with iTunes!).   

As it turns out, jailbroken AppleTV's are worth 1.5-2x as much as they retailed for, years ago-- just because of XBMC.

 
 



*Netflix doesn't have it?* Addons for XBMC such as Navi-X / 1Channel can stream TV shows, movies... the lot.
disclaimer: legality of content depends on what you search for.




I'm now planning on making a semi-beefy HTPC dedicated for XBMC for my final setup for bluray/network/streaming.

Would creating a stand for the sub enclosure so that it stands higher off the floor help?

If I purchased thick acoustic insulation and have it just under the sub enclosure, thatd help prevent some vibrations from transferring through the floor... wouldnt it?

I currently have the powered sub in between two walls, in front of a window (its probably bigger than a slidling glass window, its several windows wide/tall).

In my opinion, the speakers sound phenomenal.  Although, I haven't had a chance to completely break-in the speakers yet.  I watched Lord of the Rings: Return of the King and I was able to pick up on so many additional details that I hadn't heard before.  Also, voices sounded much clearer.  All of the speakers had much more depth/richness to them than my previous set-up.

The thing that got me most excited is that I am now certain these speakers are actually manufactured by Energy.  I noted previously that the speakers looked nearly identical to the [Energy Take Classic 5.1](http://www.energy-speakers.com/home-theater-systems/?sku=TK-CLASSI-5-1) system.  Other than the striking visual similarities and the identical technical specifications, the manual has a typo where they forgot to change ""Energy"" to ""Monoprice.""  It reads ""CONNECTING YOUR ENERGY SUBWOOFER."" Also, I downloaded the owner's manual from Energy and the language is identical to that in the Monoprice owner's manual with just a few exceptions.

I completely recommend these speakers for anyone who needs a compact set-up OR doesn't have a huge budget.

Because the projector is so close to the screen, I believe it will be incredibly bright, I will most likely use ECO mode (1680 lumens).  
The room will be very dark with almost no ambient light, but I believe brightness will not be a problem at all.  I wanted to go with a high contrast grey screen (http://www.amazon.com/Elite-Screens-Silver-Projection-Screen/dp/B000YDG5SO/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1353604858&amp;sr=8-12&amp;keywords=high+contrast+projector+screen) because I really want good blacks.  

Do I need a projector screen with more gain?  I don't think so but you are the pros!

I am a college student and, after years of saving up, I am finally looking to purchase my own home theater. I have roughly $7,000 set aside specifically for my home theater project. After a lot of work and research, here are the components that I have chosen. I would truly appreciate any advice/guidance on everything thinks about these choices—yall are much more informed than I! I am including both a link to the product as well as a review that explains why I chose the specific component. However, let me know if anyone would prefer a shorthand version of my reasoning. 

First, here’s a little about my intended usage. I love music and listen to it 24/7—this is my biggest use (specifically live classic rock). Next, I watch movies and concerts, streamed locally from an old laptop. Finally, I will watch some TV, but that is lowest on my list of uses. 

**TV:** [Panasonic VIERA 55” TC-P55ST50] (http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-VIERA-TC-P55ST50-55-Inch-Plasma/dp/B00752VKSC/)

* [CNET Review](http://reviews.cnet.com/flat-panel-tvs/panasonic-tc-p55st50/4505-6482_7-35118300.html?tag=contentMain;contentBody;1r)

* Note: I have already decided to go for plasma over LCD, so I am good there!

**Speakers:** [NHT Absolute 5.1 Surround System](http://www.nhthifi.com/Home-Theater-Absolute-5-1T-System?sc=12&amp;category=3830)

* [Wirecutter Review](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/a-great-surround-sound-system/)

system?page=0,0)

* Note: I know NHT is relatively unknown, but all of the reviews that I read were glowing.

**Receiver:** [Sony STR-DN1030](http://www.amazon.com/Sony-STRDN1030-Receiver/dp/B008BDBPT8)

* [CNET Review](http://reviews.cnet.com/av-receivers/sony-str-dn1030/4505-6466_7-35332546.html)


**Other notes and my questions:**

* Next year, I will be living in a ~250 sq foot room. Are these speakers too much power? I will be moving into a much bigger apartment after next year, so hopefully it should be alright...

* This comes out to be about $4000, so I am under-budget. This is clearly not a problem, but should I consider upgrading any of these pieces for something nicer? I am looking for a system that I can hold onto for a very long time, so I have no problems paying more upfront for a better experience. Originally, I was going to piece together my own speaker system, but the reviews for this set were so good that I couldn’t resist. However, I am still open to any other systems or buying individual pieces—or even buying the pieces that I can afford now and adding in the rears over time (This was my original plan). I would love any input about possible improvements to this system since this $7000 was set aside for my home theater!

* Is this receiver compatible with these speakers? Online resources about wattage and resistance left me confused. I have a background in science, so if someone could point me in the right direction, then I can figure this out myself. I’d love to avoid a blow-out. :|

* Since this is my first ever home theater, is there anything else I should know or that I’m forgetting to buy? 

Lastly, I’m pretty excited about all of this and thank you in advance, Reddit, for giving me your advice!

The back wall is matte white and totally blank and I have plenty of room to fit a projector on the opposite side on the top of either a bookshelf or a shorter shelf.  I plan on watching from short chairs.

The projector will be used for two purposes: Super Smash Bros Melee on Nintendo Gamecube and 1080P video from a PC by a 50ft HDMI 1.3 cable I already have (ordered a while ago with the intention of being able to play Netflix from another room- the ethernet at our building is mediocre and awfully placed).

I already have speakers, 2x M-Audio BX5A and 1x SBX10 sourced through the Computer --&gt; USB --&gt; NuForce μDac 2.  I only need the good sound for the computer stuff, having awful sound on the Gamecube is probably preferred, we're all used to using a 24'' CRT TV from the 90's.

So... the question is, what is the sense like on the following two projectors?

___

My wife and I are searching for a new home and think we have found the one: we're both thrilled about the fact that an extra bedroom may serve well as a dedicated home theater.  I told her to give me the price and that I would design and build the theater around that, and she came back with a loose budget of $6000.

With that in mind, here are the products that I had in mind.  Admittedly, a lot of this is influenced by analyses from [The Wirecutter](http://www.thewirecutter.com).

...As you can see, I've already gone over my budget a bit.  Oops.  My wife probably won't mind, as she is very anxious to have a top-notch theater for us to watch movies and for her to explore Albion and Tamriel (and for me to kill super mutants and build sentries).

Seating, by the way, is fortunately NOT part of this budget; we have already put money aside to get the [Lovesac Movie Lounger](http://www.lovesac.com/sactionals/sactionals-movie-lounger-w-chocolate-rhinoplush-covers.html), which has the awesome ability to either be a comfy two-seater for us or split into something more accommodating for company.

The room is not particularly large; it's approximately 10' by 14.5' (the last two feet being closet space, suitable for placing the projector and other equipment but potentially removable if necessary).  Obviously we would be positioning it lengthwise, and the back of the sectional would be about 8.5'-9' from the wall (meaning that if I do the fixed frame in front of the speaker, we'll probably be 7.5'-8' from the image).  I threw together a quick idea of how it all could fit [here](http://imgur.com/0DndW9n).

___

* From what I've read, the Epson 5020UB is insanely bright which is ideal for ambient light, which this room won't have, so perhaps I can go a step down there to the [Epson 3020](http://www.amazon.com/Epson-V11H501020-PowerLite-Theater-Projector/dp/B009EPSJXM) (I've loved our 8350 so am partial to Epson, but if there's something that's better, I'm all ears).  I would also consider doing a [Goo Systems](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/696120-REG/Goo_Systems_6371_High_Contrast_Screen_Goo.html) paint job for the screen instead, but I like the idea of having an acoustically transparent screen behind which I can place the center speaker.  And in that vein, if anyone knows of another company that can eek out even more screen space on a 120""-wide room, I'd love to know it because my wife is firmly in the ""bigger is better"" camp.
* Is the speaker system I've chosen the best bang-per-buck available?  I'd be willing to shop different speakers from various companies but I do like the sleekness of a system built to look great together (plus the package deal comes at a lower price).
* Speaking of sleekness, are there **any** good in-wall speakers that I could use as alternatives?  I'd love the idea of the room being as smooth as possible.
* Is a room of this size at all viable for a 6.1 or 7.1 setup?  If so, I would love to fit that in my budget or at least up the receiver to a 7.1-ready one (like the [Onkyo TX-NR515](http://www.amazon.com/Onkyo-TX-NR515-7-2-Channel-Network-Receiver/dp/B0077V88VI)) with plans to add another speaker or speaker pair later.
* Is there any part of this budget that's either overdone or falling short, and are there any components that I'm forgetting about and need to consider?  Is there anything that I could step down in order to boost up something else (like getting a lower-quality screen for better-quality speakers, etc)?  My wife's priority is the perfect image while I'm willing to go a bit further for the perfect audio.

A little bit about my gear.  

Im driving everything through a [Yamaha RX-V767](http://au.yamaha.com/en/products/audio-visual/av-receivers-amps/rx-v767__l/) which I picked up second hand for a great price.

The surrounds, center and sub are from the Wharfedale DX-1 speaker system.  For whatever reason Wharfedale speakers are pretty easy to come by in NZ.  I read this [review](http://www.hometheater.com/content/wharfedale-dx-1-hcp-speaker-system) which convinced me to keep an eye out for a sale.  I picked them up at a fantastic price after waiting a couple of months.  NZ$580

I then kept my eyes peeled for either the 9.1 or the 10.1 Wharfedale bookshelf speakers, and picked up the 9.1s a month of so later.  Again I liked what I [read](http://www.stereophile.com/budgetcomponents/1105wharfedale) about them.  NZ$250
As its a family room and we have got two toddlers sleeping nearby Im not exactly rattling my rib cage with low end, but its the clarity and detail that I am really enjoying at this stage.  When the little ones grow up I will be adding a bigger sub! 

Im thrilled with the [BenQW1070](http://www.projectorreviews.com/benq/w1070/) projector, it deserves the hype.  I am close friends with the NZ supplier for BenQ products and so got it for a great price.  Im projecting on to a 120"" screen with 1.3 gain.  NZ$1000 for projector and NZ$170 for screen

Quick question - is it possible to control XBMC on a Raspberry Pi - or any other device for that matter that supports CEC - directly with the control of the Onkyo remote?

My TV doesn't support CEC (it's a ""non-Smart"" 55"" Samsung TV - hence the Raspberry), but I think that shouldn't be an issue, since the Onkyo does - and this one would be the one to control the Raspberry (and simply passes on the video to the TV).

I activated ""HDMI Control(RIHD)"" on the Onkyo, I also shortly got the message ""RIHD on"" and ""raspberry"" on the TV - but no control is possible.

I did understand that correctly, and it *should* work - right? Any hints? :) Thanks!

Also: here's my setup so far for clarification: http://imgur.com/zl3C7fr

---
PROGRESS!

---
And: SUCCESS!
---
A guy named sneftel on the libcec forum said that he had similar problems on a different device - ""Make XBMC the active source when starting"" should be the culprit, but I disabled pretty much every option, and set the HDMI device to ""5"" and ""AVR"" - needs to be defaulted first to be shown.
Reenabling libCEC or restarting XBMC then showed that it works perfectly. :)

So in short:

- Get XBMC with libCEC enabled (I use a normal raspbian install with precompiled XBMC, but any other recent distro should work)

- Configure your remote to send CEC commands (for my Onkyo, any of the codes 32910/33101/33501/31612 work)
- Get a well written keymaps/remote.xml mapping file, I found one on the forums via google (lost the source) - there's one on the Wiki aswell

- Configure XBMC to use the AVR device and disable every option

- Restart XBMC

- (Hopefully) you've succeeded. Only one remote to control them all. Hooray!


If you're unsure whether libCEC does work or not, use the cec-client and hammer the buttons on the remote - if that works, it's most likely something within XBMC or a bug in libCEC (which should I avoided by disabling the more ""special"" options).

1354136544.0,9,self.hometheater,13ycga,Best streaming devices?,bro_b1_kenobi,11,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/13ycga/best_streaming_devices/,"Hey everyone. I am almost done adding the final touches to my new home theater. The last items are a decent turn table (which I already know which model I want), and a good solution for over-the-air HD. Lastly I'm trying to find the best streaming solution for my now bedroom TV unit.

So for the over-the-air HD I looked into what kind of antenna I wanted to get. The search wasn't too hard since I live within a 5 mile radius of my city's broadcast towers (literally I can see them from my house). So I'm gonna keep it simple with an indoor omnidirectional antenna like [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Paper-Thin-Leaf-Indoor-Antenna/dp/B004QK7HI8/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354135409&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords=HD+antenna). 

As I was looking for a new streaming device, I stumped upon Boxee's new [Boxee TV](http://www.boxee.tv/#/features). It seems like a good deal for $9.99/mo to have a DVR service if I choose with some apps my Xbox/PS3 don't have (mainly Pandora). I realize I can get a HDHomeRunner box for $89 and not have to pay for a service so that's my main concern. 

Either pay a monthly fee for DVR with a turn-key box or setup my own recording software on my media server. My main interest in the turn-key Boxee is that I get those few apps I dont have on Xbox/PS3 and I'm pretty sure it will handle the audio processing of over-the-air HD for me, which my Ubuntu box doesn't really do very well. That being said, I'm considering upgrading the media server to Windows for better 5.1 support (from what I've researched open source OS's [Linux] don't support DTS Master HD and Dolby Digital TrueHD). The only downside is the monthly fee; I almost pride myself on not relying on digital cable/satellite by having HuluPlus and Netflix. Although adding another $9.99 on top of those and my Xbox live costs would flirt with lower-end DVR services from Comcast/DirectTV, etc.

Now for my bedroom TV I already have an extra BD player in there so movie access isn't much of an issue. I originally was thinking about getting a Roku XS 1080p box but then I noticed it doesn't support UPnP servers (which is the protocol my media server uses to push movies/music). While it has a crap ton of apps, is nice and user friendly, another PS3 or Boxee would integrate with my media server. It's a tough call because A) another PS3 would give me access to my media server AND be another video game console. B) If I decided to get 2 Boxee TVs I could just wire up a 2nd to pull all the DVR content easily from my bedroom box and have all the nice apps. I'm less inclined to add a 2nd Boxee because it lacks HBO Go, a perfect app for bedroom enjoyment (which the PS3/Xbox/Roku have). Furthermore if I went with the HDHomeRunner option as my main DVR device, I could convert the files to a format the PS3 would read easily.

So what's the best solution for me?

1) Boxee TV DVR + Boxee TV (no DVR service)(Bedoom TV) - $198 + $9.99/mo

 * +Optimized audio processing

 * +Turn-key ease

 * +DVR support for bedroom TV

 * -$9.99/mo fee

 * -Not as many apps as Roku

2) Boxee TV DVR + Roku XS - $198 + $9.99/mo

 * +Optimized audio processing

 * +Turn-key ease

 * -$9.99/mo fee

 * -no DVR support for bedroom TV

3) Boxee TV DVR + PS3 - $359 + $9.99/mo

 * +Extra video game console

 * +Optimized audio processing

 * +Turn-key ease

 * -$9.99/mo fee

 * -no DVR support for bedroom TV

4) HDHomeRunner + Boxee TV (no DVR service)(bedroom TV) - $187

 * +DVR support for bedroom TV (via UPnP)

I'm the ""tech guy"" in the family but know very little about home theater equipment. I hope that you guys can point me in the right direction. Here's what I'm trying to do...

We will have a single TV in the living room (no other TVs in the house) that will have, at the least, a Blu-Ray player (maybe a sat player but undecided for now). Most of the people in my family don't really watch TV and are more interested in just listening to music in various zones of the house. We're also not audiophiles so sound quality is not a priority here. The TV is more to appeal to renters.

We plan on renting the house out multiple times per year so ease-of-use is also essential. My family is currently working with some contractors who proposed [this setup](http://i.imgur.com/XmF9c.jpg). I was hoping that you guys could take a quick look at their proposal then read what we're trying to do so we can determine if that's a good option (or, preferably, if there is one that's less expensive or easier to use).

**Planned Setup:**

* Single TV
* 6 sets of speakers in 4 zones
* 3 of 4 zones will have volume controlled by wall knob

**Desired Features:**

* Control from simple universal remote (preferably something that can be run on an iOS device. 
* Guests can easily stream their own music (video?) without having to upload anything to a HDD. 
* Maybe Apple AirPlay can meet this goal?

**Need advice on:**

* What brand/type of receiver would be best? I've read that the Pioneer VSX-822-K and/or Yamaha RXA 2000 have good iOS integration. Again, really just looking for something that will integrate with everything easily. 
* Are the speakers recommended by the installers ok?
* What else do we need to make this work?

Happy to answer more questions as I'm sure that I'm leaving something out. I've also read a bit about Control4 and really like the system but can't find price information.

Thanks in advance!

After a lot of combing the Internet and coming up empty, I came up with this.  My living room isn't very large and the mounting options in one place (shown in the images) were slim.  There doesn't seem to be very many good brackets for mounting speakers in corners.

My surround speakers are about 12lbs each; Klipsch RB51s.  I needed something beefy to mount them to.  I picked them up cheap from a neighbor who had a 5 speaker set stored in their original boxes before he could get them posted on E-bay.

I cut a 45 degree strip out of a 4x4 using a table saw.  (large piece of wood so that my fingers could stay clear of the blade)  I then cut up this large strip with a miter saw so that each smaller strip has 45 degree bevels on each end.  I screwed the strips into the corner studs using some large and long screws, being careful to stay clear of where I needed to mount the speaker mounts.  I filled in with spackling where I needed to (love the pink stuff from Dap) and lightly sanded the area.  I textured the strips using the spray-can type texture.  (easy as spray painting something)  My wife painted the installed strips and walls as necessary.  I screwed the speaker mounts into the strips.  I purposely have the speaker mounts off-center a bit so that I can maximize speaker clearance from the back wall as my speakers are large for the space.  These are the OmniMount speaker mounts rated for 20 lbs.

The ceiling in my living room is raised up into the attic space.  It angles at the walls and then heads up to a horizontal.  It was easier for me to get the cables up into the attic by simply cutting into the angled portion of the ceiling behind the speakers.  I did cut the holes as close to the corners as possible to keep them behind the speakers.  I cut the holes using a series of smaller holes until I was sure that the holes I needed were not obstructed by studs and such.  I used metal brackets for the holes (not pictured) so that I could get the holes as far into the corners as possible. (not possible with the plastic brackets I've seen)  The covers are simply coax outlet covers with the coax connectors removed.  I think these look cleaner than using covers with two connectors typically used for speakers

Running the cable for the speaker shown was a snap.  The other one is in a corner location for the roof and was a nightmare, but I finally got the cable fished.

The mounting strips aren't noticeable at all.  You have to get very close and look behind the speakers to see them.

As the title says, I'm currently in the market to begin building up a (hopefully) semi-respectable home theater system. I'd like to begin with a 2.0 system and overtime build up, but as I'm fairly inexperienced at this, I've got a few questions that I'm hoping can be answered. Or maybe just a push in the right direction. =)

**Current Setup**

* I live in an apartment.
* [Proposed Floor-plan](http://i.imgur.com/ng3kmlk.jpg) 9' Ceilings. (I'll be changing it to this when I upgrade my sound system)
* Currently using [Logitech Z-5500](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16836121120)

**A/V Receiver**

Currently, I'm looking at the [Onkyo TX-NR515](http://www.amazon.com/Onkyo-TX-NR515-7-2-Channel-Network-Receiver/dp/B0077V88VI/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=UQ6EEKC0N8HO&amp;coliid=IQN8AX0RBM95). However, I don't actually need that many HDMI ports, nor do I need the second HDMI out. But, I do want to keep at least 7.1 with 7.2 being a fun bonus for future additions when I move out of my apartment.

**Tower Speakers**

I poked around [Bestcovery](http://www.bestcovery.com/) for some tower speakers, and currently have my eye on [JBL L890](http://www.amazon.com/JBL-Performance-8-inch-Floorstanding-Loudspeaker/dp/B000G67Q00/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=UQ6EEKC0N8HO&amp;coliid=IUBKS4OSXP0ZC). I figure tower speakers would be better for my current setup because I live in an apartment and probably wouldn't be able to properly utilize a subwoofer and I'd like something powerful enough to help make up for the fact that I won't have a center. However, I'm not necessarily opposed to the idea of two bookshelf speakers and a small (8-10"") subwoofer if it would be better for a future setup.

**Wrapping Up**

I'd like to stick to roughly this price range or less if possible, and I'd honestly prefer a little less, but if the value of these are going to be the best for current and future setups then I'm more than willing to spend the money now for quality equipment. So with that in mind, here would be my main questions.

* Decent mid-level entry for building up to a 7.1 setup?
* Would I be better going with a 2.1 system using two bookshelves/sub instead of the two towers?
* Recommendations on-par/better/slightly less but less pricey for my current equipment picks?
* For when I do upgrade, will there be issues finding a center for the towers?
* Can I cannibalize the satellite speakers from the Logitech setup for surround sound without issue while I work towards a fuller setup?

My setup is a NAD PE 2200 amp that feeds the Energy Reference Connoisseur RC-70, the amp is hooked to a decent Pioneer receiver. I would hook the Center channel the another NAD PE 2200.

Or should I wait until my budget increases to match/surpass these stats? The stats on the Technics receiver are quite nice (nicer than many receivers that I've seen in the below $300 price range):

* 5.1 Channels
* 600Watts (120Watt per channel)
* 8 Ohms
* Total Harmonic Distortion: 0.05% (no I didn't mean 0.5%, it is indeed rated at 0.05%)

The speakers hooked up to the receiver (via 14 gauge ""in wall"" style cable) are:

* [Pioneer SP-FS51-LR](http://www.amazon.com/Pioneer-SP-FS51-LR-Floorstanding-Loudspeakers-Black/dp/B004H1M4NO/) (Floorstanding Front L/R)

The equipment I have hooked up to the receiver includes:

* PS3 (Blu Ray Player/Game System/NetFlix)
* [Ion TTUSB Turntable](http://www.amazon.com/Ion-TTUSB-Turntable-USB-Record/dp/B000BUEMOO) (Turntable)

* I also have a Satellite receiver, but I don't really watch it, so I'll ignore that.

I really do enjoy listening to my turntable, but it seems that many receivers are no longer including a Phono input. Is this a problem?

So I've long been thinking about the best entertainment setup for my needs and today I finally sat down and drew a [diagram](http://i.imgur.com/g4n9w.png) of what I want to, progressively, build within the next couple of years.
 

I want to ask if this'll work and if there are any amateur mistakes i'm not seeing right off the bat.
Anyone have anything similar already built? Any blogs which provide detail or tips on changes?
 
As i'm a poor uni student I can't afford this all in one go, so i'll be starting the server on an old laptop, within my home network, but investing in a good router to wirelessly transcode HD movies. I already have decent stereo speakers and a nice 23"" IPS screen. I've saved up to build a really good PC (in this case the GPU needs HDMI out and soundcard needs optical out) which will fill the role of the Apple TV and a 5.1 sound setup will also do for now.
 
**I'm mostly concerned about:**

* Getting the best possible audio quality from my PC without disturbances from the PSU. I think a DAC will be needed, how will this connect with respect to HDMI drawn in the picture? 
* How I will be able to access the NAS when on the move?
* If my PC can connect to two different sets of speakers.
* If I can download/seed torrents directly from the NAS via my PC.
 
Compatibility comes before anything. I want it to work on Windows, iOS, Android, Linux.
Quality comes next. Lots of ugly wires aren't gonna be a problem. I'll work my way through that.

Doesn't necessarily have to be an Apple TV or Synology NAS. Just chose what was most priceworthy and compatible. For now the whole thing should be kept below $1800.

There was some other stuff to deal with first like removing carpet and old floor but now that that is done and I'm about to put the new floor in I want to start setting things up for the A/V.

So I need some help and advice on how to set up, what to setup, what to buy and all that good stuff. 

- [Here is a really bad drawing of what the room looks like.](http://i.imgur.com/wQg7M.png)

- The plan is to have 3 Large screens mounted on the wall [Possibly these guys](http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2380276) hooked up to my computers dual GTX 680's

- [Here you can sorta see the speakers I currently have](http://i.imgur.com/Q5UWQh.jpg) These were given to me by a friend and are part of two different systems. I don't think any of these are mean to be a subwoofer though so I may have to buy one of those.

- TV's would be on the 11 foot wall, so would the audio receiver and the gaming consoles.

- PC would be next to the chair near the 13 foot wall.

- A friend suggested I use these [Front](http://i.imgur.com/Gr4S9.jpg)/[Back](http://i.imgur.com/Gr4S9.jpg)  and run the cables through the wall or at least along the base of the wall since the floors are currently ripped up and there is open space.

- I've bought 100 ft of AWG 14 Copper wire, though I have a feeling I may need more than that but I don't know yet.

Now that the background stuff is out of the way here's the questions.

1) I need a suggestion on a good home theater receiver that will accept at least 3 Inputs (Xbox, PS3 and PC) as well as a suggestion for which type of inputs to use, (Optical or HDMI) considering the fact that the PC will be at least 9 feet away from the receiver.

2) Should I go 5.1 or 7.1?

3) For the PC input should I pass that through the wall as well? (which would likely make it closer to 20-25ft if I do that.

4) Should I even bother with in call cabling? The advantage I see is it would be cleaner since you wouldn't see the cables.

5) The back of that plate I linked has what seems like coax screw grooves and it also has a regular screw, are there Coax connectors you can buy that would fit AWG 14 cables or is it better to just stick the copper wired straight into the hole and tighten it with the side screw?

6) WTF is up with the connector for the woofer, it looks like an actual coax connector in the back unlike the rest of the cables.

* Be viewable from multiple angles (one of my couches can get a pretty large angle to the screen)

1376521520.0,8,self.hometheater,1kdrms,I have a question about using dual subs with a 7.1 system.,walkinthecow,10,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/1kdrms/i_have_a_question_about_using_dual_subs_with_a_71/,"I have a 7.1 system with RCA out for a sub. The first sub I bought was the Monoprice 12"" 150W. It was so-so, not loud at all, really. I wasn't expecting a lot for 120 bucks, I had planned on only using it until I could get something better. Next I bought the BIC F12 which I understand isn't much better, but the deal was too good to pass up. 

I basically understand that the wattage measurements are sketchy at best, and that wattage ≠ loudness. Both subs are 150 Watt, but the MP peak is a mere 200, while the BIC's peak is 475. The BIC blows the monoprice away, much louder. The MP sub has RCA in and out, the BIC only in. 

So I decided try them out together, to my dismay, the BIC sub alone sounds better and louder/harder than the two together. I know that I am splitting the signal, but I thought that since both subs have their own amps, it wouldn't be so drastic - like when you switch rear speakers on with a quadrophonic system.

The question finally is this: I can get another BIC 12 at a great price. Am I likely to run into the same issue as with the MP, or was it just because the MP was so much less powerful? I don't want to buy the BIC and return it, shipping is ridiculous. I know that one solution is to save my money and by a good sub, but I want satisfaction now! Dammit!

The main features we want are good clarity when there's high motion (for sports) and probably some nice build in Smart TV features so we can watch Netflix, etc without having to hook up extra inputs. This would be used primarily for sports watching, then movies / TV shows, and lastly for gaming.

So what I'm currently looking at is Samsung LED's in the 65"" range (not set on Samsung, though I do like the brand), however, I'm trying to decide between going on the cheap end (F6300 ish) or dropping a ton of coin and going on the high end (F7100/8000). **Is the high end worth the extra money?** Also, I'm a bit apprehensive spending for the highest end if it means that when I move out into my own place in 3-5 years, I'll be way behind= on tech. **Is this a legitimate concern I have, or will the high end TVs be considered ""good"" for 10+ years?**

It did come with two remotes though and the previous owner told me that everything can be done from the remote so the front panel isn't necessary. The display on the front still works.

I ended up paying $150 for it. Is that as good of a deal as it sounds? Was I right to buy this older mid-to-high end receiver instead of a newer low-end receiver?

Here is a rough diagram of the [House](http://i.imgur.com/dRz0Lor.jpg). The main ""Theater"" would be in the living room area and a smaller setup in the den. The living room has a large bay window as well.

Here is what I have so far:

* 2 x Older 32"" LCD ( Sharp &amp; Store Brand)


I would like to try and keep cost down but keep quality of components still pretty good.

I would like to use the Denon receiver and Polk speakers in the living room with some kind of projector (I have been looking at the [BenQ W1080ST](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B11C6HW)). The only thing about a projector is the need for a screen. Currently the walls in the room are a textured red paint and the SO wouldnt be to happy with a permanent (~100"" im guessing) screen or screen paint on the wall. So that is something I need to figure out. 

The other areas with screens would be the Den, Kitchen, and Master BR and potentially the other larger bedroom. Each would be simple with maybe a 2.1 system in the Den.

I would also like to add in the near future a whole home audio that can ingrate existing components and be controlled via smartphone/tablet (android preferably). Any suggestions?

I am also considering doing some home automation using Zwave and a [Mi Casa Vera Lite](http://www.amazon.com/Mi-Casa-Verde-VeraLite-Controller/dp/B007005364/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1369923432&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=mi+casa+verde+vera+lite). Any way I can tie this into the AV?

I will definitely be wiring each area with 2x cat6 and at least 1 coax, and may do some in ceiling speakers depending on the whole home system. The house was built in the 60's and has a crawl space and attic. And will probably be running most things in the attic just because of easier access.

There is also a 32x32 detached garage that I'll have my various projects in that I would want some sort of networked audio to some sort of 2.1 or stereo system.

It is acoustically transparent and I have my center channel and my 2 front sides wired to go behind the screen (sorry, I dont have room to place them wider). It is greyish (0.8 gain) so it should be good as I can control the light in my basement.

I plan on buying an 8350, probably just from Epson.ca as I can't find a better price than $1200 in Canada. If anyone knows a cheaper place, feel free to chime in..

Does anyone have thoughts on that screen? I don't want to spend much more than that and I need acoustically transparent.

Im not sure whether this is the right move or not but here is my thinking so far

Pros to buying Benq: 
- I'd get a larger image from the distance my projector is mounted (from 100inch to 120)  bigger is better!!!
- Its DLP not LCD (not too sure if this is an advantage?  From what ive read its a slightly sharper image and handles movement better)
- Longer lamp life, from 2000 hours to around 6000
- 3D (im really into the idea of watching 3d at home)

Cons
- The benq weighs 3 kg, the pany 13kg... what the jiggers are benq chopping from its projector to make it so light?  Concerns me
- I'd loose 800 lumens (but to be honest I am using the pany on a setting that is only using a third of the lumens at the most so not too concerned about this
- There is a bit of faffing around as id have to buy a new bluray player and run some hdmi 1.4 cables to my projector

Problem is I earn jack squat, have a wife and two kids and this stuff isn't cheap. So I eventually save up, sell some stuff and buy a second hand pt-ar700 for NZ$700. I stick it on a bookshelf in the middle of the living room when I first get it before I ceiling mounted it. 
So my sister comes round to visit my wife while I'm out. Leans back on her chair. Knocks the bookshelf and the projector falls back, lands on the power cable bending the whole back section of the projector where all the inputs etc are. I come home 5 minutes after this happen and they both look like someone has died, they know how much this thing means to me. Anyway, what can you do, I'm cool about it. 
I turn it on expecting the worse but it's still working! Stoked! 
Fast forward two years (and many happy hours of movies, gaming etc) and the bulb blows - a thousand hours early.  Gutted. A couple of hours before it happens ive been talking to my trying to my wife planting the idea of upgrading. I was thinking we could sell the pj, I could save up and maybe get a pj that's full 1080p. 
There's that plan down the drainwith the bulb blown. So I purchase a new bulb, and it starts flickering like mental from the begining. I'm gutted, what's going on here. I contact the dude that sold me the bulb - he suspects a dodgy power supply issue but installs a second bulb for free just in case it's a faulty bulb.  That bulb blows within two minutes. Bugger. 
The dude looks at the bulbs and is convinced it's a power supply issue. I open up the pj and can see how munted the power socket is, I have an electrician check the power supply from the wall and that's perfect. The pj is stuffed. 

So now I've got no pj, only $100 in my savings and staring down the barrel of a long savings mission, probably a year without a pj. 
(Also here in New Zealand prices for projectors are insanely expensive. That Epsom 8350 of yours - that will be NZ$3500 please. That's US$2900) 

Anyway I'm lying there at night and think, I should give the hundy dollars to the bulb guy, his bulbs weren't the problem and he gave me the second one free.  Part of me doesn't want to, but I know it's the right thing to do.  So I email him in the morning, say I want to give him the coin.  He replies, and in his email suggests i contact my insurance and see if the pj is covered because of the knock it took from sister... I had never even thought about that as an option... Hope enters my soul.
I ring up the insurance company, tell them the whole story leaving nothing out - and they accept my claim over the phone! I can't believe it. 
I nervously wait to see what they all replace it with, expecting something pretty average... They come back and ask if I would be happy with a PT-AR100. Yeah!!! Full 1080p, light canon of goodness. Retails here for NZ$3700. You bet I'd be happy (obviously I try and act cool to them!)

I install it, but you wouldn't believe it, the thing is flickering away.  What the?! I work through my whole system trying to find the gremlin. Everything - I posted on this sub reddit, the avs forum. I'm losing my mind, I spend hours trying everything, cables, settings, power supply, sources. I resort to getting a professional home theater expert to have a look whose a friend of mine. He reckons the projector is faulty. When will this end!!!
It gets sent back to panny, i nervously wait stressing the projector is fime and there is something wrong with my gear. but they acknowledge its a processor issue in the pj and send me a new one. 
Install that 
You little beauty. Works perfectly, loving it. 
The picture is amazing. The detail blows me away. It's the projector of my friggin dreams. 

The end. (I hope!) 

Tldr: projector dramas - one knock to the floor, two bulbs and three projectors later I'm loving life with a signifcant upgrade thanks to insurance.

Most TVs operate at 60 hertz, which as I understand it translates to 60 screen refreshes per second. That should be capable of displaying the 48 frames per second of The Hobbit, right? But a friend of mine claims you'd need a 120 hertz TV for some reason. Is he right? Does interlaced vs. progressive come into play here?

Beyond what the TV is capable of, what sources are capable of providing the 48 fps? DVD? Blu ray? Netflix, or other internet streaming sources? Cable (as in Comcast)?

And if you DO need special hardware, then why is 48 fps colloquially called ""the soap opera effect,"" and compared to home video? Because isn't the implication there that you've experienced this effect while watching terrible soap operas or home movies? And in that case, standard TVs and such were used to experience it.... right?

So maybe after all that, is the answer simply that most existing hardware will be capable of displaying The Hobbit in 48 fps?

Note that, as it stands, I'm thinking of an LED in the 50"" range.

1) I have always thought (for no reason in particular, I realize now that I try to explain why) that plasma TVs were the crappier alternative to LCD/LED.  Can someone explain to me why you would pick a plasma over the alternatives?


2) It is my understanding that the *only* difference between 60 and 120hz is that stuff at 24fps is displayed ""better"" at 120.  What, exactly, is displayed at 24 fps?  It's not games, I don't think.  DVDs?  Regular TV?  When would I come across something at 24 fps?  When this stuff is displayed ""better,"" does that just mean it has that bullscrap super-smooth look to it?  Because I couldn't give a crap about that and would thus have no reason to spend more for 120hz, right?  TV's that run at 60hz don't have this ""super smooth"" feature, correct?


3) Some HDTVs I have come across when gaming have a lag between the button press and the action on screen.  I'm assuming this is some sort of bullshit ""filter"" applied to the image that slows it down.  Virtually every HDTV has an option somewhere to turn that shit off, right?  I would assume so, but I've never been able to fix the problem on my parents' TV.


4) 1080p is the best resolution out there, right?  But what's displayed at 1080p?  From what I gather, it's just blu rays.  Gaming, TV, everything else - that's just at 720 or 1080i, right?  In other words: The only reason I would care about 1080p is if I had a blu ray player?


5) Some TVs have a ""gaming mode."" What is this?


6) Based on some charts I've seen online, I should (given the distance I'll be from the TV) get a TV in the mid-high 40"" range.  But, come on, 50 isn't *that* much more expensive.  Am I going to regret it if I get a TV that's bigger than is recommended?  Mikethespike will have finally arrived the day he has a 50"" TV in his living room.


7) At the end of the day, what's the best TV to play console games on?

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/ytg0F.jpg)
I've noticed a near complete lack of ""Reviews"" for this TV, likely due to the relatively huge number of possible TV models to choose from and this TV's price point/intended use.

It was this deficit of information that leads us to this, albeit small, contribution to /r/hometheater

This 32'' HDTV is from Samsung's 5000 series of TV.
It features LED ""Full array"" back-lighting (less LEDs than higher end models) and it is unknown if these have local-dimming capability.
These TVs have various panel technologies, S-PVA being the ""Best"" and also the type manufactured by Samsung. Using the service mode one is able to identify the type used in each TV. 
Type:
A:Samsung
H:Sharp
P:CMI (chimei)
R:AUO (au optronics)

My TV is a TS01 model with a Samsung (A -type) S-PVA.
(I was able to verify this in-store at my local Best Buy on an Open-Box model).

After running a preliminary calibration:
Mode: Standard
Backlight: 12
Contrast: 100
Brightness: 35
Sharpness: 50
Color, Tint all set to neutral 50
HDMI-&gt;HDMI input set to ""PC""

This model supports 4:4:4 chroma sub-sampling (very important for use as a monitor).

Initial Thoughts: 
These are the best Black levels I've ever seen on a non-plasma set. Compared to my S-IPS U2412m I like this better for gaming/movie/media. Text IS sharper on my Dell but this is due, in large part to dot pitch and the added resolution.

I am very satisfied with the week I've used this Samsung. 
I picked up the television for $299 after I had them adjust prices for the recent $350 pricepoint set by Amazon/Sears et al.


Cons would be lack of inputs (2 HDMI and 1 Composite/Component)
Cost ($549 MSRP)
Inconsistencies in panel technology (Panel Lottery) with various ""inferior"" technologies.

This panel lottery makes online purchases (And returns) much more YMMV and makes recommending it for purchase a hard-sell. I would say, wait for a sale and find a local merchant that will price-match. Purchase a TV, verify the TV is the panel you want and devoid of dead or stuck pixels or defects. I know for a fact that both Sears and Best Buy both carry AND adjust prices to reflect sales honored from other vendors. These would be my ""go to"" sources to find a EH5000.

I would highly recommend this TV to anyone looking for a ""large"" format TV monitor for gaming/media usage and proper displayed text capabilities.

There are TV's that would also work (namely cheaper Westinghouse, LG CS560 series, Sony EX500) but for a price/performance ratio, this is by and large the best choice.

I've been meaning to replace it for quite some time now... but have never gotten around to it.  Over the weekend I finally decided to hook it up to both my PC and my cable box.  It's only inputs are RCA.

Here's the thing.  If I have them both plugged in, whichever channel I hook my PC into the receiver via 1/4"" to RCA, suddenly the PC channel gets this this awful but quiet buzz.

If I unplug the RCA cables from the cable box, the buzz on the PC channel goes completely away.

If just the cable box audio is plugged in, the buzz goes away.

If I leave both sets of audio cables plugged in but, unplug the computer from the surge protector, the buzz goes away.

There is a second monitor on my desk near the receiver, connected via hdmi-dvi to the PC.  Typically I don't have this monitor plugged in.  On a whim I decided to leave my PC unplugged from the power strip and see what happened if just the monitor was plugged in to the power source.  It uses the same style of cord that you use to plug in a PSU for a PC. *This is the one that hurts my head*

So here's my question, what's to blame?  I'd like to say the comcast box or the RCA cables I'm using with it.  I'd say it was the computer, but how the hell do you explain the fact that it still buzzes when the 2nd monitor is plugged in, and the tower remains completely unplugged from any power?

Obviously the easiest solution here is a new receiver that actually has digital audio capability... but I can't justify purchasing one for quite some time.  Anyone have an extra receiver with a couple of HDMI ports they'd be willing to part with for $50?

Obviously the solution here is to just buy a new receiver and go completely HDMI and my life will be so much easier.

The TV goes pretty much wall-to-wall where it's mounted, so mounting speakers on that wall means everything is either above or (more likely) below the screen.  Not ideal, imo, as it puts either the speakers or TV too high for my taste.  It's also a pretty narrow soundstage - I'd go 4.1 with a phantom center if I put the speakers on the same wall as the TV.

Couch2 will be overwhelmed with the left front speaker, though this isn't a huge concern, as I will always be in the sweet spot.

First off, let me say that I LOVE my current setup! However, I am somewhat disappointed by the PSW10 sub.

In addition to this, when something with a lot of mid-range bass hits hard with the volume turned up, it almost sounds like the sub is ""capping out"" - it makes a knocking noise like it's just physically unable to produce that much mid-range bass. It's hard to explain.

When I hooked everything up including my Motorola HD DVR from Time Warner Cable with HDMI and Optical audio cable, everything sounded great, until I switched input to my RCA ins on my XBox 360 and Wii.  Now when using those devices I get a what I googled to be a ""ground loop hum"".

After doing some online searching for troubleshooting, I went and unplugged each source and speakers one at a time.  I even unplugged just the optical cable and it still hummed.  But when I unplugged the HDMI cable from the back of the cable box itself, the hum miraculously stopped.

Before I go off buying stuff and wasting time, gas, and money if it doesn't work, I thought I would ask here first for any suggestions.  I found a device that removes the ground loop hum by putting some coaxial connection device between the DVR and the cable tv cable coming out of the wall, but apparently it messes up digital TV and HD signals.

Since the optical cable wasn't the issue, wouldn't using RCA cables from the DVR cause the same problem?  How do I remove the ground loop humming with HDMI going into the receiver without a degradation in TV signal quality?  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I may be buying a computer later on in the year so i would also like to pick the one that would work as a computer hookup as well.

**1.** [The Vizio](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CHKPYPW/ref=s9_simh_gw_p23_d0_i2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-3&amp;pf_rd_r=1W17F0KQ8JVZ0E8QVG8G&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=470938811&amp;pf_rd_i=507846)


My roommates all have Vizios and from what i can tell the M series is a step in the right direction from the mid level recognition that Vizio has held previously. It s passive 3D which i really don't have any idea what the difference is from active. It is also the cheaper of the two.

**2.** [The Panasonic](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AVRJK4Y/ref=s9_simh_gw_p23_d0_i3?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-4&amp;pf_rd_r=1W17F0KQ8JVZ0E8QVG8G&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=470939031&amp;pf_rd_i=507846)

This Panasonic looked really good at Best Buy and has also gotten pretty good reviews. [CNET](http://reviews.cnet.com/flat-panel-tvs/panasonic-tc-p55st60/4505-6482_7-35567256.html) seems to go on and on about how good this TV.

I haven't really noticed it on my ['09 Viera](http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Series-TC-P50X1-50-Inch-Plasma/dp/B001SN7QUU) so i really don't know if that would even affect me. It is also more expensive and has active 3D (no idea really on benefits/downsides).




So all in all i really am not set in stone on these two TVs, if you know of a TV that is under $1500 and over 55 inches i would love to hear about them.

My good friend just moved in with us and brought his very nice record player. However, there's no room to make it readily accessible in the theater.

Anyone have any experience with this sort of thing? I've done some browsing on Amazon and Newegg but everything I'm seeing is intended to be used on-the-go with an iPod, meaning that it has a rechargeable battery instead of a regular power cable.

I bought my house a year ago and I am in need to upgrade my home theater. My current system consists of:

Bose Companion 3 Speakers - For music

Bose Cinemate Speakers - For TV

Samsung UN46EH6030 46"" TV

Xbox 360, Comcast box, Wii

I got both of the Bose systems for free and I am sick of them. (you know what they say about Bose - No highs and lows? Must be Bose!) 

So what I am thinking is, Mount the Samsung TV - There's already a plug and hole for that.

I have a receiver - Yamaha RX-V661 7.1 channel 90W X 7 channels. (Got it for free!)

All I need is speakers. The room is 15' X 15' but including the part where you go up the stairs it's 15' X 27'. (Look at the pictures) With carpet floors with cement under and drywall. I would be using the system for Games, Music, Tv, and Movies. I would like it to be able to turn the bass up and really shake the room for music. 

I would like the system to be under $800 for a 5.1 system.

I was thinking this setup:

Polk Audio PSW108 Subwoofer - $180

Polk Audio TSi300 Front Speakers - $340 for both

Polk Audio Blackstone™ TL2 Rear Speakers - $200 for both

Polk Audio TSi CS10 Center Speaker - $100
 
Total : $820

What do you think/recommend? Are those good speakers?

I have taken some photos of my space, and i ask for your guys assistance in how i can go about setting up this room. The room itself is very messy as construction is about to begin. The floors of the place will be entirely replaced with a dark laminate. The roof will be stripped and smoothed out with pot lights and wiring. The venting has to stay but i need a way to make it look less obtrusive(any help would be great for this). As for paint i have no idea, and same goes for the screen size. I plan on placing my two Klipsch towers on either side of the wall and would like a fixed screen setup. So the screen size i would like would try to maximize that wall real estate. 

So the questions i ask to you guys:

1. Appropriate Screen size
2. Wall Paint colour
3. Type of fixtures to make it more movie/hometheater appealing
4. Any other suggestions as to how i could make this space look as cool as possible.

Are there any other contenders out there? I'm planning to use the TV for movies and non-FPS games. I'm putting very low priority on smart features, sound, and 3D.

A few of the other TVs I was looking at:

* Panasonic ST60 - I've read that this is *the* model to beat, but the cheapest I've found for it is about $2,400 at 65'', which is a clear grand more expensive. I'm sure it's better, given the extremely positive press, but I don't know about $1,000 (70%) better...
* Vizio E series - 70'' LED at $1,600. Looks like a great deal, but the image quality on the S64 will be better, right?
* Vizio M series - 65'' LED at $1,700. PQ is supposed to be better than the E series, but I'm not sure how it stacks up against the S64.

Thoughts?

Also, although I've read enough to feel assured that burn-in won't be a problem with the plasma, I am concerned about buzzing. I live close to sea level and will be wall-mounting the TV.

I recently bought a relatively cheap Yamaha [RX-V375](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=0MJ-0022-00010) receiver and 1080p TV to tide me over until the new HDMI spec comes out and 4k falls into reasonable price ranges. I also have a really undemanding use case: powering some entry-level speakers and accepting one or two HDMI inputs and pushing it to my TV.

Anyway it was working perfectly until a couple days ago, and now I'm experiencing a strange problem. When I have my receiver set to receive input from a PC and audio first begins playing there's an audible popping crackly sort of noise from all the speakers (scaled to the volume of the receiver) and the front of the receiver flashes the ""HDMI"" logo and the little lights showing which speakers are connected drops and then comes back on. Also the phrase [""DECODER OFF""](http://faq.yamaha.com/us/en/article/audio-visual/av-receivers-amps/rx/rx-v367_black__u/4884/4196) momentarily appears. Video is unaffected however.

As an example of when the problem occurs, if I stop a movie and hit play it'll appear, but If I just pause it and resume it won't happen. If there's no sound playing and I just ding the volume control thing it'll occur, but not if music or whatever is playing already. Actually if the TV is off and I turn it on the same thing happens. It's quite strange.

I've already tried different cables, a different PC, a different outlet (just in case), different input slots on the receiver, and literally every combination of HDMI options the receiver allows me. I suppose the issue is some machine-wide HDMI controller flaking out on me.

I'm probably going to RMA the device (unfortunately I bought it from newegg so I'm sure I'll have to pay some outrageous fee) but then again, if someone somehow knows what the issue is and can confirm that it won't get worse and isn't damaging my speakers I might just live with it, since to be honest I don't really mind because it doesn't interfere with the primary function of the receiver.

I wanted to post here first so that people could give me a game plan and make sure I'm not having to repeat useless tests. 

I have individual channel sweeps, speaker pair sweeps for front and rear, a 2.1 sweep, and pink noise per channel. I figured step one is to disable all crossover settings by setting all speakers to large and setting subwoofers to lfe instead of lfe+main. Next I can play the sweeps per channel followed by the 2.1 and 2.0 sweeps,  then the all channel sweep.  This should give me measurements of each individual component in the 5.1 setup. 

Next,  I enable the crossovers and set all channels to small with sub set to lfe+main. I repeat all tests. 

Finally,  I do Audessey setup with the system. Then repeat all tests. 

Order of tests would be individual channels sweep , 2.0 fronts sweep, 2.1 fronts sweep,  2.0 rear sweep, 5.0 sweep, 5.1 sweep. 

From what I understand, doing a pink noise measurement yields only the spl levels and is not useful for measuring frequency response. 

What do you guys think? I've submitted my sweep tests too and they are floating around if you guys are interested.

* Once connected, will changing the volume on the TV affect the output volume? I have a feeling that no one is going to want to get up to change the volume, so this would be a huge con.
* Will the speakers and amp be loud enough for a 15x15 room for TV watching at a reasonable volume? I know reasonable is all relative, but the TV is not blasted.

The banner will show up two or three times (at least once during any previews, then again for the menu and then again when the feature begins). It shows up as a semi-transparent grey bar at the top of the screen, indicating that it is an HDMI signal and what the resolution is. Sticks around for 3-4 seconds each time.

I'm in the process of building a house and I'm having the electrician wire up the living room for 5.1 surround sound. I was wondering if anybody could recommend a receiver in the $300 range which meets the following requirements:

* At least three HDMI in
* Unified HDMI out
* At least 5.1 audio through standard speaker cable
* Supports 3D video
* Microphone-based Speaker Calibration
* Don't care about network or media playback features
* **Is cable of playing 2.1 audio through all five speakers and the subwoofer (preferably automatically detecting 2.1 audio and playing through all speakers)**

I've never purchased a receiver before and there are just so many to choose from. The $300 price point is fairly arbitrary and I can go in either direction in terms of price, I'm just basing that on [this 7.2 Onkyo receiver (TX-NR515)](http://www.us.onkyo.com/model.cfm?m=TX-NR515&amp;class=Receiver&amp;p=i) which I chose over its 5.1 sibling because it supports microphone-based speaker calibration.

That receiver seems fine to me, but I don't know if it supports the last item specified on my list above -- that last item is the most important to me. I remember having a 5.1 home theater in a box system where the rear speakers rarely did anything and my parents used to own a receiver which never used the rear speakers unless it received a 5.1 signal -- I want to avoid that. I don't care about having any more than five speakers or more than one subwoofer and I don't care about any network or media playback features although support for 3D video would be a plus. I don't need a receiver fit for a king -- just a decent receiver that does what I need and won't crap out after a few years (I've read some reviews about the network-enabled Onkyo receivers dying after a few years).

For what it's worth I'm planning on purchasing [these Klipsch speakers (HD600)](http://www.klipsch.com/high-definition-theater-600-home-theater-system).

1.  I went with the Denon 1312.  I am curious if it is really worth it to go with the 1612, if I am really going to be missing out not having that one.  If I could get the 1612 for say $50-70 more should I?

2.  I know the positioning of that center Dayton B652(5 of these being used all around) isn't optimal, but until we move out of here and I can wall mount my TV it will have to work.  

3.  I'd like to build stands like these:  http://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/nwsd2/looking_for_speaker_stand_suggestions_andor/  Ive tried PM'ing that guy, as I'd like a few more pointers to get that done.  Then I can put my fronts and rears at the same height using the stands.  

4.  Also I am curious what stereo modes I should be using in combination with the DVR.  I know on the PS3 end I just leave it at PCM and I have seen DTS-HD MA while I play blu-rays.  On the DVR front, ideally, what would be the best modes to be using in 5.1?

5.  Upgrade wise I plan on adding a Dayton 10"" sub within the month between today and my birthday.  And within a few months it will be a 60"" Samsung so we can move the Vizio to the bedroom.  

All in all I am impressed with the improvements.  My only Onkyo setup wasn't terrible but HD audio is pretty damn impressive.  Already tested out Dark Knight Rises and Empire Strikes Back.

I have a Pioneer Elite Definitive home theater system.  Whenever I plug the sub in however it'll turn on but then after a few minutes it'll start this loud humming or buzzing, I'm not sure how to properly describe it.  I've tried both plugging it into the wall and into a power strip. 

 I have a real basic understanding of how the entire system works and any help would be greatly appreciated. ",,False,self,t5_2rof6,False,,,True,t3_15l7qu,http://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/15l7qu/subwoofer_humming/,

I'm looking to set up 5.1 home theatre sound in a living room with some serious limitations imposed by my wife who could not give two shits about sound quality and cares only about the aesthetics of the room.  

We've a 50"" plasma mounted in a custom recess in the wall opposite the couch in a fairly square room.  When we did our renovations we installed speaker wire in the ceiling based on some advice that I now realize wasn't very good - the setup is that we can have four ceiling speakers, two near the front, about 1' out from the TV screen and 10' or so apart, and two more near the back of the room with the same spacing, which would be almost directly above the couch, ever so slightly behind.

So my original plan was simple - two fronts, two rears, the centre somewhere around the TV and hide the sub behind the couch or under a coffee table.

The more I read about this kind of setup the more I realize that in-ceiling fronts are NOT desirable, however, as per the wife in-wall speakers are utterly out of the question.  Why is that any worse than in-ceiling, you ask?  I cannot say, but the line in the sand is drawn.  So, would directional in-ceiling speakers work here?  Opinion seems split.  To aim at listening ears would require them pointed down at pretty close to 45 degrees.

No problem to hide a sub, and I have grudging permission to put a small center speaker out in the vicinity of the TV - she considers this a MAJOR concession, just so you understand what I'm dealing with.  She's not a horrible bitch or anything - it's just that we have a very simple, clean look to the room that we went through a lot of trouble to get done so I get that she's loathe to take away from that.

Anyhoo, is there any way to do this...well, right is not the word but...acceptable maybe?  Or should I just say the hell with with it and do the cheapest two speaker + sub setup I can find because nothing else I do will sound much better?  Right now, it's TV speakers, so almost anything is an improvement, but I don't want to put in a lot of time, money and effort for something that simply cannot sound good.  I understand that the end result will necessarily be sub-optimal, but how bad are we talking?

Cost is a factor, in that if the only solution is $1000 pair of fronts then it's a non-starter.

I was looking at the Samsung es8000 but it seems to have too many unnecessary features for me. the Sony hx850 also looked nice. I was leaning towards led but I might go with a plasma. I'll mostly be using it for streaming/movies but also have an xbox360.

The closet thing I've found to a solution is a gaming headset that comes out this month (Astro's a50 wireless headset), but I've heard gaming headsets tend to be overpriced/cheaply made and that there are better options. However, I can't seem to find those better options when it comes to wireless.

Then, I moved to the newer WD TV Live, thinking ""Oh! It's newer, surely they have at least made it work with their own hard drives seamlessly!"". Well, I was wrong again. Just as bad and now I am out another $100.


So, what I want is a home media server that works. I want to be able to play music and video. I want to be able to play pretty much any format of video or audio. I want it to be arranged nicely and to show information about movies, tv shows, and music albums. I really like the look of the Popcorn Hour C-300's menus and how it automatically brings in album covers, movie covers, reviews, synopses, etc. but am not sure if I would just be throwing money down the drain again in terms of compatibility with my hard drives and future hard drives I may purchase.


Is it best to buy a media server box like that or should I build a pc that is a dedicated media server? The boxes are attractive of course due to the price and compactness. I can afford a media box right now but would not be able to fully afford a media center pc right now. How do I best do this? The only computer I have currently is just a laptop.

Let me know if I miss anything. I'll post pictures as I build my setup.

Here are the steps:

* 1: Prepare:

        Lay down all the cables needed, where they're going to run.
        Buy your cables first. Make sure you take proper measurements
        of your area beforehand. Lay down the cables loosely in the
        area you want  them to run, without attaching anything.

* 2: Mounts:

        If you're using mounts (projector, speakers, accessories) now is
        the time to put them up. Go ahead and drape what connectors
        you need for each mount with a little bit of slack to make sure
        everything will connect ok. For your speakers, if you're wall
        mounting them, make sure you place them in the proper area 
        for your soundscape.

* 3: Cable management:

        There are a lot of ways to handle cable management, and none
        are wrong. There are endless benefits to using cable
        management: it makes things look more crisp and professional,
        your partner will be more ok with you putting in a theater in
        your house, and some offer energy savings.
        Since I rent, I use cable runners attached to the floorboards, but
        if you have the time and $$$, the best solution for cable
        management is wall running with plates. I also suggest putting
        your A/V equipment in a separate area, I'll go over that later.

* 4: Blackout material:

        Most current generation projectors do pretty well with some
        ambient light, but you still want to try to get rid as much as
        possible. Luckily there is a great cheap way to do this and look
        nice. JC Penny's sells quality Energy Star rated black-out
        curtains for $25-55 in multiple colors. You get to black out ya
        place for cheap, it looks nice, and is energy efficient. It's a
        win win win. Ill link at the end.

* 5 Equipment installation:

        It's crucial at this point that you have all the wiring and cables 
        you need run into the management. Now that you have all the 
        'barebones' of your theater set up, go ahead and attach your 
        projector, speakers, and other equipment.
        For your components (BD player, Xbox, PS3 etc), I suggest 
        moving them into a different area out of site (Closets work 
        great for this). I also suggest buying an A/V rack or you can buy 
        steel-wire racks at Target if you don't want to spend too much.

Basically, with my setup, you'll walk into my living room and see just a screen, speakers, a floating record player w/ iPod dock, a remote and a keyboard. I'll also have an HDMI cord on a rip line so you can pull it out of the runner and plug in a device on the fly. All the wires will be concealed behind the paintable runners and all the equipment will be mounted or on a tray on a rackmount in my office closet.

I'd really like to do it without requiring a receiver to hook it into.  Is this even possible? (ie - can i just plug it directly into the back of my TV?)

I mainly use the TV for video games and movies, but really dont want anything big, since space is kind of at a premium.

* ~$1500 USD budget. Obviously, I want to save money where possible and only spend lots if necessary. Budget is flexible.
* At least both HDMI and Component input (the latter for old games consoles).
* I have no interest in 3D, and I don't particularly care if it is a smart TV because I have external devices for things like Netflix.

I can hear certain sound effects and occasional bits of background music, but dialogue is pretty much gone.

I would like to ask if anyone knows of a solid, yet inexpensive, option to replace it.  Sort of a ""Best bang for the buck"" sort of thing, where ""buck"" is as small as possible.  It doesn't have HDMI inputs or anything, so that's not really a requirement, but my TV and consoles use them, so if there's a cheap enough replacement that does have them, I wouldn't be upset.

1. Has wireless connectivity to stream music from our laptop or phones (iPhone AND android)   
2. Must be around $350 WITH speakers ($400 MAX)  
3. Has at least 4 HDMI inputs

To receive wireless connectivity I am aware that I have to purchase a small wireless receiver.

**My Concerns/Questions:**  
1. Is this receiver overkill? (8 HDMI seems like a lot!)  
2.  Should I spend more on the speakers?  
3. Can we watch TV without turning the receiver on?  
4. How do the different zones work?

I have read reviews on the projector and for the price, it seems nothing will really beat it. I really wanted to get peoples opinion as far as my usage and if this should really be the one to go with.

I'm pretty much going to be using this as an outdoor projector when I have friends over and maybe some indoor use (eventually).  With 2600 lumens, will this be something that I can use outdoors during the day time, or more than likely not?  I don't think that I will ever use it for that, but maybe down the road. 

Also, is the screen a big deal in terms of making the video better quality.



Any feedback about the projector and if it would work well for my potential usage would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you very much in advance!

1367108770.0,5,self.hometheater,1d8um5,What's the right Blu-ray player for me?,Spacebotzero,10,5,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/1d8um5/whats_the_right_bluray_player_for_me/,"I had posted yesterday asking some questions about the Oppo 103 and the Sony S790, but I deleted it because I have a better question to ask.

First of all, the Oppo 103 is nice, but I think it's overkill for me. It has functions I think I wont use because I'm going for the Marantz 8801 Pre/Pro which is BEAST of an AVR and it can easily deliver exceptional audio and video. 

Second, I was considering the Sony S790, which as it turns out, is a 1 year old model. Not that it's a bad thing, but if I'm going to upgrade, I'd like to upgrade to something of the current year.

That being said, I found that Sony launched the S5100 as well as the S3100. 

Now...the thing is...my future Marantz 8801 already has 2K and 4K upscaling capabilities. Wouldn't it be redundant if my Blu-ray player AND my AVR did 4K up scaling? Shouldn't my AVR just do all that work for me?

Also, it seems like lots of blu-ray players these days have stuff I am just not interested in like Pandora, Netflix, Internet browsing, YouTube. That's all well and good, but I'm not interested in all these add-ons. I am simply interested in Picture Quality. The S790 is said to have great PQ...the S5100 also has excellent PQ...as well as the Oppo 103. 

That brings me to the Sony S3100. The S3100 does not have 4K upscailing, not even 3D (which is fine because I just don't care about 3D). Some reviews have said that the DVD upconversion is junk, but after buying a blu-ray player chances are damn good I won't be watching SD DVDs anymore. 

What I'm getting at here is, I need a simple...blu-ray player, that delivers great image quality. The S3100 is cheap enough, that if I absolutely need to in the future, I can upgrade and buy another unit with little to no buyer's remorse. 


What are your thoughts on this approach? Am I wrong in thinking like this? 

EDIT: Well after doing a great deal of research on blu-ray players today, I've come to the conclusion that the technology has plateaued in image quality. Sure there are probably hints of better image quality with higher-end, more expensive models, but blu-ray tech has been out for so long, that it has matured. That's why I can't find a player that doesn't have any of that 3rd party crap on it like Pandora and Netflix...youtube and web browsing. They all have this junk on it because the tech can't get any better. So I've decided on the Sony BDP-D3100. It's missing 4K upscaling, 3D support, and some other stuff that I don't need because my future Marantz 8801 will be taking care of all that. It still has 100s of 3rd-party streaming programs I won't use, but if I ever change my mind and want Netflix, I'll be good to go. 

I compared this model to Pansonic offerings and LG models...but Sony S3100 reviews stood out more such as...it's quieter, load times are faster, picture quality remains great. It really just comes down to buying it and getting it over with at this point. It's my first blu-ray player, so now I have to find some awesome movies to experience!

I know about the current value of them on craigslist (~$250 for the kg-4's), so would I need to be looking at $250+ speakers to upgrade or $500+, $750+, etc?

Anyway, although the new projector is 700 lumens less then the current one, I am wondering, since it will be 4' closer, and has a much higher contrast ratio, will I notice a nicer image?

Maybe you can give me some advice on some things that I should do from the beginning because we are doing the construction from the ground up. The room will be for the home theater and my battlestation exclusively. 

The room will be 10’ wide x 21’ long x 10’ high. The construction will be in concrete. I expect to use around 14’ x 10’ for the home theater and 7’ x 10’ for the computer but the room will not be divided by walls so it will be a long room.

I expect to install a Epson 8350 with a 92” screen (haven’t decided yet which one).

So, if you would’ve constructed your home theater room from the ground up, what things would you have done from the beginning? Also, is this size good for a home theater, battlestation room? What finishes are good for a media room (tile, rug, wood for the floor, etc.)

But what I’m wondering about is the screen. I can’t measure right now, but I’d say that I can install at least a 6’ screen in my current room. Probably have about 10-15 feet of space between the wall and where the projector will sit.

I’m looking for cheap screen options. **And realistically, I’m not going to be building a frame.**

I recently found this..

http://www.amazon.com/FAVI-HD-120-16-120-Inch-Projector/dp/B0026DTP2S/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=3MLPOI2KAXZF2&amp;coliid=IRWXPQW9NCS77&amp;psc=1

That’s probably the most expensive I’ll go. And the automatic rolling feature is nice, but definitely not necessary.

My question is, what are some cheap alternatives, and how much does a screen matter? (Why on earth are they so expensive?)

I just purchased my first home and I have the space (hopefully) to set up an awesome home theater! 

Here is what I am looking to buy:

* Projector: [Epson Power Light Pro Cinema 6010](http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/jsp/Product.do?sku=V11H399020)
* Screen: [Black Diamond Fixed 110""](http://www.screeninnovations.com/screen-materials/black-diamond-ii-hd-08-black/)
* Couch: [Conley 6pc Recliner](http://www.raymourflanigan.com/conley-6pc-reclining-home-theater-seating-299282524.aspx)

Here are some links images of the room done in sketch up and my results from a throw distance calculator. They may be off by an inch or two, but its pretty accurate despite my poor sketch up skills!

Speakers are in green, I may need to create little sconces for the rear speakers to rest on. They aren't setup for perfect surround unfortunately, but I may be able to space them so they are close. I already own them and they are Asperion speakers from the [Intimus family](http://www.aperionaudio.com/speakers/intimus-family). 

In-between the two freestanding chairs will be a Shogi table. They are in front of a fireplace. All furniture is based on actual pieces and are actual size.


Some Questions:

* I want the black screen, should I be using 0.8 or 1.4 Gain with my setup? I will be able to have the room basically be pitch black when needed, I want the best picture.
* Are there any problems with the distance? I included an image with my results from a calculator that seems like I am okay. [Link to calculator](http://www.projectorcentral.com/Epson-PowerLite_Pro_Cinema_6010-projection-calculator-pro.htm?add=6508)
* There is a lowered ceiling for part of the room, which you can see in the ""View at screen with ceiling"". The tall part of the ceiling is 8' and the area by the lowered ceiling is 7'2"". I have the project set up so that it is lowered to be even with the 7'2"" ceiling. Will there be any problems?
* Any other comments and suggestions? See any problems?

I wanted a compact, front firing, sealed box so that I could achieve better musical results compared to higher output of a ported box. SVS's 5 year warranty, 45 day trial, 1 yr upgrade, and free shipping policies are pretty much unrivaled. 

I have it paired with B&amp;W PM1's in a 2.1 setup, with a Yamaha RX-A2020 as the receiver (planning on changing to a separate amp, running the yamaha as a preamp in the future). Currently I have it connected to the LFE channel, and my PM1's set to small crossed at 80hz so that the yamaha sends the front channel information to the sub. This may change.

__________________________________________________________

Review:

Firstly SVS is fantastic, they shipped it and emailed the tracking number within hours of the order. The sub also was delivered on a saturday, even with the free ground shipping. I'm not sure if this was credit to SVS, Fedex, or just some extremely lucky holiday circumstance, but it was perfect timing.

The sub absolutely gets down, way more than what I was expecting from this level. For movies it has performed pretty much flawlessly, great quickness, and muscle for days. It shakes my sectional across the room, and it's not even at 50% gain. Musically it's not exactly where I wanted it to be, just not as precise as I would like, and not as ""punchy"" I guess I would call it. However I'm having issues getting the yamaha setup exactly as i need for the PM1's and my current room (NOT an ideal room setup), so I'm not 100% convinced the sub is lacking at this point, it could very well be the yamaha configuration here.

As noted above, I'm thinking about changing the setup to utilize the preamp front outputs to get around using the LFE channel. Hopefully this will help on the music side. I may redo this after that change, but it could be a while for that (no time). When do I have more time I plan on using a RTA from work and seeing what the room is really doing to determine if it is in fact a sub issue.

So overall I'd have to say this sub is very good, absolutely worth the $650. I may take advantage of the upgrade policy to get the ultra if I move into a new house next year.

I feel pretty good about the receiver choice, especially if I can get it at that price, but I'm unsure about the speakers. Due to large windows in my living room, my setup is asymmetrical (layout http://imgur.com/DU70K) , so I'm wondering if that would make the Mirage speakers work better. However, I keep seeing great things about the Energy speakers and I'm concerned that the mirage speakers won't sound as clear. 

Another point worth mentioning. I don't care how big the speakers are. If I can get better sound at the same price, I'm sold. However, I'm already pushing my budget, so I can't go any higher on cost. 

The devices I'm currently using include a Sony LCD TV, Playstation 3, and Xbox 360, and as I mentioned before, I also want to play music via airplay.

Anyhow, it's driving me crazy, and I can't ignore it any more.

The speakers look to be leftovers from a decent ht-in-a-box.  JBL with a pretty stout powered subwoofer.  Not really worth a $300 Onkyo to push them...

I'm not sure if this is the correct place, and if it's not I'd appreciate you pointing me in the right direction. Thanks.

In case it is, I'll continue. I've just purchased an LED Bravia. On my old plasma Sony, I had the stereo hooked up through an RCA output on the tv and an RCA input on the main part of the stereo. My new TV only has a red and white output, which is fine. However, no sound was coming through the speakers, even when I switched the tv settings to audio output instead of tv speakers.

SO, at the moment I'm using a 3.5mm to RCA? (red + black) to go from the headphone jack on the tv to the stereo. Sound is only coming from the 'right' speaker (red input port).

Any clues on either of these problems would be much appreciated.

e\ I'm using an RCA for the video input from a digital television decoder, rather than the component input which the TV also has. And the decoder doesn't have a separate output for sound otherwise I would plug the decoder directly into the stereo.

As the title states will a 3.5mm (headphone like) cable support 2.1 sound?

The reason I ask is because I recently picked up a sound bar system with a subwoofer. I got this because I just wanted some better sound other than built in TV speakers and I don't have the space for a full blown 5.1 or above set up.

The sound system only has a HDMI in. An HDMI out. And a 3.5mm in. It's compatible with ARC but I don't think my TV supports it (at least I couldn't get it to work).

Here are links to the sound system and tv:

 - [TV](http://www.nfm.com/DetailsPage.aspx?ProductID=35191519&amp;cm_vc=pdpz1#.UFzX-o1lSUs)
 
 - [Sound System](http://www.sharpusa.com/ForHome/HomeEntertainment/SoundBar/Models/HTSL75.aspx)

Here are my issues:

 - It doesn't seem like my TV supports ARC so I can not use my sound system that way. 

 - The only way I can seem to get sound is by using the 3.5mm cable from the headphone jack on the TV to the 3.5mm in.

 - TV only has headphone and SPDIF (coax) out for other sound options.

 - My sound system is supposed to turn off an on with the TV. It turns on fine but does not go to standby about 20 mins like it says it is to.

Here is my idea:

 - Get a SPDIF coax cable for the TV.

 - Get a SPDIF to 3.5mm converter - maybe [this one]
(http://www.sharpusa.com/ForHome/HomeEntertainment/SoundBar/Models/HTSL75.aspx)

 - If using the above converter, get a Y adapter to 3.5mm.

 - Hook 3.5mm into sound system.

 - Enjoy less crappy sound.

Here is another idea:

 - Get SPDIF coax cable for the TV.

 - Get a SPDIF to HDMI converter - maybe [this one](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA0U00D18127)

 - If using the above converter, plug HDMI into sound system.

 - Enjoy less crappy sound.

So, in theory, will any of the above work? Which one would be ""better"" (meaning correct sound output - actually pushing 2.1 instead of pushing 5.1 being forced to 2.1)? Am I completely nuts?

I am a huge noob when it comes to sound systems and audio equipment and I tried my hardest on to search on Google to find the answers to my questions, but I didn't have much luck.

I also know that the sound system that I got is not the best in sound quality or what people would necessarily want but I just wanted some better sound without wiring things across my apartment floor (curious cats are not good for that).

So, home theater people of Reddit, any ideas? Any help is greatly appreciated. If you need more info, let me know and I'll try to accommodate.

I have Mod2's across the front and Mod1's for the surround and Surround-Back channels in a 7.1 configuration with a Denon AVR-1912 directing the performance. My sub has been an Orb Super Eight (http://www.orbaudio.com/supereightcustomsubwoofer.aspx) 

While watching a particularly intense action film this weekend, the sub went from sounding decent (though a bit overmatched) to sounding absolutely awful. Instead of ""bump, bump"" it said ""fuzz, fuzz"" so I turned it off and suffered through the rest of the film without an LFE channel. (The Denon tried to send it to the Orb Mod2's but they can't reproduce those frequencies.) 

It should be noted that the gain on the Super Eight was at less than 50% and the system was auto-calibrated with Audyssey, so I don't think I was asking too much. 

So what do you think is ""broke"" here? I assume it's the voice coil on the sub's driver, but I'm not educated enough to know for sure.

I don't really want to pay Orb $400 right now for a new Super Eight, especially when it's acted like it was being pushed too far for some time. They have the ""Uber Ten"" but it's a bit out of my price range at the moment. 

On the other hand, I also don't want to go buy a budget sub and find that it's distractingly muddy on the bottom end, either.

I need something that's going to give me good LFE and pick up where the wall-mounted Orb's leave off and e strong enough to let me  enjoy action films on my home theater without distortion that is incredibly distracting.

It seems like the actual difference would be the disc (either it's got the left/right views included or it doesn't), so I'm assuming that to watch Blu Ray 3D movies (like if I picked [this](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/How+to+Train+Your+Dragon+-+Blu-ray+3D/3293283.p?id=2138827&amp;skuId=3293283) up at Best Buy) in 3D you'd have to have the 3D player?",,False,self,t5_2rof6,False,,,True,t3_xl16f,http://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/xl16f/moving_brand_new_setup_everythings_different_now/,

As you can see from the pics the walls are almost ready for paint, still need to decide what colors I am gonna use, and what to do about the ceiling. (considering texture options)
If you noticed I have a nice cut-out for a projector, my plan is an Epson 8350, its wired and ventilated into my ducting (cold air return with a small power exhaust fan between (silent)

Carpeting and trim will be last, (house was built in 07 and contains mostly red oak woodwork so I'll likely match the rest)

I'm still in a tiny apartment, but I'm starting to build a nice (not top of the line, but nice) sound system that I'll be able to expand on later.

I started out by buying [these speakers.](http://www.jbl.com/EN-US/Products/Pages/ProductDetails.aspx?PID=ES80BK) And from here, I have some questions about next steps.

I'm not getting surround sound yet - setting it up properly in my current apartment would be impossible - so I'm either going to go with a 2.0 or 2.1 system for the time being. My first question is how necessary is a subwoofer going to be, with these as my main speakers? From what I can tell, these go down to 45 Hz, and a lot of subwoofers that I see only go down to 35. Am I going to miss that lower range? How hard / expensive is it to find subwoofers that go down lower, closer to 20?

On the receiver side, most of the ones I'm looking at only go up to 20 kHz, but these speakers say they'll go up to 40. Should I get a receiver that can take advantage of that upper range? How important is that, and how much can I expect to spend to get up there? 

Considering my situation - I'm hoping to find a nice receiver and potentially a subwoofer to complement the speakers I already have which I could expand to a surround sound system at some point in the future, and with a budget of probably ~$500 - does anyone have any suggestions for me? Advice is also appreciated. My last sound system in its entirety cost less than one of these speakers, so I'm making a big jump.",,False,self,t5_2rof6,False,,,True,t3_wue27,http://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/wue27/looking_for_some_receiver_subwoofer_guidance/,

Right now I have a PS3 (HDMI), 360 (Component), Wii (Composite) and Digital box (Scart) currently hooked up to a 27"" Samsung LED TV (D5000)

My problem is that I only want them to operate in stereo (I was looking at a pair of Monitor Audio BX2s) but I don't know how to set this up. My research so far tells me I need a digital AV receiver and I was looking at the Sony STRDH820 but this is a 7.2 channel 3d capable system and seems inappropriate when I just want stereo sound.

Also the TV will not display video unless it detects a signal from the video and audio pins on the Component and Composite inputs. 

If someone could advise on if this is the right direction to take or if a stereo amplifier would be more appropriate I'd very much appreciate it, also any advice on how I would connect a system with so many different types of input would be welcome as I'm not fully sure how the AV receivers work.

I have seen really good advice given on this subreddit, and i hope I will get some too. I bought a projector (Optoma HD33-with warranty). I have a basement i would like to set this up in, but i have no idea where to start, parts to buy, appropriate screen size etc. I took measurements of the room and would preferably like the projector on the roof behind the furthest couch, and the screen to be placed in front of the tv(of course). The measurement of that distance is 17ft. The distance from the floor to roof is 7.5ft and the distance from the left wall to the closet close to the tv(dumb placement) is 8.5ft. Im hoping these measurements are enough for you guys but if not i will try to answer all questions. I have included pics of my basement.

50% Music // 50% Movies+TV+Video Games

2 x B&amp;W 602 S3 // 1 x B&amp;W LCR 600 S3 // Logitech Z-5500 Subwoofer (Modded to accept RCA Sub Out) // Onkyo TX-NR808

Additions off CraigsList ($300 Total)::
2 x B&amp;W 600 S3 // 1 x B&amp;W LCR 60 S3 // 1 x B&amp;W ASW300 // Yamaha RX-V657

So I've setup up the 600's as surrounds (well, not really - I don't have room for proper surrounds placement in this small room, but I wanted to pick them up at the good price), and planned to sell off the rest of the CraigsList find to fund a larger subwoofer.  I figured I already have a center channel, a smaller one is useless to me.  I also figured since the sub was only an 8"" and it was with the 602's it wouldn't add a lot.  Regardless, I swapped the ASW300 in for the Logitech and I'm really pleasantly surprised.  I'm not sure if it is a matter of how awful the Logitech really was, or if the ASW300 is actually decent.  

I've been planning on upgrading to an SVS (PC 25-31?  PB12? PB10? PC12?) when I could find a good used one at a low price, but now I'm considering a B&amp;W ASW 600,650 or 675.  Could anyone give me some advice on which route to take?  Also, if I acquire a 10"" or 12"" should keep the ASW300 in addition to it? or run the system with only the larger subwoofer?

Any input appreciated, I'm pretty new to this stuff - and this is my first real stereo setup.

And second and more important, a lot of reviewers said something along the lines of how audio does not go through hdmi.  Can someone elaborate further on this?  Does this mean I wouldn't be able to simply connect my cable box and xbox to the hdmi inputs of the receiver and the tv to the output?  Or am I misunderstanding?  Thanks again.

Hi guys, I have a 42"" hdtv, but the one problem with it is it has terrible sound capabilities and only a 3.5mm out hookup. So, I want to bypass the tv altogether in respect to audio. Also, my receiver doesn't have hdmi ports or it would be way easier. 

So, am I able to connect my cable box with an hdmi cord to my tv in order to take care of the video, and then connect the cable box to the receiver with composite cables for audio, routing the sound out to the speakers with speaker wire? Also, since it's composite, I'll just be able to have the left and right aspect of audio, right?

Also, if I wanted to connect an xbox... How would I do that?  I'm pretty sure the new xboxs only have an hdmi and optical port.

In case you need it, the tv is a Hannspree ST42DMSB, and the receiver is a Sony strd515.  If you need clarification on anything, just ask.  Like I said, I'm barely keeping my head above the water.

Hi guys, newcomer here.

My landlord is hiring me for some quick contract work because this stuff is over her head. 

Unfortunately for me it's a little over my head too.  

Right to the knitty gritty:  There are 2 speakers and a volume control in every room of her Bed&amp;Breakfast, and the closet under the stairs contains this:

http://imgur.com/a/DHXt1

There are 3 rooms in total, and I believe speakers on the outdoor patio.

Quick googling reveals that a receiver capable of 4-room output runs around $300 to $1k? 

Something like: http://www.amazon.com/Denon-DRA-397-Source-Receiver-Audiophile/dp/B000HD5FWI

Here's my question:  Are there cheaper ways to do this?  Would a regular $70 receiver from bestbuy work if I twisted all the cables into one?

Help me out?

I've got my HTPC/TV set up almost exactly how I want it at the moment. The one thing left to make it perfect is the ability to play my PC games on there. 

I've got neither the funds or the inclination to buy/build a new PC, and because I work from home, I want to keep the PC in the office (my ""quiet"" space for working).

Luckily, the office is adjacent to the Living Room, and directly, the pc is about 4 meters from the HTPC/TV, if running cables, it's a 10 meter run (it's a rental house, so drilling the walls is a no-no).

There's Gigabit networking to each point, so networking solutions are acceptable.

I've been looking at the options, and I think my best option is a long HDMI cable and either a pair of USB Extenders, some kind of USB over IP solution, or whacking a big antenna onto a bluetooth adapter and using bluetooth KB and Mouse.

I'm not a hardcore gamer, so tiny response times aren't that big an issue, however, saying that, it can't be too slow.

Has anyone got experience doing anything like this, any advice, and potential pitfalls, or some more elegant solutions?

Thanks!

1332222517.0,7,self.hometheater,r4q7j,Low-to-mid range receiver recommendation,elusiveallusion,7,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/r4q7j/lowtomid_range_receiver_recommendation/,"Hello r/hometheater!

I'm sure this is the kind of question that provokes groans and sighs (in the same way asking r/photography 'what camera should I get?' does). 

I'm looking for some thoughts about what I should be looking for in a low-mid range receiver for what will be the 'B' system in my house. I'm moving to a new place which has a pretty nice home theater already set up, so my current system is going to be relegated to 'living room' role (possibly even 'bedroom 1'). The components are currently a three year old 50 inch Samsung plasma which has served me well; a four year old Yamaha receiver (the [HTR 5950](http://usa.yamaha.com/products/audio-visual/av-receivers-amps/htr/htr-5950_black__u/?mode=model) - it was new, although the model was a year or two old when I got it) and the JBL [CS-680](http://www.goodgearguide.com.au/review/home_entertainment/jbl/cinema_sound_cs680/219598) set (the technical details are available in [this pdf](http://www.jbl.com/resources/Brands/jbl/Products/ProductRelatedDocuments/en-US/ProductInformation/brochure_cinema_sound_eng.pdf).

I quite like the JBLs and they look reasonably neat and attractive; the TV is not in dire need of replacement and I'm not terribly interested in 3D. 

The reasons I'd like to replace the receiver are that owing to the age/lowish end nature of the Yamaha, it has no HDMI-out port to pass video to the TV; I've managed without, but in the new house the TV is going to be wall mounted, and I'd rather have as few as possible cables going to the actual tv. In addition, without that, the receiver's role as an integrating unit is a bit weak. 

In terms of input, it'll get HDTV via HDMI from a Foxtel (Australian pay-tv company) box, a DVD/Bluray/WDTV box, and a Wii - 3 or 4 HDMI inputs would be more than adequate. There's only the 5.1 setup, but I could still purchase some better fronts so I'd prefer 7.1 to be supported. I'm quite happy to go for a slightly older model. I don't need 3D support. Some sort of airplay support would be nice but not required. 

The budget would be less than about $600. My instinct is 'idiot, buy the best Denon under $600"", but I'm wondering if this is a shallow and pedantic view. 

Many thanks!

My old(ish) receiver gave up the ghost a while back and I'm now looking for something to replace it as I'm tired of listening through my TV's speakers.

The dead one is a Yamaha something-or-other. I liked it because it had 4-in-1-out HDMI as my old TV only had 1 HDMI port (I know, I know...). I had my TiVo Premiere, PS3 and AppleTV all connected to it via HDMI and it to my TV also via HDMI. All was well. Then I stopped getting audio and it seems as though something has blown in the receiver. Luckily, my new TV has plenty of HDMI ports so I've temporarily just plugged everything into it. It's...*okay*, I guess, but I want my surround sound/sub back.

Now, I've got all the speakers I want/need and a powered sub (they're not audiophile-grade, but good enough for me) so I don't want to waste money on one of the HTiaB-majigs but those seem to be all the rage these days. I don't even really need any video capabilities as I'd like to just run the audio out of my TV into this mythical box I hope to find (via optical).

So, long story slightly shorter, I'm looking for something (relatively inexpensive but not ""cheap"") that will meet these criteria:

* Optical in
* 5.1/7.1 out

That's pretty much all I need but my search so far has been fruitless to the point of frustration. Anybody got any ideas?

I am putting together a home theater and the receiver is the only part that I am undecided on. I am a Canadian so all the awesome electronics south of the border are mostly off limits. I've found two cheap options that would fulfill my needs. I only will need 4 HDMI ports. That part I am completely certain off (1 game console, 1 cable box, 1 computer occasionally, and one spare for possible new acquired electronic). I also think I will only need 5.1. You can try to sell me on a 7.1 system but I need to be able to get it for less than $400 in Canada. 

I found a refurbished and manufacturer certified [Yamaha RX-V371BL](http://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-RX-V371BL-5-1-Channel-Receiver/dp/B004QQXDVC) for $229

The other option is a new [Onkyo tx-sr313](http://www.electronicsforless.ca/audio-3/amplifiers-receivers-13/onkyo-tx-sr313-5-1-channel-home-theater-receiver-2859.html) for $269. I'll probably get futureshop to price match that company so that I can get it from an actual store. 

So I don't really see any big features to differentiate the two besides the refurbished aspect. The Onkyo would be a two year warranty so is non refurbished and an extra year under warranty worth $40? 

I also just found a [Pioneer 5.1 Channel Receiver (VSX-523-K)](http://www.futureshop.ca/en-CA/product/pioneer-pioneer-5-1-channel-receiver-vsx-523-k-vsx-523-k/10241688.aspx?path=4561c6805a885ce2d8bd760e5a68222fen02&amp;SearchPageIndex=1) for the same price as the Onkyo.

Any suggestions for this last piece of my system?

Speakers will be Energy Take Classic 2 and the TV is going to be a Panasonic S60. I am not going to step up to the ST60, I have already decided on that.

I'll write below what I'd like my system to be able to do, so you can see what I'm aiming for!

I am looking to purchase my first HDTV and after sifting through posts on here, CNET, various AV forums, and review websites, I have narrowed my choices down to either the Vizio [M3D470KDE](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0096YOQDS/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;seller=) or the [E500d-A0](http://www.amazon.com/VIZIO-E500d-A0-50-Inch-1080p-120Hz/dp/B00BF9MZ9O/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375706004&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=e500d-a0).

I like them because they are at a good price (~$650-700) and have a solid set of bells and whistles (see criteria below):  

* 1080p/120Hz
* 46""-50"" Screen (I will be sitting 8-12 feet away, won't know for sure until I move into the new apartment)
* Passive 3D (for the cheap glasses and simultaneous full-screen gaming with a friend) 
* Coaxial input for OTA Antenna, Digital Tuner inside (as I will be cutting the cord)
* Several HDMI inputs
* Optical Audio out (to send audio to my receiver)
* **$500-700 budget** (grad student)  

I don't particularly care about screen type, but passive 3D on a plasma seems to be rare. Glare will not be an issue (no direct light).  

I also don't care about Smart TV, as I will be using an Xbox 360 for streaming TV/movies at least until the Xbox One comes out. It seems that most TVs with 3D already come with Smart TV, so I don't think I'll be able to save by dropping it.

I understand the E-series is Vizio's ""entry-level"" series, and the M-series is generally the ""mid-range"" series, but given that the M3D470KDE is a generation older, would you guys recommend one over the other?

Things they have in common:

* 1080p resolution
* 120 Hz (effective) refresh rate
* 4 HDMI, 1 Optical audio out, 1 Ethernet port

Anyways we are going to make our house more useful and spending money on it. Since we will be saving money by staying in our home and not moving to a large mortgage we want a nice room to watch tv, games etc in.

The drawing very quickly done to give you an idea what we are working with, the room is pretty small but that's okay...

We are both huge hockey and football fans so we want a decent hometheater to watch games on. I haven't decided on what size of tv to get or move what we currently have downstairs.

Currently we have a 46"" samsung.

One thing to note on the drawing is where I am thinking of putting the tv is a brick wall I am not sure if I want to put in flat against the wall or get a corner mount. 

Another thing to note on the ""left"" side marked 12' 6"" there is a small basement window smack dab in the middle - not egress just a small window.

The ceiling is a drop ceiling so I am wondering if I can put ceiling mount speakers in or is this overkill for this small of an area? I've never looked into pricing on these

I do not have anything yet I am just trying to lay out and idea and a budget.

I think for furniture we will will have a larger sofa and one recliner unless reddit points me in another direction.

Key things I am looking for is:
TV - size
Stereo system - Nothing crazy..
layout ideas for the room

like I said the drawing was quick and obviously isn't to scale lol

What I'd like to do is set up a system that allowed me to run wire to speakers in the kitchen (one room over, but a separate room), while also incorporating my TV and soundbar.

What I was looking at were two zone systems - that way, if I wanted to listen to music over airplay in the kitchen, I could just listen to the music in the kitchen. Or, if I had people over and wanted music in both rooms, I could do that. Or, if I just wanted to watch TV and didn't want any noise in the kitchen, that would also be possible.

I don't really need a 5.2 or 7.2 setup - I just want to continue to use my soundbar. Surround is nice and all, but I'm not sure I really need to make that investment - I'm pretty happy with the sound I have right now. Does anyone make a 2.2 system? Would that work for me? Everything I've seen that is 2.2 doesn't have HDMI ins/outs, which would mess up my TV plans. Pre-amp outputs for zone 2 wouldn't bother me - I can invest in an amp that will run the speakers in my kitchen.

   * Center: Definitive Procenter 1000 compact center speaker

The rears are mounted slightly behind the couch on the side walls, near ear level. The Infinity subwoofer is no longer used due to its lack of power for the room size.

My problem is, I am afraid of water.  We currently have three sump pumps in the basement and have done everything humanly possible to prevent water seepage, and we are dry 99.99% of the time.  However, our entire neighborhood was built over some wetlands (environmental laws weren't too popular in the 50's) so we have a high water table, and every now and then we get some seepage.  And if the pumps fail, the water level rises pretty quickly.

So because of all that, I don't really want to risk building a room the traditional way, with 2x4' and drywall/plywood, etc.  What I have been thinking of doing, is just painting the current poured concrete walls and floor, laying down some cheap, thick area rugs and mounting some home made accoustic panels over the concrete walls.  Besides chairs, there would be nothing closer than about a foot above the floor.  

Has anyone done this?  How does it wind up sounding?  How does it look?  I would plan on painting everything a very dark color, so I don't think it should look too bad.

Is that a suitable replacement or is there a cheaper, better alternative?",,False,self,t5_2rof6,False,,,True,t3_1gjslf,http://www.reddit.com/r/hometheater/comments/1gjslf/need_some_guidance_advice_appreciated/,
