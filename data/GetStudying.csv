The professor was okay at best but could be really smug and unhelpful at times. That being said, one day she told us something that pretty much changed the way I looked at learning. And ever since then getting A's as been a breeze compared to how it use to be for me. And since it helped me so much, I figured I'd tell you guys in the chance that it'll help you as much as it did me.

During the middle of class she was quizzing us on a few chapters in preparation for an upcoming test. She then gets to one middle aged woman and asks her a question to answer. The woman kinda freezes up a bit, and you can tell she's thinking, and it's probably on the tip of her tongue, but she just cannot for the life of her remember it. After a while, our professor suddenly starts mimicking the Jeopardy theme, I guess to break the tension and give everyone a bit of a laugh. This is what happened when she started doing that. 

Student: Haha. Stop that, it's making me nervous.

Professor: So? What does being nervous have to do with anything?

Student: Well I can't remember it as well if I'm nervous.

Professor: Oh really? Well tell me this. If you were walking down a dark ally one night, and a guy walks up to you and points a gun at your head and screams ""Tell me your first, middle and last name in the next 10 seconds or I'll blow your head off!!!"" would you be able to do it?

Student: Well of course I could.

Professor: Oh really? But wouldn't you be nervous in that situation?

Student: Haha. Yeah but I know my own name!

Professor: Exactly!! You would *know* your name, you wouldn't *remember* it. So the next time you're studying, realize that you're studying to *know* it. Not remember.

Now, on the outside I don't think I did anything, but in my mind my jaw dropped through the floor from how much sense that made. Why the hell didn't anyone tell me that before? That probably would've made a difference YEARS ago!! So from then on out, that what I did. I studied to know. Not to remember. And on the next test I made a 97. Up until that point I was in the low 80's. During the next semester I had 4 classes including a physics class. All my life I had always struggled terribly with anything related to science, but this time I was gonna prove to myself that I could actually do it. And I did. An A in physics, along with an A in each of the others except for one (fuck literature). The semester after that I had biology, my academical arch enemy. But again I was gonna prove I could do it. 

Never made below a 95 on a single test. Fuck yeah you guys. Fuck yeah. Never felt more like a boss than when I made biology my bitch. 

So there it is. Hope it helps you because it sure as hell helped me more than I could have hoped for, and little does that professor know how grateful I am to her for something she probably doesn't even remember. Maybe now you too can know how awesome it feels to slowly walk away from a classroom as it explodes behind you because you simply beat every challenge it could throw at you, and it just doesn't understand how you did it.

1365368996.0,143,self.GetStudying,1bvh0l,Is it really laziness?,tetrabrach,156,13,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1bvh0l/is_it_really_laziness/,"**tl;dr**

**1. In many cases people are anxious, not lazy.**

**2. Set clear goals you can actually attain, even if they seem 'too small'.**

**3. Don't waste mental energy judging yourself or comparing yourself to others. You have too many important things on your plate to waste time with that.**

**4. Study however you need to; don't be afraid to experiment with different methods. Listening to a book isn't somehow less valid than reading it.**

**5. Make sure you have all the supplies and stuff you need so that when you start working you don't have to waste focus on looking for things.**

**Whole Thing:**

Very, *very* often, what people think of as a lack of motivation, laziness, or an inability to get started is actually some degree of anxiety and/or perfectionism.

If you're aware of the fact that you needed to be doing $THING, and instead of $THING you've read half of Wikipedia, cleaned your room, given your dog a bath, played 12 hours of Skyrim, sharpened all your pencils, *and* alphabetized your DVDs, the problem is **not** with you. A little voice, so quiet your conscious mind isn't aware of it, is telling you that all your procrastination is less intimidating than the assignment.

The best way around this is to avoid adding negative value judgments to your studying, which only makes it more difficult. Instead, keep setting yourself up for success. If you can only focus for two minutes before your mind starts to wander, study for two minutes- but actually study. If you're at your desk for an hour, but 45 minutes of it is spent thinking about how you're stupid and lazy for not starting sooner, that's both unproductive and unhelpful. You're training yourself to associate study with stress.

Let yourself need what you need. Set up your study space so that you have what you need: notebooks, pens/pencils, highlighter, eraser, calculator, whatever. Just have your supplies easily accessible. Keep a spare cable in your bag for your mp3 player if you need background music. Have some spare batteries for your calculator. If you can't study in a library, go to a coffee shop. Work in your car. Read in a park. Listen to audiobooks at the gym if that's what works for you. No one method is better than another- all that matters is getting information in your brain.

Most importantly, have a goal each study session. Measuring your study in units of time is nearly useless. Deciding you're going to study for 3 hours is no structure at all. However, if your goal is to outline your history essay and write the bibliography, do half of your calculus problem set, read three chapters of your English novel, and review your physics notes, you can accomplish quite a lot. Maybe it will take you three hours; maybe it will take you two. Maybe five. Maybe you'll get tired and need to stop, but you'll have finished your calculus and physics goals. If you can't see clear progress, you'll never appreciate the effort you've put in. That kind of negative feedback is not going to make it any easier to come back.

Studying should be engaging and will often be *challenging*, but it doesn't have to be *difficult*. Everything I've written above is intended to help you reduce the amount of extra bullshit you have to do in order to get to actual studying. Focus is a finite resource, so if you can avoid spending it on searching for pencils, chastising yourself, and staring blankly at a textbook, you will find that your time is much more productive.

Lastly, many educational institutions have some degree of machismo and a 'no pain, no gain' work ethic. Everyone has encountered that guy who comes in with a 32 ounce coffee, talking about how he spent the last two days awake and studying. Maybe you are that guy. Don't be that guy. Don't listen to that guy. Methods don't matter- results matter. Eating right, working out, and getting enough sleep will let you get more done in six hours than That Guy did in 48- plus your adrenal glands won't be shot to hell.

I'd sat down, opened up a spreadsheet, and marked out all the free hours i'd have during the next few weeks to study for finals.

I came up with a total of 111~ hours to prepare. Quite a lot hmm? I can easily afford to be a little inefficient with my time.


I went ahead and timed myself doing one 'study block', I divided the work into sized 'blocks' to further improve organisation. 

This is when I made my horrific discovery...

It's been 6 days since I started this. Every time I'd 'study', whether I'd do some examples/read some text whatever, I hit the timer on my phone. I stopped the timer when I stopped studying for that 'session'. 
Any time I looked at facebook, or went to take a piss, or went to eat I paused the timer, and restarted it when I got back to the books.

What I found horrified me.

For the first 6 days, i'd predicted a total of 35 hours of study. After summing together the amount of hours i'd 'logged' however, I've gotten a measly. 6.49 hours. 

That's right, I was apparently working at 18.5% efficiency. I'd understand if it was 80% or even maybe 60%... The scary thing is during this horrible inefficiency, if I hadn't timed myself I'd have absolutely no idea I was doing so badly, it FELT because I was sitting in front of the books/computer etc that I was studying rather 'hard'.

Where the rest of that time went I honestly have no idea. The next step in my little self study,is to start a seperate timer, that measures the gap between the 'study timers', and next to each time write down what was done. eg 3.43minutes -toilet, just to see where this time is infact going.

I'd like to both ask and recommend some other people on this sub to do this, and write their results down on an excel spreadsheet, and post their results.

Perhaps we could even make a bit of a game with this, involving posting up stats: Like: total hours planned:Efficiency%.

I'm somewhat new to this and a lot of advice is a compilation of what I've read from /r/getstudying and what has worked for me. Can never have enough study guides though, right? 
Supposed to be a basic guide to strolling the fuck over to your desk and picking up a goddamn highlighter. Suggestions and edits are welcome and encouraged! 

Easy advice to give, hard to follow, but good basic format:

**Plan**

* Break up all the work into the tiniest components and list them out. (e.g., writing a paper: 1. think of topic 2. list possible ideas for paper 3. meet with teacher for suggestions 4. bare bones outline paper 5. browse for possible sources 6. pick out the sources you will use 7. add those quotes into the outline 8. begin sentence structure............. you get it)

* Estimate how much time it will *realistically* take to complete each task. Write it down.

* Plan in advance and assign a number of those little components to each day, scheduling in times to fit with the rest of your schedule, making sure projects with the nearest deadlines are priority

* Find a pomodoro timer website that works for you

* If you need flashcards, download an app or use www.flashcardmachine.com or whatever you can find for PCs (I use Smartr for OSx)

* Grab some pledge wipes and make your work station sparkle like a fucking unicorn on LSD. Line up fresh notebooks, charged laptop, sharped pencils, favorite pens, new highlighters, big cold glass of water (+ reliable coaster), and anything you'll need to do your work

* If you're working on several things keep your backpack on the floor next to you and only pull out relevant material for what you're currently working on, helps keep the focus/organized/productive workspace.

**Start**

* Use pomodoro to keep yourself on track and most focused.

* Sit down and do it. Cell phone away, tabs closed. Pomodoro helps calm that urge to constantly check your messages.

* Because everything should be broken up into manageable pieces, don't worry about tackling the hard stuff first. It makes the most sense to go in chronological order (of your choosing... like writing the findings section before the introduction if that's your bag)

* If its reading, type up a quick summary of what you read when you're finished with a section/chapter/whatever.

* If you're writing, outline the shit out of your ideas.

* If you're studying, remember the golden rule: You're not learning if you can't recall the information. Don't just read a study guide or a flashcard once. Read small chunks of information and then test yourself. Say it out loud, type up your mind-notes on a blank word doc, whatever works as long as you're pulling it back out from your brain. This will save you time!

**Keep Going**

* Go to class. Go to the gym. Make dinner. As long as you're on track with your study schedule, you'll be fine. If you're not, make your study schedule more realistic.

* Little by little, it gets done. Its not a mountain, its just a little step each time.

1355777742.0,86,self.GetStudying,150fww,Tips for Good Grades,B33P3R,105,19,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/150fww/tips_for_good_grades/,"I wrote this ""checklist"" for my girlfriend who was having trouble academically. I made it a bit more formal, and thought I would share it. These things really help me, and it's a list of things I wish someone told me when I started college.


**Tips for Successful Studying/Good Grades**

1.	**Study Alone**: Studying with friends is only going to be a distraction. Goofing off is bound to occur, and that’s less time focusing on whatever you need to accomplish. Go to the library alone, and spend an hour or so there. If you feel like you can go longer, then do it! The exception to this rule is to rehearse information with someone else, AFTER you have studied it. Have them test you with flash cards or with a sheet of your notes. If it is math you are having trouble with, you may want to look that over with a friend as well, but be weary of goofing off.

2.    **Study in Advance:** Make sure you study within a week or two of your test (depending on how difficult the material is), but don’t wait until the day before to start studying. Make sure that you do study the day before to refresh the information and make sure the information is still relevant to your thoughts.

3.	**Practice Grammar/Spelling**: When texting people or typing on Facebook, twitter, Reddit, email, etc. DO NOT abbreviate with sentences like “were r u goin.” Use proper punctuation, capitalize the right letters, and make sure your word usage is correct (Know the difference between “your,” and “you’re,” “its” and “It’s,” etc.). Bad grammar and spelling is embarrassing, and people notice and point it out.

4.	**Don’t Lie to Yourself**: Don’t say you’ve studied for something more than you have. If you get a bad grade, don’t say you studied hard, because if you studied hard enough and tried a bit harder, your grade would have been better than it was. Of course it isn’t always 100% your fault for a bad grade (hard test questions, etc.), but take responsibility for not doing well. This will make you want to try harder next time, and will discourage laziness.

5.	**Visit Office Hours:** Even if it’s just once, go to each of your professor’s office hours just to say hi – say you’re interested in the class and look forward to it. Not every professor is worth getting to know, but this is a great way to find the ones that can help you.

6.	**Don’t Get Too Involved**: Joining clubs and getting involved on campus is all great, but you’re at college to better yourself intellectually and use that knowledge to help you advance in the world – not play badminton weekly and go out on the weekends. If your grades are suffering, punish yourself by studying instead of going out or socializing. If your grades are sub-par, the last thing you should be looking into is an organization to join. Organizations can wait, but your grades come at a scheduled time at the end of every semester, and those matter much more. 

7.	**Be Independent:** Don’t count on friends for happiness. Learn to enjoy alone time, and then learn to control alone time. Spend some of that time looking over notes, even if just briefly. Spend the rest relaxing.

8.	**Use a Computer to Take Notes**: If the professor says no computers, ask for permission politely after class anyway. Make a folder on your computer for each year, then each semester, every class, and every test. Arrange them accordingly. This makes it very easy to take notes and find notes. Save your notes by the Class, and the Date. If your class is History 116 and it is December 10th, save your notes as HIS116 Notes 12.10.12 (Microsoft word cannot save documents with “/” in them, so use periods to separate the date). *(This doesn't work best for everyone, but it's great for keeping organized. If you already know that pen and paper works best for you, stick with that route. If you start having trouble, maybe give this a try.)* 

9.	**Review Notes After Class**: A lot of times it’s easy to write something down, and then forget.  Later in the day, take 10 minutes to just scan what you’ve written down and try to recall as much as you can from class. This is more effective than you’d think.

10.   **Meditate!** : Take 5 minutes or more a day to just sit down quietly alone, and breathe. Focus only on your breathing and do not think about anything. This is less important, but it can keep you sane!

* Sometimes when I dont feel like studying, I start my best motivating strategy. *Scaring* myself into studying. Yes, I write list of all the bad grim things that will happen if I don't study and a list of all the good things that will happen if I study.


**2) PREPARATION:**

* I prepare my study playlist, all consist of hemi-sync brainWave entertainment music. And for those who will ask, YES,  It *DOES* make a difference. I can easily sit for two hours in a row listening to this music and study without getting bored. I recommend everyone to order hemi-sync CD's and listen to them while studying. 
* I prepare my book and all my notes and bring alot of blank print paper. I don't like the ruled paper for some reason. I like writing my notes on a blank white paper. 
* For long study sessions (4 hours +) , I like to bring some snacks. Milk, M&amp;M's, Redbulls. Redbulls and caffeine drinks are limited to one drink every three hours. 

**3) ACTUAL STUDY SESSION:**

* I study with headphones on while listening to hemi-sync music. My study technique relies heavily on taking notes from my own previous notes and the book. Light use of mind maps. If I open the book and I feel lost, I just reread the whole chapter and summarize it, writing it down with pencil or pen. I found out that whenever you write something it seems to stick in your head. 

* I try to avoid just reviewing a subject. I find *simply* reading a book without actively taking notes or writing down the important points or at least highlighting important parts as a waste of time. 

*  Through experimentation I found out that I am alot more productive using the pomodoro method. I study for four pomodoros (Each pomodoro is 25 minutes)  then take a long break then come back again for four pomodoros. This way I can study for long periods using short concentrated bursts. I finish alot this way than if I study 2 hours in a row. It also limits my distractions.

* In every long break, I usually find myself drained out of energy and *too bored* to study. Alot of people seem to suffer from this problem too, which make their study sessions short. Here is my solution to that problem:  Do something interesting like watching a movie or playing one game of DotA 2 and have a coffee or redbull. After doing so I find myself prepared to study and my mind is refreshed. 

When I started following this routine, my GPA skyrocketed and I started seeing A's. 

So, reddit, what's your usual study routine?

Even worse once you lose focus, the class doesn't slow down, the teacher keeps going, and concepts start going over your head. Next lecture those same concepts are used to build on other concepts, which you now don't know.

Instead, if you skip lectures entirely, and study the course material at a self-dictated pace, with a focus on MAKING SURE YOU UNDERSTAND every little bit, and not moving on until you do.

I've been getting basically straight A's (Up from a B-Cish student).


The only problem is willpower to not sit on reddit when you should be studying, (A huge problem for a lot of people here) and fully understanding how much time proper 'studying' takes.

EDIT:
For people wondering, this is from a pretty ""technically"" heavy Mechatronic Engineering 3rd year course. 

EDIT2:
After reading all of the comments suggesting ""why don't we have both"", I live 1 hour away from university, meaning getting there is an hour, getting back is another hour. Dorms aren't an option. My thinking for this originated when a friend made a joke about how I commute for 2 hours to attend an hour lecture. 

Turns out not only does skipping the lecture save time, but also it helps me learn more 'concretely'.

Tonight I realized I could use Reddit to improve the efficiency of my studying. I just tried it out, and I am very happy with the results. Here's what you do:

* Go through your lecture as you normally would - read the handout, look at the powerpoint, take notes, etc. This usually takes me about an hour per lecture.

* When you've gotten through the lecture once, do a TL/DR! Take out a sheet of notebook paper (or type it, whatever) and spend **ten minutes** writing down the most important concepts that someone would need to know if they didn't go through your whole lecture.

* Now the TL/DR (which should be **one page MAXIMUM**) serves as your study guide - start here and build outwards filling in all of the details you need to know. 

Why this works for me: I'm a detail-oriented person and have a hard time stepping back to look at the big picture. TL/DR helps me get the big picture concepts down before I try to memorize all the details.

Well, why don't you guarantee that you'll do it tomorrow? Often the hardest part is simply getting your books out. The studying comes much easier after that. Take 5-10 minutes tonight to prepare yourself for a good study session tomorrow.


Here's what to do tonight:

1.  Take 5 minutes to clean up your desk. Or even better, clean up your room. It will make you feel better, and the clean environment helps you focus.

2.  Take out your book, open it to the right page, and set it on your desk.

3.  Take out your notebook, notepad, or a few pieces of loose-leaf paper. Place your favorite pen or pencil on it at an angle. Even if you don't need to write anything, it will help get you into the right mindset.

4.  Go to sleep! You've procrastinated today, but tomorrow you'll see that you've done the hardest step and prepared yourself for a productive study session.

If your teacher briefly covered a few concepts that might not be considered part of your core understanding of the material, try first studying the core material and then expanding your knowledge by going one step beyond what your teacher asked you to learn a bit more about these additional concepts. Often you'll learn some very interesting things and reinforce your understanding of core concepts without even realizing it.

How do I tell my family and friends?",robhernzs,69,7,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1dekgw/feeling_like_a_piece_of_shit_i_am_suppose_to/,"Hello, I am really feeling down and will try to keep this as short as possible in order to get some advice and help from the reddit community. 

I am a 6th year student that has been withdrawing from m last 3 semesters due to the poor grades I was getting. I am a chemical engineering major, and my gpa dropped from a 3.8 to a 3.02 my senior year (doing 5 years). I was not satisfied with the grades I was getting and decided to withdraw 2nd senior semester. From then, it just became a habbit; if i was not getting A's I withdrew over and over again. My parents and friends think I am doing a second degree, but in reality, I am trying to finish my first degree and still have about one more year left in order to finish. 

I am supposed to graduate next week with my parents thinking they are going to see me walk, and haven't had the courage to tell them. All I have been doing is sleeping for long hours and eating a lot while trying to find a job or internship for the summer. I have gained weight just this last year alone (I used to hit the gym 3/4 times a week). 
How do I tell my parents? they have such high expectations of me that sometimes I feel like the biggest failure and thought about running my car off a cliff several times when going home from college and back. 
There is much more to the stress that accumulates, but this is my main concern. Any advice to how should i approach this problem will be greatly appreciated. 

-First time Redditor seeking help. 

Update: Reddit can sometime be like counseling. Now seeking help from the university and about to go and talk to my girlfriend about this. Thanks for the advice and support everyone!

Update 2: Told my girlfriend first: She was shocked because I told her at a store. We talked after wards and told me that she was upset that I didnt tell her that I was struggling through classes, because she could've pushed me. She said she felt guilty because I always helping her and motivating her and have high expectations for her, but she doesn't do the same for me. She said that she felt proud that I am not settling for bad grades, but to make better choices and try to do things better and to internships along the way because I haven't done any. She was supportive. 

I told my brother second: He was extremely supportive. He graduated before and just wanted to get out of college and just breezed through school. He said to stay calm and that I am not a failure because I had not quit yet. I told him I want to give it another shot and do it right. He said to take my time and come back strong, that hopefully I learned a lot from it and apply it. 

My PARENTS! I told my father first, and he was really upset that I waited till the last minute to tell them. He said that a week before would have been fine. The conversations was short, but he was upset. My mom just kept asking me why I didn't tell them before. I told her I was ashamed to, and hopefully I will fix it because I was not doing so well on my last classes. 

Summary: They were supportive, but just were upset that i waited till the last minute to tell me. You were right guys, it wasn't as bad as I imagined, and life continues on. 
Currently applying to Internships like crazy =).

I read on here a while back that one thing that helped others to stop procrastinating was a change in venue. Your old studying place might carry feelings of procrastination and goofing off so a new place was kind of a fresh start, like going from your room, to the library, or even your kitchen. Well I took that to a different level. 

I have my own laptop that I built and love, running Windows 7 and one user on it. That user is now followed by a second. My main user has all of everything on it. Firefox, Photoshop, MS Office, iTunes, WoW, Reddit as my homepage, all the bookmarks of every great thing I have ever found on the internet, and Mila Kunis on the background. Its so easy for me to procrastinate with it all there. The second user is my change of venue. 

My second user is now basically my work user, and I can tell you in the past month it has saved me from **MANY** missed deadlines. Its streamlined with only Chrome, and MS Office. I have the app extension, [StayFocused](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji) which can and does block every single fun website I ad. There is even an option that makes you complete a difficult task to get to be able to change the rules and guidelines you have set. So on this second user, I have all but forgotten about Reddit, my lvl 90 hunter, and my ex's Facebook profile.... (thank you god..)

So I came here to advocate making a second user on your computer and blocking all your fun shit. That way you can figuratively have your cake and eat it too.

I'm trying to look for undeserved sympathy but for advice on how to get out of this situation. 

Firstly, I am a chronic procrastinator. Even since I started high-school I've always left everything to the last minute, in my final year of High School I never studied until the very last minute, sometimes a few hours before the test, and for the exams I didn't even bother to study for most of them even before the day of the test - this is the level of my laziness. Despite that I managed to achieve a good enough score to get into Chemical Engineering here in Australia (which I believe I don't deserve as I am a piece of lazy piece of shit)

However. I'm failing all of my subjects. The issue is not with partying, I don't party at all, and the issue is also not with any work-commitments, as I don't even work. The issue with chronic procrastination and deep laziness. I spend all of my free-time on the internet on Facebook, Reddit and reading blog posts and articles instead of studying and leave everything to the very last minute for assignments and sometimes for exams I don't even bother to study at all.

I just can't seem to do my work, I can't get started and I can't get focused. I have an exam on Monday which I have not studied for and have missed most of the the lectures on. I am positive that I will fail it, and I'm not even bothering to study at the moment because I realize it will be useless since I've already failed it and it will be impossible to catch up on all the missed lectures. I don't want to be like this. I hate it. I hate myself for developing these bad habits all these years.

However I don't want to be a piece of shit lazy procrastinator anymore. I've been trying to change everyday for the past four months.. but to no avail. Every day before I go to sleep I say 'Tomorrow is the day I'm going to change' but alas nothing happens. I feel like shit all day because I'm a disappointment to myself and my parents who have been really supportive and caring towards me.

I deserve to fail because it is my fault. I don't deserve to be studying at a university. I may have been smart enough to get into university by doing the absolute bare minimum but that's not fair to all the other people who worked hard and deserved to be in my place but didn't get in. It's a sad fact that people like me who don't put in the effort and who don't want it bad enough are allowed to study.

So I've decided that I'm going to take a year of from university, get my priorities straight, work for a little while, possibly volunteer and then come back, if I feel I have changed my ways then I will perhaps continue with tertiary study otherwise. But I need advice on whether this is a suitable plan of action. So feedback would be appreciated.

Also any advice on how I overcome the mess I am in?

In regards to studying, I'm sure we can all agree that apart from getting back a good test score, there is little if any short-term pleasure in academia.  Often times we are able to suppress our short-term urges in favor of the more intelligent long-term choice, but only when we have the presence of mind to do so.  

Although im sure that it has been reiterated countless times, I believe that this is one of the reasons why it is imperative to get plenty sleep, have a good diet, have low stress, and maintain a social life.

1363480977.0,47,self.GetStudying,1afsul,A guide to efficient memorisation.,IIIZhouYu,51,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1afsul/a_guide_to_efficient_memorisation/,"Hello everyone,

I thought I'd share what I know about memorisation with you guys, as it has really helped with my studying law this year. Also, I like to help people where I can.

Why you should read this: memorisation gets a bad wrap, but thats because human beings tend to suck at it. Used correctly, memorisation can be an unbelievably powerful tool when studying. Personally I have found it has dramatically improved revision efficiency and knowledge recall.

I'm not claiming to be a memory genius by any means, but I hope you find this stuff useful.
****

**Preamble**

Right, so the basics. Most people's idea of memorisation is repetition - if I ask you to memorise something like the number 1,867,423 you will probably repeat it to yourself in your head to try and get it to stick. This is sub optimal. 

Human memory is good at a couple of things, and remembering numbers is not one of them. What human memory is amazing at is remembering:

* Visual images (note that memorisation of images and recreation are two different skills)
* Emotions
* Physical spaces

Sitting here right now you will probably be able to remember how to walk from where you lived as a kid to your friend's house, or the corner shop, or your favourite restaurant. This is quite impressive, and something we don't recognise every day. Likewise, you will probably be able to remember the faces of people you haven't seen in years (though again, describing that face to someone else is a different skill), or the cover of a favourite book, or a time where you have been really angry/upset/happy.

Humans are good at this stuff, but we are less good at dry academic stuff like numbers, formulas, analysis of literature, case names, etc.

The trick to efficient memorisation is essentially use the memorisation techniques we are naturally good at to remember the stuff we suck at remembering normally. Basically, you need to make dry stuff interesting, rather than trying to remember it just as it is.
****

**Memorising specific pieces of information**

The way to get anything to stick in your head is to make it interesting, vibrant and link it to something you already know. As a law student I have to be able to recall hundreds of case names and know what each of them is about, so take a case called R v McKechnie, which is a criminal case about taking your victim as you find them. 

To memorise R v McKechnie I make a basic visual image of the associations that the case name brings to mind - personally its a guy in a tartan kilt (Mc) getting stabbed in the knee (nie) which then explodes - the guy in the case had an ulcer which exploded meaning he couldn't get surgical treatment. He also wears a crown (R = Regina).

This is the core of efficient memorisation - take something that you need to remember and make it really memorable, so that you will never forget it. The best way of doing this is by making a visual image with strong visual associations to things you know - generally the first association that comes to mind when you think of something will be the strongest and the best to make the visual image from. 

How well this works does depend to some extent on the information you are trying to remember - R v McKechnie is a lot easier to create associations for than 1,867,423. However, you can perform a similar trick with numbers - you just have to codify them to visual images. So 1 becomes a tree, 8 becomes a snake, 6 becomes a devil, etc. I won't go into detail on number memorisation, because frankly I don't use it overmuch and other people can do it better. However, if you ever wanted to know how to memorise a deck of cards, or pi to the umpteenth degree, thats how you do it - a common technique is the [PAO system](http://mnemotechnics.org/wiki/Person-Action-Object_%28PAO%29_System).

**Efficient recall**

Being able to make a great visual image for something will innately make it easier to remember, but it isn't perfect recall - you'll forget eventually, or not be able to grasp the image - you'll know what you are looking for it, but won't know where to look.

However, there is another mental trick you can use to efficiently store information so that you know exactly where to recall it from - the journey method. 

The journey method works like this - you recall a journey that you know from your memory - say how to get from your bedroom to your bathroom to your kitchen to the front door (or whatever). A journey can be anything from the inside of your house, to your walk to work or a particular counter-strike level, as long as you know it well and can 'walk' through it in your head. Journeys with lots of differentiated areas tend to work best - rooms in a house, streets in a city, etc.

So, you have a journey. The trick to the journey method is then to place memorable visual images in certain points along that journey - like bus stops on a bus route. You walk through your memory journey in your head and place your visual images at 'stops' on the way through.

****
**Putting it into practice**

This is great in theory, but where it really shines is when you see how effective it is in practice, so lets memorise a list of random shit.

Socks, cushion, dragon, sink, diamond, waterbottle, beyonce, asparagus, desk, ballet dancer, aftershave, yogurt, torch, headphones, cat, underwear, sandwhich, balloon, arrow, penknife, keyboard.

Try and memorise these now, then cover them up, wait a minute or two and try and recall them. 

Maybe you are a memory genius, I don't know, but without using the journey technique I get maybe 9/22. Worse if I wait longer. 

Now, lets try the journey technique . First I want you to create the most vibrant, interesting, amusing mental images you can for each of the above items in the list. Then you place the items from that list in each of the 'stops' on your memory journey. So for instance, in my memory journey there are socks floating in the air above my bed. They stink and have gone slightly green, they are my slightly expensive thousand-mile running socks and if I go close to them they drag over my face making me feel gross. Suddenly, socks are memorable. 

Go through your memory journey making each item as memorable as possible with as many associations as you can - you can use vulgarity (there are an alarming quantity of giant cocks in my law journeys), humour, puns, colour, sound and (possibly strongest) personal connections. Then place each item in a specific point in your memory journey - so I have my socks floating over my bed, then a big red silk cushion on my desk, etc. 

Take your time and really focus on it. Part of the reason why the memory technique is so effective is because it makes you focus on what you are trying to memorise.

Now, cover up the list, wait a minute or two and test your recall. You'll probably be able to recall every item on the list using the journey technique. If not, then focus on making those images as vibrant as possible and being really emphatic in how you place them.

Now, the cool bit is that not only do you recall the list, you have memorised its order by placing the items along the journey. So if I ask you what the seventh item was on the list, you should be able to tell me that it was Beyonce without any real difficulty. Moreover, you could tell me the list backwards, or tell me the third item from the end, just by walking through your memory journey. Cool shit huh?

****
**How to apply this to studying**

This of course depends heavily upon what you study and how you study. Some topics don't require memorisation, others are simply harder to memorise. I can only really discuss the stuff I know and that I personally study, so as always, your mileage may vary.

However, memorisation can be an effective study tool. Just using visual imagery can substantially improve recall, while the journey method especially can help you recall entire topic areas in detail.

Again, how you use this stuff will depend on how you study and I can't hope to cover every possible topic here, so I will just go with what I know.

Personally I use visual imagery to recall case names, I use a (very basic) numerical mnemonic system to recall numbers such as dates or statutory section numbers and I use the journey method to recall long lists of subject area overviews, with visual images of cases dotted along as I go. For instance my EU law journey starts near my house, and walks along a nearby road where I have positioned visual images of cases like 'Van Gend en Loos' or Simmenthal. 

Using the journey method you can memorise an entire overview of a topic, especially if you have already sequentially ordered it. Personally I create checklists of 'cheat-sheets' that break down each area of law sequentially. For example [here](http://i.imgur.com/MG0UxTe.png) is my criminal cheat-sheet for offences against the person. 

I placed that cheat-sheet along a road near my house, and as I walk along it in my head I see each step. And yes, ""R v Ireland"" is a leprechaun. So sue me. 

Essentially, if you can make what you need to know into a sequential list then you can make it into a memory journey and enjoy (with some work) perfect recall of that information. 

As I mentioned, this does require some work. It can be a lengthy process to create visual images for each piece of information, to organise that information and then to spend the time placing visual images along your memory routes. However, the trade-off is that, if you spend the time memorising the journey you can perfectly recall the information you require. 

Revision then becomes an active process where you organise your information, create visual images of it, then memorise those images. You then test yourself on the recall of your journey - an active process and one that gets better when other people test you on it (if only to show your burgeoning memory prowess). I personally also use a program called [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) to help with case detail recall as well. 

I have personally found that the journey method makes revision less shitty and boring. Instead of rereading textbooks (don't do that), I am always active when revising, and testing yourself and going through your (assuredly bizarre) mental journeys can even be quite fun. Its also a hell of a lot more efficient time wise than anything else I've ever tried. If I can go through the entire memory journey perfectly for an entire topic then I know I am good to go - the rest is just exam technique.
****

**Wrapping it up**

Please forgive me for a wall of text that probably doesn't read too well. I've tried to summarise quite a complicated technique in a pretty short space, and undoubtedly I will have missed stuff out. I'm happy to answer questions you might have (though I might have to sleep first), but please recognise that I claim no expertise in this, but that I am just trying to share something I have found useful with other people who might find it useful.

Good luck memorising :).

**Further information**

The book that got me started on efficient memorisation and the journey technique was 'Moonwalking With Einstein' by Joshua Foer. Its an excellent (and very well written and engaging) overview of memorisation and the journey technique. My 'putting it into practice' section is pretty much yanked wholesale from the (much better) bit in this book. 

I have also read 'You can have an amazing memory' by Dominic O'Brien, which is a pretty useful functional guide to memorisation, and is also worth looking at.

I don't have to memorise numbers a great deal for my course, but when I was curious about it, the [Mnemotechnics wiki](http://mnemotechnics.org/wiki/Main_Page) was a good resource.

Frankly google will be your friend, and there will very likely be other (better) guides on the journey technique, mnemonics and memorisation in general. ",,False,self,t5_2tl44,1363482108.0,,,True,t3_1afsul,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1afsul/a_guide_to_efficient_memorisation/,

First of all, read this to understand what it is - 

A) http://lifehacker.com/5554725/the-pomodoro-technique-trains-your-brain-away-from-distractions

B) http://workawesome.com/productivity/pomodoro/

C) http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/the-pomodoro-technique-is-it-right-for-you.html

D) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique


Right? Sounds frikin' awesome, and damn right it is. Ok so now to the relevant part. 

The way this works is that 

A) get an awesome pomodoro app for your phone/desktop/tablet. Android users get this - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.phlam.android.clockworktomato. Simply the best. 

B) log your pomodoros through the day. No cheating! 

C) screenshot it. 

D) post it in the thread. 

E) the one with the maximum pomodoros get bragging rights! 

Here's an example of how it looks - http://imgur.com/5Qk1q8U. The white dashes show the pomodoros and the total number is displayed on the top. 

As to why do this? Think of it as some sort of a leaderboard. You can brag about your awesome records. And it will motivate you to work harder. Yes, this can be eaaily fudged, but that's besides the point. If your priority is to fudge scores even *while* you're using something like the pomodoro technique to work, you have bigger issues on hand. 


So, yay? Nay? WTF? Please let me know. Also, if mods are on board with this, maybe we can have the link to the threads once they start on the sidebar, maybe? That'd be very, very cool. 


Finally, even if you don't agree with this, or are not interested, do pass the word around. And also, upvote for visibility, I get no karma for this! Thanks!

1366389784.0,42,self.GetStudying,1comds,A late semester self-assessment: What I've learned.,Wiskie,48,6,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1comds/a_late_semester_selfassessment_what_ive_learned/,"Hey all,

I noticed I was slacking lately so I figure I could remotivate myself and others by returning to [a post I made earlier in the semester](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/16yz2p/what_are_some_of_the_things_you_guys_are_doing/c80oecm). If you're like me, spring semester is coming to a close and things are about to get *real* hectic.
 
Let's start by just going down the list:

* I was surprisingly good at getting things done early last semester, but unfortunately there'd be such a gap between doing the practice problems/homework that I'd always fall off come quiz/exam time. Get things done early so I don't need to stress, but don't neglect some review throughout the week as well.

I think my problem here was an issue of not bringing the intensity everday, which is also one of the reasons I'm mad at myself for slacking over the past few days. Schoolwork should be considered a full-time job. You have to bring the intensity for *at least* five days a week.

* Always go to office hours whenever they don't overlap with a class. The professor/TA is giving you the opportunity to learn in a more personal environment, take him/her up on the offer.

I've been better about asking professors and TAs questions and I feel that this has made a difference. They are surprisingly willing to take the time to explain it to you thoroughly if you take the time to ask. Don't neglect the possibility of email (especially for TAs who aren't quite so busy as profs).

* ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS do anything such as ""bonus"" or ""extra credit"" work. It's not always available, but when it is, take it. In fact, it shouldn't even be seen as auxiliary, it should be considered part of the grade.

So far, this hasn't been a problem. I would implore you all to remember to set aside time to get this XC stuff done as if it were a regular assignment. Put in the effort.

* Read the book. Even if it's not required reading/bears little resemblance to the lectures/notes, it offers practice problems and new perspectives.

This has been a game changer. Your lectures are probably around an hour or less in length. You **will not** get everything you want/need to learn out of a class without reading the complementary textbook at least once and keeping up with it (generally best to read it *before* the corresponding lecture if you can't do before *and* after). 

* Get to bed at a reasonable hour.

I've been getting worse at this as the semester goes on. The temptation to go on reddit is sometimes just too great. The problem, for me, isn't that I don't get enough sleep. I don't have classes until later in the day and I generally get more than eight hours. The problem is that I plan my day to get up at, say, 8am, the alarm goes off, and yet... I'm not getting out of bed until 9:30 sometimes. That *sucks* when you planned on doing something at 8:15 and cannot.

* Get into a routine. One thing I'm thinking about: Making sure everything I do has a purpose. That purpose can be ""relaxation"", but once it turns into ""time wasting"", it has to stop. I don't need to be doing schoolwork 24/7, but I need to be allotting my time in such a way that everything makes sense. There should be a rhythm to my life, and there should be enough going on to make sure that even if one thing stresses me out, there are positives. Work towards goals.

I'm telling you, up until I was through with my first set of exams this semester (so the first 3-5 weeks), my efficiency was approaching 100%. Legitimately did not go on reddit for that time, and furthermore, every second of time I spent doing something was to serve a purpose--very calculated. I would recommend this if you can do it.

**Other Stuff I've Learned:**

* You really should be attending all your class periods. If there's one thing I am proud to say I have done and will do consistently, it's show up to class. A lot of kids figure they can skip a day, but it not only makes you miss that day's material, it kills your motivation.

* Going back to my previous point about finding a rhythm, I'd like to address a few things things: 
 
1. I'm a quiet guy, so for me, finding friends to do things with has been a challenge. I did come out of my comfort zone a few times this semester (I went skiing for the first time, for example), but I think the biggest thing I've learned is that you have to be an initiator. You need to be the one that brings people together more than you need to be the one who gets invited to everything. Food for thought, probably better to go to /r/seduction or /r/socialskills if you want more on that. Not much I can do this semester, but I've already gotten in contact with some old friends over the summer so I can hopefully keep my self busy... and entertained.

2. Making the distinction between setting aside time for relaxation and ""wasting time"" is an important one. I need to listen to my own advice here a little more. It's an important point. Make your free time count. Make it enjoyable so that it legitimately recharges you.

3. Bring the intensity from the start. It's much easier to start strong (and you'll tend to finish a little easier due to burnout anyway) than to start slow and try to catch up. Be a little fanatical for the first few weeks and you'll surprise yourself with how good off you are by mid-semester.

4. Don't freak out. Self-explanatory. Take action. Look up [internal locus of control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control). **YOU** are responsible for making things happen in your life. It injures you to see it in any other light. It's frustrating to be working all the time, but it's more frustrated to know you did nothing when you should have. Focus on the doing, and you'll get results. Don't count chickens, and don't live in the past or future.

* I allow myself one ""fun class"" a semester. Last semester was a programming class through the CS department. This semester was a German history class through foreign language. Every STEM major (male or female) should reward themselves with a class through the foreign language department. The ""scenery"" is *so* much better than what I had gotten used to in the Computer Science department, if you catch my drift... ;)

Since motivation is probably the biggest challenge facing people on r/GetStudying, I will provide you seven strategies from my class that are proven to be effective.

Here they are:

**1.  Use Self-Consequencing**

Use self-administered reinforcements and consequences for meeting goals for a task 

For example: *If I create an outline organizing my thesis this afternoon, I can go to a movie with my friends tonight.*



**2. Use Performance or Mastery Self-Talk**

Use thoughts or self-talk to remind and rehearse reasons for why you should do or persist in a task 

Examples:  
""I am really starting to get this""

""If I answer all the study questions in my text, it will help me get a good grade on the exam.""

""If I answer the study questions, I will really understand how global warming works."" 



**3. Increase your Interest**

Remind yourself of the value in persisting or completing a task and finding ways to increase immediate enjoyment or situational interest in the task.

For example:  Talk to somebody who really enjoys the task to find out what they like about it 



**4. Change your Environment**

Manage the resources and the environment around you to decrease off-task behaviour.

For example, study in the library rather than at home or in residence.



**5. Efficacy Management**

Deliberately attempt to increase your confidence in your ability to be successful studying or doing a task.

For example, list 10 reasons why you think you can succeed on this essay.



**6. Use Proximal Goal Setting**

Break tasks into smaller units that are easier to manage. 

For example: 
Instead of setting a goal that says... *Study Chapter 3 for my exam.*

Try… *Identify and define key terms in Chapter 3 that have a good chance of being on the exam.*



**7. Use Attribution Control**

Deliberately attribute the causes of your successes and failures to  things that are… 

- In your control 
- Changeable 

For example:  Instead of thinking…  *I didn’t do well because I’m not good at math.*

Try… *I didn’t do well because I didn’t practice answering that type of question.*

I've just done two very tough exams, one in maths another essay based.

The two modules were very different and required a lot of learning, both of the modules had little in them that one could understand, even after a semester of lectures. However, we were supposed to do essays on the topics, include extra reading and show, in short that we understood the topics. I think that a good method for learning for this style of exam may be important to many on r/getdisciplined. So here's my advice.

My style of learning was to prepare answers that would do well and then learn those. Below are my tips for 1. creating the answers, 2. for learning them.

**1. Answer creation:**

**1a**. *Speak to your colleagues.* Class mates are best and speak to more than one. Once you find out what everyone else is doing you will realise that one, you aren't as far behind as you thought, two you'll see what everyone else thinks is required.

**1b**. *Go through the lecture notes.* Your lecture notes are meant to guide you, some times they may seem daunting (especially if you've missed some key lectures). In this case speak to the lecturer, if the lecturer is not useful speak to a colleague after half an hour of trying to get to grips with it.

**1c**. *Question spotting.* Find which questions have come up before. Write down all of these questions and ADD any questions of a similar style that could occur from your lecture notes. When adding questions make sure to be as broad as possible within the framework the lecturer has provided. Look at exercise questions that have been set by your lecturer and compare these to previous exam questions, if they are similar its highly likely they’ll come up.

**1d**. *Read around the topic.* To get a good answer for your topic you need to show some extra reading. This may come in the form of academic journals or books/online resources. When reading academic journals focus on the abstract, introduction and the conclusion. 95% of papers that I have read have had all that you could ever want to put in an exam within these sections, it's often a waste of time to read more. Books/online resources often explain the concepts in layman terms and may include academic references which you can in turn refer to. This is possible for every undergraduate subject.

**1e**. Plan for each possible question within allocated time* Following from 1c: exams have a set layout that a lecturer will tell you before it comes up. Work out how long you have for each section then.

**1f**. **Structure.** *Structure* This is to be combined with your planning. Each essay should have a structure and one that you can relate to quickly. Being dyslexic I find this tough to do. My method is to initially brainstorm points and then, if possible, to find a recurrent theme within the essay. For instance, I had to write a literature review on a certain topic. I brainstormed all papers that I could think of and some important points. I then wrote the papers in chronological order, this made sense as each built on the next though an order which works for your essay is what you desire. I then came up with the recurrent METHOD, FINDINGS, WEAKNESSES/ANALYSIS way of breaking each paper down. 
Now this method must change slightly when you don’t know what question will come up. It is key here to make your answer flexible enough to cut out waffle when asked a specific question. For instance: say I had a question explain the Economics of Labour demand, this is a topic which includes value of marginal product and elasticity of demand and has 45mins allocated total. Now VMP and Elasticity of LD may also be asked as individual 15min questions. Hence I’d plan the 45min Q with an Intro, then VMP then ELD then Conc. If I were asked a 15min question on VMP I’d cut out the rest.

**1g. Colour**
I think this is the most important thing I could recommend along with timing. Buy 10 felt tip pens all of different colours and a stack of A3 (it’l be the best money you spend). Make sure you have bright visible colours that are distinguishable from each other and black.
Now say you have 4 topics to learn, I use red for topic 1, blue for topic 2, orange = 3 brown =4. On top of that I use Green as difficult to remember, pink as vital, and Black (and black only for this) as the journal author and year of publication. I then construct my answers in their major colour, but bracket each title, sub title in a green cloud and extend a line from it to the bottom of that subsection (then repeat cloud). Big subsections have a big green square and prongs on the outer side of them. I can see nearly all of my notes when I’m in an exam through this method of learning.
If you have graphs then draw the graph axis in its section’s colour. 
Also, add pictures if possible. For instance, I had to remember that an I(1) process dominated an I(0) process during persistence change. To remember this section I drew a pink stick figure with a handlebar mustache and big biceps and a top hat in a boxing ring vs a plum. The boxing ring was red, as is the persistence change section.


**2. Learning answers:**

**2a**. *Timed Answer* Firstly write your answer using the same equipment you’d use in your exam but looking at your coloured notes whilst timing the answer with a stopwatch. You’ll see very quickly whether you need to cut things or not. If you do need to cut things do so, do not think that you can write faster. I’d always recommend cutting your answers to 5mins under the allocated time limit. This gives you some scope to play within the exam and will also make you focus on the key points. This write out is a key learning process.

**2b**. *Record answer* on your phone or on a recording device record yourself, either reading the answer written in 2a or by reading your coloured notes and expanding on them in your own way.

**2c**. *Re-write answer 5 times* The first time you do this look at your notes for 10mins before, then cover them and write the answer out from memory. Place in green or pink stars anything that you forget. For the second and third times repeat above but now create a new sheet of forgotten notes for each section and look at this pre the third write up. 
For number 4, make sure that you have not seen the notes for that section for at least an hour. For number 5, no seeing for 3 hours.

**2d** *Difficulty with a specific point* If you cannot remember something then use the **look say cover write check technique**. Do it in that order and repeat until you get it, it should be the 3rd or 4th attempt.

----------------------------
And that should be enough. I’ve found that with the above, 5 times writing out and a recording means that I remember the essays/derivations and can break them up/apply them.


I hope some of it is useful.

TL;DR
Read the italics and look at what you think is appropriate for you. Focus on **communicating with others, COLOUR, timing and speaking out loud**. The above varies from module to module but I would say it takes between 5-10 days to do.

Edit: Final point, there is always time to improve. The 5 to 10 days is near true, for safety but some modules can be learnt within a day with these techniques. Give yourself as much time as possible for ease of mind, but always remember any 'I can't do it' attitude is never 100% correct. To relieve stress I cut caffeine from my diet completely, even green tea. I meditated for 15-30mins every morning see here: http://www.audiodharma.org/series/1/talk/1835/ and I always ate decent quality food (cut anything that would spike my day but end in a low ie fast food).

1358999346.0,37,self.GetStudying,17644k,[19 Right Now] Been 2 years since I've stepped foot in school. 2010 I dropped out. Got my GED last year and am starting Freshman year in College next Monday.,getmymindready,44,7,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/17644k/19_right_now_been_2_years_since_ive_stepped_foot/,"I was never a great student, it all started back in elementary school. I was doing great until 5th grade, at that time I knew I was going to graduate to junior high school so I passed the rest of my senior tests with a 65-75 range. 

I still managed to get into the city's best Junior H.S (Intermediate) because I took their art entrance exam and got accepted (You had a choice to either take the math or art talent exams). From my freshman to senior year I failed most of my classes (I got a 55 EVERY single semester in Italian every year, my Italian teacher bluntly told me that I was going to have a hard time in Highschool) and got around 60-70 in Math, Social Studies, Science. The only class I've gotten A+ in was gym. I never got held back because I cheated my way through tests, forged my parent's signatures and copied homeworks from my peers. I was ridiculed by my classmates for doing this, this was no surprised because they were all kids that lived in wealthy homes and played all sorts of instrument (I knew some to this day that went to Yale or Harvard.)

I left Junior High and went to the High School near my home. It was horrible and I had to step through metal detectors everyday because the school officers had a couple incidents where kids would bring knives and guns inside. The constant smell of weed lingered in the hallways and the teachers seemed helpless in making the students turn their lives around. I was one of these kids. The pure lack of educational reinforcement within the high school caused to me find solace by cutting class and heading home to play games on my PC instead. I'd soon buy a copy of World of Warcraft and every time a raid or event would come up I'd leave school in the middle of the day. Eventually the counselor saw this and told me to get a GED, which I declined because I though I still had it in me. 

I dropped out in late 2010 and started working full time in retail. Last year I got really interested in nursing because of my friends. I've known them since middle school and they are all going to great ivy league universities through out the country. They tried to put me back in school by convincing me to get my GED which I received July of last year. I recently switched to a part time job and am staying with one my friends who goes to a nearby university splitting rent in other to attend Community College classes.   

My Community College counselor put in English Composition, Math for Health Sciences, Fundamentals of Speech and Psychology I this semester. She also told me this is going to be hard because ""well it's nursing!"". 

I need to get my mind ready for this because it's the only chance I have to get an education again. I've been actively reading books for the last year trying to keep my grammar and english intact so that's a start I guess. Any past experiences in any Nursing education would be greatly appreciated. I'm sorry for the long essay, thank you for reading.

This advice is based on mistakes I've made through my first year of university.

**Time Management**

Of course this might be something that some people have a hold of, and some that don't. It's really important that you being some sort of schedule and routine when you're in university. It may be tempting to go out every night and get drunk and not to worry about the next day. Unfortunately I myself am not one that likes a routine. But you need to evolve your way of life around your timetable given to you. Lucky for me my timetable is fairly relaxed, there isn't many early starts and I get a long weekend. However you need to be able to manage your time effectively so that you have enough time to do your work and have fun. Even if your fun may be considered nerdy or anti-social, you do what you like and if someone doesn't like it, fuck them! Over my time at university I've found people from all walks of life. Some don't even drink, and would rather smoke the green stuff than get out. And I respect them for it, and they respect me for not getting overly drunk.

**Finance**

I think this is the first thing that you should think about before going to university. Some people like to set up a weekly budget before they go to university, however your less likely to stick to it with freshers week going on and you'll find a lot of your money to begin with will go on alcohol or things that you enjoy if you don't. Personally when I went to university I didn't budget at all and began to realise only until a couple of months ago that my student loan didn't cover the full cost of my accommodation. However you should set up a student bank account, which will allow you to have a hefty overdraft. Try not to go overboard and spend all of it before the end of your year. Of course it will increase the next year on (based on my own research) But you should definitely consider getting one of these before you head of to university. Even if you had all the money in the world it's better to be on the safe side and have an overdraft for those emergencies. 
If you work out a budget plan that's fine, do what you think is best for yourself. 

**Meeting people and being sensible**

There's been a few times where this has come into play. I didn't have the best of fresher's because I was more of a introvert at that time. My situation at the time caused me to be fairly depressed. I had moved away from home for the first time and didn't feel like meeting people. However due to some of my regular habits I was able to meet new people. And now I love meeting new people, hearing their stories and sharing interests. I encourage you to be more outgoing than you are. You would be surprised who you will meet. In my first few weeks after freshers I fell in with a stoner crew. You would think that they may have been dodgy or wanted me to do things I didn't want to do. But they were completely the opposite, they were amazingly nice and I applaud them for it. They even gave me a couple beers when I didn't have the money for it!

When I talk about sensible I mean you shouldn't go firing off your views of things to quickly. My most awkward and frankly regrettable moment was when I was arguing over Christianity vs Muslims with this girl. She seemed to take offence and I didn't really understand why, until I realised she had Muslim parents, she herself wasn't Muslim but I guess she decided to stand up for them. I regret it to this day but we are all made up and happy, even if I think she doesn't see me the same way any more...

**Keeping up with things...**

While your at university having the time of your life it's always good to stay connected with friends. With the wonders of the internet and social media now it's easier than ever to keep in contact with people. You will find that as your away from home for long periods of times you will realise that you will slowly become distant from your friends. People will move on and may even forget that you were even in your lives. It doesn't hurt to keep in contact with people, you might just regret it one day when you couldn't be bothered to have a ten minute conversation with someone you know and you see them the next time in a bar and they ask you for your name again. 

If communication with friends isn't hard enough there is always your family members to keep in contact with, someone I knew would phone home every single day to speak to their parents. I am slightly different, however I always at least try and shoot off emails to my parents updating them on things. And always have a a nice reply to look forward to within a couple hours at the most. You might also want to install and set up Skype at home for your parents so that once you've left they can use it without having to set up an account and such. It might be nice to see their faces once in a while.

You might also find there are times when you want to go home. I had a time where I felt so depressed I wanted to quit university and move back home. However I bet that feeling off and the next week I went back for a weekend. For some you may have a very long journey to get home and it may be expensive. I've included some links at the very end of this post to help you out booking journeys home (UK, sorry American readers!)
I would always recommend that you try and go home at the weekends, and never during the week when you have lectures and other sessions in your course.

**Work hard!!!**

I can't stress this enough, not only do you need to turn up to lectures, you also need to do some extra studying, without it you might fail your degree and you may be responsible for your home learning. You don't have to study in your bedroom. Find somewhere you can study, before you really get into your studies take a walk round your campus and find somewhere that might be suitable. Luckily for me I have a computer lab that is only available to computer students so I can be in there at any time (24/7) And not have to worry about anyone else distracting me.

You need to find out how you work best, it might be that you prefer utter silence when working, or you like music, try and find out before heading off to university and try and make with what you have and try not to have an impact on other students or the people you live with. So if your going to play music in the early hours of the morning. Make sure you get some headphones or turn the sound down.

Hope it helps.

Basically, think of studying like practicing for a huge performance at a play. **Reading notes** etc. is really just **familiarizing yourself with the material**. At the end of the day, you can feel REALLY familiar with it but it won't help all that much when it comes to the actual performance. I love Community but just watching it doesn't help me pull off a perfect Jeff Winger impression.

**Reviewing your notes** and summarising them etc. is like **memorising lines**. It's the base of your entire rehearsal, you have to do it but it's not quite enough.

Doing an entire **practice exam** - no peeking at solutions, setting the timer etc - is analogous to doing a **full rehearsal**. Again, you can't do one and pray you'll nail the actual one. Sure, you might do decently out of luck but the point of practice is to eliminate the need to hinge everything on chance.

Then, finally, you **review** your practice performance and make notes of your weak points. And do more questions/review notes to target those points and practice them until you're perfect. 

Again, hope all that helps! Nothing solid in terms of DO THIS AND YOU'LL GET YOUR A's, but it does show you how to shape your approach.

When it comes down to *actual studying technique*, there are plenty of things you can do. Quiz-and-recall works for some people, I follow the **Cornell method** and: 

(1) Write down notes in class using the Cornell notes style 

(2) Have an extra notebook for each subject that acts as a condensed textbook 

(3) Review the cues/questions from #1 nightly 

(4) Drizzle out practice questions and reviews over five day chunks with one rest day after (check out the five day study plan from Cornell)",,False,self,t5_2tl44,False,,,True,t3_18kqde,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/18kqde/approach_studying_like_youd_approach_a_play_if/,

I'm incredibly intelligent, articulate, and a consistently outspoken member of our high school's debate team. I've won tournaments locally and regionally, but I just didn't study. I didn't put in the time necessary for me to be able to do what I wanted on an undergraduate level. It was never a close call as to wether or not I got in. I got plain, flatly, rejected. 

It wasn't because I applied to an Ivy League school, or a school that should be beyond the reach of someone with my intellect, it was because I DID. NOT. WORK. It's as simple as that. If I applied myself, I would be receiving acceptance letters from anywhere I wanted to go. I know that this isn't true for everyone and some people do have to work in order to be successful. 

I am that smart. I just didn't apply myself. No level of intelligence is substitute for hard work. None. This subreddit exists because you all at least are trying to learn the value of hard work and studying.

It doesn't matter if the essay that is 1/3 of my grade is due tomorrow. As soon as I sit down, I get stressed, get cramps, and get headaches. I am mostly a good student: I do my projects on time, I do my homework early and I study daily. But, when the essay deadline comes up, all my classes' GPA go down because I am trying to write an essay, but all I accomplish every day is a blank page and a bunch of waste of time. My fear of writing had been building up for years that it is almost like instinct. If I am being lazy, I can push myself to be diligent again. If I am doing poorly, I will work diligently so I understand the subject better. But writing? Nothing can make me write until the very last hour. Even if it means I am going to get C+. 

For all I efforts I put into my studies and the concern I have toward my GPA and future, to see my essay bring my good GPA to mediocre just because I can't write anything, it is frustrating.

It's not even I don't like writing. I can analyze the texts the teacher gives me well and have been praised in my analysis on the writing techniques that authors uses. I view writing as a important skill that allows you to express yourself more. I am even a frequent reader god damn it.

Even then, I still have fear of writing and the fear is growing every year. I could finish my essay despite my fears in my sophomore years in high school. Now, I can't even write a word. Too much stress. I even lost hair because of god damn thing. So much homework overdue and late.

I fucking hate my parents and my teachers for implanting the idea that I suck at writing and there is no way to improve my writing into my damn subconscious. I want to express myself well. I want to write well, god damn it. My parents told me that I suck at writing and always will be, so I should stick to damn sciences. The grades of writing is important they say. I don't even care about the essay grades anymore. I just want to fucking write so I can sleep like a decent human once.

I don't know what tips you guys can give, but, after so many years of trying to erase my fears, I just feel tired. I see so many students writing something in one day, and they get B+ and they complain how bad it is. Fuck you, asshole.

*  Learn a majority of Intro Biology

* Learn a majority of Chemistry

I used to be a stellar student back in high school, 4 years ago, straight As. The moment I moved away to college everything changed. I was always excited for the new semesters, only to flunk all courses or having to abandon them to avoid the Fs. I switched programs 3 times, took all sort of classes, from chemistry to philosophy to programming. I even had to switch universities due to poor grades. It's as if I could never get down to studying (well, that is 100% the case actually).

All my life people would tell me how intelligent and great I will become, and I really DO enjoy the company of the college crowd, discussing things beyond the latest pop single, things that matter. I like the idea of learning, and working low-wage jobs has made me realize that I do, indeed, want to get things under control. 

As it stands, I am only $10 000 in debt (which is my only saving grace, really) but I know that I have a problem. Is it ADHD? I always thought that I didn't need any medication to concentrate, only to never really be able to concentrate at all. These past years are all a blur - I've learned nothing, wasted my family's money, wasted my youth. I thought that changing classes up would allow me to see what really interested me - it turns out I fail at every single thing I do lately. I can't even bring myself to start reading a book, for God's sake!

I'm now starting to see my friends graduate, whereas I've only completed 4 classes in 4 and a half years. It's beyond shameful, and I hadn't talked to anyone about it until I had to come clean to my parents this summer. I seem all right all the time, but inside, I am a mess. I do not know where to start to make things better. I cannot go on like this. I know I need to see a professional, but I am REALLY afraid that if I don't do something about school quickly, I'll lose my chance on a profession and have to work at McD's my whole life.

I apologize for my rant but I really have no idea what to do now. I know that all I had to do was sit down and study, but it seems that is too much for me. Yet I do want to turn things around, and I think that's a good start.

But the calculus handin due tomorrow? Done half of the first question, and I did that in the hour between classes today. 

It's so stupid. It's a difficult bit of work, but it's not beyond me. What's more, the only reason that it'll be difficult is that I've not been working hard enough. I keep complaining about not having enough time, but that's not true. I have loads of time, I just waste it drawing out pointless tasks (because really, I didn't need to order my herbs and spices alphabetically, and the floors didn't need cleaning). 

But I've done it again, and now I'm going to have to sit up longer and work, then feel more tired in the morning, and then get less done tomorrow. It's a awful cycle and with four weeks until this semester's exams, one that I really do need to break. 

So, any advice/tips/magic tricks ? (asks a redditor for the 382,390,239th time)

The situation is, I took a second midterm yesterday, probably answered less than half the questions, and walked out of the lecture hall feeling like I'd just gone twelve rounds with Pacquiao. There is a very high probability I am no longer passing the class. Suffice to say, I know a failed, even with a curve, and it was a pretty significant portion of my grade.

Did I study? Yes. I did the reading, did the practice problems, got pretty far along in the project we've been working on, and even singlehandedly organized a study group to go over the subject on the night before the exam.

The class is a 300 level Comp Sci class meant for Comp Sci majors and Mechanical Engineers that I was told was an Intro class. I'd never taken any programing previously, whereas many of my classmates have, and was hoping to get a sense for it in this class. Bad idea. I don't even dislike programming, but it's very apparent I'm not operating at the level expected. And I'll be the first one to say there's no excuses--it's my fault.

I seriously feel like throwing up, and it's basically been one constant stomach ache since yesterday. I'm angry at the school for setting a freshman genetics major up with this class and not warning him, I'm upset because I let my parents down (and they're the ones basically paying for my schooling), but mostly, I'm angry at myself for doing so poorly and not achieving what I set out to do. I mean, I essentially do nothing except school work. I have no job right now, I don't really have any real responsibilities, and I've never ""partied"" in my life. I had ONE THING to accomplish and I failed.

I don't think I'm a dumb person, you guys. I am the classical self-motivated kid--valedictorian, 97+ percentile ACT score, self-studied APs, state-qualified athlete. I came here as a genetics major with prehealth or grad school hopes, and already it looks like those have been trashed. This first semester of college has been a complete reversal of fortunes. 

And not to be a drama queen or anything, but I even welled up a little as I typed this, haha. It's just that I asking myself, ""where do I go from here?"" There's bad and then there's really bad, and my situation seems really, really bad.

What do I do, you guys? I have other midterms coming up before Thanksgiving, but at this point I'm so defeated I don't know if I can get enthused about the material.

I just can't ever seem to find the motivation to want to study - I get by well doing this, but it really is a detriment to a lot of other factors.

Whenever I feel behind, I don't feel the need or want to study and catch up - there's simply no motivation. The beginning of each semester I start out really well, going to lectures, staying on top of things but I really start to regress maybe 2-3 weeks into the first month of the semester.

-I keep making silly mistakes and even after reviewing the math I still don't catch them. Things like ""4 - 0 = 0"" or ""-6 * -1 = -6"" were on my last test(which I scored 4.6 when the minimum passing grade was a 5; if it weren't for things like that I'd have gotten what I needed).

-On nearly every test(not just Calculus) I end up running out of time, even without reviewing my answers. It's weird since on highschool I was always among the first to finish(and got high scores on them).

I bullshit my way through middle school and then completely gave up on high school, managing a 0.4 GPA before testing out using California's High School Proficiency Exam. 

I only took the exam to get my jaded ass out of an environment I was socially and academically uncomfortable in. Few subjects made any real sense to me beyond the humanities, and math was an impossibility altogether. 

So, I left. At 16 I was done with high school and I had my whole life ahead of me. I didn't know what to do with my new-found freedom, but I knew that I wanted nothing to do with education or academia. My closest friend had recently been accepted to UC Berkeley and was prepping for the move, an eight-hour journey by car. My friend was uninterested in living the dorm-room life so I decided I'd get ""a job"" up in the area to pay for half the cost of a small apartment.

At 17, I moved out of my parents house and into the real world. It was terrifying. My parents fronted the money to pay for my first apartment lease, something even then I knew I had no business deserving... with the intent that eventually they'd be paid back.

For the first month of my time there, I was unemployed. The economy was just beginning its crash and as a glorified high school dropout, my options were limited. So I became a dishwasher. I spent the next year of my life washing dishes while my friends and peers advanced to bigger and better things. I loved the time I spent living independently in one of the coolest cities in the country, but I wanted more.

Fast forward nearly six years, and I'm in the same position. Nearly. I just traveled the Middle East for a year, at age 23. Prior to that, I was nominated ""laziest redditor"".

Today I'm 24; I know nothing of the academic world but want nothing more than to become an investigative journalist. I'm enrolled in my local community college with minimal expectations from my family and friends. I have no girlfriend and otherwise no prospects. I have nothing to lose and EVERYTHING to gain and I'm hungry for it.

But I have something to prove to myself. I want to succeed and work my fucking ass off more than anything, which I can honestly say for the first time in my life. I can also say that, for the first time in my life, I have a dream. It's terrifying. I'm embarrassed-- I think I'm beginning to learn what ambition is. I've never thought anything of myself, yet here I am, in the midst of a college library, wondering how the fuck I'll make it through 14 units in the coming Spring semester while hopefully landing a gig with the school's newspaper. Is that even a normal semester? I don't know.

So, my question is this: how do I become a diligent student? Is it as ""easy"" as grinding gears and putting oneself to the task? I've never ""studied"" a day in my life, because frankly I thought I was not only above it, but also because I've never given a shit. Now that I'm older, in my place and ready to be a man, I don't know where to begin.

If you haven't started revising yet, 

**Do Yourself A Massive Favour... Make A Timetable And Start Revising At Least An Hour A Day Outside Of Lessons.**

Don't leave revision until the last month, because you won't pass. Don't let students from rich families, who go to Public schools take all the places at Uni!

My brothers and I, and many others I know have retaken a year, and have also retaken exams many times already - of my brothers, one is now a Radiographer, one is now doing Law in University!

**Even less hours of examinations will determine your whole future.**

This is without a doubt the worst decision the Government could possibly have taken, because as it stands Wales and Scotland will not have any changes, and probably neither will the EU or the rest of the world who do them. This will mean that most students from England will be at an even bigger disadvantage!

Sometimes I still have lessons to learn from a unit so I don't start studying until the I have gone through all the lessons (usually units have around 15 lessons or less), and then once I done that I only have a day or two to prepare for the test.

I started my freshmen year in August of 2009, and I absolutely loved my university. Over the course of my time there, I struggled with maintaining the motivation to study and attend my classes, finding the right major, and most importantly overall, having the desire to do well in school. I was even on academic probation during three of the seven semesters that I attended (not all consecutive). I finally made the decision to graduate a semester early and attend a different school. It ended up being the best decision I made.

Not even two-and-a-half weeks after graduation, I started my classes for medical billing and coding (which was very short-lived). Realizing I wanted to do something hands-on in the medical field, I switched to medical assisting/medical office assisting. Since the beginning of this new chapter in my life, my motivation has rarely faltered, and I've been doing exceptionally well. I felt that nothing could stop me. That is, until recently...

This school is for the non-traditional student and has multiple campuses scattered about throughout the state. A corporate decision was made and my original campus was shut down in June. While I miss the old one, the campus I currently attend is working out so well for me since it's located in my boyfriend's hometown and is half an hour away from my parents house (where I currently reside).

Unfortunately, in addition to attending classes at this new campus, I got a part-time job, and my motivation has been consistently decreasing. While this job is great for me in terms of working in the adult world and having some sort of income, I'm on the verge of slipping into my old habits (i.e., not studying, not doing homework until the day of, wanting to skip class, etc.). If I work a day shift, all I want to do is sleep when I get home. And when I have an evening shift, I just want to relax and screw around on the computer before I need to turn in for the night.

**Now for my question:** I'm utterly afraid that with the current state of my motivation, I'll end up repeating past occurrences. It'll ultimately piss my parents off (who are helping me pay for school) and disappoint them to the point where they don't believe in me anymore (I've already come close to that).

What can I do to assure that I won't slip any further and that I can come back from how far I've already fallen? I don't just want to do well to make everyone else proud. I want to make myself proud. Any advice or tips would be helpful. Thank you!

Psychology 369 – Applied Cognition

Chapter 6

Memory Strategies and Metacognition

**Memory Strategies** –

-  you can perform mental activities that help to improve your encoding &amp; retrieval
- levels of processing – you will generally recall information more accurately if you process it at a deep level, rather than a shallow level

- elaboration 
 - in the levels of processing approach to memory, rich processing that emphasizes the meaning of a particular concept; it also relates the concept to prior knowledge &amp; interconnected concepts already mastered
- rehearsal – silently repeating the information to be learned. Rehearsal is not considered to be an effective memory strategy
- people tend to forget information that is not distinctly different from the other memory traces in their long-term memory
 - very important when we are trying to learn people’s names

- **self-reference effect – enhance long-term memory by relating the material to our own experiences**
- encoding-specificity principle - recall is often better if the context at the time of encoding matches the context at the time when your retrieval will be tested

**Avoiding Overconfidence** –

- people believe they have highly accurate memories about their life experiences but even flashbulb memories contain errors
 - we are overconfident about our memory skills

- foresight bias – occurs when people have been studying for a future exam, and they are overconfident about how they will perform on this exam

**Strategies Emphasizing Practice**

- the total-time hypothesis – the amount that you learn depends on the total time you devote to learning (generally true)
if you simply re-read the material over &amp; over, this additional practice will not be helpful
 - “number of hours spent studying” not a good way to predict student’s GPA
 - *1 hour spent actively learning the material (deep levels of processing) is better than 2 hours of just reading it*
- the retrieval-practice effect – you try to recall important concepts from memory; if retrieval is difficult - and you succeed – your learning is enhanced
 - *retrieval practice improves test performance
- the distributed-practice effect – you will remember more material if you spread your learning trials over time (spaced learning)
 - you will remember less if you “cram” (massed learning) – learning the material all at once
 - this works for both recall and recognition tasks
- desirable difficulties - a learning situation that is somewhat challenging, but not too difficult
- a delay of at least 1 day between practice sessions is very effective in boosting long-term retention
- **testing effect – a 2nd function of tests – taking a test is an excellent way to boost your long-term recall for academic material**
- Roediger &amp; Karpicke (2006). Students asked to read short essays on a science-related project. ½ of students studied the same essays again, ½ of students took a test on the contents of the essay. Then they had to write down as much as they could recall from the essay (no feedback). Last step, everyone received final test where they wrote down their recall from the essay. Some students received final test 5 minutes after last activity (studying or taking 1st test). Others tested after delay (2 days or 1 week)
 - when students took the test only 5 minutes after the last activity, those who restudied the material performed slightly better than those who took a test on the material
 - after delay of 2 days or 1 week, *students earned much higher scores if their last activity had been taking a test*

- Roediger &amp; Karpicke (2006)
- testing provides practice on retrieving the relevant material
when students complete a 2nd test, their recall shows greater organization (versus just studying)

**Mnemonics Using Imagery**

- mnemonics: mental strategies designed to improve your memory
some mnemonics emphasize mental imagery: we mentally represent objects, actions or ideas that are not physically present

- Bower &amp; Winzenz (1970) – **when people use mental imagery, they recall more than *twice* as many items, compared with people performing simple repetition**

- **visual imagery can be a powerful strategy for enhancing memory**
- **imagery is especially effective when the items that must be recalled are shown interacting with each other**
 - if you want to remember the pair piano-toast, visualize piano chewing large piece of toast
 - visualization mnemonics are motivating &amp; interesting
- to remember unfamiliar vocabulary items, use the keyword method
 - keyword method: identify an English word that sounds similar to the new word you want to learn; create an image that links the keyword with the meaning of this new word
 - helps people who are trying to learn new English vocabulary words, vocabulary in another language, or people’s names

**Mnemonics Using Organization**

- organization: trying to bring systematic order to the material you want to learn
- we need to use deep processing to sort items into categories
- retrieval is easier when you have constructed a well-organized framework
- chunking - combine several small units into larger units
 - people recall more letters when a string of letters is grouped into meaningful, familiar units, rather than in arbitrary groups of three
hierarchy technique - system where items are arranged in a series of classes, from the most general classes to the most specific
structure &amp; organization enhance your recall
 - an outline is a type of hierarchy – it is divided into general categories &amp; each general category is further subdivided
- first-letter technique – take the 1st letter of every word you want to remember, then compose a word or sentence from those letters (colors of the rainbow – ROY G. BIV)
 - lab research does not show that this technique is effective
- **narrative technique – instructs people to make up stories that link a series of words together**
 - Bower &amp; Clark (1969) - 1 group was told to make up narrative stories using some English words
 - control group received no instructions
 - each group learned 12 lists of words
 - **people using the narrative technique recalled about 6X as many words as control group**
 - clearly an effective strategy for enhancing memory
 - used successfully with people with impaired memories
 - to improve your exam performance, you must apply these strategies
 - *students often resist using resources that could help them (web, outlines, chapter summaries, practice-test questions)*
 - college student’s study habits, study skills, and study attitudes are strong predictors of student’s grades in college",,False,self,t5_2tl44,1370300577.0,,,True,t3_1fm2n8,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1fm2n8/psych_lecture_notes_on_most_and_least_effective/,

I'm going to make the bold claim that all of these are not as important as simply focusing on the subject. You know what I mean by focusing. Don't try to 'categorize' it and make a 'skill' out of focusing.

Focusing is what a child does when she watches the lion king for the first time. It's being captivated and having your head 'inside' the story. Imagine if a kid was watching that movie while standing on her head because her friend said it helps you watch the story better, as well as watching it in 10 minute segments to ensure she's 'rested'.


The more you think about 'learning strategies' and the more you try to impose some strict mechanical system on trying to learn, the more time you spend away from actually learning the subject.

I'm going to say that most of the talk about study techniques etc, are infact just well disguised procrastination.

I think a few ideas are fairly interesting to explore, but don't look into 'study techniques' DURING the semester, only before, or after.

I'm currently at the process of getting my bachelor degree from LIS (Librarianship &amp; Information Studies), I *only* need pass the final exam and finish my bachelor thesis (which is another issue, but I guess I'll fight with that on my own). However no matter if I get accepted to the masters' programme, I'd like to improve myself in various coding skills.

The reason is, that with the knowledge I gain just in school, I'm basically predetermined to end up in a library, doing a calm, beautiful, but monotonous and terribly paid job. The way to reach something more perspective (at least in my country) yet not totally out of my field would be working with databases, either scholar, web-based, or in a combination with another job, e.g. in the library. I know it's quite vague, but that's how I feel about the issue. :)

So well, my question is - which languages and how should I learn (on a level of reading the code is enough for the start) to have a basic knowledge and a possibility of improving in the future? I know some HTML basics and I attended CSS and SQL courses in the school, but it wasn't very good so I can't remember shit.

I'm thinking about improving my HTML / getting into CSS again and definitely SQL...but then? PHP, Javascript, Python, C++... Frankly, I don't have any idea which of these could be useful in my field. Again, I really don't need to code anything advanced myself (at least not for now), I'd just like to understand the code if shown and be able to add/edit something on my own.

Also, I'm not a native English speaker so I'm not sure if I could handle an English-written textbook, so I might rather look for a more general advice, e.g. use books, use interactive online courses, get a live course with teacher (not preffered though, I'm not the richest student) etc. However if there's anything English written that is worth mentioning, feel free to recommend, I'll at least check everything. :)

First I am going to explain my situation. I have to clarify some things though. Some of you are gonna say that this isn't **that** bad. I know it could be a lot worse, but I feel like I am going downhill **quickly**.

I am 16 years old, a sophomore in high school. I go to a very respected prep school and my parents **work their butts off to pay for me to go their.** In my middle school days, I was top of the class. Like I never made a B, but I also **never** studied. It was just easy for me. Everything was. By the time I got to high school, I had developed some **really** bad habits. I expected things to just work out for me. My grades dropped. I made my first C. Then my first D. Then more C's. I would come home and sit on my iPad, and not study **at all**. My school is a tablet school, so it is mandatory that we use our iPads, and I think that they were a huge part of the problem. 

Anyway, I fell into the groove of just **not working**. And honestly, it felt great. I would relax all day. Have fun, browse the Internet. Whatever. 

This has been going on for a year now. My dad is furious. Just a few minutes a go he told me I am going no where in life. That was after receiving an email home from my teacher detailing a 65 on a math test. I have one problem: **I just can't make myself work hard. I can't.** I make elaborate plans to do it, but they only last a day, and then I am back goofing off. I feel **absolutely hopeless.** My GPA is at a 3.3 and if I don't kick it in to gear now it's gonna drop again.

I just need advice. I feel out of control, unmotivated, and hopeless. I feel so guilty for wasting the good education I was provided with. I am a sophomore with about 4 weeks left in the final semester of the year. **I need to change by then. I have to. I just need help.**

Can some one tell me what kind of colleges I should be looking at, and what I can realistically pull my GPA up to, even if I have to make straight A's? Is it hopeless, is there time to improve. 

I also need some pro tips for motivating myself. I need a schedule that **works.** I've tried 30 min on and 30 min off, but I play two sports and by the time I get home, I can't spend that 30 minutes doing fun stuff unless I wanna be up till 3. That is assuming I actually do my homework though. I just can't. 

I'm thinking trying 40 minutes on and 20 off. I just need some reassurance. Sorry for being a whiny bitch. I just feel like I'm headed over the edge.

In less then two weeks, I will be doing two exams per week and each of these exam usually require a total of 35 to 70 hours of work in their books. I will be doing this for the next 4 months or so, I have no idea if I will be able to manage it but right now I need help to organize myself to do this.  I just want to briefly mention as well that this will all be secondary level of class, nothing too fancy. Mainly algebra, arithmetic, some entry level of physics and chemistry of the 12th grade so this might seems like nothing to a lot of you. 


All of this studying will mainly be done at home or during class. My class start from 3-6PM and 7 to 10 PM Monday to Friday(exams are Wednesday and Thursday at 6PM). Right now I don’t have a job in the morning although that might change soon but for now I can devote myself fully to this. Also a reminder this is all done in a adult high school which mean none of those class be taught by a teacher,  the books as basically have all of the explanation and the teachers are only there to answers question and give me pre test. So this will require a lot of self motivation to me.


I know a lot of you can usually manage such amount of work no problem, but to me I have actually never done more than 3-4 exams over the course of one month and now I need to be able to manage to do 8 per month. In preparation I was planning on immersing myself into khanacademy to get a head start in most of the stuff I will be studying. But the main thing I wanted help with was with organising an efficient schedule and efficient studying session. Also I would GREATLY appreciate any tips or personal experience on such tight schedule.

I have so much reading to do for my university I can't seem to keep up with it. I'm a psychology major and I need to read a big number of scientific articles and book chapters. The work keeps piling up and unless I find a way to effectively cope with this huge reading list my grades will suffer. Also due to my dyslexia I read and work slower then the avarage student. 

Besides that I have the bad habit of summerising every required to read book chapter/article as good as I can causing me to sometimes waste a lot of time on information I won't eventually need. I'm scared that if I don't summarise this way, I'll miss important information that I need to know for my test. My program has the problem based learning style of education, so my only guide on what's important (or not) is a vague descriptive case.

I allready browsed around for solutions. I checked out speed reading and tried to apply it, but this method hasn't been supported by (scientific) facts, reduces comprehension and is seen as a method of just ""skimming"" through the material. So I'm not sure this could be of any help

I'm enrolled in a prestigious school that is beating my bank account into the negatives. 

 studying psychology, second year.

Rolling by with a pathetic 1.50GPA, no research or clinical experience. 

Don't know why I haven't been kicked out of school yet.

I have abysmal sleep habits and no social life. 

I work 10 hours a week, dead end job unrelated to what I want to do in the future. 

No contacts/references due to horrible social skills. 

I read slow as hell. My memory sucks. Behind in all my courses. 

I'm getting fat from being sedentary. 

I am hardly ever prepared and have no idea what the schedule of a keener should be.

I don't know where my time goes. (I'm lying. I hide in my room all day every day)

My fear of failure trumps my every attempt at improvement and change.

My ultimate goal is to be a doctor, medical doctor. Or maybe a psychiatrist. I love learning about psychology. I cruised by my science and math courses in high school and have absolutely no idea how to approach this. Med school competitive GPA: 4.0, right?

Please please please internet strangers, help me through this. 
I'm broke from tuition, and there;s no way I'm going to let myself be jobless and forever in debt and unable to satisfy my intellectual curiosity because I was lazy and never gave two shits. 

BUT i'm willing and ready to change now.

so how's about a reality check?

Time management is a huge problem. 

What's a typical keener student schedule?

How can I speed up my reading and processing abilities? shamefully admitting that it took me 8 hours to make flashcards for studying yesterday. is that unreasonable?

How can I maximize my chances for grad school admissions?

What should my short term and long term goals be? How should I prepare and execute?

AND.... What about my godawful GPA? How can I get internships or research experience with that awful digit?

HOW can this be solved, scholars of reddit?

Please tell me I have hope for grad school and will be able to get profs to recommend me.

**What can I do now, given my current situation?**

I was definitely stressed about everything from making friends, to schoolwork, to even just the little things you don't think about when you come to a new school. [See here for some context.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/13axbk/how_do_you_guys_cope_with_potentially_failing_a/) In the end, I finished with just below a 3.6 GPA on a 4.0 scale--not horrendous (I expected much worse so it was pretty serendipitous to see it work out this way), but there's definitely room for improvement.

My winter break was rather unproductive, and I'm a little mad I didn't get as much done as I wanted to originally. Yet, it was refreshing to be able relax for a bit knowing I could come back, now, and begin anew. My first day of class is this week. 

Honestly, I'm a little nervous. I'm still not completely acclimated to this new environment, and knowing me, it could be a while. But my goals remain unachieved. In that sense, there is still work to be done. That's why I'm here.

**Anyway, I was wondering if you all had any specific (or general) tips for me, or maybe just some general information regarding what you're doing differently this time around compared to last semester. I think the entire community would benefit from your input. Thanks!**

Help please?,LCS9492,24,6,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/10ezan/i_dont_remember_how_to_be_a_good_student_help/,"I have always had a big problem with letting myself be a good student. Or, rather, being the best student. When I was in elementary school, I always had the best grades in my class. Most of my teachers loved me and trusted me. I wasn't a teacher's pet, or a braggart, or anything. I just liked being the best.

Then, I entered middle school and suddenly I was bullied for being the best student. I had friends, sure. But every time I received praise from a teacher for having a well-written essay, or getting the highest on a quiz, other kids would scoff and act like I only got it because the teacher 'liked' me. I can assure you, I worked my butt off to be a good student and eventually the bully began to affect me. By the time I was in 8th grade, I purposefully started to answer things wrong on tests and homework. I was no longer the top of my class, but I was still getting good grades.



By high school, I had gotten extremely lazy. I had stopped caring about being the best student, and more about being good enough that people thought I was smart; but bad enough that no one expected anything amazing from me. If homework was only a small percentage of my grade, I wouldn't do it; I would study enough that I'd pass a test, but not enough that I would certainly ace it; I would allow my grades to be at a comfortable C in everything that I didn't particularly care about. I recognized how bad this habit had gotten my junior year, when my GPA was at a 3.2, which wasn't good enough to get into the college I wanted.



I realized I needed to step it up. I loaded my schedule with AP and Honors courses, and I did decently... Until I started to fall back into my old habits. By my senior year, my GPA was a 3.4, and still not good enough for my top college. I graduated without having been accepted anywhere because I didn't want to apply anywhere else for fear of rejection.



So now I work full-time and I'm saving for a car. I want to go to school, but I don't know how to get motivated to do it. I'll probably go to a community college and get my AA and then transfer to a University, but I don't want to have the same habits there that I had in high school. How do I change myself? I'm at a point where I don't care what others will think of me or whether THEY'LL be proud of me. I want to be proud of myself. I want to be motivated. What should I do to become a good student, Reddit? I'm at a loss.


EDIT: It's also worth mentioning that during most of my time in middle school, I was also in foster care. I had zero support from a parental figure to always do my best. In fact, my foster brothers and sisters would often treat me like a know-it-all, and acted like there was something wrong with me for enjoying homework.

Basically, in the past month, I submitted four of the five research papers for my five courses too late to be accepted by my TAs. Basically, I am going to fail four of my five courses. I don't know what to do. I obviously need to do a late withdrawl (if my registrar will even grant me them), but this is going to DESTROY my transcript for grad school. However, if I don't do a late withdrawl from the course, then it'll destroy my GPA and i'll be on academic probation and unable to take classes. But by fucking up, I've basically lost a year. The thing that is totally bumming me out is I GET school. When I submit work, I do well on it. I get buried under readings but I usually understand lectures quite well. It's also notable that I go to a pretty prestigious school that is also notoriously difficult as well. I'm just so humiliated that I couldn't FINISH these papers. I also don't know how I'm going to tell my parents that I flunked out of second year. I know I don't have to tell them, but I mean, they'll notice when I have to take summer school or a fifth year or whatever. I'm also the type of person who isn't in the financial situation to not work during the summers, because I need that money for the fall. I've fucked up. So hard. I think the worst part is, I haven't even been partying hard or anything this year. I live off campus and kind of alienated a lot of my friends that I made when I lived in a dorm because they were all rich frustrating snobs, and not good friends, the kind who just want attention from you but are never listening when you genuinely have a problem or anything, despite me always giving them ears back, and my current roommate goes home EVERY weekend. I also work about 20 hours a week. I can't even remember the last time I had fun. I just feel like I'm always sitting at my computer ""working"" either just... too slowly? Or doing dumb shit on reddit. I haven't even logged on facebook in like 3 weeks to help me do school work. I don't know how I didn't manage to keystroke more essays in this amount of time. It was a lot of work though. I don't know. But I managed it. I also think that if I tell my parents they will ask me to go home, and transfer to the shittier university in my home town. I don't think my current transcript will even let me transfer (plus my credits Ive actually been successful on are kind of low, as average grades at this school are really quite low compared to other schools) plus the late withdrawls? I'm not sure though. Maybe I could reapply as a mature student, I'll be 20 in June? Moving home would probably encourage some discipline and time management, but I really don't want to have to do my undergrad under my parents gaze. Last night I quit my main reddit account in a self rage. I don't know if I want to go to grad school even so maybe my transcript sucking wouldn't be the end of the world? I definitely know I want to finish my undergrad. I love learning, and I especially love discussions in university. I just don't love writing essays. Dropping out isn't the answer. I grasp the material, just not the realities of deadlines. 
Basically I really needed to get this off my chest. If you wanna yell at me like my parents are going to yell at me, that's fine. It's actually probably really useful. Any advice on failure and conveying this failure to my parents would be amazing. They're incredibly supportive people, always asking if there's anything they can do. Which is why I'm so ashamed at the thought of telling them.

Alright, so I want to do medicine after graduating from high school. If I want to do Medicine at an Australian University I need to:

* Get above 90% for all of my subjects (Physics, Chemistry, English, Maths)

Frankly, I failed my half-yearly exams because I thought I was studying when I actually wasn't.
To make sure I get above 90% this time, I'm going to make notes on the syllabus beforehand, practice lots of textbook questions and try and do past papers (sort of difficult as our school doesn't give these to us).

I'm ok for English and Math, but how am I supposed to approach Physics and Chemistry so that I excel in the exams? The content is not incredibly difficult but I'm still not completely sure as to how I approach studying it. I really mess up on practical tests. I think that it might have something to do with the way I act during exams.

* Get a good UMAT score (similar to the American MCAT) - 
Will do past papers, but again, advice on how to study or improve emotional intelligence/logical reasoning would be appreciated.

* Do extracurricular activities - 
I've never been a sporty person and I don't do many extracurricular things. I enjoy playing soccer but the season's coming to a close.

I have some intuitive feeling that a notion like this varies from person to person but generally should we all have an equally strong outlook on studying.

I know that we should value it to the extent that we value the goal of it, e.g. getting that occupation that we desire and that is the goal, but in reality and more specifically how should we take it?

Job prospects after graduation would also be nice.

Hey Reddit!

I'm a second-year in college who did the smart(?) thing at the time and came into school undecided on a major-- which was fine for a while, I was able to get 90% of my general ed. requirements and my lower-division writing done my first year, and the rest of it I was able to finish last quarter.

As one of my general ed. requirements I took a course in Game Systems and Design and loved it conceptually, but only did well because I was lucky and angry (in one case) enough to power through projects with a good partner most of the time. Continuing on that path, I took Intro to CS, taught in the Java programming language, really enjoyed it for the most part.

This quarter I tried to make more progress in Computer Science, opting not to follow the game design track even though it's something I really like. The major is impossible for me to finish within an acceptable period of time, but I went with something pretty close (pure Computer Science) in hope that I would be able to do some independent work with aside from school later on. (Relevant: Live in an area with a ton of tech companies, including a small handful of industry giants nearby, including Google, Western Digital, Toshiba, Blizzard, etc.)

I ended up taking Data Structures and Algorithms (CS2), 3 math classes, a CS logic/philosophy dept. requirement, and a high-level Bio requirement for an academic society, all split between this summer and fall and it was brutal. Grades aren't out yet, but I'm gonna have to retake at least two of those classes for a more acceptable grade. 

On top of that, the Computer Science department at my school is making a ton of scheduling changes, so I can't retake CS2 because the series that the original set is being replaced with will be taught in a different language. Problem here is, I was previously told that I can't repeat that class, it's an illegal repeat, etc. IN ADDITION to that, under the new set of requirements, the logic/philosophy I took is no longer a requirement, and I took the wrong version of discrete math/boolean algebra.

This brings me to my current problem. I'm considering a change of major, and I'd like it to be to something that involves writing and analysis, both of which were my absolute strongest points in high school. I love picking things apart, talking about them and how everything relates to everything else, and I'd love to know if this subreddit has any ideas for a major that focuses on those things and has viable job prospects after graduation-- I'm not really thinking about grad school at this point.

I've been looking at Pharmaceutical Science, Political Science, or something in Business.

Adding to that, would it even be wise to change my major? I'm of the mindset that I'm at college primarily to learn and as a bonus, I get a nice degree at the end. Staying in CS would give me another chance to strengthen my foundation in CS, even if it does set me back two academic quarters. But I still don't know if this is the right major for me, and I'm not sure how to look around, and it's been tough trying to figure out if I'm in the right place right now.

But my grades have been getting worse and I have no motivation at all to change it. It all started when last year I got accepted into doing the first semester of uni early, whilst still in school. I put a lot of attention onto that course and saw that my grades in school fell dramatically. I always just said that after the course had finished I would get myself back on track. That never happened (I don't think it was even there to begin with).

Two weeks ago, my family and I left for a two week long vacation. When I got back I realised how much work I had missed out on at school. I have always been a high achieving student (always top 10 in the grade), but when I got back, I was told I didn't make it this year.

I have so much work to do and catch up on, yet I just see myself wasting time away. It doesn't matter what I try do. Uninstalling games, blocking the internet. When I try to get work done, all I do is continuously let my mind wander. Whether it be thinking about that game I can play, or just thinking all the easier things I could be doing right now.

I've thought of this in the past, but never said it to anyone. But I feel like due to me being bright as a kid, and picking things up naturally in school, it has made high school (specifically extension maths), a hell of a lot harder as things don't come naturally, and I don't know how to work towards things. I have no motivation to work towards these things.

The only time I get work done is just before the task is due. And normally that work lands me a pretty good mark, so my brain doesn't see a reason to change, even though I logically know how much easier it would be if I just started doing things earlier.

However this year I have been working really hard, and now just before one of the most significant set of exams I have burnt out.

I have in the last week or 2 began to improve ensure that i have been eating properly again, and taking regular breaks however the damage was done… I was unbelievably stressed and this was definitely exacerbated by the fact that i still had so much to do! 

I am now struggling to work, I have lost motivation and work ethic. I fortunately am not as stressed as i was, partially due to listening to hypnosis CDs and Lovan, partially due to the loss of motivation.

I realise this is poorly written but I am really exhausted and I have become quite desperate to reignite my work ethic.

This is going to be a long post, I'm really struggling here in this class, and I'm not very good at being concise anyways.
 
I guess this question is more geared towards software development people.. You don't necessarily need to know Objective C to help me find a way to grasp this knowledge better. Although I'm sure it will help. 

Okay, so I'm in deep in my IOS development class.
We're a few weeks into the semester now, but the Objective C part of my class is already over. I guess we are supposed to learn more about Objective C while building our IOS apps, because the CLI portion was pretty quick, although I'm sure most of the people that know the language started learning how the whole IOS deal works with Obj C.

We have these same labs that are like 
1. Build a program that asks the user for two numbers and an operator and outputs the solution.
2. find out which of 2 numbers is greater.
3. """" even or odd
4. diameter of a circle given radius
5. this gas mileage app.

And the first round was CLI, second round was CLI using classes. and Now we're doing full blown IOS apps of them.
I'm just ceaselessly running into error after error after error. I'll debug and get it to build and it will always crash as soon as I start entering the first or second number. This has happened with every lab. I'm up to 4 so far, spending about 4-5 hours on each lab. When I get stuck I refer to old labs and example programs that were written in class and try and compare them to what I'm trying to do and sometimes it works, but I think all of my code is just riddled with logic error after logic error. I post to /r/learnprogramming about 0-2 times a day and basically get no replies just because I feel like there is so much wrong with my code.. or I'm just doing stuff so wrong and thinking it's c++ and people don't even bother. Occasionally I'll get a nice guy but I can't rely on that obviously. 
So I've been trying to read through my books and powerpoints and just can't find anything relevant at all as I flip through my IOS development book and my OBJ C development book. I feel like the class is just trucking by so fast and I really don't understand the basics, and can't figure them out at all. It all just mystifies me..
I'm used to just making my code work. When I was in C++ I understood the language. we moved at a pace where I knew when my code was right and wrong or could at least isolate the problem eventually and on my own with the help of my book and compiler. When it comes to Objective C it all just feels like patchwork and I just don't understand it thoroughly enough to get my projects done. 
Should I go outside my class for instruction? I tried that stanford IOS thing but of course I can't even get the calculator I copied from the video to work.. So how can I gain an understanding of this language rapidly enough to actually understand what I need to do in my labs? Whatever I was doing for C++ isn't working here. At a month or two into the semester I feel like I'm already responsible for so much knowledge, with no way to actually write my programs. 
I don't know what to do besides read and do a bunch of programs from the book we are already done with as a class.

Does anyone here use a voice recorder for lectures or studying/learning?

I've just started using one and have been so surprised at how useful it can be (I previously thought they were completely useless). 
Here are some uses I've found for it:

1 - I was supposed to be absent for a psych lecture, so I lend my recorder to a friend who recorded the lecture for me. While it's nice to be able to borrow notes, you can sometimes miss out on what the note taker forgot to jot down. 

2 - For readings, I use the SQ3R method. I end up thinking of a ton of review questions for every chapter, and simply don't have the time to write the answers out (in writing or typing - I'm slow :P). I just end up recording my answers and listening to them over and over when I have the time.

3 - Similar to above, I commute for 40 minutes every day (to university and back) so using that time to just plug in my voice recorder and listen to my answers is a great use of commuting time. It also seems completely useless to steal compared to an iPod or an iPad (we had a string of robberies where bus commuters had their items snatched while getting off the bus)

4 - For certain courses, such as an introductory French class or linguistics, it's nice to be able to record a TA or prof (if given permission) so you can rehearse a certain word that's been said in the lecture or tutorial.

some background first

18yo indian student here..  i graduated from high school this year, with abysmal (i.e. waaaaay below average) grades. i had a pathetic score in my JEE mains (the first stage of the national engineering entrance examination). all of this can be attributed to my addictive habits, lack of time management and lack of self control.

before bombing in both of these exams, i was considered to be one of the finest students in my state. this debacle adds insult to the injury. with my grades i have no future, at all.

out of shame and fearing for my future, i left all of my electronic devices at home, swore off the internet, bought an ultra-dumb-monochromatic-screen-phone and moved to a hostel in another city and enrolled myself in a cram school.

for the first few weeks i studied like crazy. but after that i experienced a burnout and now i'm afraid i might go back to my old ways.

for example, today i wasted an entire day playing Snakes on my phone. i didn't want to study at all. its like i lost all of my previous motivation in one go.

i'll specifically outline all of my problems here:

- after studying vigorously for a period of time, i lose my will to study unless something like a test is imminent

- i'm afraid i might start another playing-video-games-on-my-phone-addiction

- my hostel has sub-human conditions. no flush in toilets, creepy insects and lizards roaming all around, mad heat etc. i'm thinking of moving out, but i'm stuck here for this month so i have no choice.

- fear of repeating past mistakes. i'd convinced myself that if i got on the internet once, just once, i'd be doomed (because of my internet addiction)

i'm short on time, so i'll end this here. please help",,False,self,t5_2tl44,False,,,True,t3_1fzfp9,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1fzfp9/how_do_i_keep_going/,

1355460568.0,14,self.GetStudying,14tt9f,Study Better by Setting Good Study Goals,Spudst3r,20,6,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/14tt9f/study_better_by_setting_good_study_goals/,"Hi Reddit,

I posted some this information in a previous Reddit thread, but I think it's so helpful that it merits its own post.  

The content is from a University class on learning strategies.  Research shows that students exposed to the strategies below attained a higher average GPA throughout University compared to those who weren't.

So here it is:


**Setting Good Study (TASC) Goals**

Every time you sit down to study or accomplish a study task, establish a specific study goal before you begin.

For example, instead of setting a goal that says *""read chapter 3 of my textbook""*, create a goal that is more specific that includes the following about the task:

**Content** -- What you are actually trying to learn.  For example, don't just say ""read chapter 3"". Instead, preview lecture notes and the textbook to identify what specific *content* from chapter 3 you need to learn that will be on the exam.  E.g. ""The professor focused on it during lecture, so I need to learn the different stages of photosynthesis/cell breakdown from Chapter 3""  Recognize this before actually trying to learn it.

**Action** -- Define *how* you are going to learn the material.  E.g: 
""Instead of reading the textbook, I am going to select the key terms that will be on the test from the textbook and write their definitions on flash cards.""

**Standard** -- Defining how you *know* that you actually *learned* the material.  E.g. ""My standard for knowing that I understand photosynthesis/cell breakdown is by being able to explain those concepts in my own words without looking.""

**Timeline** -- Defining specifically *when* you are going to do a task, contained within a 2 hour block of time.  E.g. I will study this Monday at 2pm - 4pm.

So the whole goal would look like:

*Learn the different stages of photosynthesis/cell breakdown from Chapter 3. Write these terms down on flash cards.  My standard for knowing photosynthesis/cell breakdown is by being able to explain in it my own words without looking.  I will study from Monday 2pm to 4pm.*

Versus:

*Read chapter 3.*

-------

By following this type of approach to goal setting, you are creating a way to hold yourself *accountable* so that you can *regulate* your learning goals.  Many students set *vague* goals that are easily ignored and not strategic in what they're trying to achieve.  Aka, ""Read chapter 3"".  You will end up wasting a lot of time reading and studying content you don't need to know.

It's much more effective/time efficient to nail down the *content* you need to learn before beginning, and then targeting your learning for just that.  Avoid becoming overwhelmed by breaking your study goals into smaller study sessions of a few hours.

All of this fits into a broader approach towards studying known as *self-regulated learning.*  It involves four steps listed below:

----

**How to Incorporate Study Goals into your Learning (Self Regulated Learning)**

Here they are:

**1.  Understand the Task/Course Requirements Before Starting**

Don't begin a task or study session until you understand what you need to do.  Preview lecture notes and the textbook before reading to identify what *content* and *concepts* the course expects you to understand before you try to learn it.

Tip:  There are three types of information to be mindful of in academia:

*Explicit information* -- the concepts and expectations that are listed in the syllabus or lecture notes.  E.g. deadlines, paper requirements.

*Implicit information* -- the concepts you are expected to understand or connect with that are not stated in your course content.  To identify this information, audit the overall theme of the course to see what the professor is trying to get you to understand. 

*Socio-contextual information* -- department/faculty specific ways of doing things that you are expected to be aware of.  E.g. Engineering will have different assignment formatting standards compared to English.  Different academic cultures create different standards and expectations--so be mindful of the differences.

**2. Plan and Set Goals for the Task**

Once you understand what you need to do, set good study goals using the *TASC goal setting* process outlined above.

**3.  Start doing the Task**

Complete the task or study session as you planned.  If you have trouble motivating yourself to do the task, find ways to get motivated.  Here are some strategies if you're looking for ways to increase motivation:  http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/14ix8u/seven_strategies_to_increase_your_study_motivation/

**4. Look back and Monitor your Results**

Did you succeed in completing your goal or not?  Were you too ambitious, trying to learn too much content in two hours?  Reflect back and hold yourself accountable to whether you achieved the goal, and what changes you could bring in to improve your next goal.  If you keep doing this, your goals will keep becoming better.

I'm finding it far more difficult to make progress on studying than on my other challenges I've taken up (nofap, running, meditation, sleeps at decent times, etc.). It makes sense because like the others, I don't really have much experience of just doing a bit every day, I've only ever really crammed a week or two weeks before the exam and gotten through that way, but unlike the other focus points in my life, I'm trying to do a hell of a lot of it straight off the bat. 

It's not like I'm doing that with running; I'm doing incremental progress to avoid injury, and keep me sane. With studying, I suppose I might be injuring myself by trying to do to much, setting unrealistic goals and failing to meet them. So for the past three days or so I've been frustrated with my studying efforts. I haven't been able to understand why I can't get a grip on it, just focus in the morning and get a solid four hours done! WHY NOT? I just don't get it. I've been experiencing procrastination, simple lack of motivation, distracting myself by opening up the internet, making excuses, feeling frequent frustration, and sadness.

So what I'm attempting to do now is understand it. I have a bunch of resources to refer to (largely from reddit resources such as this one), 'how-to's of all descriptions, and I'm simply making an effort to understand this part of me, and how I can control it better, get better results and more. I'm meditating, but that's a different aspect of my life. It calms me, keeps me cool, and probably has numerous other benefits, but it's simply a different experiment in what has become my life of experiments. And I'm making a shit ton of notes, typed stuff, and noted on paper stuff. 

Hopefully this will move me further forward and get me some answers.

 I didn't think it would be this hard, I didn't think it would require quite as much effort that I have now to grasp the concepts I want to grasp. Motivation, concentration, etc. I'm a bit wired now, I suppose it's from reading about focus. Just wrote a shit ton of notes, haha.

I'll probably update with my progress, and I'll read everything you guys comment. Wish me luck. 


=============Edit 1:==============


I feel the need to clarify the sort of studying I'm wanting to be doing!

There's studying lecture material (currently Behavioural Ecology), in which I read the slides and my old notes, write more detailed notes, then memorise them in a Loci palace. Takes about an hour to two hours per lecture depending on my focus level and the difficultly of the material. 

And there's a 3000 word essay I have to do on evolutionary theories on ageing (I know, a different kettle of fish, but I feel much of the same stuff I'm reading about applies to both). Imma be focusing on this the next four days to hopefully get it finished, but maybe not, since here I am procrastinating, haha.

Ups would be that you virtually go to school for free(as it ""technically"" is a federal academy), graduate and easily make 6 figures a year sailing. 

The downs, like i said, is the regiment itself. Because it is a federal academy, you must adhere to Navy Regulations and etc.. (Cannot leave school whenever you want, set wake up time at 0615, and you can't skip classes).

But let us cut to the chase: Earlier today, I took my Electric Circuits final, and I bombed it. Now here is where the story gets pretty screwed up: I did not fail because I did not know the course material. 

It seems that I had lost ANY recall of what I studied the past two days for. The night before, I went through every conceivable example problem in the book and felt like a boss. However, come test time, I suffered primarily from speed. It took longer for me to process the question than any of my peers due to sleep deprivation. As a result, I was the last one to leave class.

I will be frank, I am probably ""up"" there on the procrastination scale, and I am unmotivated to do anything. To be more exact, I cannot apply myself. 

The reason I didn't study this year was not even because I had a busy social life, but because of mindlessly using the internet and playing games until God knows when.

So here is my tale and take from it what you will. Is there anybody who has had a similar experience procrastinating all year and getting by through dangerously close margins? Please let me know, how to change my ways for good?

I am fucked. I have been working regularly and pretty well all semester in three of the four subjects I am taking, and feel confident in those. However, I have an exam in a subject that I have not opened a book in yet (a 101 class in political science  about behavior and theory). The class seems to be based on the philosophers (Mill, Aristotle, Plato, Hobbes, Thomas Aquinas, John Locke, The Medievals, The Radicals, Machiavelli, Marx, Kant, Rawls, Habernas, Bodin and Spinoza) aswell as ontology, the michigan model, rationality model,  election theories, medias role in politics and ideological dimensions. 

I do think that the behavior part of the class is something I can do well in, but I am having huge problems even reading the theoretical stuff. They both count 50% each for the grade, and the exam is cut in half, meaning for instance 3 questions about theory and 3 in behavior. I need to pass both parts to get a grade. As much as I love many subjects in my political science programme, the ones involving philosophers just seem so... Heavy. I can't focus to save my life when trying to read the assigned articles and books, I find it bores me. I know it is essential to understand our current knowledge about the world, the questions and how politics works, but I just can not help but find it uninteresting. It does not trigger my curiosity.

So therefore I turn to you guys, that have helped me so many times before. How do you get past a class you don't care for, but you need? Or do I have to find a way to make it interesting? The task seems so big that it is hard to get started. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

end note: sorry for the rusty English and the messy post, I am not a native speaker, so I tend to mess up the grammatical part at times.

Now I'm doing a Masters. The course is so intense, with a LOT of outside reading to be done. It's only the first day, and already I feel like I'm drowning under the amount of work I've been given. The problem is, I'm not so good at doing work for myself. Turning up to classes, fine. Doing an essay, fine. But doing 'outside research' and extra reading (which is really important on this course to keep me above the minimum pass mark)... I just can't bring myself to focus. No matter how I try, I just lose interest within minutes, and find myself staring into space.

I'd also like to (with your help, please!) figure out some sort of schedule to keep me on top of all the reading that needs to be done. I'm in class every afternoon, and some mornings, and by the evening I get pretty tired and burnt out, even if all I've done is read for a couple of hours. In the evenings I also need to set aside a little time to talk to my boyfriend, as we are long distance, but don't want it to impact upon my studying!

Any advice appreciated, thanks.",,False,self,t5_2tl44,False,,,True,t3_10s1ue,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/10s1ue/starting_masters_course_need_help_with_studying/,

This summer another student and I created a website that is on its way to being a phenomenal student resource (currently at 907 student users).

The URL is [http://openleaf.me](http://openleaf.me) and it is a student-to-student networking site for sharing resources and getting study help from students all over who share your major and courses. There is also a news feed for each campus.

We have created a [screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgqCTrnb2Oo) for you to see what the website is all about before registering.

All you need to sign up is a student email address. As an avid user of the world wide web I know that this is a lot to ask so if you feel uncomfortable about giving that information away and still wanted to try out the site I will create you an account if you pm me or you can send me an email at enopanen@openleaf.me

Hopefully those of you that try out the site will find it to be a good source of information at some point. We built the site with the theme of open-data and open-information in mind and promise not to do anything sketchy with your personal information.

Also before you say anything, yes it does have some similarities to reddit. We ""borrowed"" some of our favorite features from the site we spend the majority of our time on because we feel that giving the users control of the content makes the internet better.

TL:DR [http://openleaf.me](http://openleaf.me) is an awesome student resource website that we built this summer and we won't sell your email address if you sign up.

In three weeks I will sit for my Master's program comprehensive exam. It's kind of a big deal. It's an essay exam over the four core subjects in my program.  Two of the subjects are smaller and will be administered on the same day, but the other two subjects are large and will be administered each on their own day (three days of testing total).

My plan WAS to study for the two smaller classes this week, one of the bigger classes next week, and the last class the week after next - then I would have an entire week to review everything. But this week I just could not get myself to focus and barely got through any of the material.

I'm reading over my notes from the classes and taking more notes/making study guides, but I'm having a hard time getting everything to stick. I know I could pass a multiple choice exam, but I'm worried that I won't know enough to be able to write a good essay on these subjects. 

The good news is that we will be given choices - for one subject they may give us 7 essay questions and ask us to answer 4 or 5 of them. So I don't need to know EVERYTHING.. I'm trying to focus on key concepts rather than details, but I'm a very detail oriented person, so that's hard for me.

I have 24 full days (not counting today) left to study. Any tips?

Calc - surprisingly easy and I'm not having problems with it (yet)

Chemistry II - Pretty easy lab, made a 96 on first test. But now we're in the chemical kinetics chapter, and I can't do some of the practice problems without stabbing my notebook with my pen over and over.

The first exam is on december 3rd and the second one on december 10th if that matters. The second one is known for being ""the harder one"" out of the two.

Problem: I get overwhelmed instantly, can't recall information I just read, looking at equations and can't make sense of it, and Hw instantly overwhelms me.

Attempted: 

I ran into a problem like this before in physics and the solution there was to make a strategy guide for the hw and think about the topics before reading (make logical connections before I read). I tried it on this one and it's just not working (strategy guide and diary). 

Going to the library to sever all distractions results in instant headaches. 

Sat down and started from scratch by re-readying chapters and making sure I understand concepts. It seems to be going in one ear and out the other.

Reviewing results in instant overwhelmness. 

caffeine increases the overwhelmness.

I feel the need to be able to recall all the information at an instant.

Help!,goobington,12,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1f7p32/3_weeks_away_from_completing_college_and_my/,"Before I ask for advice, here's some backstory that's important:

My first 3 1/2 years at a fairly prestigious University I was pretty driven as a student.  I wanted to make up for my mediocre study habits in High School and really make it in my area of interest at the time (medical research).  I had a pretty solid GPA my first couple of years, but things in my major (biochemistry) got pretty intense in my third and fourth year and despite how hard I worked, it dropped about ~0.3.  Because I was extremely driven towards a couple of specific grad programs I made sure to join a research lab in the hopes I could get my name on a publication as a means to help me stand out.  However, after lots of sleep deprivation due to the demanding coursework/labwork, working with an extremely abusive grad student and douchey PI, and having to take numerous courses with this one particularly sadistic instructor, my mental health took it's toll and I was basically unable to function in academia for the rest of my final year.  I wound up taking a good year off where I got therapy and also realized that my interest in pursuing a career in biomedical research was more or less of a forced interest.  I found out that my true passion was in computer and information science which I had spent hours each day studying for pleasure.  Now I've come back to finish a few remaining general education requirements and a couple of major courses in hopes that I would be in a better mental state than before to focus on school.  However, I've found myself barely able to concentrate and will have major panic attacks even when the assignments aren't nearly as difficult as what I've achieved before.  On top of that, my interest in my major has diminished entirely and I can't even force it anymore because my passions for other things have greatly taken hold.  All I can really think about is how much more meaningful my life will be once I leave this hellhole.  I did manage to get by last semester, but I'm struggling to stay afloat this time around and have both an essay and a lab report due tomorrow that I've barely done any work towards.  I luckily have 3 weeks left, but not even the thought of that is enough to get me back into focus.  I don't have that same crunch time adrenaline rush as I did before and blasting loud music doesn't help anymore.

**TL/DR Formerly driven student was mentally and emotionally beaten to a bloody pulp by insanely strenuous coursework/research, an abusive research advisor, and a particularly sadistic instructor who teaches the majority of the upper division courses.  Now has developed a new passion, but cannot focus on school because no fucks can be given and has academic PTSD**

Any suggestions as to how I can get myself focused again?  Don't simply just say ""get off the internet"" because I need it to do outside research for the lab report.

c) 2 AP exams (APUSH, AP language)
d) ACT (I'm going to try both SAT and ACT and see what works better)

f) Finals

I decided that one way to put myself under scrutiny, and perhaps help others needing motivation, was to post some sort of declartion here. So, here goes: 

1. I will not watch online TV unless when eating meals. 
2. My phone will remain off when completeing homework or studying. 
3. I am going to practive 16 SAT vocabulary words everday, and bring the cards along with me, so if given spare time, I may practice. 
4. 3/5 weekdays, I MUST complete one SAT math section.
5. 1+ SAT math section will be done on both days of the weekend.
6. I am going to follow most of what is written on this incredible, incredible [productivity guide](//www.jamesmaa.com/2012/12/02/james-maas-productivity-hacking-guide/)
7. I am going to wake up on weekends at 8:30, like [this] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn-1c2KbsiU)

Thus, will result in a lower grade for my first paper. And a lower grade on my first paper can bring down my overall grade in the class, I mean, that's how it works, right? D:

I have a huge exam coming up in December -- as important as choosing between life and death. And the syllabus is immense. 19 subjects. 

Everyone I know who's preparing for this exam is way, way ahead of me in terms of portion of syllabus completed. I'm one of the 'lazy smart' types, I don't put in much effort and end up getting passable grades. I've always been like that since school, and now, in college as well. 

The problem with this is, the exam NEEDS efforts to clear it. Like I mentioned, the syllabus is immense. I cannot possibly finish it by being what I am used to being. I NEED to study for more than 10 hours a day. 

- I'm currently clocking barely 6-7 hours a day. Try as hard as I may, I cannot push myself beyond that. 

- even when I'm studying, I catch myself staring at the pages of my book for long stretches at times. 

- I freak out when I realise how much my friends have finished, and then, ironically, I engage in self destructive behaviour by giving it all up. 

Any tips how to fix this? How to study for more than 10 hours per day? How to be more PRODUCTIVE, even with subjects you hate? Anything at all? I'm pretty desperate!

I live in north Africa where if you want to succeed, which i will define here as getting into top / high paying jobs requires you only to get the right diplomas : in this case that means getting into a top french engineering school via the competitive competitions for les ""grandes ecoles"" (many argue they are the most competitive &amp; difficult in the world at that level but i don't care about that).

Those who generally succeed in that task come from families who have a lineage of grandes ecoles graduates and have enough network &amp; money to get the right help i.e private preparatory classes who are known to have some crazy success rates.
 that's not really my situation. I've already passed the exams once and relatively failed (didn't get a top 7 school which means being in the 50 best of my (national ranking) generation) i landed much further at 289 only to get a groupe A school while i need an A+ one.
(in reality, if we take in account all nationalities including french, then you have to land in the 400 firsts of 9000 Competitors.)

it's common to retry these exams , we call a student in that situation 5/2 , there are 30+% of them and they are the ones who trust the top places in general. but i need help :

i need to change my ways &amp; habits, all of them. up until now I've relied on going through classes with just getting good marks and never studied at home (never - literally) , not doing homework had only few consequences since i was having good grades. being from a middle to low class family and my parents being uneducated i didn't really know  or had any access until very late to all of these shminblicks about school rankings &amp; selectivity being the ONLY criteria for corporate success and therefor didn't know about what i would have to face later on.
Today i'm 20 , i have 180 days to prepare for the exams and i just can't seem to sit in a chair and work enough time for it, i can't seem to focus for more than 40 minutes even in the exams i wasn't able to focus in all of their duration (they go from 4h to 6h in subjects such as Math/physics/Engineering/) and the stuff that i have so difficult that i really need to put in all the attention i can to extract the useful methods &amp; ideas from the exercises.
I met a person who succeeded from the first try, very inspirational, the dude comes from the poorest region in the country in the desert, no facebook no games no freaking laptop no girls, very smart too.

he put in something like 13to16hours per day during the last year and got it. i truly understand what made him work that much but it just doesn't seem to affect me , well beyond feelings.

I was a straight A student until 7th grade, and school seemed easy and effortless for me at the time.  Long story short I stopped taking school seriously after 7th grade, I just didn't have any motivation to go to school and do well anymore.  I really am not sure what caused it to happen because I don't remember what I was thinking at the time, but if I had to look at it now I would say I just lost an interest in school, it didn't seem like a challenge anymore.  I ended up going to highschool and basically missing 75% of my classes by the first semester.  I then left HS and went into a homeschooling program.  I forced myself to do the work the first year and I ended up getting good grades.  By the 2nd year of homeschooling I was tired of it, I found a way to cheat the system basically and not do any work.  So, I naturally didn't do any schoolwork anymore, I didn't learn shit and I ended up with good grades on my record.  

Although that seems bad, It actually ended up being a good thing.  I had a lot of free time and didn't really have any friends I enjoyed hanging out with at the time, so I just stayed home and I ended up learning a lot of things just by having an interest in what I was doing.  I ended up getting interested in games, then in learning how to make some private servers and what not. I ran a decent server and ended up making a few $'s from it, but most importantly I ended up learning a lot of shit that is actually useful in real life situations... It taught me how to critically think and solve problems.  I didn't really have anyone teaching me, it just was kinda something I fucked around with until I eventually figured out.  That was what really made it exciting for me I guess.  Anyway, because of this I ended up getting into some programming and I ended up picking up on some very basic programming skills, as well as learning how to deal with people and management of sorts.  I felt like that was more of a life experience than what i would have ever possibly learned at school, and this is what puts me in my current situation now.

So now I'm in my 3rd year at a community college and I can honestly say I have never taken it seriously in my 3 years yet.  I mean, I really, really want to take it seriously, I stress out about this shit every day, but I just don't put in the necessary effort to do it.  I know what's required to get the results that are necessary, and I know i'm more than capable of doing it.  I just can't get myself to care enough to do it, I feel as if i'm wasting my time doing this shit.  I can't help but to think the way I do, it's just the ideas that are naturally flowing through my brain.  I sometimes feel as if the idea of school is below me, I feel as though anyone is capable of memorizing a book and passing a test.  I feel like I am capable of doing big things in life, and I don't necessarily see school as the best way of doing that.  The problem is that I really don't even know what I'd do as an alternative, but for some reason I feel as though I'll figure something out if I'm not wasting 75% of my day with school + schoolwork.  It's not really much, but when I look at what I did when i was homeschooled it kinda showed me that there are other ways of doing things in life.  It wasn't really anything i'm really excited or think highly of, but it makes me doubt school because I feel as though I have benefited more towards my future on my own, and can probably do so even more if I had the time.  Now the problem is that I don't even know what it is that I want to do really, but something tells me i'll figure it out when the time comes.

I really have no questions to ask, i've just had a lot on my mind and it felt good to write that down.  I really don't even know how crazy I sound to any of you who bother to read this, but I'll gladly listen to any opinions any of you might have, whether they're good or bad.  I really don't know what to think anymore, so I could use some opinions on my situation and this seemed like the proper place

Had trouble learning one in the past.,besilentlydrawn,10,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1jlv9p/best_ways_to_study_a_new_language_had_trouble/,"It's kind of a long story, but I'm a junior in college and I just found out that I'm going to be required to take a language. I don't generally struggle with my classes as a college student a whole lot -- I've got everything down more or less at this point.

However, when I took german in high school I really struggled with it. My friends and pretty much everyone else seemed to pick it up really easily and I never really did. I was probably not as good of a student as I am now, I'll admit but I by the second year (I only took two years of it) I was kind of lost. The teacher spoke only in german most of the time and I didn't always know what she was saying (ex, came to class one day, kid next to me was intently studying his notes, though ""hm, that's strange"" and then the teacher handed back a test. I had no idea we were having a test and assumed she must have said it in german and I didn't understand).

There are a lot of reasons I might not have done well with german in high school -- me not studying well, the teacher (she was older and although very nice, she was a bit spacey), and a whole host of other reasons.

I decided to take spanish in the fall and I'll need to take 3 semesters of it, which is fine. I started working on Spanish on Duolingo and I'm doing pretty well so far! I've been making sure to work on it every day -- I think I'm on my 5th or 6th day of it now and I just got to level 4. I'm almost done the animal section.

My questions are..

Is there anything else I should be doing now? Should I make flashcards of the words that pop up on Duolingo? Should I be using another website instead/in conjunction with Duolingo?

What can I expect from a language class in college? How much harder will it be than in high school? I really want to do well in my spanish classes (B+/A) so that my GPA doesn't go downhill. I really like where it is right now! 

I also plan on getting a tutor should I need one, but I was hoping that I could more or less do this on my own, but I won't hesitate if I think I need more help.

If there's anything that anyone has to offer or share to help me out I would really appreciate it.

Other stuff:

I have been diagnosed with ""test anxiety"" and I'll be allowed to take my exams/quizzes/oral exams/whatever else someplace else instead of with the rest of the class. I'm not 100% sure how it'll work since this is new to me and I haven't dealt with it at the college yet.

I've tried both and I do notice that I lose focus when I use my breaks to watch YouTube.

On the first midterm, I got 45%. And on the second midterm, 38%. I'm obviously doing something wrong here. Normally, I'm able to show up to class, take notes, and study the day or two before the midterm and do reasonably well in all my classes, and I've never hit a wall like this before.

Here's how the class breaks down (percentages):

*Participation - 10%

*Midterms (x2) - 20% each

*Final - 20%

*Group Project - 20%

*Group Project 2 - 10%

I can reasonably estimate that I'll get at least 5% on participation, 15% on the group project, and 8% on the other group project. This means that I will ultimately need to get 75% on the final to bare minimum pass the class.

I'm a 1PD (first year in pharmacy school). I think I have a grasp in actually knowing how to study, but for some reason, I just can't find the motivation for me to study as much as my fellow classmates.

I have friends that literally study all the time- from morning to late at night. Obviously, they are getting better grades than I am, but I just can't see the value in putting yourself through that much effort and stress. These students don't necessarily LOVE the material; they do it because they tell themselves that there is no other way to go about it. They also freak out way more than I do. I really wonder if I should be adopting this state of mind. 

A little about me: I keep a planner. I make ‘to-do’ lists every morning and try to follow them. If I don’t finish everything, I carry it over to the next day. I keep up with lectures daily. When I make notes or review, I use earplugs; I don’t play music in the background. I am VERY involved with organizations on campus, and I know many of the older pharmacy students because of that. I exercise about 5 days a week (running, bodyweight exercises, yoga). I eat healthy everyday (cereal and tea every morning, and walnuts, meats, veggies, fruits throughout). I do my best to get sleep (although I usually go to bed between 1-2am right now and wake up at 8-8:30am). To me, my mentality is to stay healthy so I can perform better academically and avoid stress as much as possible. I don’t go out at all during the week. I am definitely not the type to cram. I’ve been there, and I SUCK at it. Despite all of this, I am making mainly making C’s and B’s. I know that I am capable of doing better. I actually do see myself having a lot of time on my hands. 


Here’s what I think I should fix: 
-	I am addicted to facebook, youtube, and reddit ☹. I actually do have leechblocker and chrome nanny blocked from 8am-5pm. BUT is there an effective program I can use for Safari for times when I cave in? Safari is just too easy to unblock. 
-	Reviewing notes: I really don’t know how to do this well. Do you all review daily? For how long? Do you review for all classes? Or do you guys just cram everything a few days before? How do you cram effectively? 
-	Prioritizing: I try to keep up with ALL classes, but how do I portion how much to study for each. Obviously, I try to focus on the ones that I’m doing worse in, but I don’t really know how much time to commit to each subject. 
-	Preparing for exams: I already know to study a week early.. but what does that exactly mean? Be finished with exam material and notes by then? Start reviewing notes at that time? If so, when, and how long should the sessions be? When should I do practice exams? 

Do you guys have any specific helpful hints? Or should I just suck it up and get into that stressful mode where if I don't study/memorize everything I will do bad in pharmacy school? I really appreciate any help!

I graduated Uni 5 years ago, and have had a regular job since. I have now decided to go to med school. In the UK, to attend most med schools as a graduate from a 'non-science' degree you need to do a GAMSAT - An admissions test.. 5 hour exam, in 3 parts. The next sitting is September, so i have a few months to prepare.

I'm after some pointers on studying for this after such a long break. I work full time and at night (10pm-5am). I have study guides for this particular exam, but actually getting back into the swing of studying to learn is a bit of a mystery to me.

Specifically - 
Written Communication - There is a quote or series of themed/related quotes, and I need to write about it or them. (x2)
This is to test critical thinking skills, and are assessed firstly on 'Thought and content', and secondarily on 'Organisation and expression'
Timed 30mins per essay. 

Verbal Reasoning - Multiple choice questions based on a passage, Diagram or cartoon. There is 10-12 passages, with between 4 and 9 questions per.
This is timed 100 mins for 75 questions.

Science - Multiple choice questions based on scientific information (Presented verbally or diagrammatically)
170min for 110 questions (40% Chem, 40% Bio, 20% Phys)

I feel that the written part is my weakest part. Not least because I have been using computers for 17 odd years, and as such don't write very often. My hand hurts after like 5 mins.
My plan for this part is to go through the practise question paper, and write an essay on each quote at least 2 or 3 per week, and i have some friends who are English teachers whoc will mark them harshly and send them back to me.

So, I'm actually after ways that i can make info stick, aswell as deducing which research tangents could be beneficial to the test as a whole (That's mainly for the science section) It's just been so long! I have.. Sketchy access to the nearby uni library.. I can get in there if one of my friends is there to sign me in - I'll look into getting some sort of alumni membership if needed though.

I have a packed schedule and have little time for sleep and studying. Help please? Details follow!

---

I am finishing up my Summer semester in 3 weeks and so far my focus has been terrible. My first semester last fall I did fairly okay at staying focused and paying attention in class but then I went broke and had to get a job. My job is wonderful, it relates to my major, it pays 10.60 an hour, and I get to do some on the job learning. Unfortunately, it's caused some lack of time.

My first problem starts with location. I live an hour away from my school/job. I can't afford an apartment so I am living with my girlfriend and her parents. This means no quiet time for studying and the rare times I am home, there is constant TV blaring, dogs barking, and a whole lot of stress. 

My second problem is time. This semester I start class at 8am and I am done with classes at 3pm with only 15 minute breaks (classes on this campus are only offered at one time a day). I then go to work at 3:30 and get off at 9:30. I then have an hour drive home. 

So my daily schedule looks a lot like this. 

* 6:00- wake up and drive to class. 
* 7:15- arrive at campus walk to class stop at the vending machine for breakfast 
* 7:45- Show up in the classroom. 
* 12:00- Get out of class A
* 12:15- Show up at class B
* 3:00- Get out of class B 
* 3:30- Show up at my job across town
* 9:30- Get off work and go home
* 10:45- Get home eat dinner and spend some time with my SO
* 11:30- Go to bed. Rinse. Repeat. 

That's my life Mon-Fri. I work most weekends as well but I use the extra time to catch up on sleep. 

Where am I supposed to find time to study? Fortunately next semester I get out of class at 12:30 everyday but I don't know when I will be expected to work.

So what I do for study is explain the subject to an imaginary person who doesn't understand it. That's it. But I feel like that's not active recalling (yes I'm quoting Cal Newport). I forget the things I studied.

Hello,

I've been struggling through High school and I'm finally about to finish, I have a few more months of examinations, a few classes, and I'm done, and then I can apply to a college, depending on my grades.

Throughout most of my years in school, I didn't give in much effort to my studies, I was careless, I was told I am smart, intelligent, and my grades paid up to what they said, too. My grades were hovering around 93~96% from first grade, to sixth grade. I finally entered a prestigious high school as soon as I entered seventh grade, I found it extremely hard, my grades dropped MASSIVELY, I wasn't used to study day-by-day schedule, and so on, my grades dropped from 96% to 79%. It was a huge shock to me and my family, to the point where my dad didn't believe me over the phone.

So I stayed in that high school anyway, same grades, same everything, no effort, I was careless, delinquent, all I ever wanted to do is just pass. As I entered 11th Grade, I started working really hard, I literally spent hours studying, I didn't leave my room for long, long hours, even though I did that, but at some point, I just..got burnt out, I didn't feel like studying anymore. Anyway, my grades rose up from 79% to 93%, and I was 3rd on my class, 5th in the entire scientific faculty in my school.

All of that was merely the first semester, the second semester, I felt burnt out, I couldn't get myself to study, but I did anyway, it was mostly cramming before the exam, I am really, really tired. I expect my grades to fall down to something around 81~85%.

It doesn't matter anyway, I'm entering 12th grade, with high self esteem, and I plan on studying really hard, no cramming or anything, my only problem is, I can't get myself to quit the Internet addiction, gaming, chat..etc. I also don't have a stable sleeping schedule, I sleep whenever I feel like sleeping, go out, eat at random times, I exercise very often, but I still feel like my life is just messy. 

What I'm asking is, what do you recommend me doing about my daily schedule? How can I start organizing my life before summer ends and school starts? Any advise? Also, please include how to do it.

In this post I'm going to do a little rambling about my own successes and failures this week, and then if you feel like sharing your own please do so!

Firstly the major success that is on my mind: I got all my homework due in for next week completed. I did it over the course of the weekend and I'm pretty impressed with myself. It's not a massive amount of work by anyones standards (finished off an essay, started and finished a different 2 essays, did about 25 maths questions) but I'm proud of myself for doing it. Obviously this means nothing if I can't repeat the same success next week but it takes pressure off!

The main failure I had was an exam. I basically bombed it, and I'm expecting a very bad result by my standards. It's entirely my own fault for not revising. I'll also be receiving a much more important exam result next week which I don't think I did well on either, so next week will be quite a hit to my confidence but I'm going to keep working through it. If I have to resit then so be it.

I'm an arts student in Portugal and as a result, I had a simplified version of Maths for two years, and I only had Physics and Chemistry in middle school.

Thing is, at the start of the year, I have decided I don't want to follow art as a career, so I turned to different options and found Engineering, more specifically, Mechanical Engineering. ME was the one that clicked the most with my interests, I have always loved creating stuff and figuring out how things worked, from what I've seen of ME, it would be a great major to follow. However, I need Math, Physics and Chemistry to apply.

I have started tutoring in Math and plan on learning Physics and Chemistry by myself, the problem is I have no idea where to begin. My tutor started with Probabilities on Math and I'll be following that, but I have no idea about Physics or Chemistry.

What I would like to achieve from this post is some help in getting some kind of study schedule done, the most important topics and how to learn them efficiently.

I'm from Brazil and here we have a system called Vestibular to get in the university.

So for example, the university I want has the exam in two parts, 1st one 80 objective questions on all subjects and if you get a minimum score on this one you go to the 2nd phase. Now there is a composition test and specific discursive questions for the course that you want.

In about 20 days, I have to take the [1] CHSPE and I am sorely unprepared for the math element. I've looked all over online for some practice courses, but there doesn't appear to be anything available for free besides practice tests.

To put it one way, my math skills are very lacking, and I will most definitely fail the test should I have to take it now. It would be wonderful to have someone explain basically how to study the following subjects that the test covers.

Number Sense and Operations

Patterns, Relationships, and Algebra

Data, Statistics, and Probability

Geometry and Measurement

This is a very difficult request (because this is pretty much all of high school math clustered into one test), and it is very improbable that anyone would be willing to help with this. However, I would be content if you just told me how or where to study these things to prepare for a test. I can invest huge amounts of time to studying, but if it is going to take the same amount of time it would take to study these subjects in school then I cannot do it.

What I mean to say is that I am ready and willing to put in the time to study, I just don't know how to go about doing it.

I need the most help in Algebra, so if anyone has the time to help with that it will be greatly appreciated.

Any help you can give is useful at this point, Thank you.

As a student who's used Endnote &amp; Refman, Zotero is by far the best reference app.

I can use Google Scholar, open the article and then press save in Chrome... Zotero automatically parses the entire page and saves the relevant details and saves it in the database, which is synced on my account so I can access this on any computer. This is awesome for me, as my laptop runs Ubuntu (prefer) and my desktop runs Windows. The reference database is synced across both, so it doesn't matter what I'm using. 

It will also allow me to save any relevant website which I might want to use, I just click the icon on Chrome and it handles the rest. I have never entered in anything manually on Zotero, only ever clicked the icon in Chrome. 

It's easy to get the correct referencing, always. My university uses APA which works fine in Zotero. 

In all this is a godsend, I can find articles easily and it doesn't take any extra time fixing the referencing up.

When I'm getting my ass beaten 24/7, obviously I'll run when I run, but as a full-time college student today, when I have to read so much and do so much everyday, the first thing I sacrifice in my daily schedule is exercising.

I'm pretty familiar with the forgetting curve and strategies on review. Currently, when watching a lecture (most are online). I'll 1) skim through notes before just to grasp the main concepts, 2) actually watch lecture and take notes, 3) wait about 10 minutes, then review by talking aloud the lecture while also reorganizing notes (if necessary). As far as understanding the material this has worked well it seems. 

BUT there are times when I'm pretty lazy, and I'll only do steps 1 and 2. I'll skip the review after 10 minutes. So, my question is: How can you make up that last step? I imagine it would not be as simple as going over the material again, especially if ~40 minutes have passed. In that case, would you go over the material twice? Or does that time limit even matter? 


And an extra thought: Would be it be extremely beneficial for me to review those notes before bed? I imagine they would definitely increase retention, but by how much? Is it worth it? (because thatd be an extra 1.5 hours probably to review all classes that day). 

I appreciate the upcoming responses :)

1347096240.0,8,self.GetStudying,zjt9k,Online free (fairly remedial) Algebra course?,,9,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/zjt9k/online_free_fairly_remedial_algebra_course/,"(Cross-posted: r/GetStudying, r/tutor, r/learnmath, r/matheducation)

Hello everyone,

I am a 23-year-old college senior. I aspire to be a military aviator. Part of applying for an aviator slot entails scoring favorably on qualifying tests, namely the AFOQT (Air Force Officer Qualifying Test) or the ASTB (Aviation Selection Test Battery; Navy and Marine Corps version). Both of these tests have quite a lot of algebra, and those sections weigh heavily on the pilot aptitude ranking. I have study guides for both tests, and I actually did take the AFOQT during my freshman year of college. My scores were upper average, but I feel they weren't very competitive (based on viewing numerous stats). Luckily, I can take that one again, and I've got two tries at my disposal for the ASTB.

Here's the thing. Algebra has never been my strong suite, but I honestly think that's because I wasn't particularly motivated when I was learning it in grade school. I also haven't taken any kind of algebra classes (or really had to do anything involving it) since my freshman year of college (2007). I was never very well-versed in it to begin with (just enough to pass), and after looking at some problems now, I feel like I've forgotten at least half of everything I learned.

I feel that I'm quite an intelligent person and I think I'd be able to excel at algebra if I try to effectively start from scratch. Luckily, I have plenty of time before I need to take either of those tests, since I can't even apply until I graduate (next May). I know there are various educational websites out there, but I'm wondering if there's one that teaches algebra in the form of a free course, rather than an assortment of related links and explanations. I think my best shot at getting up to speed is to genuinely start from (nearly) the ground up and I feel I can learn most effectively if it is presented to me gradually and in a structured manner. 

I know that seems remedial, but I feel that algebra is my greatest weakness academically, and it shouldn't be. I'm very capable in all other areas, I think I just need a fresh start at this one. Does anyone happen to know if there are any websites that offer such a thing? 

Taking an actual class at my university (or another school without receiving credit) is not an option due to courseload limits, timing, and money.

I know that if I'm back there, I will again be sitting there, doing nothing, and 30 minutes later I'm again smoking and just getting really tired of me.

1359555869.0,8,self.GetStudying,17k82f,Compositions have been killing me for ten years.,Grioknosz,8,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/17k82f/compositions_have_been_killing_me_for_ten_years/,"I’m 19. I will be graduating from sixth form this spring and going to university within the year. When I compare my (study) life to those of many students I see complaining about their lives on the internet, I get the impression that I have just about everything in a better state. I have no problem in getting motivated to achieve better grades and don’t seem to be facing any kinds of financial woes or social drama in the foreseeable future. But there is a reason I’m writing here, and it’s to cast a hook out to see if anyone is familiar with having the kind of crippling difficulties I've had. Maybe also to find out if “crippling” is the proper word to use in my case―I’m prepared to hear that it's not.

My case concerns writing assignments of every length. Foreign language compositions are manageable enough, but I can’t quite complete them reliably. It is with English compositions that I can hardly get started. I tend to find myself out of words, despairing that I can’t think of anything worth saying. When I am offered guiding viewpoints that I can start off writing about, I am at a loss as to how I could expand on those subjects. It’s apparently never been a case of not finding themes that I could tackle or questions that I could raise. More likely the issue lies in the simple act of writing the sentences, of putting word after word. One of my teachers has told me that I have a very straightforward and logical way of thinking about things that makes me unsuited for producing the kind of exploratory, aimless pondering and questioning that English classes require. I have also been told that I apply too much self-criticism. I know what makes poor writing, but can't produce good writing, so I end up writing nothing.

It’s strange how our English textbooks don’t mention this as one of the troubles that can befall a writer and offer advice on overcoming it. It has made me wonder if it requires such a special rare kind of mental block that nobody has bothered to consider it an issue to be taken seriously.

Accordingly, I have thought about the possibility that the whole problem is imaginary, that I am suffering from nothing more than laziness or unwillingness to seriously take on a challenge. But it’s brought so much anxiety to my studies and I even considered, for a few months, to drop out of sixth form as I didn't think it would ever let up. With these kinds of awful real consequences, surely I can’t be bringing this on myself? Not to mention that grabbing myself by the collar and getting to work on the composition has never brought any results, as my paper’s remained as nearly blank as ever. Unless the laziness is of a much more deeply-seated kind, and my mind is actively blocking any resolutions that involve engaging itself more? Has my childhood been that fucked up, that my brain chemistry has only come to enable escaping difficult situations instead of solving them? Maybe there is a skill related to growing up that everyone but me of my age has learned.

I have had this for as long as I have been receiving composition assignments. My earliest memory is from when I was 9, I had been told to finish a story whose beginning was in the textbook. I think I had to abstain from completing that assignment that time. Then did I get in the habit of acting thus every time and avoid having to learn the proper way of writing, even until ten years later? In the meantime, I have eventually completed my compositions , but usually not in time and never with grace. They have turned out lackluster and often at least partially incomplete. With some assignments that were absolutely necessary for graduating a compulsory class, I've had to resort to help from an assistant teacher. Those times, she was practically holding my hand through the process.

I've noticed before that I tend to be very confident about completing the assignment gracefully… before actually getting to work on it. Lately, this confidence has started to be whittled away as I've noticed how deceiving it has always turned out. I can’t say this realization has done much to encourage me.

Extra-curricular texts with a purpose of getting a message across, such as this one, rather than demonstrating one’s skill in composing text, have never been a problem.

One rationalization I thought up long ago is that my quiet, heavily introverted character and tendency rarely to participate in conversation has inhibited me from developing a fluency in writing and talking more than absolutely needs to be said. Or that it has led to such a sharp segregation between my “in company” and “alone” states, so that when finding myself unsupervised, all of the implicit outside pressure that shapes ours and my behavior and coerces us into talking, maintaining a conventional face and pretending to be more competent and of higher status that we really are, disappears, and leaves my mind totally free and unmotivated to take any long-term initiatives. Those explanations seem uncomfortably smug, though, and place the blame away from myself in such a way that they deserve skepticism.",,False,self,t5_2tl44,1359568749.0,,,True,t3_17k82f,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/17k82f/compositions_have_been_killing_me_for_ten_years/,

I'm having trouble getting back up.

So, a little backstory:
I just finished my last year of secondary school and am moving off into tertiary education. Nearing the end of my high school education, I really slacked off. I lost my motivation, I hit the brick wall. I got lazy, I got complacent and I no longer worked at 100%. there were some days when I just hit rock bottom, getting 40-50% on exams when I used to be between 80's and 90's. Those days I told myself, I need to get back into the right routine, and I do, for one day. Then I go back to the old lazy ""boo-rns."" In the end my marks were enough to get into the university course I want (I hope, offers don't come out for another week or so), but I want to try and transfer into a university course that requires me to get very high marks in my university course.

So, my problem is, how can I get back my motivation to do well, and how can I continue this feeling of motivation for longer than a day? I know I need to do better, but I never do anything, my motivation, nor my will is strong enough to do so.

Last semester, I got two Cs. This semester, with much more difficult classes, I got two Bs and a C+.

My other courses were Experimental Psychology and History of Psychology.

The class I got a C+ was a philosophy course on Existentialism. Here's the thing: I needed the class for a requirement. However, I had never taken a philosophy course and this class was not an introductory class. Everyone else in the class had either taken a philosophy class before or had some experience reading and interpreting philosophic literature. I had none of that experience, so it was like jumping right into the deep end. I worked my ass off, reading the books, struggling to understand and analyze. We had three essays and I got C+s, B-s, for being too general.

But none of that will appease my parents. Once they learn I received a C, they're going to clean out my bank account (only have $400 left) and take away all my electronics and devices. And be really really pissed off.

Hello /r/getstudying.

I'm a 18 year old senior in Highschool, and I'm about to graduate in a few months, and I'm struggling very much on continuing my path, I don't even know if I have dreams or ambitions, which is quite sad, indeed. Honestly, I don't know where to begin and how to complain/ask for advice, I'm really depressed because of school, I've been a delinquent and a cheater most of my school life, but in the last 2 years I've been actually working hard to earn my grades, so far I've earned my best which is 94.6% in total, I've worked so hard the last semester, I've strained and exhausted myself, and I wasn't quite pleased anyway, all my hard work and the result didn't actually satisfy me, I expected and wanted something higher, but oh well. So the second semester begins, I'm a bit laid back, careless, anxious and depressed. I've done 2 midterms so far, and my results are VERY disappointing, I got a D in both of them, which was a really huge shock to me, as I assumed that I would've aced but I actually didn't. :(

So after I receive my results, I am shocked, depressed, and simply out of hope and motivation. I know that a few tests probably don't matter, but they actually do, and even if they did not, I have other problems. I'm a bit arrogant, and I have lots of ego, I am extremely bothered by other students scoring better than me, and it really affects me negatively, accepting the fact that someone else is better than me is truly painful, but I've accepted it anyway, and I also seem to be bothered rather skeptical about myself, I don't understand stuff as quickly as others do, comprehend it as easy, let's take math as a prime example, sometimes I don't get the lesson at all, it's quite hard to follow and confusing to me, but looking at others, nobody seems to have any problem, it's starting to make me feel like I'm inferior or there is something wrong with me, and that's really one of the biggest problems, I have doubt in me about my intelligence, I don't know how to make sure I'm mentally OK and prepared for it, or I actually need special help. So in conclusion, the main reason I am very anxious and depressed is because I'm not confident or sure that I will be able to keep up with future lessons/classes. 

I've been visiting this subreddit for quite a while now, and I like what I see, almost everything seems to be helpful to me, yet I still have problems. I don't manage my time right, I don't have a good schedule, I do not study daily to plant information in my brain, I am basically a delinquent and a lazy unmotivated person, because lately I've been so unmotivated that I actually do not give a crap about anything.

I'm sorry that this might seem a little bit unorganized, English isn't my first language and I seriously need help/advice. :(",,False,self,t5_2tl44,False,,,True,t3_1bb7g7,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1bb7g7/lack_of_motivation/,

Won't it make it harder to remember because you're not in the same conditions (no music and its quiet) if you're at school for an test/exam or listening to a lecture that requires previous knowledge of older concepts learned?

I'm thinking it depends on the person which could merely answer my own question but I'm at a conundrum at the moment and need a second opinion on the matter.

Edit:

Maybe this is a more clear question:

will you still be the best at retaining that same information for use during tests or exams without any music in a really quiet room?

For the first half of the year I was cruising through the classes, getting decent grades. The only thing that changed since the first half of the year is that I now found friends at this new school and I'm slacking again. They slack; I slack. It's difficult to do things for me. I should be able to do half the things we are 'learning' in class but yet I'm struggling once again. I know for a fact, that I'd be scoring much higher and get better grades if I studied maybe 30 minutes each day but for some reason I never do. I always lie in bed before sleeping and say to myself that 'Tomorrow I'll finish my homework even if it's not due the next day and I will re-read my notes"", however I end up playing video games or just doing whatever until it's late at night where I'm cramming and scribbling my homework half assed.
What is way for me to be more dedicated towards this? When I come back from a long day of school the first thing that pops into my mind is to hop on my computer and play games with my friends and not 'Oh boy let's finish homework first so that I don't feel like shit at 11pm and wondering why I didn't do it earlier"". Sometimes I even pretend to be sick and stay at home because I know I'll get in trouble for not doing my homework properly or that I didn't prepare properly for an exam and I end up missing even more material and I'm behind on homework that will affect my grade once again.
To find out my homework for the day, I have to access the school website and once I'm there I get distracted so easily that instead of doing my homework after finding out what it is, I find myself opening up youtube, facebook or a video game. I have very little self control because I often reassure myself that I can do whatever I want now and that the homework ""isn't a lot, I can do it in 10 minutes"".

I just had a lot to say and I don't know if this is the correct subreddit, but I just had to get this off my chest somehow.

Problems;

- The rooms are warm, which makes me sleepy, if they're cold I get distracted trying to warm up.

- I find it hard to take notes (to get motivated to do so) because all the info is given to us.

- Staying focused on what the lecturer is saying is really hard for me if I'm not doing something with my hands - around this time last year I was spending lectures folding tree ornament and drawing. I doodled for most of last year when I wasn't taking notes.

- My biggest problem I've noticed; if I'm not focused completely on something (not drawing/ not got full focus on lecturer because I've zoned out) I end up focused on the feel of breathing, which feels like swaying, and I start yawning and drifting off to sleep.

I've been in and out of industrial kitchens since I was 9, and I suppose I've always been interested, but my current job as a kitchen hand has allowed me to expand my horizons to the point where I'm interested in taking it further.

I know certain programs I can enter where I can get my WACE (West Australian Certificate of Education), but that level is not high enough to enter University. 

My main point is that I want to do them separately. I'm currently in year 11, heading onto my final year of highschool. I want to attend TAFE (Technical and Further Education; like a low-level University) and start my apprenticeship, the place I'm working at is willing to take me on for work experience, but is it even possible?

Is there anything stopping me from going for it?

I have taken the ACT twice so far, scoring a 22 both times.

I am planning on taking the ACT for the third time in September.

I am starting to prepare for the ACT and I am willing to do the hard work to achieve a score of 25 or above. I never really practiced before for the other two times I took the exam. I took a class at school, but rarely went because I thought it was a waste of time. They were just reading the Princeton Review book to us.

My problem is that whenever I take the ACT I feel pressured. Whenever I take the ACT I feel like I am being pressured by the time. It becomes stuck in my head and I just start to lose concentration. I took a practice english test today. I first set up a timer for 40 minutes, and another timer for 5 minutes.

 At first I felt good, but then I got to passage three and I just slowed down so much. Then when I hit passage four I looked at the time, and everything went down hill. I couldn't understand the passage and just skipped to passage five. At that point I felt helpless. I got 31 wrong out of the 75. Which equals to about a 19. 

I went over the answers and I felt like slapping myself. I got so many EASY questions wrong. Before I looked at the answer I looked over the question I got wrong. Looked at what I put and almost every time I got the answer correct on my second guess. It was so much easier without the pressure of the time and everything seemed so clear.

I want to be able to feel like that during the test. Is there any way to achieving this?

**Updates:**
Been practice testing this whole week.
I have been focusing on just killing the questions and staying calm. 

So far I have brought up my English score from a 21 to a 24
I have also brought up my Reading from a 19 to a 22. 
I am going to work on science now.
Then next week I am going to finish with math(My highest score in math was a 25, so this might be a little tougher)

Option one is breaking it down into 10 item groups, and memorizing those groups until I know them ROCK SOLID before moving onto the next group

Option two is breaking them down into groups, but moving onto another group before having the first one SUPER good, and then lots of review?

Last semester I studied harder than I ever have before in my life for the firzt half. I literally would study 3-4 hours sometimez a lot more every day 7 days a week. It paid off. By the middle of the semezter I waz sitting on close to 100%, not a single lost mark for most of my subjects.
 Then the mid semester holidays came around and I lazed off. I took an extra week off studying, justifying to myself, hey iv just topped the class I can afford to relax a bit. Truely I started to slack off around the 18 day mark. However my study in those days carried my grade for half the semester...
After that 2-3 week break in the middle of the semester however I could no longer study. Id try to, but only manage a feeble hour or two every few days. It was impossible to build a habit like I had at the start of the semester. Fastforward to results. Iv failed 2/4 subjects. While barely passing the other two.

This pattern of only being able to hold habits for roughly 17 daya (accoding to habit streak). Is present in a lot of aspects of my life. For inatance I vowed to gym religously every day. Around the 17 day mark my car breakz down and I decide to take a day off the gym. I tried to pick up the habit again but convinced myself that maybe 3 times a week to the gym would be enough. Havent gone for a week and a half.

How do you keep a habit going after breaking it due to uncontrollable circumstance s. It seems no matter what I do. Productivity crumbles for one reason or the other Round day 17.

**1.**  Make sure I make a schedule and set goals

**2.**  Read before every class

**3.**  Use anki or notecards for pretty much every class

**4.**  Do practice problems and practice exams for every type of class

What I'm wondering is what is the best way to approach STEM classes? (gen chem 2, calculus, etc) Is it just a lot of repetition and practice problems?

I am currently taking only two difficult courses which are Italian and Gen Chem 2, I usually use Anki for Italian but still have some problems mostly because its hard writing papers in a different language. My real problem is with gen chem, I can't seem to find a good way to approach this class, I mean should I make Anki cards for details, facts, concepts, and equations then just do practice problems? 

Also I forgot to ask as well, does it matter the amount of time I study per week? Or is it more the quality? For example, would doing 2 pomodoros for each difficult class every day and 1 for easy classes every day be plenty?

I'm currently stressing out realizing it is t-minus 12 hours before my test starts. I still have a night ahead of me and the test is first thing in the morning.

Still... I'm stressed out. It's a big test. Important. I'm shivering like no other and I can only imagine I'll be lying awake for hours on end trying to repeat the material in my head and coming to realizations that I don't know it as well as I want to. I might catch myself trying to cram last minute, in spite of knowing it won't help my chances.

And if I make it: what if I suffer from a blackout or get a test with questions I didn't even get the chance to think about it.

In short, how can I calm myself down? How do I prepare for this? Any tips on how to go to the test fully prepared and with the confidence I feel I'll desperately need?

I've had lots of ""great ideas"" as to what my major should be, but I'm starting school in January, so it's about time I figure it out. 

I love science, and I'm really good with biology and I do love learning about it. But I feel that if I was going to go for a biology major, I should just go really hard and go for a degree in Biomedical Engineering (engineering is huge at the school I plan on transferring to). I'm confident that I'd be capable, as long as I pushed through my natural laziness. I also have a boyfriend in the engineering program who would be able to support me. So the pros for this major would be having a better income after graduation, but the cons would include possibly lesser quality of life during college and not doing what I absolutely love.

However, I am absolutely in love with music. I've been a saxophonist for about 8 years now, and it's always been my greatest love. Being a musician, I play a nice slew of instruments - the usual piano and guitar, plus proficiency at quite a few wind instruments, including woodwind and brass. I've also always loved teaching, so growing up, the idea of being a music teacher always sounded like a great idea. Although, these days, a career as a teacher doesn't sound as...appetizing (?) as it used to. 

But, it's hard to make a living as a musician, or so I assume. I have an inheritance I've always planned on investing into rental property (I've gone through a lot of landlord and real estate courses to prepare myself), so if I was to go for a degree in music, I'd probably do the whole real estate thing to take care of income.

Jeezus, sorry for the wall of text. I just really need help deciding what I should do about my major, or advice about how to come to the decision. I apologize if there's a better subreddit for this, and I'll gladly go there if you point me the way!

I'm 20yo, about to be 21 this year. Through my life I've had a lot of nice results. I've been a good student, I've been in my national team, and national champion for a quite a few times. Overall I've had a very good and successfull past life. 

In May, 2010, I've had a surgery due to fractured nose which I got on my match, meaning I wasn't able to do anything physical for a month. I was ok with all of that, since my season was already over and i could get 1 month vacation and then start hard again. But then shit happenned. I got rather ill, and was hospitalized for whole summer, and wasn't able to train for another year. I was so pissed at life, fucking everything I've worked for. I had no summer break due to being in a hospital. I couldn't play my sport anymore. I obviously got thrown out of a national team. My confidence was at all time low. 
But then school starts after a summer break and I get out of a hospital. I thought to myself, if I can't train, this mind as well be my school year, I'm going for straight A's (I was a straight B student before). The problem that happened was, some of my teachers found out about the state I was in, and I've exploited that. It's not that I haven't skipped classes before, but now i've been skipping them all the time. From Oct - May, I had like 250-300 skipped hours. It was so easy for me, I just said i was at doctors or in a hospital. I haven't been bad at school, but it's high school, so I didn't need to put up much effort. I did however spent a lot of time outside, partying and stuff. 
Then I enrolled in to a law school which has always been my dream. But I took the first year off, and did zero studying. I'm not 2nd time in a 1st year, and it's June. I have fallen behind so much!

But I do have one big big big problem, that I want to change. I want to get better at studying. I spend like 8hrs in a library a day at least. But I can't focus at all. 2 years of not studying and training have probably did that to me. I can spend 1hr, before taking a break, and literally read 2 pages, which i forget really soon.

Hello Reddit, 


Anyway.  I'm going to start university next year, however, my confidence was shattered today.  

Today I met with an adviser to discuss my schedule and plans for college.  I told him that I intended to major in either biomedical sciences or pharmacology and toxicology with a premedical advisement track.  

When I told him this he sort of smirked.  Now high school was not a serious time for me.  I didn't study, never did homework, and never put in 100% effort. (I know you probably hear this on reddit all the time, but it is true.)  I hovered around 91's and 92's.  I realized would college is nothing like I envisioned, and that I was not some amazingly smart genius that I thought I was.  

I asked him what was so funny, he responded by saying that the ""weed out"" courses will show my the hilarity of my ambitions.  This was the first time in my life where I wanted to burst out and cry. I knew what he meant.  I drove home and contemplated on this for a week.  I came to the conclusion, ""fuck him.""   

My question to you /r/GetStudying is simple, but complex.  How can I dominate intro courses that are designed to weed out individuals.  Specifically Biology and Chemistry. 

I went to my local goodwill and stocked up on supplies.  I purchased Chemistry: The Central Science 7th ED. Both of Cal Newport's books.  I also purchased *What Smart Students Know.*  I even found a good copy of Campbell's Biology. I also got a copy of World History I from a friend for free. All this for under 20 bucks.  I also have a school subscription to Educator.com.

I have all these resources, but I don't know what to do with them.  I don't know where to begin.  

The one thing I do know is that I have to create a schedule with all this stuff to prepare for college.  I start classes on the 26th of August.

I have an easy schedule this year.(Senior) Taking AP calculus is the only beneficial course.  

I am taking BIO 200, Chemistry 101, Calculus, and World Civilizations next year.  I don't know if I should lighten my course load or not.   

Thank you.

I, although decent at school, still try to achieve the best grade I can. Something I have used to try to succeed more in my high school is staying after school an hour each day and then walking home. Any tiny question I have about the day I stay after and ask away to all my teachers.

This has worked wonders for me so far. My grades shot up and am starting to see improvement on my tests. It's been great and it gives me a better environment to work and be productive in, which was not offered at my old school, which I am thankful for. 

Here's the problem though. I have been staying after school every day that I have almost lost my ability to self learn. Every question I have I can just ask and, so far, this hasn't been a problem. Now the problem is is that track season just started and it is right after school for an hour and a half. All teachers at my school leave around four and I'll be unable to seek extra help from my teachers when I desperately need it for days before exams and such. I'm worrying I'll see the same grades I saw at the begging of the quarter.

I don't know how I'll find extra help and the textbook, for me, honestly isn't a great reference point. Teachers don't seem to stick to it and they just kind of teach what they feel. Probably once every two weeks we need our book for something. 

**TL;DR** Have been staying after school for extra help everyday but since track season has started I am unable to seek help from my teachers.

I can already tell that this is going to be a wall of text, so if you would like to go straight to the abbreviated version, there is a TL;DR at the bottom. 

I am coming to you all out of a last ditch effort to break some sort of wall I have run into. I am hoping that I can find some sort of solace in knowing not only that others are in a similar situation as I am, but have found ways that they specifically have managed to overcome such problems.

I am currently in my fourth semester of community college, preparing to transfer to a double major in philosophy and political science in preparation for law school. I am also working part time at a grocery store to save money to help subsidize the debt that will be gained during my final years of schooling. Okay, so that’s the rundown of who I am and what I am doing, now onto my problems. 

Ever since I started higher education I seem to have been in a constant struggle with balance. When I first started, I found myself approaching schooling with an almost impeccable view of perfection of my work, and I tried very hard to achieve that perfection, but fell short. Not only short, but I fell to a low B average, something that I told myself I would never achieve. This I can attribute partially to dealing with an intense emotional depression from my girlfriend of two and a half years cheating on me with a close friend of mine and someone I trusted. (I know, typical story, typical response.) Anyways, once I got my current job I somehow managed to lose all focus on school and focus heavily on improving my work at school, and my grades had even slipped more. 

So, here I am sitting on a 2.7 GPA with two and a half semesters left and I am scared shitless. It was a very difficult experience at the end of high school for me in regards to education. I wanted and hoped I would be able to join my close group of friends in the adventure of university, but due to monetary constraints, I was forcefully persuaded to stay at home and go to community college. I took this rather personally and told myself I would never be put in that situation again. 
So up until about a week ago I was going to school full time, barely getting by, and working full time, and driving myself up a wall. It got so bad that I found myself finding downtime at work to just sneak in some study time, but this ended up stressing me out and my grades so far have not shown any sort of progress. (Currently sitting at a 3.5 in the middle of the semester.) 

I had some sort of weird epiphany and decided that I should cut work almost in half. And so this week I am working almost no hours and am able to focus more on school, but I am also running into another problem, how do I become more efficient at studying? Sure, I can and do go to the library almost all day on my off days. (I go to school two days a week.) But, with all those hours that I put into the books, my grades show B’s at best. I cannot seem to break the threshold into the A territory. 
 
Recently I also decided that since I was going back to back from work and school, my mental health was dwindling because I had no time for some positive hobbies that I enjoy, and in my opinion, thought that my study habits were failing because I was getting so frustrated so easily. So I picked up working out five to six days a week for about an hour at a time, and I am trying to apply a little bit of time weekly to playing Starcraft, a competitive video game which engages me mentally like no other entertainment can. 

These small changes have yet to show any sort of improvement or any difference at all since it has been so soon that I have changed my lifestyle. What I am coming to you guys for is or any other ways I can apply myself more, gain motivation, self-discipline, and enjoy my time in college. I know it is a lot to ask, and I hope that someone, or anyone can relate to my situation, but I feel like I’m driving myself crazy by taking on too much at once and failing at finding the sublime balance that is needed to succeed. 

Thank you all so much for reading through this. I apologize sincerely for any grammatical errors made. I am rather rushed this evening so I drafted this in one sitting. 

**TL;DR** Community college student with many responsibilities is having trouble finding a mental balance and achieving his goals academically. Need advice from those in similar situations.

When I was in high school I used to play this game Runescape a lot. Long story short, I ended up being pretty addicted but succeeded academically and in sports, but lacked a significant social life (which was okay bc I went to a rich private Catholic high school where there was significant drug/alcohol abuse). I logged off Runescape 3 years ago with the intention of never playing again.

I was accepted and attended a good university, University of Illinois, but this summer at the end of the school year, for some reason I decided to log on to Runescape. Long story short, addiction took hold of me fast again. I worked as an EMT this summer, (I am pre-medicine), but my every waking hour not working, I was playing this game. I spent about $1000 this summer on it (there is a gambling aspect of it that you can spend money on). I just got fed up and quit today, not renewing my membership and changing my password to something I don't know. I recognize I was/am an addict so I stopped. Took the whole summer to get me to this point but here I am.

But my question for you is, I have my MCAT next summer, I plan on taking it around July 1st. Is there any way I can transition from this video game addiction to studying for the MCAT smoothly? I don't go back to school till the 22nd, but should I start by studying for the MCAT two hours a day?

I have found that I get very anxious on the day before the exam and I end up studying the least on that day. 

What I usually do is go over the book or powerpoint notes in order to learn the material, go over the practice examples on the book, making sure I understand them. I do these for however many chapters we will be tested on and instead of reviewing on the last day, I end up studying on the late hours of the night, being unable to focus on the material or absorb it like I did a few days prior. I'm now aware that being in my house does have its effect, even if I'm not in my room where I'm usually distracted. It can be my phone, texts here and there, the lack of motivation to finish a pomodoro or the urge to stand up, drink water, eat etc.

There are just days that I have to force myself to stay at home because of our car situation so I really need advice on how to tackle this accordingly. As for learning the material, it usually takes me 4-6 pomodoros per chapter, which is 2-3 hours and most of the time I call it a day. I study starting 5 days before an exam, so it is crucial for me to review on the last day. This would mean 3 days for 3 chapters then the last 2 days for reviewing. However, I get the least amount of studying done during review.

I really need help in how I can organize myself in taking exams and how to review for them properly and not like this. One example of how I procrastinated today is how I've spent the last 4-ish hours looking at other things instead of studying for a final tomorrow. I know the first rule is to get off reddit so after this post I'll be back on tomorrow to check replies for this.

Specifically, the class is Organic I, and I will be taking Organic II and Physics I starting next week which I would need a lot of preparing with.

His day job is working the farm, his weekends are farmers market and his home life is his baby.

Me, a high school who at 1 point was getting D's &amp; C's and now is getting all A's by doing adderall no less then 4 times. It helped me understand how to do good in school and how to actually try. I use to try but i just never could fully do it, did adderall once and its been with me forever, but thats not the point of this post.

I am just trying to exspress the brain magic adderall gives. So when I take adderall it helps me pay attention like crazy just as its supposed to. But it does much more then that. It helps me learn by myself with no prior knowledge at all. Alright so when im in my astronomy class (a class that is completely hard as fuck) we were working on a quiz that I really wasnt prepared for at all. Of course I planned to take adderall this day so it would hopefully make me do better on this quiz (and it did) But yea, i litteraly didnt know much shit about it... So with the power of adderall, my brain was litteraly able to go think out a huge thought process on how all this shit could work out, I mean i took much longer then everybody but my thought process was working like a mad man as i had not enough info to work it out properly. So I was going through all the shit I had learned in the past relevant or not and by then brain was able to piece the puzzle of this hard as fucking quiz. So simple this drug helped me learned shit I thought could not be possible to learn unless instructed. It seriously is a miracle drug to me as I have pretty much changed my entire life by doing it once. If your getting all F's and you actually started to try but you just cant, I recomend adderall

TL;DR: so pretty much adderall is much more then a drug that makes you pay attention, but further alters your thought process to a degree of what I would say your brain is working at 30% (assuming it works regularly  at 5%) and can also motivate you from weeks to months by simply teaching your brain on how to learn be active in your field of study.",,False,self,t5_2tl44,False,,,True,t3_12dil6,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/12dil6/the_juicy_brain_magic_of_adderall/,

I do score in the mid 80's for most of my English exams, but I need help converting those 80's into 100%. 

I've got two English exams coming up sometime next week and they'll be based on the following literary styles/periods - I've listed the descriptions of the tasks if that helps.  

1. Medieval
2. Renaissance
3. Romantic
4. Modern
5. Postmodern 

**Task 1 - IN CLASS** *you will be required to select and read one text representing one of the literary styles you have studied this term and answer questions to show that you understand how meaning was conveyed through the particular structures and features of the language which are typical of the style and era*

**Task 2 - IN CLASS** *You will be required to read one text and analyse the ways structure and language were used effectively to convey meaning for a particular purpose and audience*

* Is there any advice you guys can give me on how to get 100% in these tests?
* Could someone please summarise the things I should know about each movement? 
* One more thing, does anyone have any websites where I can find old English exams? It would be much appreciated.",,False,self,t5_2tl44,False,,,True,t3_12cxip,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/12cxip/looking_to_get_100_how_do_i_improve/,

I have a general understanding of the concepts - chain rule, graphing, derivatives, and everything else. I was thinking of simply going to the library on Saturday and just working through every single practice problem I could find. Is this a good idea? Will it help reinforce the concepts and make sure I score higher on my next exam?

Most of the classes I've taken have been english/marketing - a manner of researching, then putting that information on paper. That's obviously not a workable solution for math, so I need to try something different. thanks in advance.

**1. Spasm/Cramps**  

how to avoid? Charlie horses, leg cramps, foot cramps, stomach cramps, you name it. I am 21 years old and lately now all nighters have been giving me these horrible cramps. I assume its because I am just not getting enough fluids. Could be because adderall dehydrates and I always forget to drink. I have updated myself to put notes around my computer or alarms telling me to drink, but does anyone else have some theories as to why this occurs? I am pulling one tonight so i have bought like 3 gatorades and intend on drinking them all. If anyone else has some ideas or what fluids I should be drinking please tell me

**2. Unable to sleep afterwards or I sleep for 1-2 hours and then I cant fall alseep**

 After I pull an all nighter and take my test or submit my essay, I go to sleep. I have made the mistake in the past of going to sleep immediately but I have read that you are supposed to go to sleep in the evening. So, for example, if I pull an all nighter I am done with my test by 6 pm, I usually ty to sleep by 7 or 8. But when I do sleep I only sleep for like an hour or even less and then I can't sleep till like 2 or 3. I have tried camomile but that doesn't really work. I sometimes have these bad cramps (refer to 1) or have to pee alot (next question), or I just can't fall alseep. I take adderall so does anyone have ideas on how to just calm the body down, unwind and just fall alseep? Should I like watch a show or play a game or read a book and just ease it in? When I do these things after an all nighter I find myself antsy and too delirious to either enjoy the activity or do it long enough

***3. Why do I pee so much after all nighters and how do I stop peeing so much?***

After all nighters I have to pee like a drunk man, every 20 seconds. Even the all nighters back freshman year where I did not drink a whole lot I used to have to pee so god damn much. THis is a huge problem during long test as you can imagine. I have tried taking creatine, read somewhere it absorbs more water. Doesnt work.
