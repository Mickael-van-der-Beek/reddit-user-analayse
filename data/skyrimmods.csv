Introducing NPC Sculptor!,acindron,110,7,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1hcgqp/edit_any_npc_within_the_game_introducing_npc/,"So I've been working on this mod for months and it's finally starting to come to fruition. It still won't be available until next month but I wanted to share some of the features that come along with it and answer any questions that you may have. 

**Skyrim In-Game NPC Editor**
*or Skyrim NPC Sculptor (haven't decided on the name)*

Here's some screenshots:

[Screen 1](http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/37693-1-1372405096.png)

*Yes, I'm aware the ""Follow Me"" is missing from Aela's dialogue, this was one of the biggest bugs with the mod that was finally fixed last night!*

[Screen 2](http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/37693-2-1372405100.png)

*Just like using showracemenu on your character, it's suggested that you keep the race and gender the same or you may experience odd occurrences. Your NPC will pose as if he/she is bound. I haven't found a fix for that yet but as soon as you're finished editing them, they will return to their normal state.*

[Screen 3](http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/37693-3-1372405100.png)

*You can use any hair mod that you've downloaded. So far we've (myself and several beta testers) had no problems with ApachiiSkyHair, Skyrim Ponytails, SGHair, Tera Hair, Oblivion Hair, etc. I suggest downloading the [Skyrim Precache Killer](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33526) to avoid CTDs if you use a lot of custom hair mods. This also applies to eye mods.*

[Screen 4](http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/37693-4-1372405101.png)

*Viola!*

FAQ:

* **What is the purpose of this mod?**
If you don’t like editing NPCs through NPC Editor or Creation Kit, this mod is for you. It will allow you to edit NPCs within the game with ease using the vanilla character creator.

* **Are there any requirements?**
Skyrim Version 1.9.32.0.8 and the latest version of The Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE) will be required to run this mod. 

* **Why isn’t it available yet?**
While I've fixed most of the problems, I'm adding a new menu option to Race Menu called ""Attire"". This will allow you to change the armor, headgear, gauntlets, and boots of the NPC. It's been a pain in the neck but it's almost finished! Note: This will only work with Vanilla gear. Sorry!

* **Will there be an MCM support for this mod?**
Yes, but only to enable/disable it during game play. You will also be able to enable/disable the ""Attire"" function altogether.

* **Will it work with custom hairs, eyes, etc.?**
Yes! There has been plenty of testing several hair and eyes mods.

* **Will this bloat my save or cause CTDs?**
Absolutely no save bloating. It shouldn't cause lag or CTDs either but further testing needs to be done to make sure. I have a fairly large team of beta testers using it for the past month and the only problems that arose have been fixed now. 

* **How did you avoid the grey-face-bug that you usually get when the facegen-data isn't properly created?**
Sleepless nights and days and TONS of help from the Nexus community. This was the most challenging feat I had to face when starting this mod. The game will not create ESP files for your characters. Everything will be stored within the game save. Three of the beta testers have changed the appearance of over 30 NPCs with absolutely no bloat either. I personally suggest you do not edit over that amount and will make that apparent with the initial release.

* **Will it work with Vampire Followers?**
Yes. There will be Dawnguard, Hearthfire and Dragonborn patches.

* **Will it be compatible with Custom Races?**
Afraid not. I don't recommend changing races for reasons mentioned above. I may eliminate that entire menu before the initial release.

* **Will it be compatible with RaceMenu?**
I’ve only done brief testing with RaceMenu but so far it seems to be working fine. However, you will not be able to use the ""Attire"" menu with this mod. Sorry.

Nexus requires a file before you put up any mod and since it's not ready, there's no way you can track it but I will be putting updates here! I will be making a video shortly of how it works even though it's easy as pie!

I hope you guys are looking forward to my mod!

|**Name**|Nexus Mod Manager|
|:-----------|:-----------|
|**Link**|http://goo.gl/5lGyw|     
|**Description**| Makes installing mods easy and fast, needed to install almost everything on the list|

Quick list of all the mods, it is ordered so you if you install them in order you should have 0 problems ingame (possible ocasional crash is inevitable, quicksave sometimes).

**IMPORTANT**: If a mod asks you to replace X file say yes to all, if you have followed instructions it's ok.

**REALLY IMPORTANT**: Sometimes the installer will ask you to update a mod when installing a complete new mod. This is because the modder named two mods too similar, press NO when asked to install the mod without replacing the other. The same way press YES when updating so you dont have 2 versions of the same mod.


**This mods do NOT CHANGE your gameplay in any way, only improve it. INSTALL IN ORDER.**

However this subreddit went from a hub where modders can talk about modding the game to r/skyrim 's request dump to keep their subreddit from filling up with this junk. I don't have an hour to sift through this place looking for relevant posts, I work full time and also play the game on top of trying to learn to be a better modder, discuss the process with my peers etc. If this subreddit can't keep itself clean it will lose the attention of people actually capable of fulfilling these requests.

Edit: I'm not necessarily advocating banning them, they can be a nice thing to have if they can be kept under control. At the moment though, we're likely to be overrun by them in the coming months.

Just my opinion, take it for what it is.

Huzzah!


The closest to release - **Falskaar**
http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1453599-trailerwip-falskaar-thread-5/
(latest thread, in a while there may be a new one cause post limit blah blah) this mod should be out maybe this month, maybe next. idk but it should be VERY soon. (95% completed)

other one's probably a while away:

**Rangers of the Red: A Journey to Valenwood** -  http://7thelement.net/home/?page_id=13 - creator of moonpaths to elsweyr is working on this mod.

**Frontier** - http://frontierskyrim.wordpress.com/ - in open alpha i believe, no nps and quests, lots of content though.

**Issgaard** - http://prometheusmod.proboards.com/ - if anyone remembers the old DUNE mod for oblivion, it's that dude again, the dune mod died though, so don't get your hopes up.

**Kamdoon** - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26398 - seems very early in development but from all the information, and the videos the author has posted, this mod is interesting, the author seems very enthusiastic, one to follow for sure.

and one you all must know about:

**Enderal: The Shards of order** - http://enderal.de/?lang=en - we all know this modding team behind nehrim. i don't need to say anything more.

**Rochebere** - http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/705069-rochebere-a-brand-new-city-coming-soon/ not really a new lands mod, but adds a massive city with quests and a guild into skyrim. get a teaser by downloading his smaller mod Syerscote - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/29381

**Luftahraan** - http://www.moddb.com/mods/luftahraan - similar to Rochebere, will add a massive city 3 times the size of whiterun to the northwest coast of skyrim.

**Skywind** - http://morroblivion.com/forums/skyrim - you know what this is. and if you don't, well just look at the name.



**Completed major lands mods:**

**Moonpaths to Elsweyr** - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/9782 - A very well designed mod, should add a few hours of enjoyment.

**The Shroud of Jotunheim** - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/32120 - Claims to have taken a whole 500+ hours to make and adds 6-10 hours in a brand new island. i haven't got to playing this, but it looks nice, you should defo check it out!

**Agent of Righteous Might** - http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33766 - Again, not a new lands mod but adds 16 new quests based on the agents of Stendarr and a new faction based around their deeds. Well worth a play.

**Special Mention**

MERP | Middle Earth Roleplaying Project - A mod i have been following for years now, way back since oblivion. the mod was shut down last year by the greedy Warner Bros.

Loved the Khajiit class and spent a lot of time in the character creator, but getting a bit into the game I don't really feel like a Khajiit, especially with the combat.

The generic male voice shout, the sword action, the unarmed fighting, if it weren't for he ability to see my character, I'd probably forget i was a Khajiit. Even in 3rd person the stance doesn't look catlike and it just seems like a Cat-man skin over a normal human. 

Any mods out there that can help with my problem?

At the moment I'm using TAB to sprint, using my thumb for W, A, S, D and the top part of my palm for TAB. I also have jump binded to CAPS, which isn't ideal as it's a little hard to reach.

Ideally I'd like jump to be TAB and sprint to be a double tap of W, this would make it so much easier to play.

I don't know how easy this would be for someone to implement, I have little to no experience with the modding of games. If it's going to be a headache to sort out then don't bother, I don't really want to put people out.

Also, when I can't find my horse, I should be able to whistle to call my horse from wherever he is.

To help you with your quest I'll provide a series of tips that'll make your life easier. I'm sure the experienced ones here know most of these, but since it appears that some are just getting started working with the Bethesda engine these tips will be a help.

This tip will show you how to quickly test your mod after you've edited something or are just working on getting something done that hasn't anything to do with quests, worlds and the like. But it will be a huge help to anyone who is more interested in scripting, testing new concepts and experimenting with things that need some fine-tuning to do right.

What you'll basically do is teleport to a cell before you load a game, you'll have less load times this way and you're ensured that it's a clean version of a game. You'll be a test character, without any skills nor quests, you'll get a full iron suit and some other basic items, but it works if you place required items nearby.

* I've made an empty Cell named [ModTest](http://i.imgur.com/QU8A3.jpg) so I can place an NPC there and experiment with him.
* Save your plugin file.
* Make sure your mod is [activated](http://i.imgur.com/d74fM.jpg) in the launcher.
* I like working in [windowed](http://i.imgur.com/juKeh.jpg) mode so I can switch between the creation kit and the game with ease.
* When you've started the game, don't rush in to load. Instead, open up the console (yes, you can!) and type in [COC](http://i.imgur.com/SlSlL.jpg) [CellId].
* You'll be teleported to the [cell](http://i.imgur.com/fMopG.jpg).
* To exit the game quickly, open up console and enter QQQ.

Features:

1. Mods are kept in a separate directory from your game.  So your data folder will stay as Vanilla and the mods will be loaded when you start the game

2. PROFILES!!!!! - You can have different mod profiles, such as my roommate doesn't like my mods so he has his own profile with his own mods

3. Local Saves per profile - you can choose to only let saves made on that profile stay with that profile

4. Nexus Integration for downloads

5. Supports NMM and Wyre Bash Installers

6. Easy overview of file conflicts

7. AND MY FAVORITE FEATURE, you can run programs such as ReProccer/Bodyslide/Automatic Variants from the profiles virtual data tree and any changes those make will be applied to your profile, so when you hit play they will be applied to skyrim and when you quit they will be saved in your profile and not in your Data folder

1360687731.0,46,self.skyrimmods,18duzl,[Mod Request] Dovahkiin shmovahkiin. A different game play experience.,Nautical_Taco,55,9,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/18duzl/mod_request_dovahkiin_shmovahkiin_a_different/,"It came to me in a dream… I had this awesome idea for a mod that would change the Skyrim game play experience. I personally have no time/ambition/experience to make it happen myself, so I wanted to set the idea loose for anyone who wants it.

Why do we have to be the dragonborn every play though? Wouldn’t it be cool to lead a different life, but still enjoy the main quest line? So here is what I am thinking, a mod that adds a dragonborne NPC into the game. Your interaction with the NPC can influence some of his choices, but they are still his. For instance, he might be inclined to stay out of the war, unless you persuade him to join the stormcloaks or the imperials; this could be achieved by completing tasks or by speech craft in some circumstances. There are a number of other plot events that one could change as well but I don’t want to throw out spoilers, just in case :D.

This could go even further by having your character play different roles. Perhaps you’re the Watson to his Sherlock, a loyal sidekick and confident. Perhaps you’re an agent of the Daedra, who attempts to battle and thwart the dragonborn at every step of the way. It could be that you are a representative of the imperials or the stormcloaks. I imagine in the scenario of the antagonist, one would have to have the dragonborn retreat or something like that and build up to an eventual defeat, towards the natural end of the game. It’s possible even that one could play the antagonist as a kind of spy who gains the dragonborn’s trust and tricks him into making poor decisions.

This would be a huge undertaking but if there is a modder out there who has the ambition it would be pretty amazing. It could work rather seamlessly with that alternate start mod I would think as well. If someone does want to attempt this project I would be willing to help in some small ways, such as voicing among others tasks. Hope you enjoyed my idea.

1348762515.0,40,self.skyrimmods,10kha8,"[REQ] A request, from a modder to mod users.",chesko256,49,9,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/10kha8/req_a_request_from_a_modder_to_mod_users/,"Mod users very frequently make requests on this subreddit, and I'd like to take some time to make a few requests of my own, from the mod-using community at large. These points are all based on my personal observations since beginning my modding activities for Skyrim in February. They are all thoughts I've had for a while now but I finally decided to coalesce them onto the same page. I hope some of this is useful, enlightening, or informative.

* **Don't assume how difficult something would be to do.** Many, many times I read something that goes along the lines of, ""Hey, if you could just do XYZ, that would be awesome. I don't think it would be that hard, but I'm not a modder, so what do I know?"" The answer to that question is generally ""nothing"" or ""not much"". If you do not understand how to technically implement a feature in the game, do not assume how difficult it would be to do it. What you may consider to be a trivial feature or detail may require quite *a lot* of work to implement.

* **Understand that Papyrus is not the source code.** The scripting system has access to only a fraction of the game's subsystems and features, and what it can do can sometimes be quite limited.  ""Write a script for it"" is not the answer to everything. Many aspects of the game are baked-in and cannot be changed right now. The Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE) is making strides here, but there will always be engine-level issues that will be insurmountable without a code-level patch (See: [Morrowind Code Patch](http://morrowind.nexusmods.com/mods/19510/)).

* **Please learn how to use Ctrl+F on your browser and use it on a mod's front page.** If you have a question or think you've found a bug (more on that in a second), the *very first thing* you should do is go on that mod's front page, press Ctrl+F (the ""Find"" feature in every major browser), and type keywords related to the problem. I'm going to guess that 90% of the time, you will get the answer you were looking for. Mod authors take the time to write this stuff down ahead of time so they don't have to answer the same questions over, and over, and over again. Don't make the first place you go the Comments section, please. *You are probably not the first person to ask the question that you're about to ask.*

* **Understand that just because you don't like something doesn't make it a bug.** Reporting a ""bug"" about something that the author intentionally did is not only a waste of the author's time, but will probably put him or her on the defensive. Use good judgement here. If there's a question as to whether or not something was intentional, just ask exactly that (""Did you mean for it to work this way?"") instead of jumping directly to ""When are you going to 'fix' this?"" Ctrl+F on the front page goes a long way here as well.

* **Don't make feature requests in the form of a bug report.** Example: Popular Mod A comes out, which makes Mod B work incorrectly. You go in the comments and ask the author of Mod B, ""When are you going to fix your mod so that it works with Mod A?"" Please don't do this. Politely ask for support to be added. Understand that compatibility is a *feature*, not a requirement to the mod's functionality. It does not matter how popular Mod A is in this equation.

* **When reporting a bug, more information is always better than less.** PMing or commenting to an author, ""I tried your mod but it didn't work, can you help me?"" is a waste of time, space, and effort for both you and the author. Provide as many details as you possibly can, including the version of Skyrim you are using and any script extenders you are playing with (and their version numbers). Let the author determine what is and is not important information.

* **Be patient.** Problems take time to fix. Don't make assumptions about how easy something would be to fix (see bullet #1). Authors can be busy and may need some time to respond to your comment or PM.

* **Understand that authors are often at the razor's edge of our patience with some issues and questions, especially ones already answered on the front page.** Years ago, before I started modding, I would sometimes get responses from authors that would be very, very terse, quick, and possibly rude. And you think, ""Hey man, I just wanted to know if Super Pony Shields was compatible with your mod, what's the big deal? What an asshole!"" Now that I've been doing this for a little while, I can now understand *very well* how an author can quickly lose their temper over questions we've already answered over, and over, and over. And over. If it's on the front page, and you didn't look, that may be a trivial transgression to you. To an author, it can be of utmost annoyance and irritation. It's like the guy in class behind you that thumps your ears. You can quickly lose your cool over something like that; the person behind you, meanwhile, says ""But it was only a thump."" Little things have a tendency to pile up over time. See bullet #3.

* **Take the time to say ""Thank you.""** Most people already do this, but it's always good to have it happen even more. Authors are fueled by basically two things, depending on their mentality: downloads and feedback in the form of comments or endorsements/ratings. I don't care about my download counter or how ""popular"" something is, but I do care about how people feel about the work. When buried under a mountain of user requests and bug reports, thank-yous (provided that they are deserved) are often the only fuel we have to keep going. So take a second to go through your Nexus or Steam Workshop profiles and find the mods you use every day, and thank the author for their hard work and contribution. It really means a lot.

I hope I wasn't being too preachy; and if I was, I hope that I at least wasn't preaching to the choir. Have a good day, enjoy your mods, and thank the authors. And pick up the Creation Kit! Anyone can do it! The best way to say ""thank you"" to a community that has given you tons of extra content and enjoyment is to pay it forward, and start producing things of your own for others to enjoy.

Thanks for reading.",,False,self,t5_2sqqh,1348762819.0,,,True,t3_10kha8,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/10kha8/req_a_request_from_a_modder_to_mod_users/,

Now there is.

This mod does what it says... It adds EPIC battles throughout SKYRIM!

While exploring the SKYRIM, you will come upon battles containing many, many NPCs spanning many, many acres of in-game ground.

At last count there are more than 1000 NEW, ANGRY NPCS and more to come!

I've tried SkyRe, Skrim Unleashed, Combat-Duel, and a bunch of one-off mods, plus more in my Nexus Mod Manager I've yet to try. It's been mostly good but I've found a problem: 

The problem is with arrows. First, I found I could--at point blank--lodge an arrow in a bandit's face and do almost no damage. Simple level/damage adjustment, right? Then I realized I could *bullseye said bandit in the face at 100 meters,* every single shot as a level 1 fresh from Helgen.

It became obvious at that point: why not make bows wildly inaccurate at low levels, and more accurate with training? That way arrows are still deadly (they are a threat to you at all times) but you can't exploit them at low levels (because you can't shoot straight) all the while being thrilling and rewarding when one of your potshots actually hits the target!

Is there a mod that does this? Scales accuracy to level while retaining high damage?

I play on master, am lvl 36 and all dragons are jokes! Some ideas on how to make them harder/better:

* Obvious stuff like more damage, health, armor and magic resist.
 * Maybe the types of dragons could have tweaked stats. For example elder dragons have high armor and health, while blood dragons have high magic resist and armor, but lower health. 
* DRAGONS CAN NO LONGER BE STAGGERED!
 * In case you didn't know, the stagger perk in destruction allows you to interrupt a dragons breath 100% of the time.

* Perhaps less ADHD dragons? (not required, it sometimes makes things interesting.)
* Larger dragons, dragons that use multiple shouts, more dragons.
 * I think there are like 4 ""ranks"" of dragons now, so maybe adding some new ranks would be a decent way of changing how much damage/hard the new dragons are. 
 * Adding new textures would be a neat way of showing the higher ranks.
 * Perhaps there could be ""lesser"" dragons, which are smaller and much weaker but appear in groups of 3-4.
 * Shouts should probably cost more souls, due to having more dragons. An example would be word 1 costs 1 soul, word 2 of a shout costs 2 and word 3 costs 3 souls for a total of 6 souls for an entire shout, up from 3. 
* Perhaps Greater / lord dragons. Much larger, uses multiple types of breath attacks, perhaps uses multiple shouts or even other types of spells. These would be rare and drop the best items either for crafting or just as loot.

* Enhanced dragon loot
 * Some people may not want dragons to drop legendary armor or weapons, and that makes sense. Adding new loot to dragons such as horns, teeth, leather along with scales and bones could allow more uses of a downed dragon.
 * I realize this gets into other parts of the game, but having dragon scales and dragon bones used for more things would be a great way of improving loot without giving them tons of crazy gear.
   * Example: Dragon scales+other ingredients could make a potion of dragon slaying, or dragon horns (new item) + dragon bone could be used to make dragon weapons/arrows. 
 * Less serious item could be multiple dragon bones to make a dragon skull for cosmetic/decoration reasons. 
* Crazier ideas could include: Riding dragons (I know this is in progress somewhere) with the addition of dragon priests or something also riding dragons (perhaps the ""greater/ lord"" dragons?) This could be a separate mod, some people may only want enhanced dragons and not entirely new mechanics. 

I think dragons should be a bigger part of Skyrim. I loved the early fights with the dragons but was disappointed in how easy staggering made them and the fact that when you finally did kill it, it wasn't that exciting since all you get were some bones and a soul. Making dragons epic creatures that actually make you both fear them AND seek them out would go a long, long way in making a great game even better.

Which do you use? I'm curious to know which mods you all deem essential to enhancing your Skyrim experience. Might be a good way to compare and maybe learn of new, excellent mods we don't know about yet.

*(Don't include ENBs, Climates of Tamriel, texture mods or fixes. Those are given as freebies. I'm interested in your gameplay/immersion mods.)*

e: I actually got responses. Cool. I thought I'd add mine.

* **Immersive Armours** - Variety is everything. Sets a fantastic mood and really mixes it up.
* **Immersive Weapons** - As above.
* **WARZONES** - Really brings Skyrim to life. No more walking in the countryside with nothing going on but a few Kahjit.
* **Live another life** - I've played this game so many times I find the only way to mix I up now is to use this mod. No main quest to be seen. If you want to be a lowly bar assistant you can, working at the farms and cutting wood before you can save up enough money for basic armour and weapons before you can begin your life anew as an adventurer. Or, you can start as the newest member at any of the Guilds.
* **SkyUI** - Self explanatory. Should have explained that one as a freebie. Not sure why I didn't.

Ok, let's do the next five (5).

Again, here are mine:

* **Cloaks of Skyrim** - I feel that there are very few armours in the game that work well without cloaks. Most benefit immensely from a good cloak.
* **Closer Quivers and Longer Arrows v3 - Iron Arrow Quiver Replacer** - Having only an iron quiver really makes the game more immersive, I feel. None of those ridiculous looking quivers that don't match you're armour. a stiff leather quiver which doesn't change. Also longer arrows and a quiver that touches your back are a subtle enhancer that make the game feel less awkward.
* **Quality map with roads and hold boundaries** - Should have probably have classed that as a freebie. Too basic to live without, really.
* **Categorised Favourites** - Like SkyUI and Quality Map. Should have been a freebie...
* **Dance of Death** - I have found that having a killmove for every kill creates a link between the PC and the NPC during combat, and as a result it feels more immersive. A good sword and shield one-on-one can feel quite immersive with the blocking animations followed by a solid killmove. I personally set killmove chance to 100% with decapitation at 5%, and turn off the perk needs. That way decapitations are still semi-rare but the combat seems 'fuller'.

I'm looking for a mod that does the following:

* Disables level advancement in Alchemy
* Makes all alchemy perks buyable in book form (but rather expensive)
* Seriously devalues player made potions (or makes them unsellable), so they're for utility as opposed to an easy cash-cow.

This would eliminate grinding from Alchemy

* Disables level advancement for enchanting

1335885607.0,29,self.skyrimmods,t1khr,How to download removed files from the Nexus Modding sites,anonymousecontribtor,36,7,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/t1khr/how_to_download_removed_files_from_the_nexus/,"Often times files get removed from the Nexus sites, whether because the content is too extreme, the author is angry at stupid comments, or because the uploader did not own the file. Sometimes these files are very hard to obtain elsewhere on the web. Here is a little way around this problem that only works for mods uploaded since the NMM was released:

1. Let us suppose that the mod we want, mod Z, has the URL:  
http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=15611  
  
2. That number at the end is the Mod Index, which in this case is 15611.  
  
3. Since Mod Indexes are assigned sequentially, the mods created immediately before and immediately after mod Z are mods A and B with corresponding Mod Indexes of 15610 and 15612 respectively.  
  
4. Now suppose that the first file of mod Z is the file we'd like to download.  

5. Look up mod A and check the URL link for the NMM download link of the oldest file, which should look something like this:  
http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/nxm.php?mid=15610&amp;id=55047  
  
6. You will note two numbers in the URL. The first is the Mod Index while the second is the File Index. File Indexes are also assigned sequentially, but are also assigned to new files added to existing mods. This means there could be some distance between the first File Indexes on two sequential Mod Indexes.  
  
7. Now look up the URL for the NMM link for the oldest file for mod B, which might look something like:  
http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/nxm.php?mid=15612&amp;id=55055  
  
8. Provided that the following facts are true...  
-These files are the oldest files for mods A and B (and older ones haven't been deleted)  
-The first file for mod Z was uploaded after the oldest file for mod A and before the oldest file for mod B.  
...we can be certain that the File Index for mod Z's first file must be X where **55047 &lt; X &lt; 55055**.  
  
9. All that remains to download the file is trial and error of all NMM download URLs using the right Mod Index for mod Z, 15611, and all possible File Indexes, **55047 &lt; X &lt; 55055**:

I've studied voice-acting a couple of years ago and did some voice-work for a few German Oblivion mods back in the day.

I'm finally trying to get back to voice-acting and land a few more gigs - just yesterday I spoke two roles for a indy animation movie (the dude who made the Warhammer 40k soundtrack does the soundtrack for that one as well! So cool.)

I'm currently using reddit to exercise it. I voice comments [that intrigue me](http://soundcloud.com/shure_ill_voice_that/kirsten-dunst-comment-by), [that I find funny](http://soundcloud.com/shure_ill_voice_that/fox-conspiracy-comment-by) or just [plain ridiculous](http://soundcloud.com/shure_ill_voice_that/epic-high-five-comment-by) - [I ususally voice](http://soundcloud.com/shure_ill_voice_that/wallgirl-comment-from) them [over the top](http://soundcloud.com/shure_ill_voice_that/powerthirst).

So there you have a bit of range, know what the sound-equipment I use sounds like and especially what I sound like. I'm bilingual - however, English is not my first language. Sometimes you can hear a little bit of German pronounciation in there, but I will do my very best to edit that out.

If you'd like to me do a NPC, just send me PM.

I was watching Holes, and I got thinking about the old west, how it was possible for fugitives to ride into a town where they weren't heard of, like free men. This was largely due to there not being a way to alert all the towns of something that happened, other than word of mouth. I figure that the price on their head would eventually spread to other towns.

Then, I thought of Skyrim, whose law system is largely similar to the wild west. I realize that the holds are governed by separate Jarls, however, I think that if there's a mass-murdering, pillaging dragonborn going about Skyrim, word would eventually spread of their crimes.

**Here's my idea:**

After a certain threshold in bounty is reached(could be customized by the user, I was thinking ~10k, but it seems high now that I'm typing it out), it would start seeping out to the neighboring holds after a certain amount of time(could possibly show an alert on-screen, something like ""Word of your crimes has spread to other holds"")

Going to jail(or otherwise removing your bounty) would remove your bounty across all the holds, possibly after a certain amount of time.

If your bounty gets cleared in hold A, and you go to hold B before word reaches them about your bounty being cleared, guards would (obviously) still try to arrest you. The inconvenience this would cause could be alleviatied by a speech option with guards, something like ""I already served my time/cleared my bounty/etc in hold A."" You could try saying this without actually having cleared your bounty in hold A, leading to a speech check.

I have neither the time nor skill to do this, I just want to see what you guys think about this, and if any modders wanna try their hand at it, feel free.",,False,self,t5_2sqqh,False,,,True,t3_131fix,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/131fix/ideabounty_spreading_over_time/,

To spice things up a bit, my idea was to extend the quest to include pretty much every Skyrim resident in the game!

I couldn't find any mods that did this and I have a bit of programming experience, so I installed the Creation Kit to see if I could do it myself. I quickly realised that I don't have enough time to go through to learn it all properly (damn uni), so I now come to you for help...

I was thinking that any non-essential NPC could be a Target, and ideally would be revived upon the completion of the quest (perhaps as you leave the area?), so you aren't left with towns resembling graveyards.

It seems pretty easy to generate a random NPC using Match Conditions for the Reference Alias; a good example of this is in the Companions quest ""Hired Muscle"" (CR04), which can select from over 400 possible NPCs for the ""Brute"" alias (www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Hired_Muscle).

The main problem is that the Dark Brotherhood Forever quest doesn't choose from existing NPCs, but creates its own to be used exclusively for the quest, then disables them upon quest completion. It randomly chooses 1 of 10 predefined NPCs for both the Contact and the Target, though for this mod I'm really only interesting in the Targets.

This is where my knowledge fails me - I'm unsure how to modify the quest in CK to select an existing NPC as a target and later revive them, rather than creating one and later disabling them. Can anyone help me out?

Over the past twelve hours I have been running comparison screenshots of twelve different post process injectors that are commonly used by modders. Initially, this was so I could make an informed choice on my own but after collecting the vast quantity of data I felt it was only proper to share it with the community at large.

I have used 13 different screenshot locations (*Test 12 &amp; 13 has changed since original submission*) along with an Autohotkey macro to obtain uniform timing inbetween screenshots and processors. I've also used 'tai' and 'tm' to minimize NPC/UI clutter for an easier visual reference.

The tests were performed on a default Skyrim on Ultra settings with Skyrim High Resolution DLC, and the bEnableFileSelection=1 as required in SkyrimPrefs.ini for most Post Processors.

I was unable to measure the performance impact due to my hardware outpacing the software and thus I encourage you to find the injector you enjoy the most and testing it for accurate performance results. If you have questions I'll answer them for as long as I'm awake and continue upon (my) morning. Enjoy, and cheers. 

I'd like to thank all of the authors that contacted me to resolve bug issues so that their mods could be properly displayed. Finally, now that I have a scripted, simplistic process to create additional screenshots... **if you'd like a specific injector added please let me know**.

tl;dr: Sometimes showering with a troll leads to bruising the hippocampus.


*Post processors note: Some of them include additional mods to further enhance their shadows. If you perfer a particular configuration that could use some improved shadowing, consider looking into also [Realistic Lighting with Customization](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=7654) or [ULTRA REALISTIC WORLD LIGHTING](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=13531) in conjunction with your processor.

- Improved Rock and Mountain Textures - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=849.  This mod does exactly what it says.  I was blown away by how much more realistic rock formations looked.  Again, I experienced no FPS hit at all.
(This combined with Enhanced Distant Terrain make the regions around Whiterun look great)

- HD Furniture and Barrels - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=238.  I'm playing a thief right now so I see a lot of furniture up close.  I was pleasantly surprised how much nicer interiors looked with this mod.

- Enhanced Night Skyrim - http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=85.  You'll find yourself stopping just to stargaze during your night travels.

I am not affiliated in any way with the creators of the mods that I just recommended.  They all have improved the visual quality of my game without any loss in performance so I thought I'd share.",,False,self,t5_2sqqh,False,,,True,t3_mutr4,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/mutr4/suggestion_try_this_must_have_mod_plus_three/,

While playing skyrim, I had an idea of a new spell. There was a similar one in, I think the game was Risen, where you could cast a spell and then you would appear as a ghost in front of your mortal coil and could explore the world in a limited radius around you, without the enemies noticing you being there. You could look around edges and see how many enemies there are. 
You can do this in Skyrim with the TFC cheat, but without the restrictions. It would be nice if there was such a spell.

If anyone is interested in doing it, I would appreciate it.",,False,self,t5_2sqqh,False,,,True,t3_13mpja,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/13mpja/idea_mind_travel/,

They just kinda stand there facing each other with the only sign of emphasis being their head slightly turning. (Sidenote: It really bothers me that the characters sometimes don't make an effort to face me when talking. What's up with that?)

What if we created more dynamic idle animations for the common folk. Just as they go about their business, but especially when you're in conversation with someone and other people are standing nearby, presumably listening.

They do little more than stare at me. Doesn't anyone ever get an itch? No fidgeting in Tamriel? The guards wearing all that armor never get a wedgy?!

Here'a few ideas:

- Scratching their chin
- Scratching their shoulder
- Shrugging their shoulders out of discomfort
- Adjusting their weapon or helmet
- Checking their sword or drawing the string on their bow
- Waving at other NPCs
- Pointing or gesturing in the general direction of a landmark

I think this would add an additional layer of emersion and believability.

I made a mod that I think many of you will like.  Enjoy!

**Frostfall** is a survival-style mod that adds cold weather survival gameplay elements to Skyrim. It uses a sophisticated system to track your location, weather, time of day, worn clothing, and more, to determine your current rate of exposure. All of this takes place seamlessly in the background.

The three main components of Frostfall are *Hypothermia*, *Cold Water Survival*, and *Camping Equipment*. 

The primary objective of this mod is to add a deep, immersive level of gameplay to Skyrim, while keeping tedium to a minimum. An immersion mod should never get in the way of having fun.

[Steam Workshop!](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=13685&amp;searchtext=)
[Skyrim Nexus!](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=11163)

**MAJOR GAMEPLAY CHANGES**

The major gameplay changes presented in this mod are:

* *Hypothermia* - You now have Exposure Points. Cold areas will chill you to the bone; fires, and staying in warmer climes will keep you warm (Riverwood, Falkreath). Worn clothing, Frost Resist, and certain foods help you endure the cold much better (up to 4.5x longer). Being wet will drain your EP much faster.

* *Cold Water Survival* - Water has different temperatures based on the location. Riverwood, Falkreath, and the Rift areas are nice and refreshing. The Reach and Whiterun areas have chilly water. The Pale and other snowy locations have frigid water that can kill in a matter of minutes. Flamecloak spells will allow you to swim frigid waters with ease... just make sure to get out before the spell runs out!

* *Camping Equipment* - To make surviving with the first two points much easier. Adds a craftable tent, bedroll, and campfire kits. Bedrolls let you sleep outdoors. Tents let you sleep outdoors in bad weather. Fire kits keep you warm, and dry you off, and permit fast travel.

* FAST TRAVEL: You MUST have Fire Kits in your pack to be able to Fast Travel. When you arrive at your destination, you will get there toasty warm!

You will be given a new item upon start - **Camping Gear**. This allows you to create and place basic campsite items.

Although you don't have to use it, you will also receive the **Weathersense Ring**, a special ring whose gem turns different colors depending on the surrounding temperature. I recommend you hot-key this ring so you can check your condition at any time! 

(Messages will also appear without using this ring automatically when your condition changes, or something needs your attention, so don't worry.)

A book, **""Survivor's Guide to Skyrim""**, is sitting on a barrel inside the Riverwood Trader. It explains almost everything in this post, but in an in-world style of writing. Give it a look if you get a chance, and refer to it if you have questions while playing!

Please see the [release thread on the official Bethesda forums](http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1352887-rel-frostfall-hypothermia-camping-and-survival/) for more information, including gameplay details, incompatibility, and known issues.  This is a mod that has a lot going on inside of it, and the post there will help you get what you need to know.

I would like to let you know that root66 and I (Mr6) have started an CreationKit IRC channel on irc.xertion.org. 

It surprised me that for a big game like Skyrim, there was no real channel aimed at modding. The Minecraft IRC channel was (probably still is, but I haven't been there in a while) a good example. Seeing things like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/search?q=%5BHelp%5D&amp;restrict_sr=on) makes me think we need an IRC channel as well.

An IRC channel is a great place to ask quick questions. Most people are learning to use the Creation Kit now and running into the same problems. (For example, when making NPC-s, using Ctrl F4 to make sure the body is the same color as the head.) Things like that can take a while to find, but if someone else had the same problem, quick to solve.
If you do not have an IRC client yet, you can try [Mibbit](http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.xertion.org&amp;channel=%23CreationKit) (works from within the browser) or pick one from [this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients).

I will try to be online as much as possible in the coming days, to help people with simple questions (since I'm no expert, yet!).

I hope many people will join and that it will be a place brimming with people eager to help.

Im not really good at speaking my mind and I'm terrible at grammar so let me say sorry before I start.

Around the end of December I started working on a Lord of the Rings Skyrim Mod with a friend from Norway that I met on the Nexus. The mod was originally just going to be a retexture, but it quickly turned into a full blown story line that connects the LORE of Middle Earth and Tamriel in a weird yet interesting way, and throws you(the player) into the mix by trying to stop the great evil that spilled into Skyrim. 

But, the mod has suffered some great losses. Our original modeler had to leave because he thought he was slowing down the team. Our next one was a professional who was working as a modeler and did some great things with us. He was offered to go work with the MERP team (behind our backs) and he took it( He then had to quit from MERP because of family issues), after that we had two great modelers who did some excellent work, one even had a degree in 3D design and made the nazgul for us. Thoughs two, I suddenly lost contact with, and no longer respond to me or anyone from the team. 

What im trying to say here is, I need help. LPteam needs help. Iv had so many fans tell me never to give up, but its so hard not to when I don't have a choice. I made so many people happy with just the small releases that we have done, and that makes me happy. 

I even had [Darkfiregaming](http://www.youtube.com/user/DARKFIREGAMING) commenting on one of our [images here](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/images/73255) 

Please help Reddit. I mostly need a modeler, but any help is wanted, we our a team of around 10, and voice actors our also wanted. Check out our website, [tomesos.com](http://www.tomesos.com)

The current Skyrim skooma is a disgrace. Alcohol is pretty anticlimactic as well. There's so much that could be improved upon!

At the very least, skooma should be more than a glorified weak stamina potion. I'm thinking some kind of stamina, damage and damage resistance buff, with a screen effect and a chance to become addicted with a negative effect that gets worse the longer you go without skooma or moon sugar. After a few days of progressively worse symptoms they would get better as you detoxified.

I've got a little bit of modding and design experience, and a lot of programming experience, so now that I have a personal rig I can actually do something with, I'm pretty excited about finally getting into serious modding.

I'm going to start small with a few new dungeons of different types and work my way up to the big leagues with major quest-lines and may even try to lend a hand in some of the major overhauls/mods once I've got a good amount of experience under my belt.

(The below is intentionally a vague question, as I'd like to get a lot of ideas rolling. I'll figure out what ideas I like best, merge them with my own and see what I can come up with. I'll of course credit you beautiful people for your ideas.)

One thing I think Mass Effect and KotOR did brilliantly was add character to your followers, and it's something I wish Bethesda had tried to pursue. Serana is at least a step in the right direction, but woefully inadequate to my wants, and you need to be a vampire anyway.
I've tried Vilja, Companion Valfar, and Hoth, but didn't care for them. Vilja is the closest to what I want, and I doubt I'll find some under-the-radar mod that's as developed, but I figured I'd ask around.


Additional information/Rant follows:
I dislike the vanilla followers so much that I usually don't have one and take a sabercat around with me instead (Via the Tame the Beasts of Skyrim mod), but since I've started using Skyrim Unleashed that's become less of an option, plus I'm kind of tired of playing the ""lone wolf type"". The vanilla followers all seem to be just the same cardboard cutouts with different skills painted on. You can introduce yourself, ask them to follow you, and immediately they are loyal to you for life, even to the point of killing guards, old women, and the Emperor for you. (Also the ""Want to marry me, stranger?"" ""Sure, stranger"" deal bothers me, but that is a different mod.) I guess writing isn't Bethesda's strong suit.
Vilja is my favorite companion mod, but with her bubbly, naive ""ditzy blonde"" personality she seems to be catered to a shallower, more ""forever-alone"" demographic and I think she's really over-the-top and obnoxious. Valfar and Hoth were both novel at first but their character was flat and they got repetitive fast, and eventually they just became meatbags like the rest of the followers available. /rant

Any info you might have for me would be great. Thanks in advance, sorry for the text wall.

I also play primarily as an archer.  Something to change some of the archery style would be nice.  Not overpowering it, but also not shotting someone through the eye socket and having them turn around to murder me.  Possibly including kill animations.

Just wondering if anybody wants to help me play-test some of the features of this mod before I release. Or even just give me some opinions on how the mod looks.

The mod features a Toxicity system similar to The Witcher.

And it adds some new toys like Grenades, Proximity Mines, Explosive Arrows, and some neat poison related abilities.

There's a major de-emphasis on crafting. You no longer need to grind crafting to level up alchemy and many of the new toys such as Grenades and Proximity Mines do not need to be crafted. Instead, the player can use reasonably common objects like a bottle of ale, and turn it into an explosive. This is done instantly with the Throw Grenade/Mine hotkey and requires no crafting. Like I said, major de-emphasis on crafting.

Last but not least I added a perk system that's quite different from Vanilla Skyrim.
It essentially encourages even greater character customization.
I call it the Loadout system, please read the link above for more details.


It's meant to be used with SkyTweak and Grimy's Utilities:
http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/33395/

SkyTweak because that features some useful alchemy balance sliders like crafted potion magnitude, number of poison doses per poison, and an item limiter for potions and poisons.

And Grimy's Utilities feature the ability to put multiple potions (Up to 126 different potions per hotkey slot with 4 hotkey slots)",,False,self,t5_2sqqh,1369160952.0,,,True,t3_1eqxvj,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1eqxvj/beta_a_battle_alchemy_overhaul/,

This is a new release, it's called ""Object Tweaker"".

It's under option files in the file tab. I hope you guys don't mind that I didn't make a dedicated page for this.
It's much more efficient to respond to feedback when there's one comments page instead of like 6.

**===Overview===**

Object Tweaker lets you edit the position and angle of objects in the world with sliders.

You can also edit the physics of the object. Example: ""KeyFramed"" motion type locks the item in place (no matter how many fireballs you shoot at it). You can also stand ontop of keyframed objects, and use them to build a staircase to the sky with paintbrushes or something ridiculous like that.

[Atmospheric Whiterun](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/34481)
and
[Real Cities- Whiterun](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30594)

Atmospheric Whiterun adds a ton of lore-friendly shrubbery to Whiterun. Real Cities-Whiterun adds buildings, making the place look like a proper trading capital. **My goal:** to clear up any areas where the grasses and buildings overlap as well as removing excess grasses that reduce framerate.
I load up the master file, both plugins, and render the WhiterunWorld cell so I can start working with it. I delete a tree here, remove some foliage there, add a barrel in an empty doorway, etc. And then I click **Save.** This creates a new plugin file that can be loaded up later. 
So I close the program and the next time I load it up, no changes were saved! I redo some changes, make sure my active file is set to the plugin I created, save again. Close program. Reopen program. Load file. Again, no saved changes. So I get the idea to not load the two mod plugins and only load my own created plugin. My plugin only has a basic, unmodded Whiterun.

From Falkreath to Winterhold you see people wear the same clothing items no matter the weather. In a blizzard, everyone still wears one layer of tunic. Mods like Wet and Cold sort of helped to rectify this problem by adding fur hoods and allowing people to use cloaks in colder regions and bad weather. However, it is still immersion breaking when you see the same familiar layer of clothing simply stuck on underneath a thick heavy bear cloak.


So, what I'm looking for are ideas and pictures for and from anything really as long as it will fit in with Elder scrolls and in particular the cold of Skyrim. Pictures and items from past TES games, something you saw on Game of Thrones, whatever.


I think that there are 2 things that need to be considered. Class (lower, middle, upper) and warmth (think regions not covered in snow vs snow). Lets take lower class clothing. So far we have something like the roughspun tunic that the beggars and prisoners (player in beginning) wear no matter the region. For winter, I'm thinking a long burlap like, or woolen heavy shirt with a few hides draped over it. Just an example.


Since half of Skyrim or more is inhabited by other races than Nord there will be foreign influences.


I might work on this, might not, at least this will provide me or anybody else with ideas. I think it will be good practice.",,False,self,t5_2sqqh,False,,,True,t3_1k8nk0,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1k8nk0/immersive_clothing_ideas_needed/,

1373425588.0,19,self.skyrimmods,1hzdsy,"Fixing the ""don't havok settle"" glitch",Easier_Rider,22,3,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1hzdsy/fixing_the_dont_havok_settle_glitch/,"So, you're hard at work on Creation Kit, when all of a sudden, the ""don't havok settle"" button stops working! You load up your dungeon, only to find that everything you wanted fixed in place has now fallen to the floor and is strewn everywhere like confetti.

A quick trip to the internets tells you that, yes, this happens all the time, and yes, you're completely fucked!

**BUT, never fear!** Through long hours of troubleshooting, I have finally figured out a way to fix this glitch. It's an easy fix, but it does require some patience.



**Step 1:** Make a new, empty test cell.

**Step 2:** Copy and paste the entire contents of the offending cell into the test cell.

**Step 3:** Make a small test chamber off in the void, and move the coc marker heading there.

**Step 4:** Suspend an item in the center of the test chamber well-above the floor, and check the ""don't havok settle"" box.

**Step 5:** Test the test cell by loading it in-game via the coc console command (""coc [cell ID]""). The item *should* fall to the floor of the test chamber, despite havok settling being disabled, if the glitch is still active. If it doesn't, than you've fixed the glitch, and can just replace the old, glitchy cell with the test cell. If not...

**Step 6:** Load up the test cell, and delete a large section of your duplicated dungeon. If the source of the glitch was in the section you deleted, the suspended item in the test chamber WILL NOT FALL when you reload it. If the source of the glitch is elsewhere, the suspended item will fall to the floor, and you can make a mental note that the deleted section was glitch-free.

**Step 7:** Repeat Step 6 to glitch-check the entire dungeon. I recommend starting with larger sections, and narrowing it down to single rooms or hallways that contain the source of the glitch. Eventually, you will narrow down the source of the glitch to specific items--usually havok objects that have become imbedded in a static mesh.

**Step 8:** Once you think you've found the offending object, delete everything from the test cell except the test chamber and repeat Step 2. Then, load up the test cell again to see if that solved the problem

**Step 9:** If there was only 1 object causing the glitch in your original cell, than the item in the test chamber will stay suspended, telling you that you have found the source of the glitch. If not, then there are probably multiple objects in your dungeon that are causing problems (this is often the case)

**Step 10:** Repeat steps 6-9 until all glitch-causing objects have been located and eliminated.

**Step 11:** Reload your original cell and delete the offending objects. If you did everything correctly, you have now fixed your dungeon by process of elimination!



Obviously, this is a fairly long process, but it does work if you have the patience. I have had to do this several times with some VERY large dungeons, and it has so far worked every time!

Best of luck!

I am lefthanded myself and it doesn't feel natural for me to use the axe with the character's right hand. I have played the game in a total of three times (still got all of them). First as a mage, no problem with left/right as I could use both hands for spells. Stopped because many quests got bugged and made some bad moves. The second time I played a stealthy cat, with only hand to hand combat. It was a really good game, but I got this blizzard track stuck on loop everywhere and It was like torture after all the hours in caves, houses, forests, mountains with the same blizzard noise everywhere all the time. Now I have created a battle nord with an  axe and shield combo. As I used both hands the first time, fists the second and use shield this time I noticed a problem. The axe can be used in either left or right hand, but the shield is fixed at left hand only. This is rather uncomfortable as it looks uncomfortable to me who would use the axe in my left hand for the best results. 

Do anyone of you got a mod that let's me put my shield in my right hand instead of the left one?

So I was browsing through the workshop on Steam, and I discovered a boat house mod. And I thought to myself, as I read of his plans to add crew and quests, why not have pirates? You could be one ship amongst a group of pirates, a guild of sorts. Or you could be at odds with them depending on how quests turned out. 

Now, the boat house is the start here. You could speak to your First Mate and set a destination, and perhaps modify the camera to change angle and show the boat departing for the next dock. Along with that, perhaps selecting the ships' wheel would allow you to select a destination, with the option of ""Piracy"" or ""Neutral"" - Allowing you to opt in to pillaging the village or leaving it be as you sail by or stop for the night.

Dogs- simple command (attack target, limited version of follower commands, no move to/use just a basic attack)

- on Rabbits and Foxes will chase them down, kill them and bring the body back. (not sure on how to implement the last bit, dragons can move creatures so im sure the code is there for one entity to move another somewhere :P)
- on Deer/Elk will chase them down, when reaches melee range will paralyse for 10 sec (to simulate bringing the deer down) and allow the player to catch up and make the kill.
- Item, Dog Whistle- can be used to recall the Dog from its current order.

Falconry. as above with rabbits (possibly foxes, maybe for a top tier or adult Hawk)

- this one could be tricky as Im not sure how Hawks are built in game, are they creatures or something else?
- either way this would require commands to be given through an item (Falconiers Glove) where equipping unlocks a power/spell that acts as target designator for a hawk to dive and deal x amount of damage, just enough to kill a 'critter'.
- some aesthetic stuff, ie Hawk waits at the kill till you loot then flies away, ability to call hawk to wrist and pose etc
- limitations, cant use inside (obviously), during poor weather or at night.

The hunting dogs would be the simplest to implement ( though the 'retreive' part may be tricky), but the Hawk would be the most practical in application (no need for a follower to mess things up all the time :P)

Would provide a use for Vigilance (becuase he's useless as a combat companion) and the 2nd would just be cool :)

So I'm almost done with my [current project](https://sites.google.com/site/grimyskyrim/my-mods/vile-concoctions) and I'm looking ahead to the next one.

Here's the premise:

It's a smithing/loot overhaul.
there will now be ""rare"" versions of each weapon/armor that are unidentified when looted. These items will gain a random number of properties and upgrade slots when ID'd.

You can use your smithing skill to fill in the upgrade slots (kind of like gems from diablo games for example). And by leveling up and unlocking perks, you can unlock new upgrade possibilities.

So this means I need to think of lots and lots of upgrades. A least a few dozen for each armor slot and more for different weapon types. I'm thinking ideally 128 possible upgrades for each item type. Which is ALOT and I would totally need help brainstorming that many ideas.

The secondary effect on lightning and frost may as well not even exist. 

Maybe 1 in 10 mages who I attack with lightning run out of mana before they run out of health. And usually those are the high level ones, so it pays off a tiny bit, but not nearly enough to make up for the massive loss of damage compared to fire. I, on the other hand, will go oom within seconds of being caught in a sparks spell or taking a lightning bolt or two.

Frost bothers me even more, because it should give you the one thing that mages should have: control. Both the slow and stamina drain seem to mean nothing to the NPCs. If a ice storm spell so much as grazes my character and his 30% magic resistance, my speed drops like a rock and my stamina bar is half gone. If I'm not right next to something to dodge behind, it's already too late. I'm going to be rooted in place, eat 2 or 3 more and thats it. If I toss an ice storm into a group of bandits, they waltz right through and don't even break stride. 

It just seems like with mana efficiency being as important as it is, and the damage on fire being so much higher than frost and lightning, the secondary effects should be much, much more pronounced.

I'm using Skyre and Apocalypse as well, so the OP calm and frenzy abilities aren't there to abuse for control. :)",,False,self,t5_2sqqh,False,,,True,t3_17f3rq,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/17f3rq/are_there_any_mods_that_make_the_secondary/,

1340063087.0,22,self.skyrimmods,v8zvu,I need some assistance with a mod I want to make that has some personal importance to me,Sepherchorde,28,6,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/v8zvu/i_need_some_assistance_with_a_mod_i_want_to_make/,"I'm going to start this off by explaining why I want to do this.

Yesterday morning I received a call from my Father that my Uncle had died. It has been really rough for me, and I don't have much to remember him by which makes it worse. What I want to do though, is make a mod in memory of him, I know, this could come across as a bit strange if you don't know anything about my Uncle. He was an avid gamer, and in particular, he loved the TES series and Dungeons and Dragons.

He always played a battle-mage type character in TES and I had started with this idea when he was first diagnosed and told he had about a year, this was two months ago, so I thought I might have been able to organize at the very least the armor done and in game so he could see that and play a character that used it, and now it has become more of an in memorial kind of deal for me, as well as a bit of personal drive. The idea initially was to make some armor that accommodated a battle-mage character that incorporated some visual aspects from his favorite armors/outfits in the game.

Those armors were:

-Daedric
-Dragon Plate
-Wizard Robes
-Ebony Armor

He usually played while wearing some combination of those but had always wanted to be able to recolor them and blend certain aspects off them together, which was the idea (based on the conversations him and I have had about Skyrim).

Over the course of planning this out, I decided I wanted to try and do a little more after the armor had been done. He used to come over every weekend to play D&amp;D with us, and occasionally he would DM. When he did this, he always brought in one of his old D&amp;D characters named Ozzley as the quest giver. The best part about this character was that he was a human Wizard that had been granted three wishes, the wishes he asked for were: ""I want to be immortal in the true sense of the word!"" This not being a true wish, the response was ""Granted, but you will forever be a man of great physical age."" After that, ""I wish I could traverse the Planes freely!"" This response was ""Granted, but you won't actually know where you are ending up."" And his last wish ""I wish I had all the knowledge of every school of magic in existence across all the Planes!"" The response: ""Granted, but you are the most absent minded being in existence.""

In the end what you got was a very kind old wizard that was never quite sure where he was and remembered just enough to both potentially bring you to great treasures, but also left half finished spells and alchemy experiments laying around his tower that might turn you into a chicken, or a rat, or make living creatures within sight of you fall so madly in love with you that they mistakenly attack you because they feel they have to have you. As well as all other manner of bizarre happenings.

Sadly, I can remember exactly how the armor should be, and I can do the textures (although I lack the ability to do any modeling), but in a stupid fit of being upset deleted all notes about actual story last night.

All I am really asking for here is for help from someone that knows modeling to help me make the armor. Other than that, if anyone else is willing to help me with getting an actual story made to accompany it, I would be forever in your debt and would help you in any way possible in the future if you need it. And obviously, anyone that does help will be credited.

Many thanks to anyone who took the time to read and consider this request for assistance. 

Also, if anyone wants to see the stuff I have done for modding so they know I'm not some inexperienced new modder, I'll provide proof.

Concept Sketch my girlfriend threw together in under an hour: http://i.imgur.com/ZjQkb.jpg

The right arm and bracer are taken from the Ebony armor, the left arm is taken from the apprentice robes and has some plating on it from the Ebony armor. The pauldrons are from the Daedric armor, and the chest plate is from the Dragon plate armor, the abdomen is taken from the Daedric armor with some scaled metal coming from the sides, there are spiked parts coming over the top of the overall cuirass from the back that are taken off the Daedric armor as well. The gloves themselves are from the Daedric armor also. The helm is a blending of features from the Dragon Plate, Ebony, and Daedric helms. The greaves take their design from the Daedric and the Ebony, and the boots do the same, and finally the skirt portion is from the Apprentice Robes.

I have done some Bethesda game moding in the past, but my experience is still quite limited. 

Anyway, I wanted to discuss the possibility of building what I will tentatively call a 'loadout mod'

Put simply, this mod will do the following:

* There will be 8 to 10 loadouts that the player can customise (these can be any combination of armour, spells, and weapons)

* Instead of favoriting items, the player will be promoted to select a loadout to add the item to when hitting the favourite button

* A loadout is simply what a player can have equipped and on hand at any time. This means each loadout can only have one thing in each hand, and one set of armour 

* Loadouts are then selected from the favourites menu at the player's will. Instead of individual items, the player will see a list of their loadouts (maybe with custom names)

I think a system like this would be incredibly beneficial to a lot of players. It does break the game somewhat given how easy it will be to toggle between things, but for players with high level characters and a lots of different play styles, I think this will make the game play much more dynamic.

So now I ask you guys, is such a mod possible, and where should I start? I have a passing familiarity with the creation kit. 

**UPDATE:** Okay, thanks for all the response guys! It seems there is a definite interest in a mod like this, so I think I will go ahead and start building it. I am VERY new to this type of modding, where you're working with the underbelly of the game system, but I am excited to learn more about it. If anyone wants to help or offer advise please don't hesitate to PM me! 

Given how little design has to go into this mod, I am guessing it will probably take about a week or so to build a beta version of it, and it will most likely require SKSE to run meaning no steam workshop version. Although, that could be developed in the future.

Some features brought up by you guys I didn't think of:

* Loadouts mapped to hotkeys as well
* Some compatibility with SkyUI (looked at their code, it should work automatically) and CFM (this might be hard)
* One piece of armour or one weapon can be on more than one loadout ",,False,self,t5_2sqqh,True,,,True,t3_snqca,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/snqca/thinking_about_building_a_loadout_mod/,

I just wanted to put this out both to see if anyone else was feeling this way about the inventory, and to see if it warrents the time of a modder. I do want to preface this saying I'm ***not bitching***, and I'm enjoying the game very much.

The inventory system in Skyrim is a large change. I'm not going to shout that it's terrible or game killing, and there is something to be said for simplicity, but in the simplifcation of the inventory a feature I loved was removed; Sort.

Being able to sort by weight/value in Oblivion was amazingly useful for both quick organization and those times when you had to do full inventory overhauls after a long trip. Thus far in Skyrim I've been pretty much stuck going through the whole list of items.

Is anyone else having issues with this? And additionally are there any modders out there (crazy respect to the modders btw) who have the goal of overhauling the menu and inventory system?

TL;DR - Can't sort the inventory by weight/value, save me mod-man!

Thanks again!

I have stumbled across Civil War Overhaul (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37216/) which the author claims only introduces cut content - and it sounds pretty damn awesome. Same author also has a dragon overhaul mod that makes dragons stomp to push-back and damage, as well as improves their AI - also sounds like a fantastic addition.

A Model Manager

It's not released yet because I want to add more to it, but here's what it does:

It's an MCMenu that lets you switch between different armor/weapon models from various mods.

This has several benefits over using the original mod files:

1) Only 1 esp file, instead of several.

2) Zero compatibility issues, whereas the original mod files probably override the weapons/armors they are editing, and prevent other mods from using them.

3) Mix and match models however you want. Maybe I like Unique Unique's Dragonbane more than Unique Redone's Dragonbane, but I like Unique Redone's Oathblade more than Unique Unique's Oathblade.

4) Swap on the fly. Maybe I felt like Unique Unique's Dragonbane 5 minutes ago. But now I changed my mind. I can change without leaving my game.

**Anyways, my question is: what weapon/armor remakes should I include in the manager?**

The only restriction is they have to be remakes of items that already existed in Skyrim. Afterall if a mod is just adding new items, there's no real need for a model manager.

And finally, DW, this mod isn't going to pirate the work from these other mods by making them into some kind of compilation.
You'll still need to download the original mods. You'll then need to unpack each of the BSA's in order for the model manager to recognize them. The only difference is you can dispose of the original esp and bsa file's once the bsa's have been unpacked.",,False,self,t5_2sqqh,False,,,True,t3_1gi5jv,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1gi5jv/your_favorite_weaponarmor_remakes/,

It would fit with the idea that the dragons fight for supremacy. The vanilla dragons wouldn't have altered factions at all, whereas the dragons from DD and the dragons from Bellyaches would get their own factions.

Also, while poking around I now know how to make my own new dragons and cen easily incorporate them into the DD assault system, also giving them their own factions, further bringing some fairly intense complexity to situations and allowing more chances to escape if needed (for example if you have DCO installed) or potentially waiting while the dragons soften each other up.

The diplomat class employed complex combinations of speachcraft and sneak skills to avoid harming a single citizen of Tamriel. This did mean some limited options as far as questing is concerned, but you might be surprised how much can be done peacefully. 

This week I felt a good bit of nostalgia for such a time and decided to start up a passive character in skyrim. I'm the type of person who finds joy in the silly things, so I invented a back story for my newest character. He was a respected khajiit doctor until being driven from his homeland of Elsweyr after being framed for the murder of particularly powerful clan mother, whom he was preforming surgery on. Now he finds himself broken and septimless in a land that is not kind to him. Thieving came naturally with his steady surgeon's paws but his oath to do no harm has bound him to a limited set of skills.

So here is the deal, I expect to have the same limitations that I did in morrowind; there is no way this play style is compatible with say, the dark brotherhood haha, but shouldn't it be possible to do the thieves guild? There is so much talk about not operating that way, yet I can't even get past the 2nd major mission without a road block.

There were also some missing tree textures (but not all).  One time I got passed the dragon roar but the game crashed before I got out of the town anyway.  Not sure what I did differently to get passed that point because once I re-opened the game it crashed at the dragon roar again.

The first few times I launched the game I had forgotten to use SKSE to launch and I also forgot to install ENB.  I've familiarized myself with these things and checked and rechecked the .ini files but still crashed as the dragon roared.

Out of frustration I completely uninstalled the game and removed all mods.  Tomorrow I'm going to start from scratch.  Shall I try once more using that guide and be more careful or do any of you have a better suggestion?

Thanks for the advice in advance!

It ruins the immersion for me when I see ""nude"" characters who are actually wearing ridiculous-looking underwear. I'm not talking about when you take someone's clothes off with advanced pickpocketing, I'm talking about when you find some guy who is supposed to be naked for dramatic effect like what you would see in Amnesia. And when it's you in your skivvies and certain characters talk to you as if you were wearing nothing at all. It's those moments where the game is saying ""OK, just pretend that person was actually naked."" 

Skyrim does have a large amount of nude mods, but I have too many problems with those to actually use them in my game. It's just silly to take the heavy armor off a person and find them wearing absolutely nothing underneath. Also, nude mods are designed to titillate rather than make the game more realistic. I'm not trying to make my Skyrim into a porn game.

I think what I want is a mod that adds underwear as an equipment that everyone in the game is wearing, and that you can take off. And some already naked NPCs (like the torture victims) wouldn't come with underwear. Maybe there could even be some variety of them to choose from. What if you could enchant them with Attribute Fortification effects?

It would probably be extremely hard to add underwear to every character in the game, and mod characters too, though. Maybe a script extender, but I don't know anything.

Basically, there would be multiple small 'arenas' (to stay truer to the lore of Skyrim's culture).  Each arena would be run by a 'house' and you can join any of them, but only one.. for obvious reasons.  You can just fight random dudes at your house's arena or you can get chosen to represent your house at tournaments, which can take place at any of the arenas.  Eventually, if you beat every house enough and become a 'grand champion' of sorts, you would get invited to the ultimate tournament, outside of Skyrim (not sure where to put it --maybe redo the Imperial City's arena?).  If you win that tournament, you win a huge purse and have the option to start your own house (at a pre-determined location to make it easier to 'build' it).  You can then take on fighters, host tournaments/fights/etc.  You can have a steward of sorts to just handle it all for you if you don't want to bother managing it and just want to receive a weekly gold amount (we could be as simple as just having gold come in or as complex as having to balance expenses vs income and have potential for losses each week).

--

About me:  I am a modeler/texturer so I would plan on modeling armor/weapons/houses/arenas.  Of course, other artists would be welcome to help out.  What I am not very good at (or, rather, haven't really looked at) is scripting... which this mod would require a TON of scripting and I realize that.  It may be that the mod needs to be stripped down to a basic arena (ala Oblivion) for an initial release just to get our feet wet.

--

As for arena features, mostly just your basic gladiator fights for basic fights.  For tournaments we could do battle recreations from the land's past (like, if it was a naval battle we could fill the arena with water and have some ships that the fighters fight on).  Prizes for fights can range from gold to armor/weapons to enchanted items etc.

But it would be cool to have a mod around actual real-world magical texts. Or at least one that creates the same sort of feel. Summoning demons or raising the dead should involve a complex, drawn out ritual rather than just a flick of the wrist and a snap of the fingers. 

The mod could leave the existing conjuration system intact but there could be other spells which summon greater demons/daedra/spirits/whatever which maybe grant you favors in the form of permanent buffs like the standing stones, give you access to new unique spells and abilities, or become permanent followers.

For example, if you wanted to buff speechcraft, you would summon a demon specializing in that skill using a complex ritual that requires certain ingredients or actions and has to be performed on certain nights at certain times. Each summoning would be different and there could be a rare book that describes how to do each one. Maybe the first summoning could be a quest to show you how it works, but then for the other ones, you're on your own. It should be possible to fail them or even to do them wrong so that they backfire on you.

Some spirits could grant permanent buffs (which replace eachother and don't stack, just to keep the balance of the game), some could grant unique spells and abilities, some could tell you the location of hidden treasure, some could just attack you if the summoning goes wrong.

I'm thinking it would also be cool to include a ritual that raises a dead NPC back to life. Not as a zombie but actually back to life. So let's say your beloved follower who has become your bestfriend or even your spouse, gets killed in battle. Grieving, you drag their body to a safe place where it won't be eaten by animals or taken by grave robbers and necromancers. You research the ritual, collect the required ingredients, choose the correct time and place for the ceremony, and then perform it. Maybe it requires a sacrifice (life for life) I don't know. But if it works, the NPC is raised via something like the ""resurrect"" console command. If you did it wrong, they become a powerful zombie that attacks you, or they turn to ash. Something like that.

Using magic, especially summoning demons and raising the dead, should be difficult and dangerous.

I'd like some help from people who played Skyrim with the Skyrim Redone mod, because I don't really understand what's going on.


I played a lot of Skyrim Vanilla when it came out, multiple playthroughs with different types of characters. Haven't played since January or so, and I wanted to give a try to a modded Skyrim. After a quick search, Skyrim Redone seemed like a good overhaul mod, harder and better than vanilla, so I installed it. Just to clarify : I don't own any of the DLC, so I took the ""vanilla"" version of the mod, with no other mod except SkyUI.


I started my first new char, level 1 breton, archer, in adept difficulty (as recommended in the readme). The first part/escape from Helgen goes smoothly, and then I start the first quest in Riverwood, with the golden claw. I thought that might give me a good practice session for the new stuffs implemented in the mod. First bandit I stumble upon (at the tower, on my way up to bleak halls), and I get one-shot by his blade. Thinking it's just bad luck, I re-load and try again. Two hits, and I'm dead again. I tried dozens of time more, the only way I can survive is spamming enemies with arrows while going backward... As soon as they're in range to hit me, I'm dead, no matter what.

I tried with another char, a nord combat-oriented, heavy armor, shield and sword. The result isn't much better. I managed to kill one or two bandit before being put down. 

Even at novice difficulty I don't survive much, I kill bandits way quicker, but they kill me almost as quick as before.


After a couple of hours trying to survive with this mod (and not really enjoying it...), I now write this message : is it suppose to be this hard ? Is it playable only with certains type of char ? magic ? combat ? ranged ? Is this mod only suitable for high-level char ? Am I suppose to hunt down wolves and petty animals until I'm at a better level ? Did I fucked something up in the install/configuration ? Do I need other mods to balance the difficulty ? 

Anyway I'd like some feedback from people playing this mod, how they managed at the first level and any tips they can give me. 


**TL;DR : I get one-shot no matter what I try at the beginning of the game.**

Once you were pickpocketed, you would need to pursue the thief and catch them to gain back your valuables. They would not take all of say your gold, but   around 3/4 of it, discouraging the player from carrying all their gold everywhere they go. Another idea could be to have house thieves who would break into your home and attempt to steal your possessions hidden in chests. To counter-act this, you could purchase locks for your chests and doors or booby-trap them in some way. These would increase the odds of keeping out thieves but not make it impossible to have your items stolen. Another option could be to have a companion or spouse watch over the house to make sure nothing is taken. Again this companion or spouse would only increase the odds of keeping out thieves and not be a perfect defense. If you are part of the thieves guild you won't be as effected by other thieves but you can still be robbed. When you complete their main questline, you will be able to establish thieves in each city to make a profit for you. Finally there would be people who will attack you at random in a city on behalf of another NPC or a faction. They could be hired by a guild you have opposed or bothered, a family or a side of the rebellion which you have fought against. There would be several of them and you would have to defend yourself against their attacks. City guards may come to your aid so long as they are not associated with the faction attacking you. (For example the guards of Windhelm will not help you against Stormcloak attackers.) These additions would make you feel less safe and secure in cities and add excitement and chaos to the often mundane cities.

The types and qualities of the beverages would be dependent on the player's alchemy skill and the addition of alchemical ingredients to the batches would add more effects. 

You could set up an ingredient ordering interface similar to a vendor interface that would be triggered by either opening a book (the weekly ledger) or speaking with an NPC at the brewery (ingredient vending representative) who wouldn't need any dialog and would offer large quantities of ingredients. 

If you wanted to be really fancy you could have the ingredients arrive on a carriage (using the existing carriage model) that actually travels across a set route from a port town and is venerable to bandit attacks. There could be random quests to guard your shipments of both ingredients and product, quests to wipe out a specific group of bandits attacking your carriage, quests involving the competition... the list goes on.

1330986928.0,16,self.skyrimmods,qj7ha,[Tutorial] Creating an item like the Scales of Pitiless Justice. Very simple.,Kendu72,18,2,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/qj7ha/tutorial_creating_an_item_like_the_scales_of/,"This is a simple tutorial for creating an item that is very similar to the [Scales of Pitiless Justice](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Unique_Items#Other_Items) in Oblivion. If you're not familiar with what that is, it's a reward in the Dark Brotherhood questline. They looked like simple scales, but they had an enchantment to them that modified your player attributes. I liked this idea of finding something seemingly mundane, but finding out that it held more power than it looked to have. I wanted something like this in Skyrim, so I went to the CK to try and find a way to do it.

**NOTE**: This tutorial assumes that the player has little experience using the Creation Kit, and little to no experience with Papyrus and programming in general. If it's too redundant and long-winded in some areas for more experienced modders, then I apologize.

The way I went about doing this was I found an item that I wanted to be my ""scales"" and copied it to a new entry in the object window. For my mod, I chose a Dwarven Lexicon, mainly because of the quest Unfathomable Knowledge (you get it in Riften.) You can choose whatever item you want, but I don't know how the game will react if it's attached to an item with other functionality (food, ingredients, etc.) I just kept it to miscellaneous items. Once you copied the entry, give it a unique name and ID. You can change the weight and value to whatever you want. When those things are finished, then we need to make the magic ability, or ""enchantment.""

This is simpler than it sounds. It involves creating a new spell. [Here is a snapshot of the ability for my mod](http://i.imgur.com/Kj7Al.jpg). Yours should largely resemble what is seen here, with the difference being what is listed under the Effects section. It is important to note that if you plan on having this affect skills and attributes positively or negatively, you should choose the corresponding magical effect in that section. There are several in that list, but I stuck with the effects that were preceded by AbFortify. The durations should be zero, the area zero, and the magnitude whatever you want it to be. Also, for the description, anything enclosed in &lt; these signs &gt; will be in **bold**. So, what I have written in that box will appear [like this](http://i.imgur.com/GVLpN.jpg). Make sure to give your ability a unique name and ID like your item. The ID should be similar to the ID of your item just so you won't get confused later, but it's up to you.

Now it's time for the script. I took some scripting classes in college--some were for regular programs, others for game programs--so I am by no means an expert coder. This part of the mod boggled me for a while, but by poring through the CK documentation for Papyrus I was able to code a script that accomplished everything I wanted it to do. Go back to your item that you created earlier and click the Add button under the scripts section. [Then you'll be taken to a list](http://i.imgur.com/OERPL.jpg) where you'll pick what script you want added. Click the top entry, New Script, and it will take you to [this screen](http://i.imgur.com/iiBZW.jpg). Enter a name for your script (I simply chose the same name as my Item ID with Script appended at the end). Enter ObjectReference in the extends box--don't worry if you don't understand this, I'll explain what I know later. In the documentation string, enter whatever description you want for your script. This is entirely optional however, but it is good practice to document things. Once you're done, click OK, and you'll see your new script in the list. Right click the script and select Edit Source. You'll be taken to the framework of your script.  I'll break down this script as how I understood it in inline comments in the script. Single line comments are noted by beginning with a semicolon (;), multiple line comments are noted by beginning with a ;/ and ending with a /;. Comments, if using proper syntax, will have no impact on a script. You may keep or erase the comments below.

Note that I am using placeholder names like **YourScriptName** and **YourSpellAbilityIDName**. Replace these with your actual script name and the ID for your spell ability.

&gt;        Scriptname YourScriptName extends ObjectReference
&gt;        {The description entered in the Documentation String goes here}
&gt;              
&gt;        Spell property YourSpellAbilityIDName auto ;Declares the spell ability we made earlier to the compiler so it doesn't get confused when we use it later.
&gt;    
&gt;        ;/ This next section is a listener for OnContainerChanged events.
&gt;        This will make the game constantly check to see if this object
&gt;        has changed containers at all and performs the actions accordingly. /;
&gt;           
&gt;        Event OnContainerChanged(ObjectReference akNewContainer, ObjectReference akOldContainer) ; This line should not be modified in any way
&gt;             if akNewContainer == Game.GetPlayer() ; Checks to see if the player is the new container, meaning the player picked up or acquired the object in some way
&gt;                  Game.GetPlayer().AddSpell(YourSpellAbilityIDName, true) ; Adds your spell ability to the player. True means an ability added notification will show. Use false for no notification.
&gt;             elseif akOldContainer == Game.GetPlayer() ; Checks to see if the player is the old container, meaning the player dropped or placed the object in another container.
&gt;                  Game.GetPlayer().removeSpell(YourSpellAbilityIDName) ; Removes your spell ability from the player.
&gt;             endIf
&gt;        EndEvent

If everything looks good on your end, go up to Build up on the menu bar and click compile (or Ctrl + F7) The output at the bottom will show the results once the compile is finished. If there are errors, it will say ""Compile Failed"" or something similar. The most common errors are malformed IDs or syntax errors, i.e. you made a typo somewhere. In that case check your code over very carefully. Make sure the spell ability ID names you listed match the ID for the spell ability you created earlier exactly. If there are other errors, leave a comment explaining what it is (a screenshot helps) and I'll see what it could be. If it builds successfully, then you're in luck. Go to file -&gt; save (it will compile again) and close that window.

Now all that's left is to place your item somewhere in the world. For test purposes you can always use MolagBalVoiceCell Interior (Select Interiors in the World Space drop down menu.) Double click the cell you've chosen, it will load, and from the Object Window navigate to your item and click and drag from the Object Window to the Render Window. Your object should appear selected. Double click it and you can change the Z axis value to raise/lower the height. When you've placed the object where you've desired, you're done, unless you want it in a container like a chest or something. If you wish to put it in a custom container, you can follow the same procedure for creating the item by finding a container you like and copying it to a new entry and changing the name and ID to reflect the names you've used earlier. You can then delete the contents of that chest (right click -&gt; delete) and add a new entry for your item (right click -&gt; new). Select the new entry, and under the object drop down menu find your item (you can speed things up by typing the first few letters of the ID name of your item, it should come up). Be sure to set the item count to 1. Then, instead of dragging your item to the render window, you'd drag the new container instead. Rotate and position it however you want.

When all item or container placement is done, then you can save your plugin as an esp file. To test it, activate it with either the launcher or another mod manager and launch the game. Navigate to the cell where your item is (either manually or with the coc cellname command, e.g. coc molagbalvoicecell). Pick up your item and check your magical effects. Does everything look like it should? If so, great! If not, and you can tell what it is, close Skyrim and change what you need to in the CK, save the esp again, and relaunch. Repeat until it's fixed. If there is a problem that you can't pinpoint, post it in the comments and I'll see if I can help out.

Thanks for reading this tutorial, and sorry for the length. I tried writing it so that anyone relatively new to modding and scripting can understand it. I hope to do more tutorials as I grasp more of what the CK has to offer, but until then thanks again and happy modding!

If anyone has any advice on how to improve this tutorial, I welcome it.

* No more damage sponge enemies (obviously big creatures will still be tough). Combat should feel semi-realistic eg mages in robes shouldn't be running around with 5 arrows and icespikes in their face just because they're 'a high level'.
* More varied/significant enemy attributes such as resistances/weaknesses, perks so I must alter my tactics for different enemies
* Modified/removed enemy scaling so I'm not always fighting enemies of my level
* I should feel that I have to prepare before adventures and make more decisions in combat.
* Maybe some mods which tweak magic and some which add vanilla-friendly spells (I don't like the idea of Midas Magic for example).

My favorite thing about RP games like those from TES and D&amp;D-lore/based games is the ***Monk*** class. Recently I've been thinking about creating a Unarmed/Unarmored mod or a plain martial arts mod. I did find very good mods that overhaul the combat system, my favorite being [Way of the Monk](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/15725)... It uses scripting on pop up menus to level up the perks and such... 


So I don't feel the need to overhaul the combat system but I may add some perks to a tree if I find in too under powered....

--------------

***But I am still feeling creative :)***

I want to add more Monk and Martial Art lore to the game!

Here is my **Brainstorm*** so far..... Feedback and suggestions welcomed.



&gt;+Add Monks and Martial Artists to the game: (Unarmed and Weapon Masters- Both armored and unarmored masters.)

-Traveling Monks and Martial Artists 

-A Master who lives a secluded life in the mountains who is quest involved

-Add Monk Monasteries, Temples, and Villages with Abbots, Monks, and Young monks (Human, Khajiit, and Argonian Children) to the game.

-Add Martial Art Schools to the game.... Whiterun, Solitude, and Windhelm.... (windhelm would have an underground fight arena to participate in)

-Each School would have a different themed style of wear... Windhelm School is more rugged and tough while Monks are always in robes for example

-Quests for Martial Arts, Healers, and Priests

-Monk and Martial Artist Quest Rewards (Staffs, Rings, Cloth that are enchanted) (will find Voice Actors or Voice act myself with my Lady)

&gt;+LORE

-Stories of Ancestors and Famous Masters

-Typical Martial Art politics (""Our style is superior."" ""My master is better than your's."")

-Books describing each Arts Lineage and Principles

-Spiritual Teachings and Understandings based on Buddhist and Daoist teachings and converted to TES lore.




-----------------------------



That's where I am at right now... This is all brainstorm and I don't think I have done anything impossible that I cannot do with Creation Kit...

This is about the best place I've found for trying to start some grassroots support for new mod ideas, so here we go!

I've been dying for a spear mod.  One that has its own unique animations and properties.  I don't like the spears that come with Immersive Weapons, for example.  It looks dumb when your character swings around a skinny spear like a warhammer.  

Stabbing animations are a must for regular attacks, standing power attacks, and forward power attacks; but sweeps could still happen with the side or backward power attacks.  I'd also like to see spears with the greatest range of all melee weapons.  However to balance them out, I think they should be slower than warhammers/maces.  I think it would be cool if stabbing moves with spears were the most powerful kind of melee attack; while sweeps should be much weaker than power attacks from other weapons, but have a larger AOE.

Finally I think one and two handed variants could be cool.  However, if anyone here took up making the mod, I'd greatly prefer a one handed spear so shields are still usable.  ",,False,self,t5_2sqqh,False,,,True,t3_1k3lmn,http://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1k3lmn/request_spear_mechanics/,

There are quite a few dwellings with throne rooms out there with bunches of maniquins in them, but none that I've found with any kind of real daedric trophy room like I'm looking for.

Thats a bunch of screen caps I took of things that looked good. A long  hall or large circular room to start with. Elevated throne, the first image with the dragon priest shrine and dragon statue behind the throne rocks. 2nd and 3rd images have some great lighting effects and themes. When you quick travel to the area, an outside that looked similar to Domaine Alucard or the Tower would be awesome. But the real cincher are the last set of images from Dragonius Tower, where he took all of the daedric shrines, models, or statues and gave each a relevant weapon rack/display/pedestal with an inscription to place artifacts as you added them to the proper place.

I also love collecting gems, but haven't found a real good way to display a large pile of gemstones yet. 10 foot wide basin in the floor to drop them all in?

Any case, I'd love to see a mod that combined the dragon priest mask shrine &amp; throne image style, with a daedric artifact trophy room style, into one grand room for the Dragonborn to wait between quests.

The intention is to create potions that have new effects, but can be found in other areas in game(Ex: Guardian Circle potion). Not only does this add to the value of ingredient collecting, but it can also contribute on a more roleplaying perspective of playing a pure alchemist dropping fire flasks etc.

Anyway, I wanted to ask Reddit what sort of spells or effects they would like to see made into potions. Thanks for any future replies :)


EDIT: Glad to see so many people taking interest in my little project! Here is a rough list of the potions/poisons I'm thinking of adding:

Please refer to the spell version of the potion if you wonder what the effects are.

I played Oblivion, and I didn't like it. So I utterly obliterated the game with &gt;300 mods, and a number of mod-mods and tweaks I created for my own personal use. And it was glorious, even better than Morrowind.

Following the trend Oblivion started, I was sure I wouldn't like vanilla Skyrim. So I have waited, and insulated myself from spoilers, etc., until the Skyrim modding community was mature enough to create something even more wonderful than my modded Oblivion. 

Since the Legendary Edition is coming out soon, I figure that the time is now (and my patience is also waning as the Oblivion modding community is super dead). 

If it means anything to anyone, it'd be nice to have the equivalent of OOO (which I have always felt integrates very seamlessly into Oblivion) along with gameplay overhauls like Less Annoying Magic System, Race Balancing Project,  Simbacca's Player Advancement Method, and UI/annoyances overhauls like DarnUI, Better Music System, Map Marker Overhaul, Enhanced Economy, actually every single one of TheNiceOne's mods. This is just for my first playthrough, of course. :)

I'm not interested in visual overhauls (except ones that impact gameplay like Darker Dungeons), additional quests, and extra items/NPCs/locations that don't jive with the vanilla Skyrim atmosphere. Atmosphere is the key word, actually: I want a coherent atmosphere. No unnecessary extra content - I don't need it, I've yet to play the game at all!

So, dear reader! My problem is this: I have a refined taste in mods, but researching enough to figure out what actual mods fit that taste would spoil the game.

**TL;DR** *just answer these brief questions*

Does SkyRe change the actual content (quests, locations, etc) in Skyrim?
If it does, does it clash badly with the vanilla content?
Are there any large mods compatible with SkyRe that add well-integrated content? (Like OOO would do)
Right now, SkyRe looks pretty close to what I want, but people seem to hate it; why?

Are there any absolutely totally essential mods for Skyrim besides the Unofficial Patches? (In Oblivion: Quest Award Leveller, patches requiring OBSE) (yes I know a UI overhaul is essential)

GEMS looks pretty close to what I want if SkyRe doesn't work out.
Is there any similar list of lore-compatible, doesn't-clash-with-vanilla extra content? I'd rather not read the Nexus top list...

I really enjoyed the text-only quests OOO added to Oblivion, because they were able to avoid introducing unvoiced NPCs that clashed with vanilla. Are there any popular mods like that?

I'll start with:  
 
**[Enhanced Skyrim Factions - The Companions Guild][4]**  

&gt; ESF: Companions is a project that aims to improve this situation in several ways:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Increase the number of radiant quests required to advance in the guild, and add skill, level, and time requirements for each of the
&gt; guild's milestone story quests (status: done).
&gt; 2. Add new choices and consequences to those milestone quests (status: in-progress).
&gt; 3. Add new radiant and story quests, both during and after the vanilla questline (status: in-progress, one radiant quest added).
&gt; 4. Miscellaneous other improvements (status: in-progress, many tweaks made, see changelog).

**[Minimum Skill Requirements For Guild Quests][2]**  
&gt;Current Factions with min requirements:  
Mages Guild: All schools of magic require the player to have their skills at level 30 or above  
Thieves Guild: Sneak, Lockpicking, and Pickpocketing are all required to be at level 30 or above   

**[Thieves Guild Requirements - No Auto Quest Start Brynjolf][3]**

&gt;In order to trigger the beginning of the Thieves Guild quest, the player must have stolen items, picked pockets, and have some skill in sneak. Otherwise Brynjolf will not approach you and the dialogue options with him will not appear.
&gt; 
&gt; The requirements are as follows:
&gt; - Items Stolen &gt;= 250
&gt; - Pockets Picked &gt;= 25
&gt; - Sneak skill level &gt;= 25
&gt; 
&gt; All three requirements must be met. The number of items stolen &amp;
&gt; pockets picked can be checked under ""Crime Stats.""
&gt; 
&gt; Beginning in version 1.3, the requirements can now be fully
&gt; customized.

The idea of a character who uses speachcraft and manipulation as his weapon always interested me. I feel like the times to use these abilities are few and far between.

I'm looking for a mod that pretty much will make combat with humanoids optional if they have high enough speachcraft, letting them talk their way out of almost any situation. 

Also something to keep the pesky wolves and other beast's in the woods and off the main trails would be great too.

My goal is to personally get much more knowledge on TES lore, and plunge my self into a character with as much immersion as I can get.

With those goals it only makes sense to want a knowledge hungry, read-every-book-you-can type of character who naturally would seem to want to avoid combat any way possible. It'd be nice to be able to put a lot of points into alteration, sneak, and speachcraft to avoid confrontations while not using methods that would make it too easy (like invisibility, or being unreasonably sneaky)

I just spent the last several hours patching up the mesh for ogre teeth in Blender, in preparation for putting it into Skyrim. However, it refuses to allow me to associate a texture when I view the remodelled version in Nifskope. So I backtrack to the original Oblivion mesh, set it up in the right place, associate the right texture (which took an annoyingly long time to find, I must say) and try to stick it in the Creation Kit. I then get the warning preview that pops up if you've got an object without a mesh (a red diamond with a white exclamation mark inside). So obviously there are some issues here. Is there a safe way to import .nif and .dds files from Oblivion to Skyrim without everything breaking?

Head over to [Dragonporn for more screenshots.](http://dragonporn.ldblog.jp/archives/6655720.html)


    Disclaimer: I did not make this mod.

&gt;Dragonbone Ebonsteel heavy armor is a stand-alone set combining the raw strength of dragonbone with the more malleable resilience of ebony. While for all gameplay purposes it is still considered dragonplate, forging it requires skill in both dragon and ebony smithing. The armor rating of all pieces is nearly as great (just one tick shy) of their Daedric counterparts.

&gt;The armor can be made at any forge.
While it requires both Dragon and Ebony smithing perks to make, the armor itself is found under the Dragon smithing category.
Two styles each of chestpieces, gauntlets, and boots are included. Their construction materials and stats are identical. The choice is offered purely for aesthetic reasons.
Four distinct styles of helm are available, in either veiled or open-faced versions (for a grand total of eight). Here too materials and stats are identical, and which one wears is a matter of individual taste.
A chainmail hood can also be forged. As it is not rigid and does not actually utilize dragonbone, it is markedly less protective than the full helms. However, it does allow one to simultaneously equip circlets of any type.

Is is just generally easier than NMM? I feel like the fact that the Nexus makes the program makes it really easy, once click downloads, one click installs, etc.

Does Wrye Bash have other utilities that I am painfully unaware of? I honestly hope this is the case, as I have a lot of frequent crashes with the +145 mods I currently have, though they should be comparable (I know the biggest thing is that just the sheer number will eventually lead to a conflict).

Is is all just opinion? This is what I tend to think, but here I am today falling for the hype. Any of you care to weigh in? (and before anyone says it, I use Boss to sort already as well.

I have stepped away from the game for a while, and have thus fallen behind in the modding scene. I'm hoping to find some mods to enhance a playthrough as a kind of nord wandering wizard. The two major aspects I'm hoping to mod are

1. Magic System - mods that generally make magic a more fun and rewarding experience than vanilla, where I felt it was a bit lacking. I'm looking for opinions first on the best spell pack (Phendarix, Midas, Apocalypse?) and also for levelling/balance issues.

2.  The Aesthetic- I find the mage aesthetic in vanilla pretty far from what I'm looking for. I'm looking for any mods that can put my wizard in furs, feathers, or maybe just a little more tattered. Make him feel a little more ""nordic"" and wild than the average winterhold mage, almost bordering on druidic. You know, the kind of wizard that might have a raven on his shoulder or a crazy staff or something.

I know that my issue is nothing new and there are several fixes for it, but most of them include messing around with the CK (which I don't understand and don't *want* to understand) or installing different texture packs or meshes which I don't want to use.

See, I used the CBBE body and was pretty unhappy with it, because the girls looked like playmates. So I changed the mod and decided to give the DIMONIZED UNP Body a try. Looked good and I decided to keep it.

I've got many mods installed, but the mods which change people are:

1. DIMONIZED UNP Body (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/6709//?)
2. Ashen Race (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8583//?)
3. Finally Younger Characters (http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/2332/?)


WHAT I'VE GOT
----------------------

- A perfectly working and good looking player character. There are no problems with a vanilla race or the Ashen race, as you can see in the screenshot.

- It looks good wether my character stands in the sun or in the shadows. No bugs and problems here.

- Wrong looking NPC females. ALL of them. Why? The body is the same. 

But see for yourself.


**PLAYER**

**NPC**

Standing in the sun and has body/head color mismatch: http://i.imgur.com/WLeOdZA.jpg

Standing in the shadows and has body/head color mismatch: http://i.imgur.com/Asfk1qW.jpg

Strange thing is; when the female NPC is lit by a torch or other light source, it looks good without any flaws.



I know it's just a single NPC I use as an exmaple, but it's with every other female NPC as well. Breton, Nord, Imperial ... ect ...


What's the problem and how to fix it?


Thanks, mates.

My current issue, without any ENB or light mods- I'm not sure what is causing this- is that my game will sometimes just suddenly crash to desktop. It will repeat itself until I leave that location. So far, it would crash a bunch of times right after leaving the secret shack after the Dark Brotherhood introduction. I had to quick-travel to somewhere else to stop the crashing. It happened again in a dwemer dungeon, and it wouldn't stop until managed to make it to the next room.

Before my current playthrough, I had never really desired a special house for my character to live in, and so I never really payed much attention to house mods or the Hearthfire expansion. This time, however, I thought I'd change that, and I tried a few house mods and even decided to buy Hearthfire.

Although every house mod I tried turned out to be great, they were clearly not designed with mid-range PC users like me in mind, and so I decided to try to make my own player home.

A few weeks later and the mod is finished, just in time for Dragonborn. The home is called the Enchanter's Alcazar and you can download it using the [Steam Workshop](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=124815914) or on the [Skyrim Nexus](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/30931/).

The house is made up of a total of 9 rooms with a main hub containing 8 portals which lead to living quarters, a forgery, an armory, a laboratory, a kitchen, a map room a garden and even your own market with three ghostly merchants. The main entrance is just West of Solitude, but there are teleportation pads located in each town too.

I do know there is an advanced texture mod ( for the world I think) And thats one of the ones I need to pick up.

The Skyrim modders and Bethesda have done a fabulous job in making Skyrim gorgeous, and varied. However, I, among others, find it to be a tad bland. There aren't enough... well, unique landscapes.

I am willing to accept the challenge of your requests for those parts of Skyrim that just ooze 'meh'. And, I'm sure this can be inspiration for a lot of you other modders (I know some of you frequent this subreddit) to start work on one of those bland locations and make it pretty. And stuff.

If not, I may invest some time in making it myself.

One of the first things to annoy me about Skyrim was that seemingly only I, the mighty Dovakiin, was intelligent enough to sharpen a bloody sword. Of all the mighty smiths in Skyrim, none of them had quite worked out how that grinding wheel in their smithy worked. They must've just installed them, knowing I would soon be visiting their humble forge and gracing them with my magnificent, sword-sharpening presence.

Because only the player can improve weapons and armor, it makes combat pretty lopsided in the player's favor, provided they pick up the smithing skills and traits. No one will ever be able to have a weapon as powerful as yours. But then, provided you don't pick up skills allowing you to improve your weapons, you'll never have access to the most powerful weapons, because there are no smiths in the game who can sharpen your sword or bolster your armor, and no bandit nor mudcrab will ever drop an improved piece of gear.

   I've always been a fan of big treasure. You know those big pile of gold laying around with sword and crown all shiny .. well that what I'm into.

   I cant access Nexus here at work, but I tried searching for a mod that would allow to drop gold and I did not found any yet. Any of you using a mod that would allow the creation of a BIG treasure ? 

   I've tried the ''Player.placeatme f 100'' command ... but if I use a too big amount it's seems to crash the game. Also I would like some of that gold to be in already open chest or urn or any other container. 

   I tried to make my own mod, at first I tough of an npc Banker that would accept gold from you, then make it appear mid air on top of the treasure room so that the gold could fall randomly on the chest/urn but I'm not yet good enough with papyrus to create something like that I guess.
