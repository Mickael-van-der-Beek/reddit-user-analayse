* All previous meetings have been on hard court

* Break points won in Wimbledon 2012: Federer - 34, Murray - 28

* If Murray wins, he will get his first slam in four attempts. And he becomes the first British male since Fred Perry to win a slam (1936)

* If Federer wins, he earns his 17th Slam title (and equal 7th Wimbledon title to tie with Sampras), the number one ranking, and will consequently get the record for most weeks as #1 (currently second at 285 weeks, Sampras at 286)

**11:35AM:** Match will be underway in a couple hours, with lots of history on the line. This match is a hot ticket, seats for the final reportedly being scalped for around £15,000 a pop.

**1:50PM:** They opened up the roof and it started raining a bit, we'll have to see what happens...

A lot of /r/tennis predictions so far have picked Federer as the champ, but many here still have hope for Andy.

**2:13PM:** Well that was quick, a break in the first game. Murray up 1-0.

**2:18PM:** A few forehand errors from Federer early on, Murray 2-0.

**2:22PM:** Roger holds, 2-1.

**2:30PM:** Roger yells ""C'mon"" as he evens it up, 2-2.

**4:13PM:** Play is suspended for rain at 1-1, 40-0 Federer serving. A good break for Murray, the momentum was going against him.

**4:23PM:** Announcement has been made for the closing of the roof, the shower will pass but they're expecting more later. I believe the rules state when the roof is closed, it has to stay closed for the rest of the match. Play to resume in approximately half an hour.

**4:45PM:** Players are back on court, going through their warm up again.

**4:56PM:** Good hold by Murray, you can hear the echo of the rain. 2-2 in the third.

**5:17PM:** Tenth deuce in this 2-3 serving game for Murray, Roger has had 5 break points but hasn't converted yet.

**5:19PM:** Federer breaks on his 6th chance; Andy's first serve percentage woeful at the moment. Federer leads 4-2.

**5:27PM:** 5-3, now with Federer to serve for the set.

**5:52PM:** A blazing crosscourt winner gives Federer the break! Up 3-2 in the fourth, 3 hours played.

**5:57PM:** Federer consolidates at 4-2. He turns 31 in a month, can he close this out?

**6:04PM:** Federer holds, he is one game away from the title. 5-3.

**6:07PM:** A winner brings up deuce in this Murray service game.

**6:10PM:** A backhand gone wide gives Andy the game. Federer will have to serve for it.

**6:12PM:** 15-15.

**6:14PM:** Match point, 40-15.

**6:18PM:** **4-6 7-5 6-3 6-4** / The crowd is cheering, a bit sombre there for a while as their man wasn't able to get his first Slam. Roger returns to #1, and gets his 17th Grand Slam title.

**6:22PM:** Andy Murray making his speech to the crowd, on the verge of tears. He put up a good match today.

**6:29PM:** Federer: ""As we know-- world number one, you don't get that gifted to you.""

**6:38PM:** Well that's it for Wimbledon 2012 singles, we'll be back here for the Olympics in less than three weeks; the top 4 will be gunning for the gold medal.

* [Djokovic leads the head-to-head 8-6](http://www.atpworldtour.com/Players/Head-To-Head.aspx?pId=D643&amp;oId=MC10)

* Ivan Lendl lost his first four Slam finals before winning the French Open '84 defeating John McEnroe.

* If Murray wins, he will get his first Slam in five attempts, and becomes the first British male since Fred Perry to win a Slam (USO 1936).

* If Djokovic wins, he will equal Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg for all-time number of Slam titles (six).
A win will also mean he is 535 points behind number one ranked Federer.
 
---

* **FIRST SET**

**4:22PM:** 1-1 to start the match, each player breaking one another.

**4:35PM:** Djokovic double faults at break point, his third of the match already. Murray 3-2.

**4:42PM:** Murray 4-2. Error count so far, Murray: 9 / Djokovic: 13.

**4:53PM:** Novak breaks back, you sort of the had the feeling it would happen in these conditions. 4-4.

**5:13PM:** A Murray hold takes us to a first set breaker. Who are you picking?

**5:20PM:** Tiebreak: Djokovic 4-2 at the change of ends.

**5:25PM:** Tiebreak: 5-5, Djokovic slipping sending a return into the net to square it again.

**5:35PM:** Tiebreak: 10-10, Andy has had five set points but can't convert. Physically punishing rallies.

**5:37PM:** Sir Connery likes that, Andy takes the set on his sixth set point chance 12-10.

Murray would've gone crazy if he let that go, 87 minutes played. **Murray 7-6**.

* **SECOND SET**

**5:49PM:** Murray takes a 2-0 lead after breaking Djokovic to love.

**5:58PM:** Djokovic is broken once again, Murray goes up 4-0. Goodness.

**6:02PM:** Murray broken, Novak still down a break though. Murray 4-1.

**6:16PM:** Murray 5-3, serving for a two set lead. Over two hours played.

**6:21PM:** A really atrocious game from Murray, four unforced errors and Nole breaks. Murray 5-4, on serve again.

**6:25PM:** Beautiful lob, Djokovic has raised his level again. 5-5.

**6:30PM:** Murray 6-5, on serve.

**6:37PM:** Djokovic sends it long to give Murray another break and the second set. **Murray 7-5**.

* **THIRD SET**

**6:55PM:** The first break of the third set sees Djokovic taking the lead, 2-1.

**7:04PM:** Djokovic 3-2, still has the break.

**7:13PM:** Three hours played, Novak saves two break points. Djokovic 4-2.

**7:17PM:** Skidding ball catches Andy by surprise, and he is broken again. Djokovic serving for the third, 5-2.

**7:22PM:** With a smash, Djokovic takes the third, Murray still leading two sets to one. **Djokovic 6-2**.

Murray has 18 winners to 38 errors, Djokovic with 20 to 44.

* **FOURTH SET**

**7:29PM:** Novak screams, ""**C'mon!!**"" as he breaks Murray's opening service. Djokovic 1-0.

**7:49PM:** Djokovic 3-1, saves a break point.

Novak is given a time violation, there should really be some leeway in that situation; that wasn't really warranted.

**8:01PM:** Stunning defense from Djokovic, maintains the lead 4-2.

**8:09PM:** Djokovic 5-3.

**8:14PM:** Andy Murray sends it long and Djokovic breaks to even it up in this final. **Djokovic 6-3**.

Just over four hours played, both players fighting hard; this is going to be really agonizing for the runner-up.

* **FINAL SET**

**8:22PM:** Murray breaks to open the deciding set. Murray 1-0.

**8:35PM:** Djokovic is broken once again, Murray leads 3-0. This could be the day...

**8:41PM:** Andy sends a slice wide and gives Novak one of the breaks back. Murray 3-1.

**8:51PM:** Murray 4-2.

**8:56PM: !!!** Novak is broken once again... Andy Murray serving for his first Grand Slam trophy at 5-2.

Djokovic calling for the trainer, now taking a medical time-out. Crowd is giving him a bit of grief.

**9:01PM:** Murray service: 40-0, three Championship points.

**9:03PM:** 40-15.

**9:04PM: Andy Murray is the 2012 US Open Champion (7-6, 7-5, 2-6, 3-6, 6-2)**

**9:06PM:** Novak tries to rocket a FH winner but it goes long, the drought is over... Andy Murray is a Grand Slam champion. He did it the hard way in a dramatic five-setter beating the defending champ.

Djokovic battled hard but there probably wasn't much in his legs in that last set after playing two hours yesterday.

**9:11PM:** Djokovic: ""It wasn't to be, but I want to congratulate Andy for his first Grand Slam. He absolutely deserves it.""

**9:12PM:** A wry smile from Lendl as he's mentioned in the post-match interview.

**9:16PM:** This caps off a great summer for Andy, runner-up at Wimbledon, singles Gold and mixed Silver at the Olympics and now his maiden Slam, the US Open 2012.

We will now have to retire those Murray Slam jokes.

* **FINAL SET**

**12:04AM:** Nole broken straight away to begin, Wawrinka 1-0.

**12:13AM:** Djokovic breaks back, and also breaks the Kia signage on the other side. 1-1.

**12:18AM:** Two break points saved by Novak, it's on serve. Djokovic 2-1.

**12:41AM:** Stan saves a break point to even it up at 4-4. Clock ticks over 4 hours played.

**12:51AM:** Incredible from Djokovic, he saves four break points. Dodgy line call there at a critical moment... Stan has to serve to stay in it from now on, Djokovic 5-4.

**1:00AM:** 6-6, challenges refreshed.

**1:29AM:** Djokovic 11-10.

**1:40AM:** Third match point for Djokovic.

**1:42AM: Djokovic wins (1-6, 7-5, 6-4, 6-7, 12-10)**

---

**1:52AM:** Stan does an amazing job to hold off two match points, but Djokovic converts the third in the dramatic last game; really unfortunate for Wawrinka, the win could've easily have gone his way. 5h, 2m played.

Incredible tennis by both guys, and a pretty nice tonic to a day that featured some average matches.

Novak advances to play Tomas Berdych in the quarterfinals, presumably the night match on Tuesday.

1372514016.0,100,self.tennis,1hb5zz,Me and Pete (Sampras) A cautionary tale...,ScratchingPork,127,27,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/1hb5zz/me_and_pete_sampras_a_cautionary_tale/,"I modelled my tennis on Pete Sampras when I was younger, I wanted the full works: I had the all the clothes, luckily I didn’t have the hair, but I did tap my foot twice before serving, just like Pete.

The problem was that he played with a unique racquet; 15% smaller than everyone else's, being a boy, this challenge just made it even more desirable. So I saved and I saved, until I finally had the legendary Wilson Original in my hand. It was magnificent: matt black, with an uncompromising, manly frame. However out on court it was nothing like I imagined; it was akin to playing tennis with a squash racquet. Yet, convinced I would improve, I persisted with the monstrosity. 

As time went by, with little improvement, I had the thought that perhaps my downturn in form was to do with the strings! The strings! Salvation would be mine shortly. Of course, Pete being Pete, strung his racquet 20% higher than everyone else (even the pros), and all I could do was follow his path (silencing the nagging doubts in my mind). Predictably, it made my game tank further, not only was the racquet tiny but it now became like playing with a plank of wood. That combined with a growing fondness for beer did not bode well for my ambitions…

Because of my stubbornness I continued for years, wasting the peak of my tennis “career” trying to play with a tool that was created for one of the greatest players to ever live. With my ambitions rooted firmly in the Middlesex county league, I should have realized the size of the gulf between us sooner Pete! 

I would eventually break the racquet in a moment of frustration, and change to something more manageable, but by then the damage was done: Sampras had ruined my game. To this day, whenever I miss a shot, I don't swear, I just mutter under my breath: "" for Pete's sake"".

---

**2:05PM:** The roof was closed for the Women's Doubles, but it is now being opened again for this match.

Wimbledon rules dictate when the roof is closed it must stay closed for the rest of the match; I have no idea if the Olympic rules differ... maybe someone out there knows.

* **FIRST SET**

**2:22PM:** Good hold for Murray after facing two BPs. Murray 1-0.

**2:24PM:** Federer serving great to start. 1-1.

**2:32PM:** The Swiss snuffs out a BP to bring it to 2-2.

**2:36PM:** Murray 3-2, on serve. Good serving from both men so far.

**2:46PM:** Federer is broken! Murray leading 4-2 in the opening set.

**2:51PM:** An ace and the Scot runs to a 5-2. This CC crowd is amped.

**2:56PM:** In 37 minutes, Andy Murray has taken the first set playing some commanding tennis and breaking the Swiss service twice. **Murray 6-2**.

* **SECOND SET**

**3:03PM:** Murray playing the match of his life, has broken Federer again. Murray 2-0.

**3:20PM:** Gigantic game just played, Federer had six break points but could not convert. The Scot producing some nice passing winners, Murray 3-0.

**3:27PM:** Federer double faults to give Murray a 4-0 lead. Could this be the day?

**3:35PM:** Federer on the board now, but set might be done. Andy serving for it 5-1.

**3:42PM:** Incredible, the Scot takes the second set. Federer had seven chances to break that set and couldn't convert. **Murray 6-1**.

* **THIRD SET**

**3:47PM:** Two opening love games. 1-1.

**3:53PM:** 2-2, Fed with 26 U.E. to 19 winners.

**3:56PM:** Federer broken, Murray 3-2. If he can hold all his serves he gets the Gold, big story in the making.

**4:00PM:** Murray in the zone, just hit an effortless winner to bring lead to 4-2.

**4:05PM:** Murray had a chance to break again but Federer holds. Murray still has one break though, 4-3.

**4:09PM:** Murray is just one game away from the Gold. Murray 5-3.

It's been a combination of Andy playing lights out and the Swiss far from his best.

**4:10PM:** Andy serving for it at 5-4.

**4:13PM:** Murray service: 40-15. Two Gold Medal points.

**4:14PM: Andy Murray is the London 2012 Gold Medalist.**

**4:18PM: 6-2 6-1 6-4** / Andy Murray played an incredible match today to win the Gold Medal, something he said he cared more about than a Slam. At the end he goes to the box to give everyone a hug.

**4:20PM:** He can still do the double Gold, he plays soon with Laura Robson against Azarenka/Miryni.

**4:21PM:** What a big moment in Murray's career. The US Open is a month from now. With a hurt Nadal and mentally dejected Federer/Djokovic, could Murray get his first Grand Slam?

**4:28PM:** Medal Ceremony: Juan Martin Del Potro took out Djokovic in straights to get his first Medal, a good effort after a tough loss.

**4:29PM:** Roger receives his medal and kisses it, his first in singles. He applauds Andy as his name is called.

**4:30PM:** Packed house sings the anthem, I have never seen Andy Murray smile so much.

**4:37PM:** Quite a match, it was a comprehensive win. Murray took the lead and never lost it.

The last match I'm updating for London will be the Mixed Doubles Gold Match, Andy looking to do the double.",,False,self,t5_2qiq1,1344190047.0,,lacoste,True,t3_xpoix,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/xpoix/match_thread_federer_vs_murray_gold_medal_match/,

I wanted to just make contact not look stupid swinging hard and missing completely as people have done before me. But at the last second I just said fuck it go for it.

My problem is that /r/tennis is really the least active of all major sports, which is a shame since tennis is such a popular sport across the world.  
I was recommending some changes to the /r/tennis subreddit that would be for the better like:

1. Official Draw threads for at the very least the grandslams

2. A more interesting layout. While I prefer the simpler reddit themes to the super complicated ones, a little more themed banner would be more appealing and identifiable for new people who come here for the first time.

3. Flair showing out favorite players or surfaces, maybe even the level we play on.

4. Official threads for trainers or new players looking for tips. This already occurs but its so intermingled with new stories that I feel like a weekly official thread or maybe even its own affiliated subreddit would really help.

5. Contests for Tennis merch, hell I'd donate something if it meant getting more people active.

**4:48PM: Break!** Ferrer sends his FH wide to get broken to love, it's going to be difficult to turn this around.

He also becomes the first man to win a single Grand Slam tournament 8 times.

**5:49PM:** Well Ferrer didn't win today, but he will reclaim the No. 4 ranking to push Nadal out of the Top 4.

He did put up a respectable performance today, but never quite sparked the possibility of an upset.

I'm 26 and just started playing in a rec league a year ago. Before that I just played friends on occasion. I've always had a lot of natural ability (I'm an athletic guy, played hockey in high school) but since I started playing in a rec league I've been getting beaten by players with more experience just due to their consistency. My forehand has been a horrible weakness. Oddly, my one-handed backhand has been by far my better shot. It's been super frustrating to lose on unforced errors and double faults and I've come close to just giving up.

I've been working on my forehand a lot, since I was always over hitting or just not hitting with spin and accuracy. Made a lot of changes. Switched to an open stance, got a different racquet that gave me some more spin and power, worked on extending my arm, played for hours against a wall, watched tons of video, did a lot of shadow swinging while hanging out watching TV. I think the biggest difference has been learning how to load my weight on my outside leg and then transfer during the swing. Took forever to get that right.

Anyway, yesterday I played the first match in my life where I feel like my forehand was *on* the whole time. I still lost due to fatigue and streaky serving (definitely my next improvement areas), but for the first time I didn't want to throw my racquet through the fence because of unforced errors on my groundstrokes. I lost, but I actually felt *good* afterward.

I've come really close to just giving up on playing in leagues and yesterday things just finally clicked. I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while, found a lot of tips and resources from here and just wanted to share my joy and relief with some tennis enthusiasts.

TLDR; I'm finally not a useless sack of shit on my forehand. Tennis is fun again.",,False,self,t5_2qiq1,False,,,True,t3_1jtdq1,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/1jtdq1/i_finally_started_to_hit_a_good_forehand_and_holy/,

---

* **SECOND SET**

**6:52PM:** Federer took the first set tiebreak 7-5, and Stakhovsky won the second 7-5. **Stakhovsky 6-7, 7-6**.

It's fairly even, both have had break points but no conversions. And both are serving well with good winner to UFE ratios.

**6:55PM:** Roger had a couple of breaks points but still can't convert. Stakhovsky holds for 1-1.

**7:05PM:** Excellent serve-and-volleying today from Stakhovsky, he gets a second consecutive love hold. 3-3.

**7:14PM:** Stakhovsky was at 0-30 but he holds. 4-4.

**7:24PM: Break!** Roger BH is framed and it's long. The first break of the match, Stakhovsky serving for the 3rd set leading 6-5.

**7:26PM:** More great net play from the Ukranian, he puts away the volley to go 2-1 up on the champ. **Stakhovsky 6-7, 7-6, 7-5**.

* **FOURTH SET**

**7:33PM:** Love hold for Stakhovsky, 1-1.

**7:37PM: Break!** BH volley is netted from Rog, he is now down a break without having broken all match. Stakhovsky 2-1.

**7:51PM: Break!** Stakhovsky nets at 30-40, and gets broken for the first time in 2 and a half hours. 3-3.

**7:56PM:** Getting tense as the set goes on, Stakhovsky holds to love for 4-4.

**8:04PM:** Still very close out here. Federer 6-5, on serve.

**8:15PM:** Tiebreak: Stakhovsky 6-4, two match points.

**8:16PM: Stakhovsky wins (6-7, 7-6, 7-5, 7-6)**

---

**8:26PM:** Roger sends it the ball wide on match point and joins the many seeds that have exited on Day 3.

His long standing Grand Slam QF streak of 36 is finally snapped, and he will most likely drop to the 5th ranking.

Great stuff from Stakhovsky, playing about as well as you could ask for; between him and Dustin Brown, there was much serve-and-volley to be seen today.

* Their most recent encounter was at the French Open 2012: Del Potro lead two sets to love
but was defeated struggling with his knee injury from the third set onwards (3-6, 6-7, 6-2, 6-0, 6-3).

* Other than Rafael Nadal, Del Potro is the only other player to beat Federer in a Grand Slam final.

---

**12:28PM:** The winners today are guaranteed a medal, and I give Roger a fairly high chance to progress.

Although Del Potro has a substantial losing record against the Swiss, he shouldn't be completely counted out in a best of three.

* **FIRST SET**

**12:29PM:** Delpo serving first, holds. Del Potro 1-0.

**12:31PM:** Federer gets a double fault in this first service game, but holds comfortably. 1-1.

**12:56PM:** Trouble for the Swiss, 15-40. Two break points.

**12:58PM:** Federer broken, Delpo to serve for the set. 5-3.

**1:01PM:** Wonderful serving and extremely strong off both wings, Del Potro takes the first set. **Del Potro 6-3**.

* **SECOND SET**

**1:06PM:** Federer holds his first service of the second set, 1-0.

**1:16PM:** Del Potro saves two breaks points to hold, 1-1.

**1:22PM:** 2-2, both players serving well so far.

**1:24PM:** Delpo has a chance to break, 30-40.

**1:29PM:** Fourth deuce, the Swiss producing lots of errors this game.

**1:37PM:** 3-3, the Argentine coming in net a lot and it's helping; saved a break point.

**1:42PM:** 4-4.

**1:45PM:** BP chance for Del Potro, this could be the match.

**1:48PM:** Federer saves an important break point, he is mistiming a lot of his shots. Haven't seen this many errors since the Djokovic RG match. On serve at 5-4.

**1:58PM:** A Federer error brings up the second set tiebreak, the Gold Medal Match is on the line.

**2:00PM:** Tiebreak: 1-1.

**2:04PM:** Tiebreak: Federer 4-3.

**2:06PM:** Tiebreak: Federer 5-4, but on serve.

**2:08PM:** Centre Court erupts in a cheer, Federer has won the second set tiebreaker 7-5. **Federer 7-6**.

* **FINAL SET**

**2:13PM:** Although he won the second set, this match is still very much even. Del Potro holds opener, 1-0.

**2:18PM:** Federer saved two break points his first service. Delpo slipping on the grass, seems okay for now. 1-1.

**2:36PM:** Delpo yet to be broken. 3-3.

**2:45PM:** Del Potro saves a break point, JMDP is leading 4-3 on serve.

**2:48PM:** 4-4.

**2:58PM:** 5-5. Roger will now have to hold each serve to stay in the match.

**3:13PM:** 7-7.

**3:20PM:** Federer had a break point but found the net, JMDP holds. 8-7.

**3:33PM:** Over 3 hours played, locked at 9-9.

**3:38PM:** Mistimed swing from JMDP at 30-40 gives the Swiss his first break of the match. Now serving for a place in the Gold Medal Match.

**3:42PM:** My goodness, Fed didn't even win a point in that game. Back to 10-10.

**4:06PM:** 13-13.

**4:19PM:** 15-14. Amazing, JMDP saved three break points and scored 5 points a row to hold.

**4:30PM:** 16-16, the Raonic-Tsonga record is broken; over four hours played.

**4:40PM:** 17-17.

**4:45PM:** Del Potro is broken for the second time, but can Roger hold on? 18-17.

**4:49PM:** Fed service: 40-30. Federer roars on a wide shot. Match point...

**4:50PM:** The whole crowd gasps as he can't convert a net volley. Deuce.

**4:51PM: Federer wins**

**4:53PM: 3-6 7-6 19-17** / 4 hours and 25 minutes played, as he won there was no huge celebration from the Swiss; he knows he's still got work to do. Roger Federer has guaranteed his first Olympic Singles medal in Sunday's final.

Juan Martin Del Potro leaves the court in tears, if he had won, it would have been just as deserved. He goes to play in the Bronze Medal Match before the final, and is still in the Mixed Doubles with Dulko later today.

I am 95% sure if Federer was broken on that one break point in the second, JMDP would have won it. Really close.

I will be updating the Murray-Djokovic match later, look out for that.",,False,self,t5_2qiq1,1344009528.0,,lacoste,True,t3_xm5of,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/xm5of/match_thread_federer_vs_del_potro_mens_singles/,

* CSS for hiding titles with scores/results (hiding = spoiler tag in /r/puzzles).
* CSS for highlighting the match threads (by changing the title color and/or putting an icon in front of the title). I think, this will encourage more discussion during the matches.
* Update the sidebar to inlcude common info that people often ask in the subreddit. For example, links to watch highlights, live streams etc. Also, links to schedule of the upcoming matches/tournaments. Links to tennis networking websites. Probably not all of these, but whatever the members need most.
* Personalized flairs. Define a set of flairs in the css, and then users can pick from one of the available flairs. Text based or image based. We use country flags in the cricket subreddit, club logo in the soccer subreddit. 
* We also have a pic on our cricket subreddit (in the sidebar) and we keep changing it based on the current events.

What do you think of these changes? Any other suggestions?

I'll be happy to assist the mods with any of these tasks.

**Edit: typos**

**Edit (more suggestions):**

* [abuttfarting](http://www.reddit.com/user/abuttfarting) suggested banning people for posting results/scores in title. I think, it would be better to put a warning on the submission page (like /r/funny)

**Edit:  A plea to all /r/tennis members:** Please avoid downvoting posts/comments just because you are not interested or you don't agree. Downvote useless posts/comments.

* Head-to-head: **[Federer 9 : 3 Tsonga](http://www.atpworldtour.com/Players/Head-To-Head.aspx?pId=F324&amp;oId=T786)**

* Federer has made the semifinals of the French Open 7 of the last 8 years (Soderling, QF 2010) 

* Ferrer and Tsonga are the two Quarterfinalists yet to drop a set

* Tsonga has yet to make the French Open semifinals; last year he had 4 match points against Djokovic, but couldn't convert and subsequently lost in 5 sets

---

* **FIRST SET**

**4:31PM:** A bit of a loosey goosey game for Federer to begin, he holds to save the first break point of the match. 1-1.

**4:33PM:** Good serving, Jo yet to drop a point on his service. Tsonga 2-1, on serve.

**4:40PM: Break!** Fed crosscourt forehand winner on his first BP chance earns him the break. Federer 3-2.

**4:45PM:** Federer 4-3, with the break.

**4:51PM: Break!** Roger had points to hold but loses four points in a row to get broken back. 4-4.

**5:13PM: Break!** Federer sends the backhand wide to get broken to love. Jo with 4 games in a row, 2-0.

**5:38PM:** Federer holds, Jo now serving to take a two sets to love lead after 73 minutes. Tsonga 5-3.

**5:40PM:** Fantastic first two sets from JWT, one set away from his first semifinal in Paris. **Tsonga 7-5, 6-3**.

It will take something special to come back from this, Federer hasn't had a good look at breaking Tsonga's service since he converted in the first set.

* **THIRD SET**

**5:46PM: Break!** Things are looking a bit grim as Rog double faults on 30-40. Tsonga 1-0.

**5:50PM: Break!** Wide serve sees Federer running around to his FH to hit a clean winner. 1-1.

**6:17PM: Tsonga wins (7-5, 6-3, 6-3)**

---

**6:20PM:** Great victory for Jo, he kept it together and played solidly even after he was down the early break.

He books a place in his first RG semifinal against David Ferrer, who is trying to make it to his first Slam final.

Federer struggled with his serve most of the match, only winning 58% of his first serve points and no aces.",,False,self,t5_2qiq1,1370363304.0,,lacoste,True,t3_1fnhsq,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/1fnhsq/match_thread_federer_vs_tsonga_quarterfinal_2013/,moderator

I just finished my match, haven't even taken a shower yet - but I wanted to let you know how much everyones advice helped my game.

I won 6-0, 6-1. I'm blown away right now.  My opponent recently got bumped up to 4.5, and on paper, is a much...much better player than I am (I recently got bumped up to 4.0).  In my region, the difference between 4.0 and 4.5 is great.

The match itself was also rather significant.  Due to my win, our team ended up placed ahead of the third placed team in our division, and made it to playoffs. Not only that, we were tied with the 3rd placed team on wins, so it came down to ""individual games won"" - where we won by 3.  If I had given up any more than 4 games, even if I won, our team would have been knocked out of playoffs.

***

**How I won:**

* As suggested, I removed his weapon nearly entirely by using four different strategies.

* I very rarely hit it to his forehand, 85% of his hits were backhand shots...and over time, I could tell that his arm weakened.  His accuracy plummeted as we neared the end of the first set.

* If he hit to my backhand, I stepped far up into it so I took it on the rise - and either drove it to his backhand, or put a slower-paced down the line shot.  As he ran to his right to return these balls, he was having serious trouble driving it back to my backhand.  He hit them out, or he hit them cross-court.

* When he did catch me with a big looping shot to my backhand that I wasn't able to step up into, I gave a looping shot back over with quite a bit of topspin.  A rather high percentage shot with very little pace.  He over-hit this shot quite often.

* I was cheating my to backhand side, so if he hit a hard shot to my forehand - I ran it down and sliced it back low.  For whatever reason, he was having trouble with his forehand shot when I hit these type shots.

* When I got up 3-0 in the first game he started hitting balls in frustration after the point was over into the fence.  By the start of the second set he was yelling and throwing his racquet.  I never, ever, ever lose my cool - and I love it when my opponents lose it.

Also a funny moment with a lucky dribbling ball over the net cord in that game, Federer 4-2.

**11:04PM:** Federer 5-2.

**11:14PM:** Tsonga saves 4 match points on his service, now the match is on Roger's racquet. Federer 5-3.

1372255713.0,49,self.tennis,1h3wg4,Kimiko Date-Krumm goes old school in her 42 minute win over Carina Witthoft.,dropshot,55,6,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/1h3wg4/kimiko_datekrumm_goes_old_school_in_her_42_minute/,"The late 1980s and early 1990s was a time of change for women's tennis.  Watch a match from the early 1970s, and you saw the remnants of the serve and volley players like Billie Jean King and Evonne Goolagong, players who sliced off their backhands and came to net.

As the men were undergoing the baseline revolution with Bjorn Borg and Jimmy Connors, players that hit imperiously from the back court and pushed the two-handed backhand into mainstream acceptance, so Chris Evert did the same, her steady drumbeat groundstrokes, flat, precise, unwavering.

Like McEnroe was to Borg, the ultimate in serve and volley to the backboard, so Navratilova was to Evert.  None realized the game was to undergo a transformation that would sent it in farflung directions.  For the men, the revolution came in three parts.  Lendl showed you could hit winners from the baseline with a powerful forehand and powerful serve.  Then, Becker and Agassi were his successors.  For the women's game, it was Steffi Graf, so called Fraulein Forehand, whose pace was unheard of until Monica Seles arrived and could hit hard on both sides.

In the midst of this power revolution, there was the oddity of Kimiko Date (Dah-tay).  Mary Carillo coined the term ""Big Babe Tennis"" to describe Lindsay Davenport, Mary Pierce, Jennifer Capriati.  These were tall women that clubbed the ball inspired by Steffi Graf.  Date was small, not terribly fast, but she did what she could to defy big babe tennis.

Date knew she lacked the strength of tall players, and indeed, she lacked the topspin and the speed.  Date's strength was the compactness of her shot, hit more like an extended half-volley, barely a backswing and barely a follow through.  She took the ball off the rise, lest the balls bounce too far up where her diminutive size would find it a challenge to reach.  She hit to the sidelines, to the baseline, taking risk after risk.

Where Chris Evert and even Graf and Seles were used to rallies that went 20 shots or more, Date's shots were like a time bomb of unforced errors.  She would rarely hit more than 5-6 shots before either she won the point or lost it, and sometimes, she lost it right away, her games mimicking those of a serve and volleyer.

Then, in 1996, she retired short of her 26th birthday.  She wanted to do other things with her life.  She ran.  She got married to a German race car driver, Michael Krumm in 2001.  She entertained a brief comeback in 2002, but made her first serious attempt in 2008.  This was, apparently, no lark.  This wasn't Borg trying to play with a wood racquet years after he retired in 1982 and then gracefully retiring.  In 2013, Date is in her fifth year of her second career.

In the meanwhile, the game Date-Krumm left when she retired continued to evolve, with bigger hitters, bigger topspin, and her flat style become even more of an oddity.

1995 was the year Carina Witthoft was born.  As Date-Krumm contemplated retirement, Witthoef wasn't even a tennis player.  She made it through qualifying even beating Aussie hopeful, Casey Dellacqua in the final round.  Not bad for a player whose rank is over 700.

She had, one imagines, been told that Date-Krumm's style is a bit weird and that she had to be careful.

In the blink of an eye, Witthoft was down 6-0 in a first set that lasted only 16 minutes.  Witthoft didn't help matters by serving only 30% and then winning only 30% of first and second serves.  Meanwhile, nearly every return by Date-Krumm fell near a sideline or baseline with Witthoft dumb-struck.

She managed to hold serve, and break serve, but Date-Krumm served pretty well, and managed to win points before she lost them, a problem she's always having to deal with, lacking a topspin shot to give her safety.

The new Date-Krumm comes to net more often, whether it be a serve and volley point, or taking shots out of the air.  She doesn't want to get in rallies where the other player is dictating, moving her side to side, where age and speed work against her.  And while Date-Krumm's errant shots will likely get the best of her soon, for a round, just a single round, she can imagine what it was like to be at her peak, showing the young'uns that this old lady of tennis still knows a thing or two about winning.",,False,self,t5_2qiq1,False,,yonex,True,t3_1h3wg4,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/1h3wg4/kimiko_datekrumm_goes_old_school_in_her_42_minute/,

I think this is a great cause, so I launched this project to collect used (and new) tennis gear for these children in Ghana that are playing with makeshift wooden paddles and old tennis balls.  The pictures are worth a thousand words.  Hopefully we can generate some interest (and a stack of old kids racquets for that matter.)

edit:  Top of /r/tennis!  Thanks to everyone for the great response here.  We have an address in MD to keep shipping costs down.  It will cost about 7 or 8 bucks to ship a single kids racquet and of course the cost will go down per racquet if you can collect a group of them, either at your local thrift store, yard sales, tennis club, or craigslist.

**7:55PM:** 41 minutes played, only one break point chance so far with no conversions. 5-5.

**7:58PM: Break!** Rafa at 30-0, but drops 4 points a row to get broken first. Federer serving for the set at 6-5.

**8:03PM:** Rog looked rough at the start, but he holds for a strong finish to the opening set. **Federer 7-5**.

* **SECOND SET**

**8:18PM:** Rafa gets his first break points at 15-40 on Fed's serve, but can't convert. Federer holds for 2-2.

**8:30PM:** Nadal under pressure at 0-30, but he wins 4 points in a row to hold. Nadal 4-3, on serve.

**8:35PM:** That was quite a point from Federer to hold, it is 4-4.

**8:39PM:** Rog all out of Hawkeye challenges in this set. Nadal 5-4, on serve.

**8:47PM: Break!** Forehand winner from Rafa to break and square the match at one set all. **Nadal 5-7, 6-4**.

* **FINAL SET**

**8:56PM: Break!** Forehand pass down the line at 30-40, and Nadal has the early break to lead 2-0.

**9:15PM:** Clock ticks over to 2 hours played, as Rog saves 2 break points and holds. Nadal 4-2.

**9:17PM:** Nadal holds to love to go within a game of taking the match. Nadal 5-2.

**9:21PM:** Fed holds, and now Rafa will serve for the semifinal leading 5-3.

**9:23PM:** Nadal service (5-3): 40-0, triple match point for Nadal.

**9:27PM:** Nadal service (5-3): Adv. Nadal, fifth match point.

**9:28PM: Nadal wins (5-7, 6-4, 6-3)**

---

**9:29PM:** Federer saves four match points in the final game, but Nadal holds on to make his 3rd semifinal in Cincinnati. Apparently the winning ball from Rafa was in fact out, but Roger did not challenge it.

A very entertaining match, high quality from both men tonight; but unfortunately for Roger, he will now drop down to world No. 7 after being unable to defend his 6 titles from 2012.

1372996221.0,46,self.tennis,1ho882,The astute Ivan Lendl,dropshot,60,14,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/1ho882/the_astute_ivan_lendl/,"I just heard an interview with Ivan Lendl on Tennis Channel.  He's generally pretty terse in his responses, sort of in the vein of Gregg Popovich or Bill Belichick (for those who follow American sports).  He was asked about the match between Murray and Verdasco.

He said he and Andy were hoping Verdasco would play a few bad games, and that he played a bad set (3rd set), then a bad game (4th set) and two great games (in the fifth).  I think that was a very succinct way to summarize how the match was.  The end of the fifth set finally saw Murray being aggressive, and this caused Verdasco, who plays weaker defense than Nadal, to struggle and reach shots, many of which he missed.

Lendl was the original thoughtful planner, who did all sorts of things to gain an edge, from weight training to fitness, to getting his racquets to be weighed and strung the same.  He was the guy who switched racquets at every changeover, who played with racquets that Connors and McEnroe used to see what the racquets could do.  He invited juniors to play with him (including Sampras).  He had his courts in Connecticut surfaced just like the US Open.  He has Murray practicing at the same time the match has occurred.

Murray is similarly smart, but having an experienced veteran behind him helps in second guess less on what he does.",,False,self,t5_2qiq1,False,,yonex,True,t3_1ho882,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/1ho882/the_astute_ivan_lendl/,

---

**6:23PM:** This is a difficult one for me to pick, I'm leaning towards a Novak victory but Andy is more than capable of winning today. What are the people of /r/tennis predicting?

* **FIRST SET**

**6:35PM:** Murray up 1-0, Novak facing break points in his first service game 15-40.

**6:38PM:** Djokovic saves break points in his opening service to tie it 1-1.

**6:49PM:** Murray holds with an extended rally, the point of the match thus far. Murray 3-2. The crowd begins chanting ""GB!""...

**6:54PM:** 3-3.

**7:04PM:** Murray 4-3, on serve. Was taken to deuce four times that game, both players running each other ragged with 33 minutes played.

**7:10PM:** 4-4, this is a highly entertaining encounter. Their defensive skills on song tonight.

**7:19PM:** Murray 6-5, Novak will have to serve to bring this first set to a tiebreak.

**7:25PM:** A passing shot gives Andy Murray the first set at 30-40. **Murray 7-5**, man this is good.

* **SECOND SET**

**7:33PM:** The Serb screams out when unable to convert a break point at 30-40.

**7:36PM:** Murray 1-0, on serve. Both men playing very well at the moment.

**7:38PM:** Andy gets first point by playing a weird volley dropshot as he's rolling across the ground and just hitting the line. Unreal, 0-15.

**7:49PM:** Murray 2-1, on serve. His serving percentage is down but he's still crushing his forehand.

**8:00PM:** 3-3, Andy's mixed doubles with Robson has been cancelled for today.

**8:03PM:** Murray 4-3, on serve. The light is fading.

**8:07PM:** 4-4.

**8:15PM:** A chance for Djokovic to get the break is met with an unreturnable serve, Murray holds and screams ""C'mon!"" to his box. Murray 5-4.

**8:18PM:** Insane rally at 0-15, the Serb kissing the line with a forehand winner.

**8:20PM:** 5-5, this will probably be going to a breaker.

**8:27PM:** Murray 6-5. Every game is being contested, nothing is being given away at all.

Very tense, Novak to serve to bring up a TB.

**8:30PM:** Three match points for Andy Murray.

**8:31PM: Murray wins**

**8:41PM: 7-5 7-5** / That's easily one of the best matches I've seen Murray play. A month after Wimbledon, the two finalists will meet on Centre Court again to fight for the Gold Medal; this will be a best of five match contrary to the rest of the tournament.

This loss for Djokovic means Roger's #1 ranking is safe for another two weeks. Novak goes on to play Del Potro for the Bronze Medal, having also won Bronze in Beijing.

**8:45PM:** Murray: ""It's more like a concert rather than a tennis match.""",,False,self,t5_2qiq1,1344023132.0,,lacoste,True,t3_xmn44,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/xmn44/match_thread_djokovic_vs_murray_mens_singles/,

* **Head-to-head: [Nadal 7 - 3 Del Potro](http://www.atpworldtour.com/Players/Head-To-Head.aspx?pId=D683&amp;oId=N409)**

* Nadal looking to win his 22nd ATP Masters trophy, Del Potro trying to win his first

* Nadal's last hard court title was in October 2010 (Japan Open), his last 9 title wins since that time have all been on clay court

* Del Potro has won in his last 5 finals appearances

---

**2:17PM:** Rafa serving first.

* **FIRST SET**

**2:31PM:** Nadal converts his fourth break point of the game with a forehand winner, goes up 2-0 after 14 minutes.

**2:42PM:** Delpo saves a couple of break points to hold, but still down a break. Nadal 3-1.

**2:48PM:** Rafa serves out wide on break point, and Delpo runs around it to hit a clean winner. Back on serve, Nadal 3-2.

**2:56PM:** Love hold for Nadal to go up 4-3, on serve.

**3:04PM:** Long forehand from Nadal on 15-40 to give away the break. Del Potro to serve for the set leading 5-4.

**3:09PM:** Del Potro service (5-4): 40-30, two sets points saved by Rafa.

**3:11PM:** Both guys close to net, Delpo hits backhand volley winner to seal the first set. **Del Potro 6-4**.

Crazy to think that Nadal had a couple of break points to almost go up 4-0.

* **SECOND SET**

**3:17PM:** A few missed forehands by Rafa in his opening service gives JMDP the early break. Del Potro 1-0.

**3:22PM:** Delpo saves a break point to keep his lead, that makes it 8 of the last 9 games. Del Potro 2-0.

**3:53PM:** Love hold for Nadal makes it a fourth game in a row. Match is square at one set all, **Nadal 4-6, 6-3**.

* **FINAL SET**

**4:07PM:** Big hold for JMDP, saves three break points in the opener. Holds for 1-0.

**4:10PM:** Love hold for Rafa, 1-1. Delpo showing signs of struggling physically, he has played about 7 and half hours over 3 days.

**4:41PM:** Delpo saves three match points, will have to break now to keep the match going. Nadal serving at 5-4.

**4:45PM:** Nadal service (5-4): 40-15, two more Championship points for Rafa.

**4:46PM: Rafael Nadal is the 2013 Indian Wells Masters champion (4-6, 6-3, 6-4)**

---

**4:47PM:** Del Potro sends the ball wide at 40-15, and Nadal collapses to the ground in celebration.

It was a great Indian Wells run for Delpo, taking out Murray and Djokovic in consecutive days.

Nadal captures his 22nd Masters title, and first non-clay court title in 2+1/2 years; now 17-1 since coming back.

**4:55PM:** News before the match says Nadal will not be playing the Miami Masters, says he has to rest his knee.

[Women's Draw](http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/scores/draws/ws/wsdraw.pdf)

Now, here's the deal.  Post your winner in this post.  Hopefully it stays around for the two weeks!  The winner from each draw will get a 5pack of any Gamma brand string, your choice, for free.  A few lucky randoms of my choice will also receive a goody or two.  Naturally, we are bound to have some ties.  To keep this from happening, when you pick your winner, post the number of sets you predict they will PLAY FOR THE TOURNAMENT as well as TOTAL GAMES PLAYED in the FINALS.  Sounds confusing, but it looks like this:

Federer-18s-21g

1370731578.0,42,self.tennis,1fy85g,What can David Ferrer do to win?,dropshot,49,7,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/1fy85g/what_can_david_ferrer_do_to_win/,"Everyone treats the final as a foregone conclusion: Rafa is going to win.  And there are certainly plenty of reasons to believe this.

Rafa has only ever lost to Ferrer on clay once and that was their first meeting back in 2004.  Even then, Rafa pushed Ferrer to 3 sets, although, one could argue the Ferrer of today is far better than the Ferrer of 2004.

Everyone admires David Ferrer's work ethic, his ability to beat players that you think he couldn't stay with, players like Tsonga, Berdych, del Potro.  Ferrer does quite well against big servers and big hitters.  Recall he was the guy that finally beat Jerzy Janowicz at Paris last year, and he also beat Milos Raonic when he has a good Australian Open run.

But against Nadal, Djokovic, and Federer, Ferrer has struggled to win. Some of it, I think, is mental.  Ferrer is kind of in awe of these players, especially Nadal and Federer, and might play less than his best tennis.

The things that work against David Ferrer:

* **Lacks a big serve.**  Ferrer is a big serve away, perhaps, from being a top 4 player.  Without a big serve, Ferrer is working every point.  Nadal may not have a big serve either, but that spin seems to give people a lot of trouble, and so Nadal picks up a lot of free points anyway.
* **Lacks a putaway shot.**  Nadal is sometimes characterized as ""defensive"", but if he gets a shot that's weak up the middle, he attacks that shot.  And Nadal, when he's playing his best defense, makes incredible gets and passes.  Ferrer is quick, but Nadal does more when he gets to shots than Ferrer.  Again, the lack of a putaway shot means Ferrer has to work hard.
* **Doesn't ""go"" for it.**  Announcers are only more than happy to tell you that a player has nothing to lose, and so miracles will happen as they go for winners which they never had, and they land magically in.  If that were so easy, then why not do that all the time.  Usually, the result is a player playing something that's not their game, and losing quickly.

Many of these criticisms actually apply to Murray, except with Murray, everyone knew he had the power to play a harder hitting game, but often was reluctant to do so.  Murray built up his serve over the years, and though he sometimes lacks consistency, he does get a few free points that Ferrer doesn't.  Murray, with his work with Lendl, has also been more aggressive off the ground, trying to end points sooner, but there is still some discomfort for Murray playing that style.

In a way, a lack of aggressiveness is also Nadal's problem, but he often plays such great defense, and he can turn defense to offense and dictate with the forehand, that even though he doesn't go full Verdasco and try to attack all the time, he's quite effective anyway.  Against Djokovic, Nadal had to learn to let his aggressive side show more.  Ferrer seems to lack this aspect to his game, so he tends to grind more.

Having said all that, Ferrer, while he's not beaten Rafa lately, has at least taken a set off of him.  Think about all the times Federer played Rafa in the finals.  The best he ever did was take one set off of Rafa.  No one ever said ""well, Roger's in the finals, so Rafa will win another French Open"", even if that was rather true.  Fans just felt that his weapons, firing consistently (more than usual), would be enough to beat Rafa (even as Djokovic discovered, it's hard to play that much offense and win).

Everyone just feels that if Roger played insanely well, he would just hit winners everywhere even if that's unrealistic.  Meanwhile, no one can quite imagine what it means for Ferrer to play ""insanely well"".  We can't imagine him hitting winners and aces.  We're not even sure what tactics Ferrer will employ, and feel that he'll just do the same things that's caused him to lose all this time, even if he may be making tactical adjustments.

Realistically, for Ferrer to win, Nadal has to be off his game, and alas, hopefully hurt.  He's already withdrawn from Halle.  Still, a hurt Nadal may simply just be more aggressive.  And there's no indication that Nadal is hurt any more than usual, that is, not enough to prevent a win.  Second, of course, Ferrer has to be hitting well, and not making errors of his own.  With no sets dropped (admittedly, no super tough opponents outside of Tsonga), he apparently is playing well.

Djokovic had some success drop shotting Nadal, and one wrinkle that Ferrer appears to have added is the drop shot which he used well against Tsonga.

Still, with all of Ferrer's issue and the likelihood he won't win, he still can give Nadal trouble, perhaps more trouble than we expect a power player like Tsonga or Berdych to give.

So, other than say it's a hopeless case, what can Ferrer do to keep it interesting, if not necessarily win.",,False,self,t5_2qiq1,False,,yonex,True,t3_1fy85g,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/1fy85g/what_can_david_ferrer_do_to_win/,

The video clip is inconclusive, but watch Nadal's face when the line judge calls his bluff.  Nadal's expression is priceless.",,False,self,t5_2qiq1,1363621337.0,,,True,t3_1aitx7,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/1aitx7/nadal_called_out_for_illegal_coaching_again_at/,

Whenever I play opponents that are good tennis players (i.e. nice shots, try for winners, strategy) I play really well. However, whenever I play against a pusher I usually play terribly.

I am not sure if everyone uses the term pusher, so my definition of it is someone who just gets the ball back over the net. They often have poor form, their shots are soft, but they somehow have decent coverage the baseline. Sort of like playing a game of pong. 

For whatever reason I just completely lose it against these opponents. Not sure if it is because I get too much time to think about my shots or what. ",,False,self,t5_2qiq1,False,,,True,t3_to7uq,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/to7uq/anyone_else_play_terribly_against_pushers/,

1365453517.0,38,self.tennis,1bxw2j,I made a new subreddit and I'm hoping that it includes a good amount of tennis,,46,8,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/1bxw2j/i_made_a_new_subreddit_and_im_hoping_that_it/,"I'm subscribed to most of the major sports subs and some of my favorite content includes videos of really good plays and athletes doing amazing things. I think that could be true for a lot of you as well. The problem is, I always get stuck having to dig through a ton of different subs or visit a separate website whenever I just want to watch a bunch of sports videos. 

So instead of having to search through all kinds of links in the different sports subs I subscribe to, I wanted to make a place that would group the best videos into one place and I could just go through and see a lot of incredible athletes doing what they do. This prompted me to create:

 /r/athleticfeats

Basically I want to showcase the amazing things that humans are capable of. I'm looking for everything from monster dunks to free climbing. Anything that takes extreme physical talent above and beyond what you see normally watching sports. I would really like to incorporate tennis into this given the athleticism it takes to play. I also want to direct users to the specific sub for the sports that are shown. That way, users can learn more about sports they may not have known about or been interested in before watching them.

So my concept is essentially:

When you find a video of an athlete doing something badass, post it in my sub or cross post it with a relevant sub so that users can find a sport specific sub for the video. Hopefully this turns into something similar to Sportcenter ""Top 10"" but with a lot more content and from a more diverse selection of sports.

Feedback is appreciated so let me know what you all think.

For a beginner, any decent racquet will do.  This gave me an idea:  Reddit Racquets.  The idea is that us hardcore players in [/r/tennis](/r/tennis) give racquets for free to the new players to help get them into this great sport.  I know I have an older frame that I would be happy to mail to any redditor interested.  Just pay the shipping and it is yours. We may need to set a few ground rules for how this would go down.  But I see it as quite simple, if you got an extra older racquet, offer it up and then coordinate the shipping costs.   Most racquets, since they are light, can be shipped in the US for about 10 to 12 bucks.

EDIT:  these are the Reddit Racquets offered up so far (let me know if I miss one).

1348757519.0,41,self.tennis,10kckk,"When Brad Gilbert met Andre Agassi- an interesting excerpt from Agassi's Autobiography- ""Open""",redditmyasss,43,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/10kckk/when_brad_gilbert_met_andre_agassi_an_interesting/,"In 1994, Andre Agassi found himself at a crossroads. He was young, one of the brightest stars in tennis, but had underachieved in his career. So Agassi and his manager approached Brad Gilbert, a fiery, veteran tennis player of good ability known as an overachiever, to offer him the job as Agassi's coach. But first, they wanted to hear Brad's assessment of Agassi's abilities:

""When Brad is finally settled, half a cold Bud Ice down his gullet, [my manager] starts.

""So, listen, Brad, one reason we wanted to meet with you is, we want to get your take on Andre's game.

""Say what?

""Andre's game. We'd like you to tell us what you think.

""What I think?

""Yes.

""You want to know what I think of his game?

""That's right.

""You want me to be honest?

""Please.

""Brutally honest?

""Don't hold back.

""He takes an enormous swallow of beer and commences a careful, thorough, brutal-as-advertised summary of my flaws as a tennis player.

""It's not rocket science, he says. If I were you, with your skills, your talent, your return and footwork, I'd dominate. But you've lost the fire you had when you were sixteen. That kid, taking the ball early, being aggressive, what the hell happened to that kid?

""Brad says my overall problem, the problem that threatens to end my career prematurely—the problem that feels like my father's legacy—is perfectionism.

""You always try to be perfect, he says, and you always fall short, and it f**ks with your head. Your confidence is shot, and perfectionism is the reason. You try to hit a winner on every ball, when just being steady, consistent, meat and potatoes, would be enough to win ninety percent of the time.

""He talks a mile a minute, a constant drone, not unlike a mosquito. He builds his argument with sports metaphors, from all sports, indiscriminately. He's an avid sports fan, and an equally avid metaphor fan.

""Quit going for the knockout, he says. Stop swinging for the fences. All you have to be is solid. Singles, doubles, move the chains forward. Stop thinking about yourself, and your own game, and remember that the guy on the other side of the net has weaknesses. Attack his weaknesses. You don't have to be the best in the world every time you go out there. You just have to be better than one guy. Instead of you succeeding, make him fail. Better yet, let him fail. It's all about odds and percentages. You're from Vegas, you should have an appreciation of odds and percentages. The house always wins, right? Why? Because the odds are stacked in the house's favor. So? Be the house! Get the odds in your favor.

""Right now, by trying for a perfect shot with every ball, you're stacking the odds against yourself. You're assuming too much risk. You don't need to assume so much risk. F**k that. Just keep the ball moving. Back and forth. Nice and easy. Solid. Be like gravity, man, just like motherf**king gravity. When you chase perfection, when you make perfection the ultimate goal, do you know what you're doing? You're chasing something that doesn't exist. You're making everyone around you miserable. You're making yourself miserable. Perfection? There's about five times a year you wake up perfect, when you can't lose to anybody, but it's not those five times a year that make a tennis player. Or a human being, for that matter. It's the other times. It's all about your head, man. With your talent, if you're fifty percent game-wise, but ninety-five percent head-wise, you're going to win. But if you're ninety-five percent game-wise and fifty percent head-wise, you're going to lose, lose, lose.""

### Andy Murray d. Novak Djokovic (7-6, 7-5, 2-6, 3-6, 6-2) [(Match Thread)](http://redd.it/zo4ri)

---

Now that the match is said and done, you can discuss your thoughts here.

* Total points won: Murray: 160, Djokovic: 155.

* 14th straight time between these two that the winner of the first set prevails in the end.

* First time since 2003 that each Slam was won by four different men.

* First British man since Fred Perry to win a Grand Slam (1936).

* This loss for Novak means Roger Federer takes a 1335 point rankings lead, and he is guaranteed top spot until the 15th of October. Murray moves up to third place, 1055 points ahead of an injured Nadal who will probably miss the rest of the season.

Arguably the best tennis player ever.

Rafael Nadal: Has dominated clay tennis since he was 19, only losing 1 match winning 25 on RG. Improved his playing style and won the other 3 grand slams too. Does maybe not have as much talent as Federer but makes up for it by his speed and his drive to work very hard. 

Novak Djockovic: Does maybe have even more work-drive than Nadal. His technique is best for hardcourt, explaining his 3 titles in australia and his only missing grand slam title on RG. Must keep working very hard, if he wants to stay on the top-level, because maybe he is the least talented (weird, I know). His mental game is maybe the best ever.

Andy Murray: Maybe the one with the most talent, but has got a few problems with his style. His return is the best on the tour and his speed is unprecedented, his serve is very good. If he wants to be a real part of the tennis history he needs to keep his cool during the matches, like he did at the US open and the Olympics.

Below these giants there are some fantastic players like:
Berdych: Big serve, great ground strokes
Ferrer: Great runner, tactics 
Del Potro: Great ground strokes
And many other players.

Del Potro breaks 2-1

It's not a break until you old the serve... Which Del Potro has just done

3-1

Ferrer holds serve, 3-2, Del Potro a break up and serving

4-2 Del Potro

Del Potro two breaks up 5-2, he is playing with confidence and moving around the court well. His injury is not seeming to affect him, Ferrer is being out played at the moment.

Del Potro holds to love, still unbroken in this match 3-3

4-3 Ferrer still on serve this set

4-4 no sign of injury with that final forehand from del Potro

Ferrer saving a first break point but it is not enough, del Potro is just too powerful today, moving around the court very well for such a big man.

5-4 del Potro, a break up... Did not see this coming after the fall

Del Potro wins the second set 6-4, He has only had to defend two break points in the match so far and has only been broken twice in the tournament so far

Unforced error, into the net from del p off an easy forehand, back on serve 

4-3 del p Ferrer serve

Incredible shot by del p to earn a match point on ferrers serve 

Fantastic last rally with a brilliant down the line winner from del Potro to earn his place in his first Wimbledon semi. A worthy winner. Straight sets. Who would have thought that after his fall in the opening game. 

Del Potro did not really get pushed, he will be a test Novak, and I look forward to seeing the match

**UPDATES**

**3:51PM:** Two rain delays today, at this point there has been about under 2 hours of play so far.

There's probably not enough time to finish all the matches, so some postponements seem likely.

**6:31PM:** It's the third rain interruption of the day, play is paused again.

**7:42PM:** The rain has stopped, current matches are expected to resume but all other matches have been postponed.

**8:58PM:** More rain, that just might be a wrap for the day. 13 postponed matches from today will be now continued tomorrow.

I'm a freshman this year playing the #1 court, and the pressure was on me to bring in the first tennis trophy for my school. My opponent and I had split matches (I've won one and he's won one) so I wasn't exactly sure how it would go. The #2 court, also a freshman, was also 1-1 with his opponent. I won my singles match today 6-2, 6-2, and the #2 court (also my doubles partner) won his match 6-4, 6-4. Out of the 6 singles matches, still with 3 doubles matches to come, my team was up 4-2 overall. All we needed was one win in doubles to seal the deal. My partner and I sadly lost our match 5-8 (Pro set), the #2 doubles court lost 7-8 (6-10) in a tiebreaker, and it was up to the #3 doubles to win their match. Pressure was on, and it was    6-6 with the opposing team serving. My teammates broke their serve at love to bring the match to 7-6, and they closed out the match 8-6 at love.

It seems like the upper echelon will be a revolving-door of Nole/muzzah type retrievers with little distinction in their games.  The same way nole and murray can consistently out retrieve Ferrer, their future successors will most likely be younger players who out retrieve them as they age.

If only for variety, scattered amongst the topspining, 2hbh hitting retrievers will be the odd “lumbering big man” in the mold of Berdych, Raonic, Isner, etc.  But that’s it.  Where will we experience the creativity?  The playmaking? The touch? The variety?  The artistry?

Is there any hope?  I’m reluctantly excited for Tomic… for all of his stupid youthful antics, he seems to play a cerebral game w/ a good amount of variety and tactics.  Anyone else we might be overlooking?

Anyways, just wanted to vent a bit as the Fed loss made me think of what it the future will look like.  Don't get me wrong... I can appreciate Nole's passion on court, Murray's brute physicality, and extreme level of competition.

Then there was Roddick who had a great career (which ended just recently) and eventually won the Davis Cup with Blake and the Bryan brothers in 2007.

But in 2010, Roddick dropped to the 11th place and there was no US player left in the Top 10: first time it happened since 1973 (ATP birth).  
Then last March, Isner dropped out of the Top 20. Also a first since a very long time.  
And today, no US player has reached the 3rd round of Wimbledon (first time since 1912 I think).

I always loved watching US players play tennis. It's a country with incredible athletes in *any* sport.

In the first round, she played Carina Witthoft ranked somewhere in the 700s who went through qualies and wasn't ready to handle Date-Krumm's aggressive returns.  

Her opponent in the second round was Alexandra Cadantu of Romania, age 23, ranked 87 in the world and just 3 spots behind Date-Krumm in the rankings.  Cadantu had upset Paszek in the first round who was the 28th seed.

Unlike Witthoft, who struggled to keep the ball in play, Cadantu did a much better job returning and staying in rallies with Date-Krumm.  Where a typical rally in her first round went 4-5 shots, many rallies went 10 shots.  Cadantu hits an accurate ball and moves side to side, but somehow, Date-Krumm stayed close despite her penchant for unforced errors.

It didn't hurt that Cadantu doesn't have a huge serve or the biggest groundstrokes.  Date-Krumm tried to come to net when it made sense, typically on down the line drives to the Cadantu backhand.  She got a late break in the first set to take it 6-4.

Date-Krumm had more chances to break in the second having her down 15-40 before she made several errors and did not break.  Date-Krumm then broke for a 5-4 lead, but was broken back to 5-all.  Date-Krumm played another solid return game to break to 6-5, and finally had a nice serve game to win 7-5.

The downside is she has to play Serena, and so basically, that's probably it for Date-Krumm.  Date-Krumm has yet to face as big a serve as Serena or her return.  Date-Krumm hits serves around 85 mph which is significantly slower than Serena.  

Date-Krumm has played a Williams sister at Wimbledon before.  Back in 2011, Date-Krumm pushed Venus to a late third set, losing 6-7, 6-3, 8-6.  Of course, Venus (esp. in the last few years) is not her sister, so to expect such a close score would require a bit of help from Serena or for Date-Krumm to return exceptionally well. 

The oldest woman to win one round is Martina Navratilova, at age 47.  Date-Krumm has been playing tennis in her second career since 2008 which means she is in her fifth year of play.  Her original career was between 1989-1996 which is 7 years of play (she retired early), so she's nearly matched the number of years of play in her first go around.  Pam Shriver noted in that she lost to Date-Krumm 3 times (though by 1990, Shriver was past her prime).  She did say that her loss did open up opportunities to do television broadcasts (as sometimes early losers are invited to do commentary).",,False,self,t5_2qiq1,False,,yonex,True,t3_1h6hk1,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/1h6hk1/at_42_years_of_age_kimiko_datekrumm_becomes_the/,

Win two of them is equivalent in points of winning a Slam.  Roger Federer would not have reached number 1 without winning Paris, Indian Wells, and Madrid (and the year-end championships).

Since 2005, these are the list of players that have won Masters 1000 titles not including the top four (Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, and Murray)

* **Robredo** 2006 Hamburg

* **Ljubicic** 2010 Indian Wells

A few interesting facts.  Only one Frenchman has won a Masters 1000 in this time period despite Tsonga and Monfils being quite talented.  David Ferrer and Juan Martin del Potro have never won a Masters 1000 title.  Lleyton Hewitt, who has won two Slams, has only one two Masters 1000 titles, and none since 2003.

Davydenko leads the pack with 3 titles, though Roddick actually has 3 more before 2005.

2012 Australian Open Final  vs.  Nadal 

2012 US Open Final vs.  Nadal

2013 French Open SF vs.  Nadal

2011 US Open SF vs.  Federer

2013 Wimbledon SF vs.  Del Potro


It seems like Novak's brilliant return game and defense leads to long rallies and long matches and that brings out the very best of whoever he's playing.  I'm more of a Federer fan but i live watching Djokovic play in big Grand Slam matches because theyre usually exciting and go right down to the wire.  Hoping that tomorrow's Wimbledon Final vs.  Murray is another instant classic.  

Do you think Novak is the most exciting player right now?  Hes definitely been in many of the most exciting matches I can remember.

It's 1am CST, here. I think Nishikori will outwit Raonic with angles and speed. He's much much quicker and he looked flawless against Baghdatis. Plus, the whole crowd is behind him like never before. The problem will be neutralizing Raonic's serve. がんばって, Nishikori!


*Update 1*: 

**Nishikori takes first set 7-6**

**Raonic takes second set 6-3**

*Update 2*: 

3rd set...**Nishikori breaks and consolidates. He's up 3-0.**

3rd set...**Nishikori breaks once more. His return of serve is excellent at this pont. 4-0, Nishikori**

3rd set...**Nishikori consolidates. 5-0. As casonthemason mentions, Raonic has evaporated. Unforced errors everywhere. 5-0, Nishikori.**

*Update 3*:

**Nishikori takes the win in on home turf! 7-6 3-6 6-0.** I believe this is the first time a Japanese player has won this Open in 40 years? Incredible. He picked up his footwork, return of serve, consistency, and mental attitude and played flawlessly in the 3rd set. Well deserved. Raonic's loss was compounded by how many unforced errors were happening, but Nishikori was really starting to work him side-to-side in the end. 

*Final Update*:

I have to say, bageling Raonic is no easy feat. His return of serve was really inspiring.

* Berdych won 90% of his points on first serve against Almagro.

* Federer is on a record streak of 34 in Slam Quarterfinal appearances, and has a current streak of four in Semis (he also holds the record for semis with 23 consecutive).

* Federer will be guaranteed his #1 ranking until October 15th if he wins tonight.

---

**8:43PM:** I'm sorry, I still don't like those white socks with the blue outfit and shoes.

* **FIRST SET**

**8:51PM:** Berdych is broken early, Federer converts on his third break point chance. Federer 1-0.

**9:12PM:** Berdych breaks Fed to love, and it's all square. 3-3.

**9:34PM:** Fed holds at 6-5, going to a tiebreaker.

**9:38PM:** Tiebreak: They change ends with Berdych up 5-1. Tomas is ripping his forehand, errors abound for Roger.

**9:39PM: Berdych 7-6**, I can't remember the last time I saw Roger get beaten in a breaker 7-1.

It will be interesting to see what Roger does different in the second set.

* **SECOND SET**

**9:45PM:** Berdych gets the early break. Berdych 1-0.

**9:57PM:** Berdych 3-1.

**10:01PM:** Roger does well to save three break points, lots of errors off his racquet tonight. Berdych 3-2.

**10:08PM:** Federer broken again. Berdych 5-2, now serving for a two set lead.

**10:12PM:** Berdych is broken to love. Berdych 5-3.

**10:17PM:** The Czech claims the second set with huge serving, **Berdych 6-4**. Now leads two sets to love.

* **THIRD SET**

**10:22PM:** Federer broken first game, this is not looking good for him. Berdych 1-0.

**10:41PM:** Berdych doubles at 30-40 to give the break back. It's square at 3-3.

**10:49PM:** Berdych is broken again, Federer serving to take the third. 5-3.

**10:52PM: Federer 6-3**. Good stuff by the Swiss, fewer errors and better serving halfway through that set.

* **FOURTH SET**

**11:06PM:** 2-2.

**11:11PM:** Berdych 3-2, on serve. Fed hit a real nice running backhand slice winner that game.

**11:25PM:** Berdych breaks! He is now serving for the match at 5-3.

**11:26PM: Berdych wins (7-6, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3)**

**11:28PM:** The Czech closes it out with a strong service game, and he goes on to meet Andy Murray in a couple of days. He played really well, and managed to get that important break when Fed was in the ascendancy.

Disappointment for Roger, his timing was off for most of the match and he didn't really get into his groove until the third.

1375062420.0,26,self.tennis,1j8zd9,US Prospect Roundup,YaoPau,33,7,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/1j8zd9/us_prospect_roundup/,"A bunch has happened since the last one.  Taking it prospect by prospect...

**Ryan Harrison** has dropped to 130th in the world!  He's 11-21 on the ATP tour in his last 52 weeks, and the reason is his return game has become Isner-bad (winning just 32% of return points).  When I've watched him this year, he's essentially played a push game, hitting everything into the middle of the court with okay pace and poor depth.  It's really disappointing for someone who was a top-50 player just after his 20th birthday.  Speaking of Ryan...

A few days ago, I was in Atlanta watching **Christian Harrison** come thisclose to taking out John Isner.  He had several set points in the 1st set before losing 9-11 in a tiebreak, won the second set, then was 2 points from the match up 5-4 in the 3rd before losing 5-7.  On the surface, that's a damn good showing for a just-turned 19 year old who was playing in an ATP 2nd round for the first time.  

But it's the same game Ryan Harrison had at 19 and mostly has now.  Christian has a prettier backhand, is less talented with his forehand, but hits everything in play... right at Isner, without great depth.  And like Ryan, Christian has been really aggressive with moving up through the ranks.  Despite starting the year on the Futures tour and doing nothing of note at the Challenger level, Christian has entered 5 ATP tournaments as wild cards this year.  The Isner loss was nice, as was his win over world #83 Alejandro Falla the round before that.  But today Christian played against a veteran baseliner at the Challenger level, Somdev Devvarman, and Christian lost 0-6, 1-6.  He's still a long way away from even being a good Challenger player IMO.

**Brad Klahn** won the 2010 NCAA singles title, then struggled badly on the Challenger tour for the next 2.5 years.  He's got a limited game: he's 6'0"" without any weapons (forehand isn't bad, makes his serve at a high rate), but he's mentally very strong and keeps the ball in play.  But he's broken through with three strong performances this month: Finalist at the Winnetka Challenger, Finalist at the Binghampton Challenger, SemiFinalist at the Lexington Challenger, and he'll break into the Top 150 when the new rankings come out tomorrow.  I think he ends up as one of these guys who maxes out around the Top 100, but a year ago that would've been a major stretch.

**Noah Rubin** makes an appearance on the weekly roundup!  John McEnroe's golden goose, the 17 year old former Junior #6 (currently #26) played in this week's US Futures event and made the Finals run that included a really impressive 6-3, 6-3 win over 2013 NCAA semi-finalist Evan King.  I think we'll see Rubin turn pro sometime in 2014, and he will share headlines for the next group of prospects with...

**Stefan Kozlov**, who got some love on r/tennis for his near-win over world #113 Michal Przysiezny at ATP Newport.  Why is this impressive?  Becaus Kozlov is *15 years old*, and is a superprospect in every sense of the word.  Everytime I submit a Stefan Kozlov post it doesn't show up in r/tennis for some reason, but here is a post about [him](http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/1f8r7m/this_is_what_a_superprospect_looks_like_stefan/), one on [his Newport match](http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/1hwgys/stefan_kozlov_played_his_first_atplevel_match/), and a [link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8z6IWZdVNE) to watch the full match.  Cliff notes: Kozlov had the match won, but started cramping up badly and lost the last three games :(

**Alex Kuznetsov** continued his career year with another Challenger title last week at Binghampton, beating Rhyne Williams, Tennys Sandgren, Brad Klahn, and Christian Harrison along the way.  He's now up to #136 in the world after being #271 in mid-April, meaning he's almost guaranteed to crack the top-100 before his points start falling off.  There was a time when Kuznetsov was supposed to be the next great American after Andy Roddick... he'll never be that but he has plenty of time to still have a fine career.

Finally, I've noted **Jack Sock**'s issues with low % first serve that I think is a result of his complicated motion.  I said that, even though we think of Sock as having a Roddick-esque serve potential, Roddick was an absolute freak who made 68%+ of his first serves (somehow, despite being 6'1"" and hitting it that hard),while Sock's % is below-average at 55%, and unless that improves *dramatically*, the also-listed-at-6'1"" Sock didn't have enough else to his game to become an elite player.  

Well Sock was at Atlanta this week, and he was outside the stadium afterwards and I walked by.  I'm 6'1"", and he's easily taller than me... I'm guessing 6'3"", maybe 6'4"".  He moves pretty well for a guy that size, and that height will give him a margin of error to improve that 1st serve % even with the complex motion.  Going from Nadal's height to almost Raonic's height makes him pretty intriguing going forward, there's no reason why he can't get inside the top 20 within the next couple years.",,False,self,t5_2qiq1,1375062679.0,,,True,t3_1j8zd9,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/1j8zd9/us_prospect_roundup/,

* Azarenka's 2012 Australian Open win made her the first Belarusian player to win a Slam singles title.

* Serena Williams in Slam finals: 14 titles, 4 runner-ups.
 
---

**4:40PM:** Players heading out on court soon. Vika hasn't beaten Serena since 2009.

* **FIRST SET**

**5:06PM:** Williams breaks Azarenka on her fifth break point chance, takes the lead 2-0.

**5:18PM:** Impressive serving by Serena. Williams 4-1.

**5:28PM:** Williams 5-2.

**5:33PM:** Azarenka is broken to give Williams the opening set. Serena has won 30 pts to Vika's 18, **Williams 6-2**.

* **SECOND SET**

**5:38PM:** Azarenka breaks to open the second set, 1-0.

**5:51PM:** A break back point saved, Azarenka still leading 3-1.

**5:58PM:** An hour played, Williams is broken once again. Azarenka 4-1, bothare serving under 40% this set.

**6:05PM:** Azarenka 5-2, serving to even the match.

**6:10PM:** Vika takes the second set, she's lifted her play and Williams' error count has crept up. **Azarenka 6-2**.

* **FINAL SET**

**6:23PM:** Tense hold for Azarenka, saves some break points. 1-1.

**6:28PM:** Williams is broken, the Belarusian takes the lead. Azarenka 2-1.

**6:37PM:** Serena breaks back, square again at 2-2.

**6:49PM:** Azarenka breaks to love and regains her advantage. Azarenka 4-3.

**6:56PM:** Huge hold, Vika saves a break point... one game away from being crowned. Azarenka 5-3.

**7:01PM:** Azarenka will serve for the title at 5-4, can she hold her nerve?

**7:04PM:** Vika sends the ball into the net and Williams breaks back, square again 5-5. Crazy.

**7:15PM:** Championship point for Williams...

**7:16PM: Serena Williams is the 2012 US Open Champion (6-2, 2-6, 7-5)**

**7:24PM:** An enthralling women's final, Williams started strong but went wayward for a while.

Really unfortunate for Victoria, she was so close but was overwhelmed by the strength of Serena's finish.

**7:25PM:** This caps off an amazing couple of months for Williams who has won Wimbledon, double Gold at the Olympics and now the US Open.

&gt;**Azarenka:** ""At the moment it's tough, but Serena showed she deserved to win.""

* **FIRST SET**

**8:33PM:** Djokovic 2-1, still on serve.

**8:36PM:** Del Potro is broken early, Djokovic takes the game with a forehand winner. Djokovic 3-1.

**8:39PM:** Novak clearly up for it, it's 4-1 to Djokovic already.

**8:57PM:** Delpo is broken once again to give the opening set to **Djokovic 6-2**.

* **SECOND SET**

**9:02PM:** Against the run of play, Djokovic is broken in his opening service of the second. Del Potro 1-0.

**9:18PM:** Del Potro 3-1, one hour played.

**9:27PM:** Del Potro 4-2, Delpo saving a break point.

**9:36PM:** JMDP now serving to bring it to one set each, currently 5-4.

Delpo's first serve percentage at 79%, winning 69% points on first and 27% on second.

**9:46PM:** A great game from both players, but Djokovic breaks back with magnificent retrieving. 5-5.

**10:10PM:** Incredibly tense Delpo service that saw him save three set points. Now going to a breaker.

**10:13PM:** Tiebreak: 2-2.

**10:15PM:** Tiebreak: 3-3 at change of ends.

**10:19PM:** Tiebreak: One of the best points of the match to bring up three set points for Djokovic. 6-3.

**10:22PM:** **Djokovic 7-6**, with a winner Novak takes the tiebreak 7-3.

An incredibly hard fought set, a Delpo come back at this point seems doubtful.

* **THIRD SET**

**10:34PM:** JMDP is broken to open the third, Djokovic 1-0.

**10:53PM:** Djokovic 3-1, saved a break point.

**10:59PM:** Delpo saves two break points, but still down a break. Djokovic 3-2.

**11:09PM:** Both players looking a bit tired at this point, Djokovic still with the break at 4-3.

**11:15PM:** Approaching three hours, Djokovic is now serving for the match at 5-4.

**11:23PM: Djokovic wins (6-2, 7-6, 6-4)**

**11:25PM:** Good display from the Serb, he held his nerve in the big moments and now goes on to play David Ferrer on Super Saturday.

Del Potro played some very good tennis, a few points here and there could've changed the complexion of match in the second set.

**11:30PM:** We now have our final four... this is the first Slam semifinals to not have either Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal since 2004 (that's 33 Slams).

* **Murray**: London 2012 Gold Medalist and runner-up in four Slams (USO '08, AO '10/'11 and Wimbledon '12)

* **Berdych**: One previous Slam final runner-up (Wimbledon '10)

* **Ferrer**: Going into his fourth semifinal, still yet to make a GS final

* **Djokovic**: 5 Slams (AO '08/'11/'12, Wimbledon '11 and USO '11) and 3 runner-ups (USO '07/'10 and RG '12)",,False,self,t5_2qiq1,1346988704.0,,lacoste,True,t3_zh9qk,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/zh9qk/match_thread_djokovic_vs_del_potro_mens_singles/,

* Their first meeting at a Slam.

* Roddick's most successful Slam has been the US Open: Having reached the quarterfinals six times, runner-up in '06 and winning in '03.

---

* **FIRST SET**

**8:16PM:** All square at 2-2, it's been raining throughout the day and more is expected later.

**8:22PM:** Del Potro is broken! Roddick playing very aggresive, leads 4-2.

**8:28PM:** Andy saves a break point, and he holds. Roddick 5-2.

**8:35PM:** Roddick 5-3, now serving for the first set.

**8:39PM:** Delpo has broken back, we're back on serve. Roddick 5-4.

**8:53PM:** JMDP holds to bring up the tiebreak. It's started raining... hopefully the first set will get done.

**8:58PM:** Tiebreak: Roddick 1-0, the referee has signaled for play to stop.

The players have left the court for now, not sure if it will continue tonight.

**9:45PM: PLAY CANCELLED**: Well it's official, there will be no more tennis tonight.

It looks as if tomorrow's schedule will be jam-packed, only two singles matches completed today.

**11:36AM:** It is now Wednesday, the Roddick-Delpo match will be played after Masha-Bartoli is completed.

It is still raining, and there is more expected later. This is going to cause havoc for the USO schedule.

1313987709.0,28,self.tennis,jq9yx,Day 9 of Cincinnati Masters: And The Champion Is...,boobscomefromrussia,31,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/jq9yx/day_9_of_cincinnati_masters_and_the_champion_is/,"This is going to be pretty short because it's late and I need to catch up on sleep, but first I want to say thanks for reading these! If it weren't for the awesome tennis fans on /r/tennis I wouldn't have been blogging this tourney and would have been keeping these pictures to myself. So thanks!

We got to the tennis center early cause we thought there would be traffic (which we beat by 2 hours), and were gifted with seeing [Novak practice](http://i.imgur.com/4yhel.jpg) on Grandstand. He seemed fine warming up, but things definitely changed for the worst.

The men's finals began at 12:30 with [Andy Murray](http://i.imgur.com/HVRt0.jpg) against [Novak Djokovic](http://i.imgur.com/CVmRp.jpg). Murray started the match off serving very well (hitting the 130's multiple times) and overall playing a good (but not great) game. Novak seemed a little tired or disinterested, but soon I found out he's been having trouble with his shoulder. I figured he would just lose the first set (which he did 4-6), and then come back and win the next two like he did in his match against Monfils, but after being down 3-0 in the second the umpire announced Novak would retire due to his shoulder injury. People were pissed (I would have been too if I had driven out for that one match just to see it over so quickly), and you could tell Andy didn't want to win that way.

Good thing Novak announced he was retiring when he did, cause seconds after he did it started pouring down rain and we had to run for cover. Once the rain subsided I did get a pic of the ballkids and volunteers [drying off the court](http://i.imgur.com/3ckpY.jpg)

Once the court was dry they brought Andy and Novak back for the award ceremony, where they both received Rookwood Pottery trophies. here's [Novak receiving his trophy](http://i.imgur.com/7PWz9.jpg) and here is [Andy with his trophy](http://i.imgur.com/FVIOH.jpg). 

Women's was supposed to start at 4 but it started raining at 3:50 which means we had to wait til around 4:30 for the match to start. [Jelena Jankovic](http://i.imgur.com/hQOLG.jpg) took on [Maria Sharapova](http://i.imgur.com/HST65.jpg) (who screeched from the moment the match starts, but doesn't peep at all during practice). Both played well in my opinion, and I was surprised by how well Maria can return the ball, and her accuracy was pretty good in the first set. Jelena came back from being down in the first set to win it 6-4. 

I went over to grandstand to watch the men's doubles teams take court [Llodra and Zimonjic](http://i.imgur.com/IVXTH.jpg) vs [Bhupathi and Paes](http://i.imgur.com/9lq4S.jpg). I didn't stay long cause I thought the women's finals was going to be over in the second set, but it was cool to see how well Bhupathi and Paes played together. Also, there were so many Indian families that came out to support their beloved doubles team and they made a riot on grandstand that you could hear loud outbursts from on Center court. (bhupathi and paes ended up winning 7-6, 7-6) 

I went over to center court for the end of the second set. It was a close one, but Maria won it 7-6 in a tie break. 

Sharapova really stepped up her game in the 3rd set (and equally the number of her ""come on!!"" 's doubled), and won the 3rd set 6-3. She seemed [happy](http://i.imgur.com/PlWCe.jpg) to say the least. 

here's a pic of [Jelena](http://i.imgur.com/4Bj6X.jpg) going to get her trophy, and she joked that she wasn't used to giving speeches in a while.

Then [Maria](http://i.imgur.com/W5D7k.jpg) went to accept her trophy, and joked that the Serbian fans were much louder than the Russian fans, but that's okay cause she won anyways. This was only her 2nd year coming to Cincinnati (last year being the first), and she's made it to the finals both years.

Here is a pic of the two finalists [smiling pretty with their trophies](http://i.imgur.com/kgReP.jpg) (sorry it's grainy I took a pic of the screen.)

Overall I'd say it was a very interesting tourney. A few great matches, a lot of upsets, and a lot of injuries. I'm definitely looking forward to next year, It could not come any sooner.

Once again thanks so much for reading! I really appreciate it :]",,False,self,t5_2qiq1,False,,,True,t3_jq9yx,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/jq9yx/day_9_of_cincinnati_masters_and_the_champion_is/,

My dad (also a tennis player) used to watch my high school matches and it made me really nervous. Sometimes I would lose to girls that I shouldn't have by making a lot of errors and just not developing a strategy enough to beat them. He then decided that he would ""pretend"" to be that person when we were practicing the next time and we would play a set against each other. He would exaggerate her main weaknesses based on what he saw the day I lost. He was very funny doing it because he would make these girly grunting sounds and pretend to get upset when I won the point. 

This exercise forced me to focus beyond the silliness, to come up with a better strategy to win, AND cut down on errors playing out a game. After we started this I never lost to the same person again. I always got my revenge and the best part was that instead of hearing myself ""worrying about losing"" in my head between points all the time, I heard my dad pretending to grunt like a girl, laughed, shrugged everything off, and played each point based on the strategy he helped me come up with. 

I recommend this to anyone who is struggling with the mental and decision making aspects of tennis or has trouble against certain types of players. A good coach will help you do this!

I always enjoy watching the more candid moments of life on tour. I'm glad the top players can still enjoy life amidst constantly high demands and a crazy tour schedule. 

Also, I might as well ask... Do you guys have any favorite videos of players joking around on or off the court? One of my all time favorites has to be the [Roger/Rafa foundation commercial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94xyOpETYYs) where they can't stop laughing, but I know there are a lot of funny videos floating around.

1372479300.0,23,self.tennis,1halr6,A look at the remaining 3rd round matches,dropshot,29,6,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/1halr6/a_look_at_the_remaining_3rd_round_matches/,"Just scanning the remaining third round matches, offering thoughts.

**Djokovic vs Chardy** Djokovic ownsa 6-0 record over Chardy, though they haven't played since 2011.  Still Chardy is like the beneficiary of a nice draw having beaten Harrison in the first round round and Struff in the second round.  Djokovic is expected to win comfortably.

**Lopez vs Haas** To me, this is rather intriguing.  The two have met twice (one meeting was a walkover and doesn't count) with Haas winning both, but those two matches were nearly a decade ago.  Haas is the favored one with a big serve and big groundies, but Lopez is a solid grass court player.  Haas reached the semis of Halle, but Lopez won Eastbourne (with an admittedly weaker field).  Lopez complained about an injury at Eastbourne, but apparently, it wasn't enough to prevent him from winning.  Haas is favored and I'd lean that way, but I wouldn't be surprised if Lopez managed an upset.

**Gasquet vs Tomic** These two have only met twice, both in the last two years, and Gasquet won both on hard courts.  Both matches had similar scorelines with Tomic pushing Gasquet to a tiebreak and losing, then fading in the second set.  It's difficult to predict this because it's clear Tomic is capable of more.  If he's going to start showing his talent, he'll need to beat a player of Gasquet's caliber, and he seems capable of it.  Gasquet is no slouch on grass.  He once reached the semis of Wimbledon (back in 2007).  Slight edge to Gasquet, but would like to see Tomic pull the upset.

**Anderson vs. Berdych** Berdych is flying under the radar.  He's had a pretty good 2013 despite not winning a title.  Both guys are tall and powerful, but Anderson's probably sick of seeing Berdych.  There seems to be a magnetic attraction between these players when they are in a draw together.  They've met 8 times before, 4 times in 2012, and 4 times this year (so far).  Berdych has won all 8 encounters.  You think Anderson ought to break through at some point, but certainly Berdych is going to have confidence having beaten Anderson so many times.  Edge to Berdych.

**Ferrer vs Dolgopolov** This is one of those weird matchups where you think a player like Dolgopolov should have a shot to win.  Dolgopolov is a bit like Baghdatis in that you think he has all the weapons to do well, and yet somehow he doesn't, except Baghdatis has a little pedigree having reached a Slam final.  Ferrer, as with most players he's played against, has a winning record, 5-1.  They've met most often on hard courts and Dolgo has pushed him a few times. Ferrer entered Wimbledon with an early round loss at s'Hertogenbosh, a Wimbledon tuneup (losing to Malisse), and he's been pushed to 4 sets.  I think Dolgo should push him, but Ferrer's competitive spirit should get him through.

**Sijsling vs Dodig** Kind of a tossup.  Both are unseeded.  They've never played each other.  Dodig has the higher rank.  Both beat a seed (Dodig over Kohlschreiber, Sijsling over Raonic).  I suppose I don't really care who wins.  Big opportunity for both to reach a fourth round.

**Nishikori vs. Seppi** Seppi kinda got lucky.  He went 5 sets over Istomin taking 2 sets in tiebreaks and was up 2 sets to love before winning in 5.  Then Llodra retired on him (but played doubles later that day).  Meanwhile Nishikori has two straight set wins.  Seppi plays a steady style while Nishikori gambles by pushing opponents side to side.  They've met once before with Nishikori winning.  Nishikori should be favored if he's playing his game well.

**del Potro vs Zemlja** The three big seeds that are flying under the radar are Ferrer, Berdych, and del Potro.  del Potro gets a few more mentions because he won a Slam, but he skipped the French.  However, Ferrer's quarter was considered pretty weak, and del Potro's section (in the same quarter) even weaker.  del Potro beat Zemlja in their only head to head in 2012, and should be favored, especially since Zemlja just came off a five set win (though he played like 2-3 games today, so hardlyb broke a sweat).  

**Kubot vs. Paire** Paire is a talented Frenchman, and Kubot plays well from time to time.  Surprisingly, they have played 4 times before with Paire winning all 4.  Kubot has pushed Paire to 3 sets in 3 of the 4 meetings which means he has the kind of game that can bother Paire (and they have played on grass before too in Halle last year).  Edge to Paire, but Kubot should be competitive.

**Gulbis vs. Verdasco** This is a tough one to call.  Gulbis is the talented player that never fulfilled his talent, but started to take his game seriously this year.  He's getting better results.  Verdasco was the wild hitter from Spain who put his game together in 2009 when he pushed Rafa to five sets at Melbourne in their epic semi match.  Verdasco played excellent tennis from that point to mid 2010 when he played too many clay events and burned out at the 2010 French Open.  He hasn't played that great since then.  They've met 3 times with Verdasco leading 2-1, but Gulbis has beaten him this year, albeit on clay.  I guess I'll lean Gulbis, only because he *seems* to have dealt with his mental issues (both have them).  Could be a really nice power match.

**Monaco vs de Schepper** This a weird matchup.  Monaco is a clay courter who struggled in the South American swing, reached the semis of Houston, and did fine during the clay season, but lost in 5 in the opening round of the French Open.  But he had a really easy draw with qualifier Knittel and then Rajeev Ram of the US who was probably happy to win a round.  de Schepper is a tall Frenchman (like Kevin Anderson tall) who should have the power to be an interesting player, but has never had a nice signature win.  He reached the third round when Cilic pulled out and beat clay courter Paolo Lorenzi in the opening round.  Another one I don't care and could go either way.  I pick Monaco mostly because of pedigree (i.e., better ranking).  Obviously nice draw for both, with both a bit lucky to reach this point.

**Troicki vs Youzhny** This is also a tough one to call.  Normally, you'd pick Youzhny because he, like Haas, is known for playing well when he plays well.  He reached the finals of Halle this year, so he can play grass.  He holds a 3-2 record over Troicki, but Troicki won their last two meetings.  Troicki has been playing on and off tennis for the last two years averaging about one match win per tournament.  However, he does seem to peak at Slams.  His best showing this year has been at the French Open where he reached the fourth round.  Last year, one of his better showings was a fourth round appearance at Wimbledon.  Although Youzhny reached the finals of Halle, he struggled to beat Pospisil in 5 sets with Pospisil up a break in the fifth set before he choked it at the end.  I'm going to lean to Troicki for the upset.

**A look back to Stakhovsky vs Melzer**

Today Stakhovsky lost to Melzer which he claimed was due to playing Melzer incorrectly.  He tried to play Melzer like he did Roger Federer and that didn't work.  One reason, which didn't occur to me right now is something Melzer does quite often that Federer hardly does.  Melzer plays a lot of doubles.  This mean he's used to hitting low returns to a charging net man.  Stak probably needed to play a bit more from the baseline and take his chances coming in after that.",,False,self,t5_2qiq1,False,,yonex,True,t3_1halr6,http://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/1halr6/a_look_at_the_remaining_3rd_round_matches/,
