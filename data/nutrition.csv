It simply fascinates me how profound our experience in this life is impacted by what we consume.

As of late I've started to theorize about what a diet would look like that placed emphasis on mental/emotional well-being before any physical pay off (weight loss, muscle gain, et cetera...).

Obviously physical well-being and mental health are not exactly seperate entities but your hard pressed to find diets that value cognition over chiseled abs. So the question I pose is this...

What foods, dietary habits, vitamins, supplements et cetera.. would you include in a theoretical diet that disregards the physique in the interest of cognition and emotional well-being.

To clarify, I'm not asking for a list of ""comfort foods"" here. A diet of chocolate and ice cream may make one feel better momentarily but no ones brain is going to work better on it. Nor is anyone going to yield a strong emotional state as a result.

So I'm curious. What would your theoretical ""brain"" diet look like.

Mine (thus far) looks like this:

-Lower calorie intake (1400-1700)
-Intermittent Fasting (one large meal a day)
-Run/Jog about 30 miles a week or more.
-No refined sugar, grains, dairy or meat (causes cravings impacting mental health)
-No soy or chocolate (I am allergic/intolerant)
-Minimal table salt (celtic sea salt is fine)
-Lots of kale, spinach, collard and mustard greens. Next in line is a ton of broccoli, peppers and chili's and celery. Almonds, cashews, coconut milk/cream (unsweetened), seaweed and nutritional yeast. Hemp protein and brown rice protein (both plain unflavored).
-drinking water and coffee only
-spicing everything with lots of black pepper, cumin, turmeric, coriander, cinnamon, dill, cardamon, chili pepper, basil, savory, oregeno, and sage. also using vinegar for flavor.
-Supplement with Omega 3 (fish oil), DHEA, Baccopa (optional not constant), Glycine, Glutamine (optional not constant), b-vitamins (mostly 6, 12 and 1) and DLPA.

Bear in mind this is MY theoretical ""brain"" diet. I don't suggest this for anyone else, nor do I believe this to be the most nutritionally sound plan for physical well-being. With that said, I have lived on this for about 2 months now and feel freakin' fantastic. No cravings for anything (after the initial week or so after giving up dairy and meat) not emotional instability (i used to be quite moody and dealt with moderate bouts of depression I linked to dairy and certain meats) can focus and work longer hours, never feel physicall or mentally drained, and as a bonus I've lost weight.",,False,self,t5_2qoox,False,,,True,t3_1e81bo,http://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1e81bo/a_diet_for_the_brain_first_not_the_body/,

I try to make large quantities of leafy greens a staple in my diet. 

I get tired of the texture pretty quickly, especially kale and chard, which I find stringy/fibrous. If you do too, here's an awesome solution: Indian style ""saag""!

Recipe

1. Purchase half a shopping cart of spinach, kale, and chard. (the pre-washed stuff is very convenient, but I find it tastes bitter and I've been told freshness is a big factor in the taste of kale and chard). 

2. chop up a head of garlic and fry it up in some grass-fed butter. 

3. Throw all the greens in there with a bit of water and steam the shit out of them (kill the bacteria).

4. Take an immersion blender/blender/food processor and pulverize those poor plants. I like the immersion blender myself because it's super easy to clean.

5. Add cumin, turmeric, ground coriander, smoked paprika (put it on everything, trust me), and salt to taste. You can go pretty heavy handed on these, especially the cumin. 

6. Profit. Your shitload-a-greens probably cooked down to a much smaller volume of delicious ""saag"". You can go all out and throw some paneer in there, but I just put this stuff away like its my job.

1360639510.0,64,self.nutrition,18cs0m,A Note on Calories and A Common Misconception,dannyp123,100,36,102,http://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/18cs0m/a_note_on_calories_and_a_common_misconception/,"I've noticed in a few comments that the idea that caloric intake is a substantial determinant in body composition is being cited. I just wanted to take the time to talk about how diet effects body composition, and what the importance of calories really are in this topic.

First off, body composition is a measure of fat mass to lean mass, fat mass simply being fat (or adipose tissue to be technical) with lean mass being everything that is not fat (organs, bones, water). 

The prevalent idea is that an excess intake of calories, meaning consuming more calories than you burn on average, leads to an increase in body fat. This logic is flawed.

Calories are a unit of energy and *not* a nutrient, they have no physical form unlike, for example, fat which is essentially a long string of carbons with hydrogens attached to them. 

Now onto the good stuff...

When you eat food, you are consuming a myriad of macronutrients (protein, fat, carbs), micronutrients (vitamins, minerals) and other chemicals (phytochemicals, antioxidants, polyphenols and many more). Macronutrients contain Calories in the sense that our bodies can manipulate their chemical structure to release energy that we can use to do work (in the physical sense).

Eating food which contains calories (pretty much anything obviously) causes those ""calories"" to go somewhere. The calories don't physically *go* anywhere, as they have no physical form; what is happening is the form that they are contained in is repurposed into another form for either energy production or energy storage.

Let's use a banana to exemplify this. A banana contains the majority of it's calories in carbohydrates. Eating the banana, after digestion and absorption, leave these carbohydrates as the simple sugar glucose. This glucose can then do several things it can be

*mobilized for energy (we'll rule this out, as we are talking about a calorically excessive diet)

*stored as glycogen (a glucose polymer) in the muscles or liver to be used later

*stored in another form, such as fat or protein, after being converted to a  suitable form, with other substances being required to do this

The point to this is that this banana, and the calories that came with it, can be used in multiple ways, with fat accumulation being only one of those possibilites. What determines how these calories will be stored is more a matter of hormonal regulation than of simple caloric intake.

Certain foods have a propensity to leave their calories distributed one way or another; soda will likely cause an increase in body fat due to the hormonal involvement that results from drinking soda. Taking in an excess 250 calories of soda (sugar) will likely make you fat. Taking in excess 250 calories of something nutrient dense, let's say eggs (and let's not get started with the cholesterol fears) will cause a completely different hormonal response in your body due to the difference in the makeup of the food, chemically speaking. If you are a completely sedentary person that extra 250 calories from the eggs probably will contribute to some increase in body fat, however if you are an active person (but not so active as to create calorie balance or a calorie deficit) those 250 calories from the egg will be more likely to going to a process like protein synthesis than the sugar from the soda.

One last quick example. Think of a kid going through puberty. He can take in a significant amount of calories more than he burns and not get fat. These calories are used not to make more fat, but to allow him to physically grow. This example is extreme in the sense that puberty is relatively short and most people are not experiencing that rate of linear growth, however it illustrates that excess calories are not specifically targeted for fat, they just go there if you have no reason to do anything else with them (you sit around on the couch all day) or you eat unhealthy food that is chemically designed to be stored as fat.

Basically, the idea that excess calories *always* causes an increase in fat *and only fat* is not true, and is a common misconception when it comes to nutrition so I wanted to try and clear this up. (edit italics)

In the short term (days and weeks) you won't notice much of a change, but over a year taking out 1 tablespoon of sugar equals about 5 pounds.

I know this sound's like I'm some crazy fad dieter, but hear me out please. I live in rural China. Pretty much everything an American can buy at the supermarket is unavailable to me. Recently I've been told to avoid the wet markets where chicken are sold, because there is a disease risk with that. 

There is every vegetable under the sun here, but they are grown in human feces and I'm having a hard time with that. For now I can only deal with veggies that have a thick peel.

This is not an insult towards China. They have to feed 1.6 billion people and they do. To that end, they are doing a great job.

Little western me has gone through a lot of diets here that sound like some 1980's magazine fad diet crazyness - like the time I went on the Snickers and banana diet because I'd rather eat American chemicals than Chinese food.I periodically go through these stages as a symptom of culture shock. They aren't going away, so I'm hoping to make them healthier at least, cuz Im still carrying those Snickers bars with me. 

Oh, and please, are you a fan of Chinese food who is here to tell me that Chinese food is delicious? I'm sure you mean well. I agree with you. If I were in Shanghai. I""m not. I teach English in the poorest province in China and the food is fried in excessive oil, and btw that oil comes from companies that skim old oil from IDK where but basically it's a waste product from large-scale food processing. They serve dog tails in the market down from my school. They are curved and pointy just like the tail on your dog. I don't eat dog, but all I'm saying is: seeing things like that will cause one to have weird dietary habits, so please don't judge? I know my request is strange. May I ask you to juts roll with it, please?



So anyway, those big blocks of tofu in the market down the street look fresh and clean, and if they aren't don't tell me otherwise. I have  a huge tin of instant oatmeal imported from Austrailia. 

Apples bananas, and cucumbers can be peeled. I wouldn't eat anything here what wasn't.

So, r/nutrition, can you tell me how much damage I am doing to myself if I stay on this diet for a month or so?


Also, let me share with you my favorite skinny party snack:
1. prepare six test tubes standing up in a bowl of crushed ice.
2. fill the test tubes with a mixture of soy sauce and wasabi
3. Serve with cucumber spears that have been cut lengthwise small enough to dip into the test tubes.

Edit: also boiled peanuts are sold here. This is an option for me. How are they for a complete protein? I can buy eggs here as well but prefer not to because of the cholesterol. 


EDIT: To whoever downvoted me: I would just like you to know that I am having a really hard time here. I do my best to give my kids good lessons and I'm not trying to sound like a food brat. I've been damaging myself for some time now, can you give me a break?

My housemates and i just spent a night a few days ago watching the documentary ""forks over knives"" on Netflix, which if it can be basically summed up as meat+dairy bad vegetables and fruit good.


A lot of what the documentary said seemed to be common sense, namely what you eat has a huge effect on both your health and energy, but the whole thing just seemed off to me as a pro-vegan brochure.


i tried looking up online critiques of this documentary, but everything i came across didn't seem that legitimate either.


If anyone can help me know if this documentary is more bs than facts, or vice versa, please help me out.

Sorry if this is too much to ask, please let me know.


Just for clarification, I'm not asking if eating more vegetables/fruits is healthier(my top favorite foods are mushrooms,eggplants and mangoes), nor am i challenging the idea that people who are vegans/vegetarian are perfectly healthy diets.
i'm simply inquiring about the validity of the statement if the complete elimination of all animal products in ones diet is really such a tremendous benefit as the documentary ""Forks over Knives"" touts. it seems to me that the documentary provides an extremely one sided and perhaps even mis-leading narrative, but seeing as my lack of knowledge on the subject and my abysmal ""research""[re:googling] abilities, i would like a second, more informed opinion.

If anyone has actually seen the documentary and provide their own, more informed, opinion of it that would be greatly appreciated as well

When trying to explain the yo-yo effect to a new work friend who was on a 14 day juice diet she said she understood that and the juice wasn't to cleanse or to loose weight instead the diet was to rest her digestive tract.  

Essentially, she completely strained all fibers out of her juices, which were primarily vegetables,  which she would stagger throughout the day in order to avoid the sugar spikes.  Every few days she would eat protein and have small meals.  

Is there any benefit to resting your digestive tract?  It's all smooth muscles and my understanding was it's not something that needs a rest.  Any information, specifically info on the affects of such an extreme diet to the body both positive and negative would be useful.

* I did not fully understand her diet.  She was juicing for 4 days and eating for 3 (lean proteins and salads).  She did this cycle twice.

* She does not know the first thing about biology and she uses flawed logic in arguments.  She is also wicked stubborn.  But she admits most of this so at least there's that.

MFP pegs my avg intake at 2200 kcal +/- 200, not counting the sugar binges, macros range roughly around 125-175g protein, 100-150g fat, and 75-125g carbs.

I seem to have hit a plateau, but I think a lot of it is because I'm having trouble resisting pigging out on sugary stuff too much and too often.

So I can't be the only one who has had this problem. How do others cope? Especially people with strong addictive tendencies?

In early March I got more serious about diet (and exercise), and initially it wasn't that hard to cut out a lot of the sweets I was snacking on. I dropped soda completely (not that I drank a ton before), most candy/desert type foods, started EC on a weekly cycle - and the pounds just fell off.

Over the last several weeks, though, I find myself not only skipping workouts more often, but also binging pretty hard on basically pure sugar, usually at night. Chocolate chips, cake frosting, cookies or pie if we have any. I like the idea of chocolate chips because they are small and measureable. 4 dozen of them isn't even 100 calories. But I end up taking handful after handful. And every time I give in it's easier to give in again leading to nasty cycles.

I try to substitute fruit, mostly berries, and for a while I had a good rhythm where I'd have a night snack of a spring mix and spinach salad, maybe with a few nuts or croutons, and olive oil &amp; balsamic vinegar for dressing followed by some fruit, whatever we had on hand, strawberries or blueberries or an apple or pineapple. But now that's its more into summer both the salad and the fruit spoil so quickly that we often don't have any fresh salad or fruit. Plus, a lot of times lately I just skip the fruit and think oh just a little chocolate to scratch that itch.

I feel a little out of control because I have some strong motivations to drop another 10-15 lbs but I just keep giving in and it's super reminiscent of how I've abused mood altering substances, where I think I really don't want to do this it's contrary to a larger goal but then sort of let my mind go blank for a sec and then say fuck it and do it anyway. Plus, this is how I got here in the first damn place, by overeating sweets and failing to be physically active (desk job doesn't help) as the months added up to years until I was in my 30's and creeping up on 250 (for a guy who couldn't break 200 if he tried, until my late 20's anyway).

This is at least partly just to vent, because I think I know it's possible to simply control my will better; I could just not eat the damn chocolate chips or not buy another can of frosting. I mean, a long time ago I was a 2 pack a day smoker and caught up in a year long meth binge, but I would never, ever touch either of those things again and feel I have full conscious control over that. But when it comes to something more nebulously harmful like sugar, or, say, pot, I fall into this dependency-like cycle. And there's probably a dozen other contributing factors: I constantly procrastinate really, really frickin badly and end up perpetually behind in everything leading to a lot of work and personal stress and probably depression, still have some substance issues also leading to stress and depression, money issues, new things I'm trying that are stressful (and also a big motivator to get fit), big time lack of sleep, etc., etc. I'm kind of a hot mess actually.

You may have just enough time to grab breakfast in the morning. If not, your stomach is grumbling leading to the perfect setting for that salty, fatty, not-so-good snack. Scenario 2: You don't eat all morning and before you know it, your stuffing cold leftovers into your mouth at the fridge. Scenario 3: You experience both scenarios mentioned before, depending on the day.

Whatever your scenario may be, here are simple tips and recipes to help you curb the cravings and snack healthy!

Let's start off with a brain buster question. Are 100-calorie pack snacks ""healthy?"" Truth is, no. They are basically 100 calories worth of carbohydrates. Since simple carbohydrates turn into sugar in your body, they are basically 100 calories worth of sugar. While they are better than eating chips out of the bag and help with portion control, they are no match for the endless possibilities of healthy snacks.

Tips for Healthy Snacking
1. Design your snacks like mini-meals. Include protein, fat, and healthy carbohydrates.
2. Resist the urge to snack when you are bored or stressed. Try going for a walk or reading a book to get your mind off of food.
3. Don't snack in front of the TV. This leads to mindless eating and lack of portion control.
4. If you are one to eat from the chip/pretzel bag, take out a serving and put the rest away in the cabinet.
5. Make snacking interesting! Try something new and different (like macadamia nuts or avocado slices).

Tips for Snacking On-The-Go
1. Pack your snack the night before, or at the beginning of the week. If you are making non-perishable items (trail mix or homemade granola bars) portion out a serving so they are easy to grab on the way out.
2. Remember to read the nutrition label. Sugar should not be one of the first 4 ingredients!
3. Choose high-fiber snacks like fruits and vegetables to keep your fuller for longer.
4. Stash carrots, peanut butter, and crackers in your bag or desk drawer so you always have healthy food nearby.
5. If the vending machine is all you have as an option, opt for nuts (protein and fat) or a lower sodium food.

So, this was originally talked about several weeks ago, and it got a bunch of negative comments.

Now, today, several articles have come out about Rob Rhinehart and his Soylent diet.

1. [Rob Rhinehart has a crazy plan to let you go without food forever. It just might work.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/03/14/rob-rhinehart-has-a-crazy-plan-to-let-you-go-without-food-forever-it-just-might-work/)

3. [Who Needs Food When You Have Soylent?](http://www.livescience.com/27908-soylent-meal-replacement.html)

^^There's ^^also ^^several ^^more ^^if ^^you ^^do ^^a ^^google ^^search ^^for ^^""Rob ^^Rhinehart ^^Soylent""

What's interesting to me is how polarizing this concept seems to be.

&gt;**From: Who Needs Food When You Have Soylent?**

&gt;No [soylent is not a healthy replacement for a balanced, varied diet], said Joy Dubost, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ""I don't think it's sustainable,"" Dubost told LiveScience. ""You need a healthy eating plan for life.""


&gt;A fundamental flaw in Rhinehart's plan is his assumption that the human body needs only chemicals and elements to survive.

&gt;Dubost said it's important to remember that foods like fruits and vegetables have nutrients in proportions and amounts that work in synergy, making proper digestion and intake of critical nutrients easy.

****

But then,

&gt;**From: Rob Rhinehart has a crazy plan...**

&gt;Is it safe? “Yeah, probably.” Jay Mirtallo is a professor of pharmacy at Ohio State and the immediate past president of American Society for Parental Enteral Nutrition, which focuses on the science and practice of providing food to patients through both intravenous injections and feeding tubes.

&gt;Dr. Andrew T. Chan, a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital notes that there’s no evidence that the consistency of food, be it liquid or diet, affects health or nutrition.

&gt;“You can completely live a healthy life just drinking medical food from here on out,” Mirtallo says.

****

So up top you have a registered dietitian who says that surviving on the liquid isn't sustainable. Then you have a professor of pharmacy, and a gastroenterologist that say that it's perfectly fine.

Another article seems to sum everything up quite well:

&gt;Rhinehart’s Soylent diet is what’s known as nutritionalism, the notion that a piece of food is only minerals and nutrients in the shape of something delicious, and doesn't deliver any other sort of beneficial substance.

So, what's your opinion on nutrionalism?",,False,self,t5_2qoox,False,,,True,t3_1abye8,http://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1abye8/never_eat_again/,

* The second (**starting in January**), ""[Nutrition for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention](https://www.coursera.org/course/nutrition),"" is a beginner's course on nutrition taught by a University of California, San Francisco professor and dietitian Katie Clark. 

* Starting simultaneously **in January** will be another public health course, this time on the food system, ""[An Introduction to the U.S. Food System: Perspectives from Public Health](https://www.coursera.org/course/foodsys),"" and taught from professors from John Hopkins.  

I'm pretty excited about these courses even though they're a while away. If you like learning or reading about various aspects of nutrition/health you'll definitely like these courses. Yes, they're all completely free with no strings attached. Do sign up on Coursera (yes, I know, shameless plug)!

I start my days with 2 cups, then usually a cup with dinner/dessert, and another 1-2 thrown in in the middle of the day or at night when I'm studying or having fun when I'm supposed to be studying (4-5 cups a day). 

Anyways, due to being totally obsessed, I buy the good stuff-my go to stocking stuffer or birthday gift is always a pack of 10 different coffee blends from Gevalia or Harry&amp;David, or a 16 oz bag of Blue Mountain, and the occasional Starbucks. I usually flip 50/50 between the artificially flavored and natural blends, and when I do have access to a machine or I'm in a coffee shop, I go for the espresso. My question: am I hurting vitamin absorbtions or anything else related to nutrition?

1. Chronic diseases increased dramatically after the Western world switched to animal produce from a mostly plant based diet. 
2. White meat is just as detrimental as red meat.

I've been exercising and cooking/eating very healthy for a couple of years now (after a lifetime of smoking, drinking, and eating whatever I felt like).  I feel great and am in the best shape of my life.  

My husband will go through periods of being really gung-ho, wanting to eat well with me.  But he runs out of steam pretty quickly, gets bored of my cooking or claims the portions are too small.  So he inevitably ends up at the drive-thru after a week or two.  

He just recently gave up HFCS soda for tea, and is wanting to start eating well again.  I know he can do this, and that he'd benefit from it in every way.  I really want us to have a long, healthy life together and he's honestly in total denial about the state of his health.  So I want to immediately overhaul his entire diet, although I know that's guaranteed to fail.

So, what should be our first priority?  For me, it was sugar.  For him, I'm thinking processed carbs.  He eats a lot of white bread and pasta.  His diet has mainly consisted of lots of frozen dinners, fast food, cheese, etc.  I'd also love suggestions for things to substitute, and ways to bulk up healthy meals (he loves to graze most of the day and eat a really large dinner).

Updates:

* The algorithm now penalizes excessive ""irregular"" portions of food

* It is aware of maximum amounts of nutrients that may be harmful and will not exceed them

* It can maximize and minimize specific nutrients, eg. max protein, min fat.

* It has a function to easily replace an item in the diet


Upcoming:

* The optimization converges slowly (there are about 10^15 candidate diets), so a web frontend is not an option yet. I hope a switch of language and technique may fix this, but it will take some time.

* Meals. Rather than minimal diet for the day, 3 or 4 minimal meals that in combination have total daily nutrition.

Some examples: 

* Minimize fat, maximize protein

So I come to the US and go to Wal-Mart like everybody else to buy some ground beef. I find their beef and it looks really good and packed neatly with the fat percentage on the box. Took it home and cooked it.

But this beef looked different. It doesn’t change texture with cooking, stays stringy and no juices coming out of it. Needless to say it doesn’t taste good either, but I’ve been eating it for around a year.

Recently though I started using ground beef from a local market and it was organic too. Immediately I remember what beef in my country tasted and felt like (I come from Jordan) and it tasted 1000 times better. So I guess my question is.

Perhaps this is because I love carbs. I rarely eat red meat, and eat healthy protein like chicken and turkey, but my weakness is definitely white bread. I love mac-and-cheese, spaghetti, pizza...the food people pretty much classify as the ""fat kid food"" even if you eat them in moderate portions. I'm towards the further end of the ""healthy BMI"" weight range at 5 ft. 8, so I could stand to lose a few pounds...but I just feel like cutting out an entire group of food ala the Atkins diet is probably one of the worst ways to do it. 

So, I guess my question comes down to this: if I have 1 cup of mac-and-cheese and a salad for dinner, is it really that bad?

I have lurked here for a while and found some great answers, but I have a few questions that warranted a new post.

I am 21 years old, 5'1"", and my weight fluctuates between 95-100 pounds. 

My eating habits are pretty tame. I eat home-cooked meals all the time. I rarely eat at restaurants, and I have never eaten any fast-foods, such as hamburgers, fries, milkshakes, pancakes, etc. I never drink soda or juice, only water. 

My family is Indian, so we eat a lot of rice, lentils, and wheat bread daily. The only meat I eat is chicken and sometimes fish.

Here is my problem. I never get hungry and become full very fast. **I have tried following much of the advice on this sub, but I don't know how to apply it to myself.** I have never followed the 3-meals-a-day plan. I only have to eat one pan-fried egg, and I won't get hungry for 8-10 hours. Sometimes, I go the whole day without eating and don't realize I'm hungry until I see my hands start to shake.

I don't eat breakfast because I have to save space lunch so I will have some energy throughout the rest of the day. I usually eat a sandwich or a bowl of rice around 12 or 1 pm, come home and eat roti (chapatis) with cooked vegetables around 8 or 9 pm. If I need to snack, I eat grapes, cucumbers, or similar foods with lots of water.

For some reason, I can't eat more than one type of food in one sitting without getting really full. If I eat a large apple, that's as good as a meal for me.  A salad is as good as another meal. Same with a sandwich. I marvel at people who can eat eggs and grapefruit for breakfast; burger, fruits, and drinks for lunch; and then eat a steak, potatoes, and pie for dinner. All of those would be about 3 days' meal for me. Quite frankly, food just doesn't interest me. If it's there, sure, I'll eat it. But if it's not, no problem, maybe next time.

For the past month or so, I have started getting these dizzy spells every time I stand up quickly or even when getting out of bed. I know it has a lot to do with my diet. I don't follow a strict exercise regimen, but I know I get enough exercise just by walking around campus everyday. I tend to park far and walk to all my classes, and I've recorded my routes a few times and looked up the total distance traveled, and I usually walk 3-4 miles a day just by being on campus. I tried jogging in the gym last week but blacked out after just a quarter of a mile, and this is one of the reasons I need to fix up my diet, so I can start exercising more. 

Additionally, I drink a lot of water. Almost a glass every hour, sometimes 12-14 glasses a day. Would this have anything to do with me feeling full all the time?

**How can I build my diet? Can you suggest any foods that I can start eating, one by one? Please don't suggest large meal portions, just simple things.**

And no, I have never been anorexic or bulimic nor do I have any body image issues. I am more concerned about the state of my insides than my outsides.

* Question - How can I tell natural sugars and corn syrup apart in products like jellies? The labels on everything says just ""Sugars"" and nothing else.

When I was younger, at around the age of 14, I was very very fat. Overweight. At the height of what must have been 170 cm I weighed in at 90 kg. 

Now for various reasons, one day out of the blue, something flipped inside me and I stopped eating, quite literally. I only had cereal for breakfast and a small portion of whatever was for lunch. I started exercising everyday with a 45 minute to one hour jog. Of course, that was stupid, reckless and I put my family through hell because of my stubbornness. 

Anyway, within 4 months I lost what must have been 35 kg so I weighed 55 kg. I developed very very bad anemia (and probably other deficiencies) and fatigue overtook me all of a sudden. I did a blood test to confirm that it was anemia and set to try and fix it. I got a bit better, I know weigh 70 kg. 

Apparently, I am just above the minimum for not being officially anemic. But I still feel fatigued, and in the mornings and on some days it is particularly bad. I can't sprint for long, and jogging sometimes takes it out of me for the rest of the day. I have been taking Iron pills and trying to eat iron rich foods (red meats, spinach, beans + pulses). Also trying to have vitamin C and avoiding caffeine with my meals. But it just doesn't seem to be working.
What else do I need to restore myself? What do I need to be energetic? Sorry for the long post!

TL;DR - Fat when young. Lost weight recklessly and rapidly to develop intense anemia fatigue. Got better, but never felt quite the same. What can I do?

Because of this, I wanted to include nutrition information within the Diabetik application but couldn't find a free, reliable source for such data - which is why I ultimately decided to create a Wikipedia-style [database of nutrition information](http://nutrition.diabetikapp.com).

The idea here is that anyone can [create or edit entries](http://nutrition.diabetikapp.com/entry/1), and that the data is available to everyone. My hope is that it'll become a great way to quickly lookup nutrition information and, perhaps more importantly, that the information shared there can be used by third-parties for numerous projects and applications.

Microwaved or steamed? Does it make a difference? Actually, the method of cooking does affect different types of vegetables in both a positive and negative way. For example, when cooking tomatoes, the bioavailablity of Lycopene (a carotenoid with antioxidant properties) is increased; however, the amount of Vitamin C decreases. 

Microwaving

There is a lot of debating going on over microwaving vs. using a conventional oven. Some say microwaving is the devil because of nutrient loss and cancer causing properties. Some nutrients are broken down when they are exposed to heat. So, is microwaving better than cooking vegetables in a convention oven? Since both use heat to cook, and microwaving takes a shorter amount of time to cook food, it is a slightly better option than cooking in the oven. 

Frying

Frying is probably one of the worst ways to cook your vegetables. The heat is so high that almost all nutrients are immediately destroyed.  Frying also causes the release of free radicals, which are detrimental to your health.

Boiling

Boiling is probably the second worst way to cook your vegetables, unless you plan on using the remaining broth. When you boil vegetables, all the nutrients leak out into the water. Since many people do not save the water from the vegetables, you are not getting the benefits of the cancer fighting properties they hold.

Steaming

Steaming is the gold standard for cooking vegetables. Steaming helps to retain the nutritional value of your vegetables. Some key things to remember when steaming are: don't use too much water (1/2 cup is usually good) and don't overcook (5-7 minutes is usually good for most vegetables).

Raw Food 

Just to clarify, I am only speaking about eating certain foods raw, like vegetables, not the raw food diet, where a person will only eat raw foods (no meats, fish, etc). Studies have shown that both raw and cooked vegetable consumption are inversely related to epithelial cancers, lung cancer, and breast cancer; however, these relationships may be stronger for raw vegetables than cooked vegetables.

Degradation of Vitamins &amp; Minerals

Once vegetables are picked, their vitamin and mineral content begin to degrade. To slow this process, most vegetables should be refrigerated until they are used.  Also, many vitamins are easily destroyed by oxygen. In order to minimize nutrient loss, cut vegetables should be stored in airtight containers in the refrigerator. Just to keep in mind, after about 24 hours in the fridge, cooked vegetables will lose 1/4 of their Vitamin C content. Vitamin C is the most likely vitamin to be lost in cooking. It is very sensitive to heat, air, and water. To minimize nutrient loss, cook in as little water as possible.


The bottom line is, whether you are eating your vegetables raw or cooked, at least you are consuming vegetables!

Yesterday, took ACV (Apple Cider Vinegar) for the first time since starting with yogurt and my persistent diarrhea seems to be gone, for the first time in so long I can't recall. Years?  Amazed, I am, and happy. 

A bit baffled with the theory of this. Yogurt is supposed to flood the intestines with good flora, to (eventually) displace the bad flora. The SCD diet starves the bad flora to eventual death. ACV is supposed to kills the bad flora, but also the good flora.  I'm taking both yogurt and ACV (90 minutes apart), so I seem to be adding good flora (with yogurt) then killing it (with ACV).  Yet this seems to work. 

Can the flora from the yogurt make its way to the large intestine without being killed before it gets there by the ACV that is taken 90 minutes later?

Does it make more sense to eat yogurt one day, then drink ACV the next day, then back to yogurt the day after that?  If ACV kills all the flora, why eat yogurt at all?

This leads to a tolerance and preference for monotony, really helpful for working out, really unhelpful for nutrition.

Not going to live long this way. 

Long story short-I'm trying to plan out a near perfect food routine that I could rely on for a long time and hopefully live longer and happier because of it. I want to make a smoothie that contains an optimal mix of micronutrients and that takes care of categories of food more difficult than meat, forever (I can handle cooking and eating chicken breasts the rest of the day).

Money is not an issue, a freak like me is plenty productive and will have a nice job. Nor is time or motivation for similar reasons-just the acquisition of and organization of knowledge.

I have been brought to tears many times trying to gather data on nutrition-trying to break things down into macro, micronutrient ratios in Microsoft Excel-it took me days of effort to design bean burritos, once, and that was the last thing I cooked in the last two years. (They were beautifully perfect, healthy and delicious, though, and they weighed exactly 10 ounces each and their composition was identical +/- 3 beans). 

There are so many contrasting sources, and sooo much information that focuses on the concept of, ""Just eat a few from these categories every once in a while and you'll be ok."" I CAN'T DO that. What if I miss out on Riboflavin? I will NOT randomly get Riboflavin from another source, because I will NOT randomly eat food at any time.

I'm sure I will be helped out more during follow up, but I was curious if any of you had ever experienced this situation and knew some tips and tricks so I don't end up looking like a skeleton a month from now?

Before I ask my question, let me tell you a little bit more about me (unsure if that will even matter for the question.)

So about a year ago I decided to change, not really sure why, guess I just got sick of how I looked. I was 6'2"", 375 pounds, unhealthy as hell, and had bigger breasts than most women did (I'm a dude). Since early January of last year, I managed to drop my weight down to 265, on nothing other than running and doing some weight training, and eating smaller portions and limiting myself to a 2,000 calorie diet~ and not engorging on pasta/pizza every meal. Still though, I am completely ignorant on the facts of nutrition, I just try to watch what I eat.

That being said, two weeks ago (I have one day left of week 2) I started Insanity, and mother of god, my ass has never been kicked so hard. To my surprise, I've been able actually make it through the majority of the workouts, maybe not at the pace of most, but I am able. I dig deep and push through. I've also dropped my weight to 262 since I started, and I can see the changes in the mirror, my body is getting more toned and my fat is starting to shift to different places, as a matter of fact, I have ankles now!

Part of my problem in life is that I am a insanely picky eater, I mean to the extreme. The Insanity diet recommendations do not really work for my food palette. I eat rather well though (I think), small portions of ham and eggs, protein shakes, and on rare occasions I like to cook a small sirloin. With that in mind, I am human, and if I do not cheat on my diet I'll literally go insane, no pun intended. I LOVE pizza, I LOVE pasta, and sadly most of those foods are horrendous for someone trying to drop weight.

Now onto my question. Since i'm completely ignorant when it comes to nutrition, my question pertains to fat consumption. Do I need to burn more fat than I consume to actually lose weight? This pertains to my cheat day, as on a normal day I burn more fat than I consume. For example if I cheat, and consume a a total of 60 grams of fat, but I only burn 40 grams, will my weight not change? I know you have to burn more calories than you consume to lose weight, but I don't understand how fat works into the equation. Could someone shed some light onto this for me, preferably in a way a person with little knowledge of nutrition can understand?

Cheers,

Tyler

I'm 20 years old, 6'4"" and probably somewhere between 300 and 350 lbs.

I've struggled a lot with my body and my self-esteem and all that.  I absolutely hated everything abut my body and myself because of it till I was like, 19.  I hated being fat and felt powerless to change it.  Then I spent maybe 3 months sort of dieting and exercising at my university's gym, and I lost at least 25 pounds.  But then when I went home for the summer, I didn't have easy access to exercising, and a few months back at school I was too neurotic and fixed on my weight loss for it to be healthy for me to continue focusing on it.

Now I want to lose weight, for health reasons, mostly (new meds I want to go on go over better if you're not overweight, I think).  I cut out all added sugar (and most added fake sugar) - things like sucrose, corn syrup, and anything ending in -ose that I feel shouldn't be there.  I'm also avoiding things that have concentrated amounts of naturally occurring sugars, like fruit juice (even if it doesn't have sucrose added) and dried fruits.  I get most of my sugar from frozen blueberries, milk, and probably grains - while I've cut out pasta (or at least DRASTICALLY cut back), I still eat crackers, rice cakes, and other such things.

I have no doubt that this will make me healthier, considering that before I started, I ate all the desserts all the time.  And I do crave sugar much less often, and feel in general less hungry all the time.  But I'm worried, for one, that my fat intake is too high.  Also I just feel like I'm not well informed on how to make nutritious choices.

SO here's where shit gets complicated. 
-I'm vegetarian!  No fish.  Eggs and milk, sure.  Lab-grown meat, hey, here's hoping it's available and affordable soon.
-I don't want to NEED to exercise - although I'm trying to get workout equipment for my apartment, it might not happen soon.  Mostly I just want solutions that can become a comfortable part of my ordinary routine, because if I walk a mile to the gym every day, that's 20 minutes of me chastising myself for being so fat and horrible and how the gym will never help me.
-I'm not going to weight myself!  Nope.  Knowing my weight fucks me up mentally.  I should be able to lose weight without it, and I won't give up based on not seeing weekly quantifiable process, especially if it's just ho-hum dietary changes.
-I need to be able to eat, a lot.  Portion control is not the solution right now.  It makes me anxious to not be able to eat something if I feel hungry.
~less importantly, I'd much rather any new food be something that can be prepared relatively quickly, isn't absurdly costly, and won't go bad if I don't eat it within a week.

The only things I really know are that I need protein and fiber.  I'm not saying I know I need more, I'm saying I know I need them to live.  One of my staple meals at the moment is plain greek yogurt mixed with blended frozen blueberries and 100% cacoa powder, with some cottage cheese thrown in for fun.  It's not delicious, but it's sweet while not being high in sugar, I can eat a lot of it, and I feel like there's a lot of protein in it.  Otherwise, I eat some frozen vegetables, buy tomatoes and grapes, and avocados when they're cheap enough, but I think I eat too much cheese.  I'm also not generally put off by eating the same thing all the time. 

TL;DR what food should I make a staple of my diet that is vegetarian, I can eat a ton of, won't go bad fast, and prep work is simplish.

This question has been bugging me for quite a long time now.
 
**TLDR : I’m wondering if there is any reason for why we count the energy balance (surplus / deficit) at the end of the day specifically VS for example over the course of a week.**


Is there any special mechanism that happens in the body when we go to sleep (hormones likely) that could account for this way of measuring ? I seem to recall having read somewhere that it should probably more actually be counted over a 24-hour span, whatever the time one starts or ends eating.



***SIDENOTE*** : I’m actually asking this question in regards to (intermittent) fasting, the relatively big meals that come with it, and overall fat use. Wouldn’t that cause fat storage as fat oxidation is suppressed for a long time ?

My reasoning is the following : suppose I consume 80% of my TDEE in one meal at 9PM, then eat 60% of the following day’s TDEE at 1PM the next day. If we look at the balance at the end of the day, I’m in a deficit both days and the FFA will be called back for energy. **Yet if we look at the 24-hour total, I’m in a 40% surplus that should most likely cause the FFA to be esterified and stored as triglicerydes, shouldnt’it ?**

I suppose that the overall deficit would cause those newly formed triglycerides to be eventually oxydated, but it would be harder than if they were never esterified in the first place…


I’ve tried doing research on this topic but I can’t seem to find any comprehensible specific resource about it, if you know some or if I’m not asking the right people/subreddit please let me know !
Thanks

**EDIT : Thanks for the answers guys, I realize that my question was more actually linked to (intermittent) fasting, but /r/leangains isn't usually so big on science stuff.

I'm a paruretic, which means I have a shy bladder.  In my case you would probably call it an extreme case.  Even if I need to go pretty bad, public restrooms are almost always a no-go.  The only exceptions are if the restroom is out of the way so it doesn't get much traffic, if its a restroom with a locking door and there isn't a line waiting, or if I'm REALLY drunk sometimes I stop caring and I'm able to go.

ANYWAY, I'm 27 and it is just a part of me now.  I've read some books on trying to fix it but never made much progress.  I've made peace with it for the most part except for going out and being social.  Bars are a huge problem for me.  In fact there are times I have to go so bad that I sneak away from my group, leave the bar, find a more secluded restroom (gas stations are often great), and relieve myself... then go back to the bar.  Then pretend like I stepped outside to take a phone call.  Ugh.

Anyway, the point of this post... I'm wondering if there is anything I can do to ""prep myself"" before going out.  Maybe if there's something I can eat that would soak up a lot of liquid and make it so I don't have to pee as often?  Or heck, anything else?  I hate having this problem and it ruins social events for me quite frequently.  But over time I've noticed sometimes I don't have to go as frequently as others, and the only thing I can think of that would cause that is my diet leading up to the evening of drinks.

I don't feel constipated but sometimes I feel a bit bloated or get the feeling that I'd really like to drop one. I've attributed this to eating lots of beans and other foods that take more time to break down? Unsure about this. 

Example of previous diet:
Breakfast - Muffin
Lunch - Burrito or sandwich from somewhere like Potbelly, Quiznos, etc... Occasional salads maybe 1 or 2 times a week
Dinner - Pizza, Burgers, hot dogs, pasta
Plus random snacks in between

Present:
Breakfast - Homemade Juice (banana, apple, strawberries, carrots, kale, etc...)
Lunch - Salad (sometimes still include cheeses, usually good about dressing)
Dinner - Black Bean Tacos, stir fry, occasionally something like veggie burger
No snacks, lots of green tea...

I can't imagine I'm the only fellow here with this problem so hopefully we can help eachother on out. 

Just to preface: I'm 23, 150 pounds give-or-take and 6'0 tall. I run 4 to 5 hours per week and started a pretty diligent weight-training regimen three weeks ago. I take in 2,000 to 2,500 healthy, nutrient dense calories of grains, lean meats, veggies, fruits, almonds, and some 2% cheese daily. Good, healthy stuff I work very hard to maintain. The kind of diet worth bragging about. 

Except for the days where I go abso-flippin'-lutely buckwild and just lose it. Every week or so, I have a few hours (usually at work) where I seem to sucker myself into some kind of meditative trance where my willpower just evaporates and I scarf every piece of candy and junk food around me like a garbage disposal. What follows is crushing guilt on par with farting in church. I'll spare you all the details about the inevitable indigestion too.

I'm worried, guys. I understand the importance of cheating every so often, but I just straight-up GORGE and take in far, far more empty calories than what I'd get from a single fast-food trip every week or so. Any advice?

As some of you may have noticed, things have been polished up around these parts lately, and myself and enamore22 have replaced phys1que (who was a spammer and whose account no longer exists) as the moderators. 

Before now, this subreddit was characterized by blogspam, a lack of voting, and little discussion. What we would like, and I'm sure what all of you would like, is to see this subreddit transform into a vibrant, helpful, thriving community where people can seek advice, useful information, and intelligent discussion. Of course, such a transformation will take some work, but I'm hoping that we can all work together to try to make it happen!

I've identified three main objectives that I think will most effectively improve our community in all aspects:

* Increasing exposure and our subscriber count

* Creating a basic FAQ

* Inventing a community nickname - this one is more just for fun! r/fitness has Fittit, and members are called Fittitors. What can we call ourselves? Nutrition is a bit unwieldly of a term...Nutrittit?? Diett??

As far as increasing exposure goes, I encourage you to recommend /r/nutrition in other reddits (so long as it's an appropriate place to do so and will be considered useful to those reading - we don't want to spam reddits or comment threads). I'll take care of messaging other mods to request they put our link in the sidebar of their subreddit. Also, In the coming weeks, I will be gathering information that will form the foundation for the FAQ, and will be creating a specific post asking for suggestions for information to be included in the FAQ.

Most importantly, what our community needs is the consistent submission of quality links or self posts. Nobody is going to be interested in this community if all they find is unfounded claims, mixed messages, and immature bickering in comment threads. I've outline some guidelines in the sidebar, but I will reiterate them here:

* Follow proper [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette)! This is absolutely essential!

* This is not the place for posts about fitness, exercise, or recipes. Please direct those posts to their respective subreddits.

* Blogspam is our greatest enemy (and the world of nutrition is particularly ripe with blogspam). If you are going to submit an article, ensure that it is well written, well researched, non-basic, from a reputable source (i.e. not a commercial website or blog [with some exceptions]), and that it says something that hasn't already been covered.

* If someone makes a self post requesting a critique of their diet, please do your research before offering them advice; do not just spew nutritional dogma without supporting your claims. The most helpful thing you can do for the advice-seeker is to offer some modest suggestions, and then provide them with resources that can help them look further into the area on their own. The FAQ, once developed, will be a great place to direct queries.

* **Nutrition is an inherently complicated field as much of it is contingent on how one defines ""health"". Please remember that not everybody has the same health goals as you, and therefore may not be interested in subscribing to the same diet or nutritional philosophy as you (paleo, keto, vegetarian, vegan, etc.). Keep this in mind when entering arguments in comment threads. Unlike many other more specialized subreddits, this is r/nutrition: discussion of all diets is welcome.**

Also, we'd like to recruit more moderators to help us in this community expansion, so we will be on the lookout for active, knowledgable, and helpful users to enlist! Also, if you're particularly interested, please feel free to [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23nutrition).

Let me know what you think of all this, and also offer your best suggestions for an r/nutrition nickname!

Thanks, and I look forward to eating vegetables and growing strong with you all.

I'm no stranger to fast food or greasy bar food (I live in a college town after all), but I eat relatively ""clean"" the vast majority of the time (Greek yogurt, fruits &amp; veggies, salmon, lean protein, whole grains). 

Yesterday, I went to McDonald's with my boyfriend to snag this ""buy one, give one"" quarter-pounder deal. The sandwich I got had less than 600 calories, and I ate it without the bottom half the bun. I thought, ""Okay, not bad. I'll be fine.""

I ended up being up for half the night with this really awful stomach ache. It wasn't nausea, but it was a dull pain that I can mostly describe as uncomfortable - it just felt like something was really *wrong*. Up until that point, I felt completely miserable - not overly full, just like there was something seriously off with my stomach. I could've probably eaten again, to be honest, but my stomach just felt so strange and miserable that I didn't. 

I eat greasy bar burgers or chicken wings or whatever not often, but maybe every few weeks. Often enough. I usually feel super full and not so great afterwards, but I've never had a feeling like I did last night before. 

I should also note that my boyfriend felt the same way as I did, and while he's definitely fit (6'2"" ~170) his diet is even greasier and more preservative-filled than mine.  

Basically, I'm just wondering *why* this happened. I've barely eaten today because my stomach still just feels ""off."" Is it all the preservatives?

The Study

Three high calorie diets were tested in a group of people between the ages of 18-35.  They had a BMI of 19-30, with some people being normal weight, and others being overweight.  The participants were placed on three high calorie diets with varying amounts of protein and fat.

Group 1: “Low Protein”

    6% of calories from protein.
    42% of calories from carbs.
    52% of calories from fat.

Group 2: “Normal Protein”

    15% of calories from protein.
    41% carbs.
    44% fat.

Group 3: “High Protein”

    26% of calories from protein.
    41% of calories from carbs.
    33% of calories from fat.

Carbohydrates were kept the same for each group, with the difference in energy intake being accounted for by fat.  There was no low-carb group.  Each group was fed 884-1022 excess calories per day, or 40% over their “maintenance” requirements. (Ignoring the fact that maintenance requirements are a myth, as I wrote in this response to a NY Times piece which said the opposite of today’s Time Magazine piece.)

The subject’s body compositions were measured with DEXA scans twice a week.  DEXA scans are the most accurate method to date for determining body composition (hats off to the researchers for doing it right).  Resting energy expenditure and total energy expenditure were measured throughout the study, but not in a calorimetry lab.

The low protein group gained almost half the weight of the other groups.

Total Weight Gain

Low Protein (5%): 3.16 kilograms.

Good golly. The headline says that the only thing that matters is how much you eat, but the research says the opposite. Good thing there’s probably an ad for Pop-Tarts or Kellogg’s Kashi to distract me.

According to the headline, if the subjects are eating the same amount of excess calories, they should gain weight proportionally.  They didn’t.  This directly refutes the premise that “it’s all about the calories.”  If changing the macronutrient composition of the diet alters weight gain, then saying “…it’s about the calories, stupid” is a blatant misinterpretation (not to mention, a little insulting).  It’s obviously not all about the calories if one group gained less than the other two.  I’m not advocating a low protein diet, but this does refute the headline!",,False,self,t5_2qoox,False,,,True,t3_12a9gi,http://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/12a9gi/dave_asprey_the_bulletproof_executive_takes_time/,

And it is sugar free..but it's 70 calories for 15g of food, or the exact same as the sugar brand. Is this a side-effect of the FDA's classification of sugar-alcohols or am I really getting 70 calories with both products?

Edit: Well I decided to google a bit and got my answer:

Differences
Sugar alcohols provide 33 to 50 percent fewer calories than sugar, because they take longer than sugar to convert to glucose. Unlike sugar, which requires insulin to be absorbed into cells, sugar alcohols require little insulin to be metabolized. Sugar alcohols affect blood glucose levels less than sugar, which makes them a popular choice with diabetics. A gram of sugar alcohol range from 0.2 calories per g for erythritol to 2.6 calories per g for sorbitol compared to the 4 calories per g found in regular sugar, FamilyDoctor.org reports.

History. I've always been thin. My mom was extremely thin up until menopause (she was a yoga instructor with an 8-pack when she was 40), she was a stringy, knock-kneed teenager like me too. My dad is 6 foot and about 160-170 in his early 50s. He's been thin his whole life as well. 

Me: I'm currently 6'3"", and depending on the time of day 135-138lbs. I work an office job, so I'm sedentary for 9+ hours a day and then spend a hour total in the car. I don't exercise, but I'm not a couch potato and am fixing something or going somewhere every weekend. 

My main problem is I have a very small appetite. When I wake up I don't feel hungry, and if left to my own devices would cruise right through till lunch without thinking about food. 

When I eat, I find it difficult to finish a meal. If I force food down my throat, I feel overfull and even nauseous. Once months ago, after a filet mignon and smashed potatoes dinner, my girlfriend guilted me into eating half a chocolat lava cake (it was my birthday and the cake showed up unannounced), mixing that in with the half bottle of wine I'd had, I actually had to leave the table to get sick. 

My appetite seems to be programmed to kick in later in the day, when I'm home for dinner I do my best to stuff myself to the bursting point, and then will snack on something later. I love ice cream and sometimes I'll make a milkshake with an egg if my appetite failed me earlier in the day. 

I also have anxiety about eating out. I don't eat as quickly as most people, and usually take a break or two to let things settle in. Inevitably how much I'm not eating compared to others becomes a point of conversation, so eating out has gotten to the point where I'm anxious about it a week in advance and can hardly eat while there. 

I haven't always been quite this skinny. When I was in college I weighed about 150lbs (and was concerned about it then as well) and when I worked during the summers, I weighed a little more and had a bigger appetite because I was working outside and doing hard physical labor. However, since becoming less active, my appetite has dwindled, and nothing I do seems to have a noticeable effect. 

I recently went to my doctor for a full, general physical, and she informed me that I'm healthy as a horse, and to just eat more food and don't get low fat anything if I want to gain weight. 

Lately I've become more concerned, honestly because my GF just got a bathroom scale and I recently realized just how fucking skinny I am, so I'm really trying to turn this around and reach a slightly more healthy weight. Even if it's just getting back to 150 or a little over. Also, I have a personal career coach, and she suggested that if I want to be more productive at work, I need to lock down a healthy, brain-stimulating diet. 

As such, I've quit eating bagels for breakfast, and I'm going to go to the grocery store this weekend to get some mixed nuts and high protein snacks to keep at my desk. I try to take a men's multivitamin to cover what i don't get in my diet, but I'm bad about remembering to take it when I eat, trying to make that a habit as well. 

To get an idea of my diet, so far today I've had a large iced coffee with cream and half the sugar from Dunkin, 3 egg omelet with ham, cheese and peppers in it. I managed to eat about 3/4 of it before I got my ""blech, don't eat anymore or you're going to feel sick"" feeling. Then for lunch I had a big nacho salad thing they do on fridays, which I picked at until it was basically salsa, guac and chips left which I couldnt squeeze in after the rest. Then as I was typing this I had a toasted coconut donut I got for free at Dunkin this morning. I don't usually have an afternoon snack. Not sure what dinner will be yet, last night we had mushroom stuffed rigatoni and the night before I had two enormous ghetto shrimp po-boys. (frozen shrimp, arnold bread, mayo, relish, tomato slices)

So.... what else can I do? What kind of foods should I be eating to maximize how much of it sticks? Is there anything I can do to stimulate my appetite, or help manage my food anxiety? 

I've had conversations with people that have told me how much they love eating. They wake up every day looking forward to what meals may come, and experience a positive feeling when they eat and feed themselves. This does not happen to me, but it sure sounds nice.

They've cut:

&gt;**gluten, nuts, dairy, eggs, citrus (including pineapple), seafood, tomatoes, onions, avocado, bananas, processed meat, alcohol, caffeine, and chocolate.**

I'm also on a medication that has reduced my appetite, so eating has become a massive chore. Weight loss is a side effect of the medication, so I've lost about 12.25 pounds in 6 weeks. (went from ~137.6 to 125.4 from April 24th to now June 8th).

At first I did a ton of stir fry, and now I really hate stir fry, maybe I was just doing it wrong. Then I was eating a lot of salads with BBQ'd meat on top (no BBQ sauce though because that has tomatoes) and homemade salad dressing, but I've gotten a bit sick of it, and it's not actually very high calorie. I then switched to some GF pasta with homemade pesto, but I'm worried I'm not getting enough protein. 

I'm definitely not hitting 1200 calories a day-- I'm mostly eating one ""major"" meal a day (1/4 of a pound of pasta with pesto) and then some watermelon or other fruit for breakfast and maybe a rice cake for a snack. There are multiple times a day I would go eat something but I'm just not sure what to eat so I don't eat anything. My current only ""snack food"" is rice cakes but they are so low calorie and filling that I feel like I need something higher calorie to boost my daily intake. I did eat apple sauce for a while but I ran out, I plan to buy more. I also had some jello around that was good, though not super healthy. The only other thing I've really been making is strawberry smoothies with frozen strawberries and soy milk. If these are good for me calorie and nutrition wise I'm fine making them more often, I just am very overwhelmed.

I would post in some of the other subs, but the problem is that I am gluten-free/dairy-free/so-many-other-frees that I don't really know where to post to get some help. I need to be on the diet for at least another month, maybe for another three months before I start adding foods back in to see if the migraines get worse. It's possible that I will be coming off the medication in the next week (I'm having a reaction to it and we have to determine if it is a scary reaction or a not scary reaction), so it's possible my appetite will return, but I still need things I can eat that follow the rules. Thanks so much, if this is the wrong sub, please let me know where this should go. :)

Dinner • A burrito bowl of sorts. Black beans. Green lettuce. Green and red peppers. Steak (or chicken), some salsas, and maybe some avocado.

",captnanonymous,19,2,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/18uh99/trying_to_reform_my_eating_habits_need_some_wisdom/,"I am new to this whole nutrition thing, and I have recently embarked on a fairly drastic change of course in my eating habits. Though I have mostly avoided “processed” foods for years and cooked nearly everything from scratch, I was not making the best meal choices in terms of balance, and usually would eat only one meal a day. This would result in me gorging myself when I got home from work because I was starving. I was also a heavy drinker: a six-pack of beer on most weekdays and a twelve-pack on Fridays and Saturdays. I also recently stopped drinking 44 fl oz of Diet Mountain Dew every day. 

I now find myself 34 years old and suffering from classic skinny-fat syndrome. I am 6 ft and 200 lbs, which I feel is heavy. I tend to pack on fat around my legs and stomach. I suffered from anorexia/bulimia for a few years, but this hasn't been an issue for a long time. My goal is to lose about 25-30 pounds by summer. 

So I've finally had enough, and am getting serious about getting healthy again. I spent some time plugging numbers into various calculators, and have determined (perhaps erroneously) that my BMR is roughly 2000 Kcal/day with a maintenance level of about 2400 Kcal/day. I am currently pretty sedentary- I have a desk job and am usually pretty depressed with seriously low energy levels. I plan on incorporating an exercise plan into the mix, but I want to work on reforming my diet first. 

Here is what I ate yesterday (first day of my diet, today's plan is similar and I have been sticking to it fine), This was divided into 5 meals, roughly 1500 calories total:

* Tangelos- 2
* Hard-boiled Eggs- 2
* Coffee With Creamer- 20 oz
* 1/2 can of tuna mixed with shallots, spinach, and celery 
* Cottage Cheese- 1/2 Cup
* Raw Baby Carrots- Don't know the exact amount, maybe 20-30? Carrots are my favorite vegetable. 
* Unsweetened Iced Tea- A metric fuckton
* Greek Yogurt Bar- 1
* Grilled Asparagus- 6 oz
* Black Beans and cooked Tomatoes- 1 cup
* Grilled Chicken Breast- 7 oz
* Roasted Bell Pepper
* Canned Pineapple- 3 slices
* Pineapple Juice- 2 Tbsp, added to sparkling water

I want to lose about 2 lbs a week, and am shooting for a 1000 calorie deficit, which puts me at around 1500 Kcal/day. My questions are many, but I will try to pare them down:

* Is  1500 Kcal/day too low? Will I be ruining my already waning metabolism? How long should I stay on this regimen?

* Are carbs completely evil? From what I've gathered, I should get them through things like beans and whole grain, but how much is too much?

* I am having trouble formulating a “balanced diet”, because it’s something I never really worried about too much before now. Any tips?

* There is a lot of conflicting information available on what is considered a healthy diet. Is there a happy medium? People often seem to advocate extremes, and that usually sets my bullshit meter off.

I'm not an active reader of this subreddit (yet), but maybe you guys can help me with something I've been thinking about.

Recently my life has become a lot more busy than it normally is, and as someone who likes to cook food at home as much as possible, this has made it harder than normal to keep on top of meals. In addition, I've started working out a lot and bulking, meaning I'm consuming a lot of food and have additional nutrition goals like extra protein consumption.

So I had an idea: What if I created a 14 day list of meals that I could repeat all year, that were tailored to my nutrition needs.

The positives to this idea that immediately come to mind are:

* I can plan grocery trips super easily without having to sit down and try to plan out something every week.
* I can buy in bulk, freeze, can, etc. meaning I save time and money.
* If I take care to give a variety of foods between my meals each day, I shouldn't get tired of anything.


There are some downsides too:

* If I ever want to change things up, I need to make sure everything I adjust ends up with the same results.
* It'll take some discipline to start something like this up and continue on with it long enough for it to become second nature.


The downsides I can think of don't seem like a big deal though. This isn't something a lot of people do, though, so there must be something I'm overlooking. Is there a hidden consequence to having a spaghetti every second Thursday for the rest of my life?

In short, I had this crazy idea and I was wondering if anyone sees any glaring flaws in it before I go ahead with the next step to making it a reality.

I myself have been a vegan before, and I am currently a very loose version of paleo (I eat oats/rice and cheat a lot when I'm not in training mode for jiu jitsu tournaments). Both ways, I was perfectly healthy (according to doctors) and able to remain trim, active, and energetic (I trained in BJJ on both diets). The point of this thread isn't to attack one side or the other, but to sort out why the fuck so much evidence exists favoring one or the other and why it all seems pretty equally reputable.

My non-scientific thinking is possibly this: consider your average American's diet. It is high fat and protein but is also high in carbohydrates from grains. Case in point - the cheeseburger or the burrito. Eating this way for every meal turns you into a porker. But, if you err to one side or the other - cut out the fats and proteins from animals (vegan), or cut out the carbohydrates and proteins from grains (paleo), it seems that numerous people have seen positive results. So it seems that where the two nutrition sources meet in the middle is where we run into issues. 

I've heard (but never read, so don't attack me on this) that the flora in your gut will grow to prefer one nutritional source or the other. Could it be that the interaction of the nutrients themselves/the flora of the gut is the answer to this issue? Are both diets equally viable when done correctly and the real problem lies with mixing grains with an animal fats and proteins? Would going to either side of the spectrum guarantee health, or is one side spouting a lot of pseudo-science designed to justify a given moral/philosophical belief? Is the evidence that vegans use against omnivores based off of the typical American diet, or have they compared a fully paleo diet to a fully vegan diet in a study?

1343412191.0,14,self.nutrition,x9aza,Tube Feeding - A New Weight Loss Low,bmysz1121,22,8,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/x9aza/tube_feeding_a_new_weight_loss_low/,"I just read on Forbes that there is a new weight loss strategy for rapid fat loss and it involves tube feeding – through the nose. Yes, you heard me this new technique is overseen by a doctor that inserts a tube up the patients nose to induce fat loss during a period of 10 days. It’s overseen by a doctor, so it has got to be effective and safe, right?
 
 
 
I don’t know about you, but I think this procedure is a waste of money (and pain) for a couple reasons:
 
1) A tube up the nose? Are you serious? This is typically reserved for those who have terminal illnesses or are extremely ill and are unable to swallow. Basically what is fed through this tube is a no carb solution with an allotted 800 calories per day. Can’t you just eat 800 calories per day (through your mouth), and not need to pay someone $1500 to put food down your nose for 10 days?
 

Imagine someone putting a tube down your nose into your stomach! That would be extremely uncomfortable - and what would you really get out of this?
 
2) This creates a completely different attitude towards weight loss. Dr. David L. Katz, MD, MPH, of Yale University states that this creates a “means to an end” attitude in which we no longer focus on the healthiest way of weight loss, but we are now looking at the fastest way to produce results – which typically means it is unhealthy. This attitude will open a whole new window of weight loss techniques that are incredibly unhealthy.
 

I'm going to open my own weight loss clinic. I will put a shock collar on all of my patients, and anytime they try to eat, I will zap them and then slap them in the face with a dead fish. The shock will create an aversion to food, and the smell of the dead fish will be associated with putting food to their mouth. They won't eat again! It's flawless! It's a perfect weight loss plan for anyone needing assistance with starving themselves to induce weight loss.
 
3) This diet “works” by putting your body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is induced when your body runs out of glycogen stores (glycogen stores are created through ingestion of carbohydrates, which are absent in this procedure), and your body starts breaking down fat. A byproduct of this process is ketone bodies, which are acidic and create a pH imbalance in your body. Your kidneys have to work extra hard to keep your pH normal during this process. I am assuming that a doctor has to perform this procedure to monitor your kidney and liver function because of the strain this diet puts on your body. Now, do you really think a diet that can potentially hurt your kidneys and liver is really a good idea?
 
4) If your body was put through this type of diet for a longer period of time, you may end up going into a state of ketoacidosis, which is when your kidneys can no longer compensate for the lowered pH by the ketone bodies. This potentially life-threatening state is most commonly seen in diabetics who do not watch their diet correctly. Since your body can not stay in a state of ketosis for more than 10 days, then this “diet” can only last 10 days. The body is an incredible adaptation machine, and the more rapidly you lose weight, the more rapidly the body will adjust, and counter the weight loss. So basically, you will gain the weight back unless you stay in that state of ketosis longer which, as discussed, is really not possible for much longer.
 
5) I am no doctor, but I’m sure doctors are aware of how this diet can negatively affect the body. This brings up concern because if some ( I am certainly saying that not all doctors do this) doctors are willing to perform a procedure that is reserved for extremely ill patients on perfectly healthy adults, what else are they willing to do? They have the technology and knowledge at their fingertips to perform even more drastic and potentially more life-threatening procedures for weight loss. Where does their conscience kick in and say “this isn’t right”?
 
Im sure you have heard of a lot of different crash diets, but this one is a very dangerous diet to put your body through. First of all, people who go through this “diet” have a flawed perception of how weight loss can be achieved. You cannot lose weight and keep it off with a 10 day diet, and they do not understand this. This attitude towards weight loss needs to be stopped.
 

Who knows what type of diet will they think of next?

The whole site is based on this list of foods that George has named the ""World's Healthiest"". I'm not really in to following the diet plan he suggests or even in to all the foods he suggests, but some parts of the site are helpful.

The only parts of the website I use at all are their [Essential Nutrients List](http://whfoods.com/nutrientstoc.php) and their [World's Healthiest Foods List](http://whfoods.com/foodstoc.php). They are quite detailed and helpful for looking into either the nutrient content of foods or looking for food sources of particular nutrients. I find the Essential Nutrients list particularly helpful as each nutrient's page includes things like toxicity symptoms, deficiency symtoms, cooking, storage and processing, factors that affect function, etc.

The amount of research they do and their scientific approach is quite [impressive](http://whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=george&amp;dbid=235). Most of their researchers are from a company called [SaluGenecists](http://salugenecists.com/), and, since this is a corporation, it's best to approach the information on WHFoods with a critical mindset. However, they do cite all their references, so you're free to look into their claims.

People are way too conservative with their sidedishes. Its potato, pasta or rice. But there is so much more and better. Varying your grains makes your meals much more enjoyable and more beneficial. Barley, beans, millet, quinoa, bulghur, wild rice and there is so much more to discover. 

Size your portions. The biggest errors i see in peoples diet (used to do the same) - big portions. A meat portion is 100-200g (1/4-1/2 pounds) tops. The less bone, less fat, more meat = smaller portion. Cut it in pieces when you cook it will feel more.

Get a ""fish day"" 1 day of fish per week will vary your meals a lot.

Plan your meals. Breakfast in the morning (get fruits and something warm - any kind of oats, omelet with veggies, milk soups.) Main dish + salad for dinner (main course of meat with a side dish and some salad on the side. Go different cuisines, couscous salad, homemade potato salad, etc.) Something hearty for supper - soup or ragout.

Incorporate vegies in you meals - Chicken noodle soop? Add some onions and greens (parsley, dill, ciliantro)(parsley contains an amazing amount of vit c. and other nutrients). Making a pizza? Make your own sauce, put tons of mushrooms, peppers and cut on the pepperoni. Lasagna? Less meat, get some eggplants and zucchinis in there. Be creative.

Start cooking. STOP BUYING FROZEN PREMADE FOOD. JUST STOP. Start  exploring different cuisines. A good tool to start cooking - is ingredient of the week section. It lets you discover new recipes and expand your horizons. Didnt like it, learn from it. Did like it? Add it to your collection. http://allrecipes.com/ 
Has a section like that.

Shop at the local fruit stores. Find a good place with a good selection and some organic sections. Local markets are amazing too. Supporting local farmers also gets you better food. Fruits from further away are preserved with wax and chemicals. No matter how much harmful they are for you its never a good thing.

Best tip if you want to loose weight fast - drink water and only water for a month, see the difference. Then go back to juices, ice teas (homemade) coffee (1-3 cups a day tops). STAY AWAY FROM SODAS. EVEN MORE STAY AWAY FROM DIET SODAS. Try to squeeze you own juices, they loose a lot of nutrients after 30 minutes. So 1 portion of a time. Its excellent if you do this, but its a lot of work, and I mostly stay on store juices myself.

Fruit smoothies is an easy snack, some people even argue its better then juices in term of nutrients. OJ+Banana+ selection of your fav fruits and berries +blend that bitch = PROFIT.

Brief background: I am a high school student who's very interested in nutrition in general. I think I finally get the basics of how the macros work, but whilst trying to make a decent meal plan for myself I got overwhelmed with the micros.

1. How is the RDI calculated? I know there's a lot of controversy on the macro nutrient side of things, but this doesn't seem to be the case when it comes to micro nutrients. Why is this?

2. What is a simple, easy or effective way to make sure you're getting all micro nutrients? I haven't found a 100% complete database of foods. And the one closest to being complete (usda) is not very usable in everyday life. I simply don't know where to start.

3. In a world where nearly nobody is counting micros and many are counting calories, how difficult and important is it to get all micro nutrients? Will you easily die if you don't? What are the benefits of living a completely sober (i.e. getting 100% of your RDI every day) life?

4. Where I live, high-school students have to make a final paper (160-hour total project). They can choose their own subject. I'd like to research whether or not most students (age 12 - 18 or 18 - 24, haven't decided yet) get all micros. If they don't (which is quite probable), I'd like to come up with a solution. I'm thinking cheap, simple, tasty recipes that they can cook themselves in a short amount of time. I'm wondering if this already exists or not (google says not). Any tips on going about doing this are welcome :).

Appreciate these posts probably pop up a lot, but anything you can offer would be awesome.

My current schedule is running 3 times a week (5-12k a time - tend to build up to half marathons as the months go on then pull it back towards race days), cycling twice a week (10-25k a time), swimming once/twice a week (500m-800m each session), as well as ab ripper twice a week, weight training (lunges/squats/pull ups/chin ups and more) twice a week. I'll also be taking up kickboxing shortly - more on the martial arts side, than the quasi cardio stuff though. That'll be once a week.

Diet wise, here's a good overview:

Breakfast: Special K with blueberries / or boiled egg, one slice of brown toast and protein shake (1/2 scoop), 75g greek yoghurt, splash of milk and two strawberries or blueberries

Morning snack: little bit of melon or clementine

Lunch: wholemeal roll w/ tuna, chicken or egg &amp; chicken if feeling greedy. Sometimes with a yoghurt or vegetables (broccoli/peas)

Afternoon snack: clementine &amp; apple if heading out for a run

Dinner: varies between low-carb recipes (little bit of bacon &amp; broccoli, stir fries with chicken or beef) and rice with meat on running days.

Evening snack: slice of soreen and a banana on long run days, just a banana on swimming/low intensity days. Also have yoghurt raisins as I have a massive sweet tooth.

I have cheat days, but haven't eaten fast food in a while - do love chocolate, but try to limit my intake!

Weight:97-98.5lbs / Height: 5""0

Good to know I'm on the right track. Reddit is awesome!

Hey Guys. My name is Nick. Very nice to meet you. I'm choosing to spend my lunchtime today writing looking for some information on eating. I'll tell you where I used to be, where I'm at, and where I'd like to be. 

I'd say this time 2 years ago, (age 20) I weighed about 165 pounds. Obviously, eating as much crap as I wanted all day every day and would never gain a pound. I worked at Jimmy Johns and Best buy at the same time, And I would eat 1 sub and at least 4 mcdoubles (with fries and drinks) a day. The daily commute left me no time to go grocery shopping and cook, so I never did. Because I was on my feet all day long, I was constantly up and at em'. I was nicely toned and had the 'skinny white boy six pack' you get when you don't even work out but you look good. 

Well that phase is over. I'm 22 years old now, working 1 9-5 job. Living away from home with friends, I grocery shop every two weeks and cook most all my own meals. When I go to the grocery store, I pick up fruits, veggies, chicken, and fish. Those are the main four things that I pick up. I haven't gotten a gym membership yet because I might be moving a half hour away from my current location, so I don't want to start any contracts. 

I now weigh about 180 pounds. I was at 185 a few weeks ago, but since Christmas, I stopped eating all fast food. I got rid of all chips, cookies, and junk foods in my house. Got rid of all the candy, and anything else that wasn't healthy. No pop, and i buy a 30 pack of water every time i go grocery shopping.  I lost 9lb's since Christmas when I weighed myself a few weeks ago. I think i'm about at 183 now. That's with no exercise. 

Basically what I'm looking for is some guidance. I think I'm eating well (especially when you compare me to my group of friends and how much junk food they eat) but I think I could be eating better. I'm not sure how much of something (like sodium) I should have in a day, and not sure what fruits are actually helping me and what aren't. I'll give my meals today as an example. 

I had to skip breakfast because I woke up late, but as soon as i got to work I heated up a microwave dinner of mac and cheese. http://www.michelinas.com/ProductByBrand_AT_10515_Macaroni_Cheese_2Authentico.aspx ....For a snack a little later, I had some sugar pees which I dip in veggie ranch dip. For lunch, I finished off my bag of sugar peas, along with a mango and a bottle of water. Now I would have had that mac and cheese to eat, but I polished that off because I didn't have my raisin bran for breakfast like I usually do. Now when I get home later, I'm going to fry up some chicken which i usually just season with chicken rub seasoning and some citrus seasoning. I'll have some more fruit and veggies, and then call it a day. 

The things I usually buy are grapefruits, Mangos, Kiwi's, red orange and green peppers, cucumbers, carrots, peas, mushrooms, chicken, salmon, some microwave dinners I use for sides in meals, cheese, tuna, pickles, bread, radishes, celery,peanut butter, etc. etc. 

So I guess my main question is this. Am I doing well? I know I'm not going to lose much more weight without exercising, but I just want to start eating healthy and taking care of my body. I know too many friends in their late 20's that are already getting super lazy and hobo'ish because they feel so crappy all the time from the crap they eat. I know the microwave dinners aren't the greatest, but I try not to have more than 1 a day because they are high in sodium. I eat fruits and veggies with every meal and I try to have healthy snacks. I still eat out maybe once a week, but its usually Jimmy Johns or Chipolte. One concern I have is the veggie dip. It's hard for me to eat certain veggies without anything to dip them in. I don't go crazy and scoop out half the container for one bite...but just enough to enhance the flavor of the vegetable. Is that completely defeating the purpose?

I do have some free time to cook on the weekdays, so i'll cook chicken and fish and put that in Tupperware to eat the next day at work. Im a beginner cook, so I've been seasoning all my chicken because I have marinated before, but would like to try it soon. I'm starting to get sick of that, so if any one can recommend some quick easy things I can cook and save for the upcoming days at work...I just need something I can throw into a lunch bag in the morning and go.

I'll have oatmeal and strawberries for breakfast.
Snack on granola and coconut water.
Bagel and hummus for lunch or Greek yogurt and blueberries.
Morning Star chick'n nuggets or soup for dinner.
I'll snack on cucumbers or spinach with dressing.
Sometimes I'll have Nurti-grain bars or Luna bars.

I drink water (sometimes with cucumber) and tea and coffee, too. 

I also am allergic to most fruits. I know, I know, a vegetarian that can't each most fruits... sigh. But I CAN eat strawberries, blueberries, grapes, and bananas.

I've been looking into buying Fish Oil supplements and/or a multivitamin with Iron and B12 but there are so many mixed reviews on whether or not the supplements are actually useful.  I don't want to spend the money on them (poor college student here!) if I'm just going to pee them out. Are they worth it?

Some background: I'm a 24 year old female who is in generally good health, until recently. I take a multivitamin and fish oil pills every day. In the past few months I have been getting very sick-I've never been the healthiest person, but I've had bronchitis, pneumonia, a kidney infection, a sinus infection, and several colds since September. I have had general workups and they found nothing medically wrong with me. A friend suggested that my diet (and lifestyle to some extent) could be the cause of these recent illnesses.

I realized that (except for a healthy breakfast) I tend to eat a lot of refined sugars. I am not overweight (5'3 120 lbs-gained ~5 lbs due to illness recently) and I do not have problems with tooth decay. I am active, running 3 miles most days before I got sick. I'm a graduate student with not a lot of time to eat or drink water, and I have sugar cravings that I usually give into. 

I have realized that I seem to be in a cycle where I eat a healthy breakfast, and then a ""meal bar"" with lots of sugar for lunch while I work. When I am hungry I will grab some candy, and then when it is time to eat a proper meal I'm not hungry anymore, so I don't eat.

I had previously realized my diet was not ideal and made steps to change it, but I figured that my size and general fitness meant that the diet was not causing me harm. Now I am thinking that I probably can't keep these habits for very long, and I should change them.

To start off, my stats: 21 year old white male, 5'8"", 120 lbs. My fathers side has a history of heart problems. My mom is short and thin, no one on her side of the family is overweight, and I have definitely inherited some of that crazy metabolism. I cannot gain weight even if I try. 

It would be a great understatement to say that I'm a picky eater. When it comes to food, if it grows out of the ground, I likely will not eat it. 
There are a few exceptions to this rule- I have been known to enjoy beans, rice, nuts, potatoes, and granola. Thats about all I can think of off the top of my head. As far as things I can put down, but don't enjoy... apples come to mind, thats about it. I have always felt weird about chewing 'plant matter', as silly as that sounds.

There are some fruits and veggies I can get down in their non-default form, for example, a blueberry bagel or split pea soup. I used to enjoy banana bread but as I've grown older, the flavor of banana does not jive so well with my taste buds. That being said, it is still bread, and I could still eat it if I really wanted to. Tomato sauce is great, I love pasta and pizza, but would never have a tomato on my burger. Some smoothies are doable. I used to eat a decent amount of strawberry yogurt, but now they include chunks of actual strawberries in it and it kind of ruins the texture for me. I know I need to open myself to eating these things, and I intend to. I'm including these examples so you might understand my tastes.
some frequent meals would be:

morning- english muffin with peanut butter, cereal, and an egg or two if I have time. Most juices are okay, but not with pulp. Orange juice is great, apple juice and cranberry blends are cool too. 

noon/night- chicken and rice, pb&amp;j, burgers, pizza, tacos/burritos, cold sandwiches, and occasionally some fish. All of these would be served 'plain'. 

I eat more sugar than I think most people would. I have often said my favorite food group is ice cream. I am not blind to my health though, and do make some conscious choices, like rarely (maybe once a month) drinking soda.

I used to take a multivitamin but I have strayed away since reading some arguments against them.

Anyways, I've finally had enough. I realize that I'm not supplying my body with the nutrients it needs and that that needs to change sooner rather than later. I've been trying to eat an apple a few times a week, I had some lettuce on half my roast beef sandwich the other day, and last night I tried a friends hummus. It was good, reminds me of beans, I could definitely do that! These examples are seriously the furthest I've pushed myself since I was probably 9 or 10 years old. Otherwise it has been, for the most part, meat/potatoes/dairy/bread all day every day.

If you guys could help me find some more new foods to try, or new ways to try them, I would appreciate it more than I can express.

I realize that taking children away from their parents can be emotionally and psychologically painful and harmful.

It can't be genetics alone unless the child has Prader-Willi syndrome or something.

Is it wrong for me to think this way? Is it too harsh? I mean, I guess there could be interventions for teaching both the child and parents how to eat healthy, instead of taking the child away.

My current diet has been very high carb (350g/day) with low fats (50g/day) and high in protein (200g/day), it's done me pretty well in terms of gaining muscle, along with some fat. 

My personal training is a body builder and wants to prep me for competitions later this year, and thusly laid out a new diet plan for me today. It confuses me a little because it's not exactly keto, and it's not exactly carb cycling so I'm not sure what to think. If you all could offer your opinions that would be awesome, the diet is as follows:


-2550 calories/day (with a 200 calorie lenience if I need to go to 2750)

-200g protein, 150g (healthy) fats, 100g carb maximum

This will be daily for two weeks and then carb refeed days will be added in (one every four days). He says that this diet will allow me to put on lean muscle while slowly decreasing bf %.

My first concern is that it appears that I will be eating at my TDEE, and thus not putting on muscle or losing fat. Secondly, I'm a bit concerned that 100g carbs is not low enough to put my body into ketosis, so basically I'll just be low energy and pigging out on fat.

Thanks a bundle in advance, and sorry for the wall of text.

**TL;DR** Trainer wants me to eat 100g carbs/day, 200g protein, 150g fats

Usually breakfast, lunch, and dinner have 1 serving paired with a tbsp of nut butter or some fruit. I sometimes have a 2nd serving with breakfast if I've already gotten a bunch of eggs or yogurt in me, or grab a bowl as an afternoon pre-run/bike/swim. It's pretty much my main starch source due to the fact that I'm a bit poor as a student from buying a ton of fresh veggies/fruit (I have IBS and inherited Diverticulitis-feel free to Google it. I don't just eat really healthy for my fitness needs) and good cuts of meat. I do throw in sweet potatoes every other day or so, but I'm totally against cooking them in the microwave and baking takes time. My oat obsession is essentially due to laziness/lack of time...more laziness. Oats fill me up and keep me going for a while. My problems/questions about this:

Is using it as a main carb source (other than the veggies and fruit, which is a very good portion of my diet, seeing as 3-4 servings is only maybe 1/5th of the calories I consume per day) a bad thing? Could you guys give me some other ideas as to what to replace it with? Rice never carries me like oatmeal does, even if the oats are eaten alone, quinoa is absolutely delicious but ridiculously expensive and there's the whole farmers issue, sweet potatoes = lots of time, I'm gluten intolerant as well so bread/pasta/etc. is out. Lastly, how...much better are steel cut oats than rolled oats? I cook both in a slow cooker, so time isn't an issue. It's money. I can buy 120 servings (Costco massive box) for $6, or I can buy 1 tin of steel cut oats that has 15 servings for $6-7 where I can find it. I just...I can't...I don't...someone please explain if the steel cut (I soak them and such as well) is really that much better to spend pretty much 10x as much. Thanks all of you in advance!

I'm a 27 year old male full time college student, and part time metal fabricator. I've been exposed to plenty of caustic chemicals working with metal and working around racecars for most of my life. I've had a handful of concussions but don't have any apparent damage.  I'm slightly hypothyroid, but take thyroid replacement. Besides that I'm an active healthy individual. I'm concerned about this alcohol issue because I'm not entirely sold on the IBS diagnoses, and I'm a fairly quiet guy struggling to maintain a social life since most social activities apparently involve having at least a drink or two. I have zero interest in binge drinking, I just want to be able to have a drink or two with friends or on a date. 

I've had a colonoscopy, urine tests, stool tests, and blood work. The only abnormal things are slightly elevated bilirubin levels, and traces of mucus and protein in my urine. All other liver functions are within range. No obvious flags.

Has anyone had a similar problem? Is anyone out there very knowledgeable about alcohol metabolism? Can you point me in the right direction?

**tl;dr** Alcohol completely debilitates me and nobody can explain why. If you think you might have an idea please read the long version.

Well, that's easier said than done. Most of the books I have found on the subject are either way out of date and/or overly simplified (most kids textbooks), full of fads and woo (most mainstream diet/nutrition books), or just far too advanced for his grade level. And while I found lots of books about cooking *for* your kids, I couldn't find anything that really talks about cooking *with* your kids or teaching your kids about the science behind cooking. I do have Alton Brown's *I'm Just Here for the Food,* which isn't aimed at kids but explains many of the concepts in ways that he could probably understand with some help. Beyond that I've got nothing except my own knowledge, which is rather general.

Part of the problem is that I don't want anything with an agenda. While I do personally believe in a lot of the organic/free-range/local/low-grain movements floating around, I think a person needs a strong basis in established scientific facts before they start trying to wade through the various claims made by these camps.

When it finally came out that she had an ED, we found out she was restricting her diet (to the point that she ate no fats or carbs) and working out every last calorie that she ate.

For the sake of discussion, assume long-term use, black coffee with no sugar, and a common caffeinated soda like Coke.


**EDIT**: Here is my friend's counter-argument:

""Look up both Diterpenes and kahweol, both of which are present in caffeine, and are also present in coffee itself even after decaffenated. Those two chemicals are quite a laundry list of bad for you.

""Coffee's most commonly discussed and proven bad is the damage it does to blood vessels and cholesterol as well. It thins blood vessels while the cholesterol levels can clog them.  It also can discolor them.   It is a factor in a host of pulmonary disorders, that its benefit of lowering heart disease can hardly offset.

""I leave out all the caffeine things, because caffeine can be removed from soda and coffee alike.

""More importantly, is coffee is an inhibitor of calcium, it is generally forbidden to those with osteoporosis, and is known to be a risk factor for getting it.  This is doubly true with heavy coffee consumption (defined as 600 ml or more a day).

""The problem is, as with the red wine myths, people spread the talk about its 'good' effects, mostly in the form of anti oxidants, and ignore the bad.   So while soda is certainly without many good effects (though my cherry 7-up has antioxidants too), its list of bad is far less severe. As is the case with wine, the benefits of such can be gotten wholly from other means (red grapes or grapejuice for the wine, chocolate for the coffee) without adding the slue of risk factors.

And I'm wondering why?

I'm not picky about having a lot of variety in my diet, so what I eat over the course of a day is almost always some combination of ~80% of the following ingredients:

For a bit further information: I usually eat breakfast, and then have 2 small dinners, one right after work and another several hours later, so the Clif Bar essentially bisects the 8-9 hours I spend at work rather than lasting me until a traditional dinnertime. Also, the Clif Bar would be my main intake of soy, since everything else tends to be normal food (meat, milk, veg, bread, cheese, rice ... you get the picture).

**Edit:** After reading some of the links that RecycWater provided, it looks like I'm in the clear for a Clif Bar a day.

I'm interested in starting a cut next week when I return from spring break

A little backstory. I got a knee injury in January and was expecting a quick recovery which hasn't happened. So while I'm still recovering I though I would cut some weight while I can't lift legs. 

I currently do 5/3/1 with core days instead of leg days. I also have ROTC training every day 

I currently weigh 185 lbs.

I really have a couple of questions about cutting. 
1) what is an ideal macro ratio. I've heard a lot of different things from like 5% carbs to a balanced 40p/30f/30c. I was aiming for a 50p/30c/20f. Would this be a good ratio? I think it would be good to have a good amount of carbs for ROTC training

2) what are some good foods for cutting. I'm assuming a lot of veggies but what about protein and fat sources?

3) is there a website or another source for good recipes and foods for cutting?

That's all I have for now.

Problems could be either short term or long term, health related, fitness/performance related, or anything really. I've got my own ideas, but it would be nice to get some collective thoughts from others.


Assume total calorie intake is maintenance (i.e. no risk of getting fat).

By 'healthy' diet [I think] I mean enough essential nutrients to survive, plus a good amount of additional beneficial nutrients (whatever those are).

For junk food I might eat a pizza once a week, a tub of ice cream, a few chocolate bars, Nutella, a few other sugary things, more Nutella. Maybe 300-500+ kcal of junk food a day.


It seems to be very difficult to interpret claims about negative affects of junk ingredients, due to their consumption being mostly correlated with obesity/lack of lean mass etc...


Specific things I'm interested in:

* Is there any evidence to suggest that 'processed' carbs are bad if you're not fat?

* Same question about trans fat?

* How about PUFAs? From some controlled studies on mice and rats it seems like they could cause inflammation/cancer/liver disease etc... but mostly observational studies on humans show positive effects on cardiovascular health.

* Salt? Given that hypertension seems like a significant risk factor for death, as long as I monitor my blood pressure and it's ok, that means I don't need to worry about it?


Overall, is it even worth worrying about? And if the addition of junk food really is bad, what 'junk' ingredients are the most important (in your opinion) to remove from the diet?

Basically my question is whether it's worth it to test all my nutritional levels (b6,folate, mercury, b12, vitamin D, glutamine etc etc)

And can a gluten sensitivity really cause like major suicidal depression?

I've tested mitral valve prolapse, thyroid, B6 by itself, B12 by itself, folate by itself, and all my blood work is fine.

From my own experience, along with suggested values from various online calculators, my maintenance daily calorie intake is somewhere around 2,400 kCal. 

To gain weight, I have been eating around 3,000 kCal per day, which I split up to something like 300 g carbs, 160 g protien, 100 g fats. I try to get most of my protein from lean beef, chicken, peanut butter, etc. Most of my fats come from nuts, nut butters, and olive oil. Most of my carbs come from whole grain rice and pastas, and a lot of vegetables.

My question is about my sugar intake. I don't eat candy, snacks, etc and I don't drink soda. However, to hit a lot of my micronutrient targets (vitamins, minerals, etc), I try to eat a lot of fruit, either fresh fruit or those canned fruit mixes. This adds up to around 60 to 70 grams of sugar per day.

Now that is 60 to 70 grams of carbs, on top of the 300 I usually get from the things I listed earlier, but I am not really concerned regarding the weight gain, since I seem to have that under control. I am just not sure if having that much sugar on a regular basis is bad for other parts of my health. Does the source of the sugar matter?

The thing is in high school I ate unhealthy food a lot...I ate out often and ate fast food at least 3 times a week.

So I start college and stop eating fast food (I literally never eat fast food anymore...havent had a burger since i can remember). I become super stressed out and don't eat much because I lose my appetite. Two years later I only weigh 101 pounds...just two pounds away from being extremely underweight according to the BMI. I don't look anorexic but I'm not happy with my body and being so underweight.

I have been eating more for the past 5 months (by eating healthy) and drinking protein shakes that are meant to help with weight gain (not religiously cause they kind of make me want to throw up they're so gross and sweet) but I actually ended up LOSING 5-ish pounds instead of gaining...though my boobs did get bigger (idk wtf...)

Right now I want to cry because I just got back from the doctor and was expecting I would be at least 105 but instead I'm 101 and I feel hideous.

I don't work out though my boyfriend says I should because it may help me get more of an appetite but running makes me feel sick and makes my lungs hurt and I hate it...and running actually makes me lose my appetite as well

Anyways now I'm considering seeing a professional, a dietitian, to help me and make me a weight gain program to follow. Has anyone here gone to a dietitian before? If so do you recommend it? Also is it expensive? I'm starting a doctorate program this fall and I will be living off of $300 a month so I don't want to spend too much money on it.

EDIT: If anyone has any tips on how I can gain weight (such as what to eat...how often to eat...an exercises that would help) please share! :)

EDIT EDIT: Here's what I ate yesterday 


morning- one egg over easy with whole grain bread and half a glass of orange juice

lunch- one piece of liver, a croissant, and one pita pocket filled with chicken salad

snacks- a bar of chocolate, half a bottle of ensure, three handfuls of almonds, a serving of strawberries, half a protein bar, and another pita pocket filled with chicken salad

dinner- one bok choy, one potato, and some red snapper

snack- two buttermilk waffles with butter and half a glass of milk, a handful of baby tomatoes 

Anyways this is actually a little less than what I usually eat as I would usually have had a pasta dish somewhere in there but lacked an appetite because I was sad about the weight loss

I'm not trying to gain muscle or lose weight.

The second inspiration is more personal development and experience.

I'm 6'5 236. This past summer I have  lost a little over 30 pounds, and the majority have dropped off since I fixed my diet. I lift and run everyday and I don't want to lose too much muscle mass, but I want to lose fat as quickly as possible. I try to loose around 1-1.3% bodyfat a week or somewhere around 2-3 pounds. 

My TDEE is somewhere around 4000-4500, and I try to eat somewhere around 2000-2500, I know this would lead to my burning more than 3lbs/week. But considering drinking calories which I don't plan for and days when I overeat closer to 3000 or 3500 I think I'm pretty close to being on point. I weigh in every week on monday before my lift, and except for today's weigh in, I've never dropped more than 3lbs in a week.

I really only eat 6 different meals though (I know this is probably not too good, Sort of where I'm looking for criticism)

Veggie Omelette - Frozen Vegetables and 1 full egg and 2 egg whites, heated in a pan with nonsalt seasoning.

Chicken/Turkey and Hot Sauce- Deli Lunchmeat and Buffalo Hot sauce that has very few calories (Says 0 but probably 3-5)

Plain Greek Yogurt and Cinnamon

Smoothies (1-2 Scoops of Whey each scoop is 150Kcal and 25 grams protein, 8 Oz 1% fat milk, Plain Greek Yogurt, Bananas if I can afford them)

Balance Bars (&gt;30 glycemic Index, 200 Kcal, 15 grams of protein, Good amount of fat but mostly unsaturated, Taste real good and are cheap, Maybe not the best healthiest thing in the world but they taste good enough to prevent cheating with anything unhealthier as the day goes on.

Seafood and cooked Carrots- What my mom cooks to help me be healthy whenever I come home, have maybe once a week.

I eat some snacks, Granola, Bananas, Apples, and Strawberries mostly. 

Most of my weight gain probably came from drinking, so I've cut drinking down to 1-2 days/week and only vodka with diet lemonade to mix.

So I live with my boyfriend and his mother, and we're in the process of getting jobs (I have a guaranteed one, I just have to wait about a month or so) so his mom buys food for everyone. However, she doesn't manage money too well, and when she goes grocery shopping everything is as cheap as she can buy and mostly goes in the freezer. Since she's dieting, her food is relatively healthy, but it's for her and we can't eat it. Any veggies she buys is for a specific dinner she plans on making later that week, and any fruits usually go to her lunch. 

We've been perfectly fine with it for a while now, until I realized that I feel like shit every single day, and so does my boyfriend. We don't have health problems, and we should exercise more, but I know a lot of it stems from our eating habits, so we're trying our best to change it. I have zero problem eating healthier, and he feels the same way, but how can we? Neither of us have money or a lot control over what gets bought.

That saga ended with me blacking out, and started to eat normally again, which was great!

Unfortunately anxiety is a vicious beast and when left alone will grow large again and attempt to consume your life, for some reason my ""safety foods"" this time have been reduced to pizza (from a local pizza chain near work only) and spinach (in pretty much any form, but usually I just eat creamed spinach or spinach pie). I suppose I'm not in totally awful shape for all this being the case, I can occasionally force myself to try steak or something if someone else has cooked it, but this is about as bad as it's been since the rice chex situation.

I never really fully recovered from that and am sitting at 5'7"" weight between 115-120lbs depending on the day. I need to start adding foods to my diet (or back to my diet) and I come from a foodie family, and I'm a great cook! So in theory this should be easy.... But I've sunken so far into my anxiety that my ability to be creative has been fairly decimated...

I worked out a concept for what I want to have tomorrow (Going to do a baked mac and cheese w/ Broccoli, garlic cloves, and some onion, maybe hardboiled eggs or baked eggs as well) but I'm lacking ... well another 2 meals. My caloric intake lately has only been about 1000 a day (should be at least 1,500.) and my vitamin intake has been fairly atrocious (although the spinach has kept me alive I suppose)

I really need some help/direction with this and wanted to come to you guys, my ""trouble"" foods are nuts (allergic to all sorts of nuts, part of the source of my food anxieties), avacados (I know, I wish I could eat them but I have a panic attack every time I try, despite how healthy they are), chicken (which is extra weird because turkey is fine, and chicken eggs are fine), and rice (don't ask me why, it's an anxiety thing, if it were simple I wouldn't be here right now).

**TL:DR** I have anxiety that prevents me from eating normally, I've been in and out of it and I'm in my worst relapse in a few years. I'm looking for some general meal plan that I could follow on a daily/weekly basis for a ""worst case scenario"" anxiety situation that doesn't leave me slowly deteriorating day by day.

I had a j-pouch constructed out of my small intestine, and as a result have many dietary restrictions. I have been committed to fitness and a healthy lifestyle for about 6 months now. 

I lost 100 pounds (from 270-170) through food tracking (myfitnesspal) and cardio (couch to 5k). I started lifting weights and shifted my diet 6 weeks ago. I went from 1800 calories to 2600+, gaining 20 pounds of muscle in 3 weeks. 

At first, my focus was on protein. I have recently decided that it was time to get all of my other macros in line as well. 

Due to my medical condition, I cannot eat raw vegetables, nuts, dried fruits, and the list goes on. Basically, I need to avoid high fiber foods (including fruit and vegetable skins). 

 I recently got a vitamix, and am now able to incorporate vegetables and fruits that were impossible before. So today was my first day to commit to a diet of meat and smoothies.

Sooo....I am looking for lean gains. I would like to maximize my muscle gains while maintaining or losing fat. (Weird, right?)  

I would definitely say that aesthetics are my main objective.

This lasts for 2 hrs and, when I figured I was done, I went to breakfast with my family. Not so lucky. I had more diarrhea throughout the day. We got back to the condo where I had fever, chills, and more diarrhea. I thought it was the 24 hr stomach bug, and went to bed. The next day, I figured it was all over, assuming it to be the bug, but had more diarrhea, this time without fever. I went through the whole day like this. Today is the third frustrating day full of diarrhea. But today, it was different. This morning, it looked a bit like army green tar. I took some immodium, figuring it would eradicate it and give my poor, wiped-raw behind a break (not to mention my dry hands from constant washing). But mere minutes later, I had more, and this time, it was more watery. It began to look more like fish eggs, and finally, it appeared that it was oatmeal with various spices in it. It was very watery. It smells like mulch. I've been through 4-5 17 fl. oz. bottles of water throughout these past 3 days, among other fluids, such as sodas and hawaiian punch. But even with all this water, I'm constantly thirsty and my skin and lips are very dry.

Am I doing anything wrong, and is there anything I can do to make my poop solid again, and less frequent? My theory is that I'm not digesting my food properly. If it is at all useful information, my urine is like water as well.

Also, I'm eating regularly, and other than fatigue, watery stool, and little appetite, I feel fine.

**Edit:** I did not have any trouble today with it. I stopped drinking the water and drank Powerade to keep me hydrated. It certainly helped. The only trouble today was severe gas, but I had fun with that in the public restroom. I love making unladylike noises in the ladies' room.

____________________________

Thanks for reading this.

My brother has been applying for an NHS funded Dietician's course for 3 years running. He is an excellent candidate, and is extremely passionate and proactive about this subject. He has read dozens of books, work-shadowed three very busy dieticians, found a job in the care industry (to aid his application) and has generally dedicated himself to this career for several years. We are from a large low-income family, and an NHS funded course is the only viable option for him.

He has just been offered an interview at the University of Chester, which is fantastic news. I just wondered if there was any UK dieticians who would be willing to potentially answer any questions he has about the interview process and how best to prepare. (by email, or whatever is most convenient for you.)

He is absolutely dedicated to this vocation, and I would be so grateful if there was anyone out there who may be willing to help!

Thanking you in advance

* Meat is mostly turkey and chicken. I'm not a huge fan of seafood and I can't cook it well enough to eat it regularly.

* All wheat/oat/grain is whole - bread, pasta, cereal, etc I make sure to read the labels for all whole wheat (none of that some whole wheat, mostly bleached wheat crap)

* Dairy is cheese and that's about it. I admittedly probably eat more cheese than I should

* I read labels but I'm not fully sure what I'm looking for; tips in this area would be much appreciated. I avoid HFCS and fake sugars and basically anything that has what I think is too many ingredients

* I would love some tips on eating more veggies! I'm not a big fan of them but I know I don't eat nearly as many as I should as often as I should

* Fruits I also need to increase but not as much as veggies. I juice occasionally but not as much as I used to

* Fast food is limited to Jimmy John's and the like and I only average about 3x a month.

If you're unsure of what that is, to summarize it greatly, it means that Muslims fast for 29 or 30 days in a row, and do not eat from dusk until sun set, this includes no drinking of water, basically no ingesting anything.

I'm in the UK so at the moment that means I start fasting at 3:30ish a.m. and I can start eating again at 9:25 p.m.

It's nearly 18 hours without food and I want to be sure I'm eating as well as I can in the times that I can eat. As I'm a fairly fit person and train in MMA throughout the rest of the year, I still will be going to the gym, but this will be at night time after a meal, so I'd like to cross check with you guys to make sure I'm sort of aiming for the right stuff.


This morning I woke up at 2:50 a.m. so I could have breakfast, and I will be aiming for this type of thing every morning. I had 

- one and a have pints of water (ideally I'd go for 1 litre minimum but I just can't down that much in the morning with food), 

- some spaghetti with mince meat (left over dinner from the night, so this won't be a regular thing

- a nice dose of porridge with a some honey to sweeten it and a truck load of peanut butter (it's beautiful with porridge)

 - a smaller dose of all bran with raisins (and some peanut butter)


In the night ( 9:30 p.m.)  I am planning to break the fast with a pint of water and some dates. Then after a little rest I will have some more porridge with peanut butter around 45 minutes before I go to the gym. I will have a strong black coffee around 20 minutes before the gym and I will take a nice large protein shake with me to sip mainly after the workout (like I normally do after workouts)

( I will be drinking around 1 - 2 litres of water during the workout itself )

I will then come home at around 11:30 I'd imagine, have some stirfry veg and a portion of fish and then go to bed.

Tomorrow morning I am again going to try and have the same but include a protein shake in there as well.


Would you experts please let me know if I'm eating the best I can in the time frame given? I'm aiming for the low G.I. foods and also foods low on the ""Insulin Index"" as well which is similar to G.I., bascially foods that help you sustain energy. Am I heading down the right path here? I'm having lots of peanut butter because it's high in calories and I want it to sustain me, will I get fat from this?

He can't have tomatoes or onions, because they give him indigestion. He just started taking fiber (metamucil) and he says it's helping. I suggested he try chia seeds and flax instead, we'll see how that goes. I also told him he needs more EFAs, but fish oil pills upset his stomach as well.

Although I recently made a few modifications.

Also, is there a way to directly share the CRON-o-Meter page?

---

**Breakfast ~7:00am [dairy]**:

Banana smoothie with milk, nutritional yeast and sugar. I use the equivalent of 2 cups of milk, but since is dried milk (for easier storage and shelf life purposes), I can use any amount of milk per glass of smoothie.

Then a fried egg with 2 slices of bread. I also tried using a raw egg in the smoothie, but someone here reminded me that cooked egg proteins are more bioavailable, so I'm frying it now when I have time, but if I'm in a hurry I just pour the raw egg into the smoothie.

*650cal*

---

**Brunch ~11:00am [nuts and seeds]**: 

Peanuts, sunflower seeds and raisins. I'm usually in between classes, or studying at the time, so it has to be something easy to eat.

I'm also thinking on making peanut butter and sunflower butter and make snack bars with oats. It would be easier to eat and digest.

*300cal*

---

**Lunch ~2:30pm [vegetables]**: 

Roughly equal amount (100g/3.5oz) of spinach, broccoli, beet greens, beets and sweet potato. I can bulk boil beets and sweet potato together, and microwave broccoli and beet greens when I need to. I usually eat spinach raw.

Also, lentils as a side dish, made with the water from the beets and sweet potatoes. The uncooked lentils weight is 50g/1.75oz

I'm still experimenting combinations and dressings to find the tastiest way of eating it all. 

The 1tbsp of oil is all spent here boiling the lentils and dressing the salad. 

*550cal*, mostly from the lentils and oil

---

**Merienda ~5:00pm [fruits]**: 

A fruit, or many fruits, in this case a mandarin, but whatever is in season.

*80 cal*

---

**Dinner ~10:00pm**: 

Whatever I want, I have 700 calories left! Or I can leave my body take care of it with its lipids reserves! I have all nutrients needs fulfilled after all. I could lose 77g of weight each day if I wanted, although I don't really need to.

I sometimes add homemade caramelized popcorn here, to watch a movie or something. It's roughly 400cal with 50g of kernels, and it's also full of micronutrients.

Since I'm not actually a vegetarian, I'm a pescetarian, I could add fish here. But fish is expensive and ultimately unnecessary for my everyday diet. Although the omega-3 would be nice.

----

**Sport:**

I'm most of the day studying, or in the computer. I just bike to college ~25 blocks everyday. Although I might start going to swim in a few weeks. Do I have to increase the minimum protein intake?

---

My only concern is vitamin D, by european and most of the world standard, the recommended is 600IU. And I don't get much direct sunlight through the day. I'm thinking of getting a supplement.

And I think with milk and the egg I'll be fine with B12.

&gt;It has been estimated that people in the Paleolithic era consumed 11,000 mg of potassium and 700 mg of sodium daily.

Basically I keep seeing over and over that the recommendation is to have more potassium than sodium intake in your diet. I also came across salt substitutes like [this from morton's](http://www.mortonsalt.com/for-your-home/culinary-salts/food-salts/5/morton-salt-substitute/) that contain no sodium and 610mg of potassium per serving. I had never heard of salt substitutes before tonight but one article I came across while googling suggested mixing 3 parts potassium(the salt substitute) to one part table salt and using that instead of regular salt for seasoning. I guess the salt substitute on it's own can taste metallic to some people but most can't tell the difference if you mix in some regular table salt. 

Any thoughts on whether mixing salt substitute with table salt to use as a seasoning would be a good idea to help with the overall sodium to potassium ratio in our diets?

Any thoughts on the potassium to salt ratio as it relates to optimal health? 

To me it seems similar to the omega 3 omega 6 ratio in the modern diet and if people are using fish oil or flax oil to help improve that ratio wouldn't it also make sense to do something like this with potassium?

I'm just curious why it's told to me that all this stuff is unhealthy yet as far as anyone can tell I'm doing fine.

edit: I kinda figured genetics somehow played a role.  I don't know anyone my age who can be quite so...liberal with what they eat so I guess I was always a little weirded out.  I'm curious, if I went and got some bloodwork done up or something, would that have all sorts of scary stuff in it or might that look normal too?

Breakfast - Kale Shake

* ~2 kale leaves (stem and all)

* handful of parsely and cilantro

* orange juice

* banana or cranberries

I drink one or two of these every morning.

For lunch I usually eat a turkey sandwich or something similar (no cheese or lowfat cheese and no mayo) and if I'm still hungry I'll have an apple or banana.

Then I go to bjj for about a 2 hour class / workout.

Dinner - Protein Shake

* 1 scoop Elite Gourmet Whey / Casein blend

* about a cup of soy milk

* banana and/or strawberries

* big teaspoonful of ground flax seeds


This is when I take my creatine (GNC amplified creatine 189) and fish oil capsules. 

If I'm still hungry after this I usually make myself another kale shake.

Up until this year, I've always had some sort of meal plan at my grade school/jr. high/high school/university so I've been able to grab food regularly during the day. Now that I don't have a meal plan, I can't really afford to eat on campus. I still live at home, but my dad and his GF are both cab drivers and are rarely home when I am, so we don't eat family meals. This means that I'm on my own basically 100% of the time.

I work on campus, so I'm there from about 9am until 5pm on weekdays. I don't have access to a refrigerator during that time and I don't own a lunch box so basically...I haven't been eating. Which sucks. I'm also a slave to the snooze button, so I rarely eat breakfast. Also terrible, I know.

I have no weight loss goals; I just want to eat healthy, so my main questions are these:

* What can I eat for breakfast that requires next to no prep/eating time?
* Is there a cheap, light lunchbox out there that will keep things cold *and* fit in my already-stuffed backpack?
* What types of things should I be packing in my lunch?
* How can I do this as cheaply as possible?

A friend of mine suggested that I pre-cook a weeks worth of meals during the weekend and then take them out one day at a time. He suggested a portion of meat, a portion of good carbs, and the rest fruits/veggies (heavy on the greens). This sounds great, but I don't know the difference between a ""good carb"" and a ""bad carb,"" let alone how to cook anything. Suggestions? Help?

**TL;DR-** I need to pack lunches for while I'm at school/work (9-5), and I don't know how. I don't have access to a refrigerator during this time, nor do I own a lunch box.

I have a lot of questions and I don't really know where to start... so I'm just going to kinda dump my thoughts and questions here.

My knowledge of nutrition is pretty limited and I've never really followed any standards in my life besides ""don't eat a lot of junk or fast food"" and ""eat a lot of fruits and vegetables.""

Some people have the talent of estimating what nutrition is in what food just by looking at it, for example, looking at a slab of beef and being able to get a rough idea of how much protein is in it, or looking at a glass of milk and estimating how much calcium is in it. I would like to know how to do that.

Also, what about daily nutrition? I don't know any numbers like, how much protein should I have a day? In fact, what vital nutrition should I look out for i.e. calcium, vitamin C, or whatever. I have no idea what to look for and how much I should have of what.

Being a college student, I've been trying to get into cooking more to save money and eat healthier, so I do have more control over what I eat. If you guys have any recommendations for recipes or ingredients I'm open to that as well.

Along with eating well, I'm starting to work out on a consistent schedule, not really to become some amazing bulging body builder, but just to stay in shape and to actually gain weight. Being asian, I have a smaller body type and I only weigh 125 pounds. I actually struggle to gain and maintain weight rather than losing it, but when I work out it seems to actually help me put on a few pounds easier than when I'm not. Being on the lower weight side of things, a lot of times I have a lack of energy, so I'm hoping that changing my living habits will change this issue.

Also, I'm interested in the idea of a meal replacement shake for lunch, but I don't know what type or brand would be appropriate if I am trying to lose weight and not necessarily gain muscle. What would be a good choice to try out?

Is there anything else necessary for having a ""good"" diet? If your getting all of the vitamins/minerals etc that you need, and are burning fat or sugars, then are you on a healthy diet?

In theory, could someone simply fast while taking water and vitamins, and be healthy?

I've read many summaries of scientific articles like the china study and similar things that shed light on many of the popular misconceptions like the lipid hypothesis.

I have heard a few acquaintances and just recently my roommate removing sugar from their diets which from what I can deduce seems both superfluous and ineffective.

Superfluous because removing sugar is going to limit the options for what they can eat massively especially when not at home with snacks and eating out which I've experienced when I was a vegetarian and the annoying hunger and lack of options was one of the things that made me hate being veg.

That wouldn't be so bad of course, limiting your snacking and indulgence, if sugar was actually anywhere near the worst thing you could eat. Sugar has a GI of 65 which is simply medium.
Sure there is some fructose and that can risk diabetes but MOST cereals, MOST breads, MOST anything grainy has a GI much higher than table sugar.

So when you are out an about and you get your nice black coffee with a ""nice heathly"" ham and cheese on rye with a GI of 55-70 is it really that much more helpful.

I suppose just writing this I can guess that there are many types of people this could help, like soda addicts and latte people. People who snack on candies and chocolate on a regular basis. 

But still I think that removing GRAINS or more practically reducing grains would be a more effective method of managing carbohydrate intake which we can all agree is something that is important to anyone's diet.\

1375907676.0,7,self.nutrition,1jwpdq,Health Effects of Veganism (x/post /r/vegan),satt-,14,7,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1jwpdq/health_effects_of_veganism_xpost_rvegan/,"Let me preface with this: when I started being vegan a year and a half ago, I wasn't in the greatest state of mind. I had an eating disorder, and while I did see the positives of a vegan diet (I had been a vegetarian for about six years already), part of me wanted to go vegan also as a way to cut out foods so that I could lose weight.

I am in a much healthier place now. My eating and exercise in check, but now I am contemplating my decision to go vegan. I understand it from an ethical point of view, but I am also worried about my own health.

I am an athlete--I run pretty much daily, and do some strength exercises as well. I know that there are vegan athletes out there--Scott Jurek, for one--and that they do well on a vegan diet. But, I have also read up on other diets (Paleo, Keto, etc.),  and it seems to me that a low carb diet is very successful for some people. However, it is also very difficult to maintain a low carb vegan diet. In an omnivorous diet, grains can be replaced with meat protein. In a vegan diet, it is much harder to find a non-carbohydrate-based protein source. There are legumes, beans, chickpeas, quinoa, etc., but most of these do contain carbohydrates. Now, I believe that the rationale for not including carbohydrates is that it has a lower ""thermic"" effect than protein does, meaning that it increases your metabolism. Also, the paleo diet claims that legumes and whole grains contain large amounts of ""antinutrients"". This sounds like a load of bullshit to me, but I am also afraid that I have fallen prey of vegan propaganda. 

I have tried to lower my consumption of carbohydrates, but I do not know if this is really necessary. Do I really need to cut own my morning oatmeal because it spikes my blood sugar? 

I disagree with the treatment of animals and the way they are killed. My reason for keeping to a vegan diet is that there is no reason in modern times, in developed countries, for us to be killing and consuming animals. We simply don't need to eat animals to live anymore, we aren't hunters.

But my concern at this moment is my own health. Yes, it is selfish of me, but I only have one life to live, and I want to make sure I can live the best life I can. 

What I am thinking of adding back to my diet is seafood, poultry, and eggs. Keep in mind that I said THINKING OF, not WILL BE. Please don't attack me for my thoughts here--I thought it would be good to voice how I am feeling and see how others feel about it. I still have a bad taste in my mouth whenever I think about eating animals again. But I am worried about my long-term health. I want to make sure I am fueling my body with adequate protein and other nutrients. I know that there is no perfect diet, and I know that veganism is not just a diet, but a lifestyle, and I do not want to make a lifestyle change without being fully informed. 

Are whole grains, rice, potatoes, carbs, etc. really the demons that the Paleo diet makes them out to be? 

If you've taken the time to read and respond to this in a mature manner, then thank you. I want to be sure that I am feeding my body something because it is good for it, not because of a lifestyle choice I made while in a bad place.

He is also extremely picky, which I think is also part of the problem.

He's very thin, works a physically demanding job and is on his feet all day.

I've been trying to get him to eat breakfast, but he complains that it just makes him more hungry. He will sometimes have a Stonyfield yogurt smoothie-in-a-bottle thing (it's the only kind of 'yogurt' he will eat). I've tried to explain that drinking one of those has as much (or more) sugar than a candy bar, but he brushes me off (he also sometimes just have a candy bar for breakfast). 

He usually goes out for lunch and will get food from a fast-food restaurant (usually Wendys, which he claims is better for him than McDonalds, which it may or may not be, but is still terrible), pizza, or a sandwich from a deli (or made at home), meat+mayo only, no veggies. Occasionally he will get food from a buffet, and will get steamed veggies, but this is not often. Probably only a few times a month.

For dinner, usually takeout/pizza/dumplings. Again, not many veggies. If I am cooking for him, I usually make some sort of pan-fried chicken/pork (our oven is broken or I'd bake it) mashed potatoes, and cauliflower. Last night he had 4 hot dogs for dinner, nothing else. 

His opinion on the vegetables and other 'lite foods' is that they dont' fill him up, so why bother. Even if he does have veggies on his plage, he'll eat everything else before he touches them, and will only then have a few bites, until he's 'too full' to eat any more. I really think he only eats to feel full.

He is also very picky, which makes it hard for me to try introducing new foods to him. He'll eat apples and baby carrots if I tell him to, but that's pretty much it. He doesn't really like pasta or any kind of pasta sauce, except vodka sauce, and only sometimes. The only veggies I've seen him eat are string beans, carrots, cauliflower and broccoli. Nothing with lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms (except chicken marsala, and mushroom dumplings his mother makes, which I dont' understand), no Mexican or Indian (even if it's not spicy). There are a tons other things, but these are the big ones.

I also dont' think he drinks enough water, and is very dehydrated. He thinks drinking during meals is bad, so will only drink a few sips of water after he eats. 

He gets very tired early at night, and often has headaches. He also has bad acne. I've told him that eating well would probably alleviate, (if not fix) most of those problems, but he doesn't listen. I've tried a billion ways to make him understand that how he's eating is a problem, but it's hard to make him see it that way. He even said that his grandfather was a 'meat-a-tarian' and was healthy all his life, and only had a double bypass surgery because of 'smoking'. Right.

What do I do? I really care about him a lot and I can see myself with him for a long time. I just want him to be healthy. I'm at my wit's end here, and have run out of ideas. I don't live with him, which also makes it harder for me to cook for him.

1365704685.0,9,self.nutrition,1c5fao,Critique my breakfast shake recipe please,jocq,13,4,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1c5fao/critique_my_breakfast_shake_recipe_please/,"For breakfast I've been having two omega enhanced eggs fried in a little coconut oil along with a yogurt and berry shake. I'm just looking for ideas on how I might improve the shake.

Here's the recipe I use, which I split between my wife and I: http://i.imgur.com/7VYBDHZ.png

My concern is that it's a little high in carbs. The banana adds a lot, I thought about putting 2 bananas in but don't want the extra calories. The agave I'd like to cut too but it does taste a bit bland without it. I can handle it but my wife is not as keen on it with no sweetener. Also, I feel like the yogurt is healthy and provides a lot of protein but it's also kinda high-cal.

I'm trying to lose about 40 lbs and I'm aiming for around 2000 calories a day. I'm 32M, 6'0"", currently 225 (238 less than a month ago). I come close but most days I hit more like 2200-2400. I'm still dropping weight at this amount, 13 lbs in barely a month actually, but I think the rate's high as I just made big diet changes, started an eca stack, and upped my exercise consistency all at the same time a few weeks ago.

Also, my recipe used to be half the yogurt and half the fruit and grape juice instead of milk. This was 100 calories less but also half the protein. So far I find I go well over on fat in a day (100g+) and don't get quite as much protein as I'd like (~125g). I also go over on carbs but that's still between 125-200 g a day so it's not like a huge amount. I'm trying to keep carbs low, but not keto low, so I'm ok with getting more cals from fat as long as I hit my calorie goals. My fat sources are usually fish, olive oil, deli meat at lunch, milk, nuts but very much in moderation because it's so easy to blow my calorie goal by eating too many nuts - so I think good sources of fat overall.

**EDIT** Here's a revised recipe I think I might try: http://i.imgur.com/xDl7AHn.png

It subs coconut water for milk or juice to thin the mix with lower calories and more potassium. Drop the banana. Switch greek yogurt instead of plain for lower carbs and higher protein. Stevia instead of agave. And protein powder as an addition. Cocoa powder too for the micronutrients, more potassium etc, flavor too.

Comes out 50 calories less, half the carbs, double the protein.",,False,self,t5_2qoox,1365719310.0,,,True,t3_1c5fao,http://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1c5fao/critique_my_breakfast_shake_recipe_please/,

You do not have access to how much of each ingredient is used in the NSA Fruit Mix, but I would like to share with you some of the sweeteners that we use in this product. Splenda = 0 carbs = 0 calories, Erythritol = 1 carb = 0.20 calories, Sorbitol 1 carb = 2.6 calories, and (Sugar = 1 carb = 4 calories) that is why your carb count to calorie count does not match. These carbs are absorbed much slower and differently and do not cause peaks in blood sugar like regular carbs. I hope this answers your question about the 70 calorie Smoothie.

Advice requested :),lizaoreo,9,0,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1b7esq/meatmilk_digestion_issues_advice_requested/,"I have been having issues with my stomach and digestion since I turned 25 in December of 2011.  Nausea, vomiting, cramping, diarrhea, constipation, etc...  Just all over the place.  It didn't take long after it started for me to isolate and eliminate things that were obvious triggers, fried food and heavier meats like steak.  I went to the doctor, got referred to a specialist and a year later, I'd had a few tests done (endoscopy and ultrasound) and been put on and taken off of a ton of different pills.  Nothing really seemed to help, at least not without introducing new issues.

I happened upon a friend of my wife's that is a nutritionist and she actually had me fill out a food/symptom journal for 2 weeks and immediately pointed out that I had some dairy issues, which I kind of knew.  I knew enough at least to know that when I drink milk or eat ice cream I've had issues before, and I tend not to eat much ice cream or ever drink milk.  She discovered that on days I had more than one cup of coffee, I had issues.  I used a non-dairy creamer, but apparently those are derived from milk and still have some of the proteins in them.  She also determined I had a meat issue as on days where I had more than one serving of meat, I had issues.  So, her analysis has led me to cut out most meat and all dairy, except stuff like yogurt which doesn't seem to bother me.  She said what my problem appears to be is a B vitamin deficiency and some kind of issues digesting certain proteins in the meats and milk products.

I've started taking a one a day multivitamin and a B-Complex vitamin and watching to make sure I don't eat those things on the list.  She said that eventually I may be able to eat more like I used to, since we believe this was initially triggered by a highly stressful job situation I have since left.  I have kind of done some research myself now on the concept of what she said about proteins and learned that enzymes are supposed to be in charge of breaking them down.  She's not really mentioned anything about them and I was wondering, is there some way to improve the enzymes so that I can more normally eat again sooner?  I've been eating yogurt, which she also said would help me because of the probiotics.  Does everything she has told me seem right?

Another one I read about was eating only every other day. I'm tempted to give this a try but thought I'd ask you all on your opinions on this sort of diet.

Something else I was reading about is having only one meal per day (Intermittent fasting I think?) and this really appeals to me, but a few articles mentioned that it can result in higher blood pressure. Would anyone be able to give me some pros/cons about this?

* Lots of spinach and rocket
* 6 Cherry tomatos

* 100g beef
* Dressing - 1tbs flaxseed oil with 2 tbs apple cider vinegar
* EDIT: 1 cup of brown rice

**Dinner**

* 100g salmon with garlic, thick soy sauce, shallots &amp; chilli
* Mixture of green, red and yellow capsicum and zucchini cooked with a bit of coconut oil

* EDIT: 1 apple and 11 almonds
* EDIT: Yoghurt (full fat)


**Any tips or criticism welcome!** I'm ready to make a change in my life and be healthy and fit. I will supplement my diet with exercise - I've just started C25K. Are there any supplements I should take? Any foods I should add? etc.

I'm a nutrition noob, but what from I understand, having a caloric deficiency will cause one to lose weight. So for me, 24 y/o, 6'1, and 175 lbs, my range to maintain calories is around 2200. 

In theory, if I eat 2050 calories a day, I should slowly lose weight, correct? 

Ok, now add to this the Macros. My current plan calls for 231g of Carbs, 57g of Fat, and 154g of Protein a day. How would lowering/raising these affect a body overall? A drastic example, but what if one's diet consisted of 80% Fat, 10% Carbs and 10% Protein, but still managing to keep it under 2050 calories. Would they just be a really fat light person XD.

To be a bit more specific, I lift four times a week and run three (I rest after seven days (odd, I know)). Right now I'm in my bulk phase, so I've set my macros as follows:

Total Caloric Intake: 2900 Cal
Protein: 160 g
Fat: 80g
Carb: 380 g

First off, do these numbers sound about right? 

Second, I'm quite overwhelmed when it comes to making a diet that fits these parameters. I've compiled a large list of foods that are healthy to choose:

Protein sources:Beef,Poultry[Turkey,Chicken],Pork,Fish,Eggs,Milk,Yogurt,Cottage Cheese,Protein Powder

Carb sources:Rice,Pasta,Oatmeal,Whole Grain Breads,Quinoa,Fruit,Vegetables[Broccoli,Carrots,Peppers,Garlic,Spinach,Tomato,Artichokes,Onions,Celery,Cabbage]

Fat sources:Eggs,Fish[Tuna,Salmon,Tilapia],Dairy,Avocado,Extra Virgin Olive Oil,Nuts[Almonds,Walnuts,Pecans],Nut Butter

Others:Beans[Red Kidney Beans,Pinto Beans,Lima Beans,Lentils,Chickpeas,Black-eyed Peas],Grains[Oats,Bran,Fiber,Flax,Barley,Bread,Pasta,Pita,Wraps,Bagels,Brown Rice,Couscous,Quinoa]

Problem is, I have no idea how to make the freaking diet. 

My question to you all is, do you have a diet that follows my parameters? If you do, can you share it :)? If not, any advice on how to make a diet that follows my parameters?

My next question is: when I enter my cut phase (in a few months probably), how much should I adjust my macros?

To start:
I have recently started logging my caloric intake after calculating my needs using 15 cals (moderately active) by 160lbs, which = 2,400 calories a day (I got that formula from here: http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showth...hp?p=436716771).

I'm a skinny fawk/""hard gainer""/whatever term you want to label it, but I have always had trouble stuffing a lot of calories. In order to gain weight, I decided that 3,000 calories a day was my target (is this sufficient, or should I raise it even more?) The first few days, I fell short, but I have been hitting my goal consistently the past few days, however I find that I am always eating &amp; always full, so force feeding myself has kind of sucked.

Please critique anything below and point out where I am going wrong or what needs to be fixed:

Macro Breakdown of a Sample Day:

100g of Fat
227g of Protein
241g of Carbs
2802 Total Cals

Protein sources were from Protein Bar (30g), Chicken, Lean Ground Beef, Protein Shake (40g Pro Powder), and a lot of Milk
Carbs were primarily Wheat/Whole Grain bread, Brown Rice, and Milk

Macro Breakdown of another Sample Day

150g of Fat
200g of Protein
200g of Carbs
3000 Total Cals

Protein from Milk, LG Beef, Chicken, Eggs, Natty PB, and a Protein Shake (40g Pro Powder)
Higher than normal Fat Intake was from Olive Oil (I use this on everything) and a lot of Milk (Today I had 6 Cups, at 150 calories per cup).

I find that Whole Milk helps me a lot because it is calorie dense, as is Olive Oil. My main questions are: Are there any glaring issues with my diet? Is 3kcal enough to gain weight, or should I aim even higher?

My wife and I already eat pretty decent, but were hoping to take it a step further. Were going to be lowering how much meat we eat, and keeping it to very lean simple meats. We are also going to increase veggies and fruit, hopefully switch to organic if we can afford it. Start drinking green tea, and take some vitamin supplements.

I have heard that supplements are not necessary if you eat properly, but we both have very busy life styles and we have also heard that they can be extremely beneficial. Is there any recommendations for vitamin supplements? should we each take just a multivitamin or is there more? I am having a hard time finding any information on this that doesn't seem like an ad. We are both 23, and at normal weights, and average, but not great fitness. We both suffer from afternoon tiredness, and I have had digestive issues for the last few years.

We were also thinking about doing a cleanse, but again cant find any real information. Some say its amazing, others say its terrible for you.

I have also heard that going from a toxic diet to a healthy one can cause problems as all the toxins are being pushed through your kidneys, but then the doctor didn't go on to say what you should do about that. (it was in a documentary)

Does anyone have some links with information on how individual vitamin therapy works? For instance, in this same documentary they talked about Vitamin B3 helping with depression. They don't talk about how this should be taken, for how long, or any real information. Is there a website or resource that anyone knows of that would have this information?

4 days a week I'm out the door at 6am, and have a combination of school and hospital work continuously until 6 pm (usually with a 12-1 lunch break, but sometimes I have to just scarf down something really fast). I have trouble with constantly getting hungry, on average every 1-2 hours. Part of it is that I am quite busy, and part is that I have an irritable bowel so I don't make the most of what goes in my stomach. It would make these long work days much easier (not to mention improve my productivity) if I didn't have to keep stepping aside to snack or have to keep a pocketful of snacks at all times. By ""hungry"" I don't mean ""I could eat"", but more ""oh man, my mind is getting fuzzy, I need some energy"".

My typical breakfast is an apple w/ peanut butter, some dates, a glass of soy milk, and a cup of coffee. Sometimes I do oatmeal, but I noticed I get hungry faster with oatmeal. For snacks, I carry around peanut butter clif bars. Breakfast usually keeps me for 2 hours, and then I usually need a clif bar every 1-1.5 hours until lunch. For lunch on busy days I will have something really fatty from fast food, like a burger/fries, because it is quick, doesn't irritate my stomach, and keeps me full for up to 3 hours. Then I usually have 1 or 2 more bars before the end of my work day. After work I make myself a salad with baked chicken or fish, and have some fruit at night. 

I'm not over eating, b/c I've been like this since high school and am currently 165 lbs at 6'1"". So, is there anything I could do/eat differently to keep me full for longer and not have to keep sneaking away from school/work to snack?

Since October 2012, I've been injured off and on with two metatarsal stress fractures in my foot.  The causes I know of (high mileage, running on hard surfaces, running in old shoes) might have caused the first one, but I have no idea what's caused the next few flare-ups.

I was wondering if there is something glaringly obvious in my diet that might be causing this.

I try to eat as much unprocessed food as possible and as much protein as possible (maybe 150g a day on average).  This is because I lift and with lots of running it's tough to not lose muscle.  Also, I usually try to eat at a ~500 calorie deficit below my TDEE because, about once a week for the last 6 months, due to lots of stress/boredom, I would binge on ~2000 calories of candy, about 400g of sugar at once, and I've gained a few pounds of fat that is dead weight when racing.  I've cut the candy out now.  Since I've gotten hurt, I've started taking calcium/vitamin D supplements every day to up my calcium absorption.

Here's an average day:

* Breakfast: 2 eggs, glass of milk, maybe a bowl of oatmeal with some peanut butter
* Lunch: PB&amp;J, almonds, apple
* Dinner: Chicken breast with rice or pasta and raw spinach
* Snacks: 1-2 Gatorade Recover protein shakes, ~2 Gatorade Prime nutrition bars (they're free for student athletes so I take a bunch every day)

EDIT:  Welp, listing this out and doing a little research, it just hit me:

* I'm eating lots of peanut butter and spinach, which contain oxalate, preventing calcium absorption
* I'm eating a lot of animal-based protein, which makes blood more acidic and is hurting my bones

As a single guy, I've struggled back and forth to eat well while working and attending school full-time.  As you know, eating whole, healthy foods can be either be inconvenient, expensive, or both.  OR, once you've finally found some recipes that work, you get tired of them quickly, especially since it takes extra work (in my opinion) to make healthy food taste appealing.


SO, I present to you my plan for eating--  it is a bit atypical, since it consists of making everything in a blender. It is an all-shake diet.  Each morning, I will blend a huge batch of this, drink one shake for breakfast, one for lunch, and one for dinner, keeping them refrigerated in blender bottles during the day:


*8 oz Greek yogurt (plain, no added sugar)

*1/2 cup Egg whites

*2 scoops Vanilla Whey protein

*1 Tbsp Natural Peanut Butter

*1/2 cup Almond milk

*1/2 cup Steel cut oats (cooked and cooled)

*2 cups Spinach

*1 Tbspn Raw Honey

*100% cocoa dark chocolate, 2 squares

*1/2 cup each- Frozen blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries

*1 Lime

*1/2 frozen banana

*1/4 cup pomegranate juice

I would consume these 13 ingredients every day, breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  The only other variety I would get would be eating out with friends 2-3 times per week for dinner, where I would order chicken breast with vegetables (or something similar).

Here are the positives:  When I plug all ingredients into MyFitnessPal, I am getting the right amount of Vit A, C B, etc plus adequate iron, protein, and the macro nutrient ratio is a nice 40-30-30. It's relatively low sugar, low sodium, etc.

I did a search about this, but couldn't really find the information I need. Here's my problem.

I'm a 27 year old female, 5'6, 250 pounds (35 pounds down) and I'm needing to lose more weight, obviously. My problem is, I'm getting so much mixed information about how many calories I should consume in a day. Some say 1200 minimum, as I'm overweight and don't really have a starvation mode to hit. Others say I need to be eating 1900 or close to 2000 a day, and I don't feel comfortable eating that much.

I'm mainly sedentary. I'm a full time college student, and I work a desk job. My exercise consists of the walking I do around campus and 60 minutes of yoga, 2 times a week. Help me! I want to lose weight, but I don't want to be unhealthy doing it.

My goals are to lose fat whilst building/maintaining muscle (surprise, surprise).

**My questions to you guys are:**

* Am I reading this correctly? Would the 2930 cals per day be to maintain my current weight/fat %?
* What should I aim for in terms of daily calories in order to lose fat?
* What should my macro-nutrient breakdown be?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

And then promptly got on a plane to Japan for a snowboarding trip.  It's possible I pay him too much!






*If it's relevant, I've been training a total of 5 days per week, using a 4 day hypertrophy split with a big emphasis on heavy squats/deads/bench, 1 day of HIIT and one day where I go for a slow jog.

Breakfast:

* piece of dry toast (Nature's Pride nutty oat bread or homemade bread) or a small homemade bagel covered in flax seeds and sunflower seeds with a tbsp cream cheese

* a piece of fruit, usually 1/2 a grapefruit or a handful of red grapes

Lunch:

* Usually some kind of salad. Today I ate 1/2 c lettuce with cooked corn/black beans/onion/bell peppers (no dressing). My other go to salad has beets, pineapple tidbits in juice, black olives, green olives and a bit of feta. Sometimes I use a bit of Newman's Own greek dressing (maybe 2 tsp)

* either fruit or another vegetable (today I ate 1/2 a grapefruit, or I'll eat an apple, if I'm out of fruit I'll pack a 1/2 cup of peas or green beans with salt and pepper, no oil or butter)

Dinner

* Last night I had a piece of tilapia (marinated in soy sauce, honey, orange juice, hot sauce + some spices), sauteed onions, pineapple, black beans, corn, bell peppers, and baked sweet potato fries (a medium sized sweet potato cut and coated with olive oil, black pepper, sea salt)

* tonight I'm going to make a quiche with kale, onions, peppers, and olives (the crust is homemade using 1 c flour, 1/4 c cold water, 1/4 c olive oil)

Snacks/Drinks

* 2-6 cups of coffee

* a cookie (or some small sweet for an after-dinner snack)

* beer or a gin and diet tonic with dinner

I think I probably need some more protein in my diet, so please provide me with some suggestions. I should note that I don't really like meat. I dislike red meat, and I seldom eat poultry or pork. I really enjoy seafood, but I only eat it once a week or less.

Currently, I'm 68.3 kg (so I'm way good). I want to pack on some lean muscle over the winter and get faster on the water. I've been looking into supplements, but don't want to take supplements in the place of a good diet. Suffice it to say that I eat well -low GI foods, minimal amounts of processed stuff, loads of nutrients, quinoa and steamed brocolli, etc. etc.

I'm taking a multivitamin to cover my bases, though I think my diet takes care of all my vitamin and mineral needs by more than enough. Better safe than sorry, I don't mind peeing it out. 

Before a workout, I take Complx5. It's five compounds (Beta-Alanine for performance gains, Red Ginseng for Energy, Bicarbonate for lactic acid buffering, tyrosine for proteins, and malate which I don't know what that does). Red Ginseng is also in my Multi-V (its a multi-v for active life styles). I like to keep it natural and simple, so I avoid a huge supplement stack.

After a workout, I usually eat my own homemade trail mix (no salt added, no vegetable oil, etc - I read the ingredients). I also wash this down with a glass of chocolate milk because I've heard its good for after workouts when your body needs proteins, sugars, and fats. So here's my question:

I've been buying chocolate milk from the store and its getting expensive. I also think it's nullifying, in part, the other stuff I'm doing. I was remembering my youth and thinking about Ovaltine powder and mixing it with (Skim) milk.

I'm not one to really keep a detailed calorie journal but I try to make relative healthy decisions for the majority of my meals while still allowing an occasional wing and beer gluttony day during a football game. 

One of my favorite quick meals is a mix of veggies, ground chicken and rice for a meal that I can batch produce for 2-3 servings over a few days. I noticed that on the rice packages at the store by me (Safeway) that the calories per 1/4 cup serving was roughly 150-180 calories while on most calorie trackers it came up around 50 calories. 

I normally wouldn't care if there was a slight difference but the fact they are 3-4x apart is puzzling for me. I noticed this with brown, basmati and white enriched rice from multiple brands so I'm not sure what the root cause of this discrepancy is.

My question is: am I doing my body any harm or not allowing myself to train to my full potential by not eating enough? I have been losing body fat (judging by appearance only) but my weight doesn't seem to have changed at all.

* I eat no processed foods, everything is home cooked by me, so tips about what to eat more/less would be great

* I am no expert on nutrition whatsoever, so I am sure that I forgot important points! Please ask, if you need more infos!

* activity: I cycle a bit (3km at least per day, right now it is 7km on average), the rest if the day is a desk job.

* I do drink coffee again, I used to drink green tea instead, which made me feel better. I'll switch back to green tea.
