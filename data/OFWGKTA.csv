1364623239.0,485,self.OFWGKTA,1bagse,The Story Behind Tyler &amp; His Albums,theelderscrolls,547,62,111,http://www.reddit.com/r/OFWGKTA/comments/1bagse/the_story_behind_tyler_his_albums/,"     In ""Bastard"", Tyler raps about his pretty messed up life from his dad leaving him, which makes him a ""Bastard"". In the beginning, Dr. TC(TC=Tron Cat, The Creator, Tyler's Conscious) interviews Tyler as his therapist and tells him there will be 3 sessions. Today, tomorrow, and The next day. At the end of the album, he can't take all the sadness his father has brought him and from being a bastard, so he says ""I'll let this bullet play hero / nah, I'm over it / bang!"" This symbolizes either him killing the ""bastard"" side of him, so now that he's over with his father and being a bastard, it's time to move on. Goodbye Bastard, hello Goblin.. OR ..it symbolizes him wanting to kill himself because he is a bastard, an he says ""bang"" to urge himself to pull the trigger, but he cant. 



     In the beginning of Goblin, Dr. TC says to Tyler, ""You wouldn't do that. Kill yourself or anyone else/you don't even have the balls to begin with"", which is a reference to Tyler wanting to kill himself because he was a bastard at the end of Inglorious, he says ""bang"" wanting to pull the trigger. Or this might be a reference to Lone, the last song on Wolf, When Dr. TC asks if anyone's seen 'Sam' lately, and at the end Tyler/Wolf says ""If I see that nigga, imma kill him"". At the end of Goblin track, Dr. TC tries to change the subject by saying ""So, how was your trip to new york?"" The next track is titled ""Yonkers"", a city in NY. 



     The beginning of the track starts with ""Wolf Haley/Golf Wang"". Golf Wang is Wolf Gang if you switch the ""G"" and ""W"". Golf Wang, meaning Wolf Haley's label/group, relating to Wolf Gang by Tyler. In this track, Tyler tries to battle his evil white alter ego Wolf Haley (Tyler wanted his nickname to be Wolf, and wanted to change his last name to Haley cause his father left him and he didn't want his last name) by rapping back and forth with himself. ""I'm a fucking walking paradox"" says Tyler, and then Wolf jumps in saying ""No I'm not"", contradicting what Tyler just said. Tyler hates Wolf, and wants to get rid of him, but he knows Wolf is so cool and a good rapper, that Wolf is the one better at rapping than he is, because Wolf is a crazy awesome dude with red hair, a real rapper, who doesn't give a fuck. One line, he says ""Green paper (money) gold teeth (grills/jewelry) and pregnant gold retrievers (pregnant bitches) all I want"" is spoken by Wolf, then Tyler says ""Fuck money, diamonds, and bitches, don't need em"" and has a lyrical conversation with his personas. Eventually, in the video, Tyler hangs himself and meanwhile, Wolf starts rapping, saying ""I'm Wolf, Tyler put this fucking knife in my hand / I'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fucking hole in my head"" meaning, because Tyler is hanging himself, and he is one person, it is forcing Wolf, his alter ego, to commit suicide also, as we see by Wolf being 'forced' to hold a knife and commit suicide, at the end of the video. And the ""ace gon' put that fucking hole I'm my head"" is a reference to Ace, The Creator. Tyler's braver, alpha male ego. Ace is so brave, it's basically ""fuck a noose, ace is brave enough to put a gun to his head and pull the trigger to get rid of Wolf Haley"". 



     At the end of the song Nightmare, it is revealed that Tyler has a voice in his head that tells him to do all of this crazy, messed up stuff that he doesn't want to do. Dr. TC asks who this voice is, and Tyler responds ""Tron Cat"". Dr. TC=Tron Cat=Tyler's Conscience. In the track ""Bitch Suck Dick"", Tyler kills Taco and Jasper at the end, for no apparent reason. Then, at the beginning of the next track, ""Window"" Dr. TC tells Tyler""I brought your friends here to come talk to you/I couldn't get a hold of Jasper and Taco for some reason"". Because Tyler killed them in ""Bitch Suck Dick"". In the end of the track ""Window"", Tyler gets a gun and kills Mike G, Domo Genesis and Frank Ocean (probabaly because Tron Cat is telling him to do so. Tron Cat is the voice in his head that tells him to do fucked up shit) Hodgy Beats is only left, saying ""nigga what the fuck are you doin'?/You just gonna...nigga hold on, we can talk about this, everything that we've been through, nigga you just gonna shoot me iN MY FUCKIN'...."" and we hear the gun shoot as Tyler says ""sorry, nigga sorry."" The gun drops, and we hear Tyler muttering ""What the fuck man, man I'm fucked."" At this point, Dr. TC comes in and says ""Tyler, give me the gun."" and Tyler still repeats, "" I'm so fucked. I don't know what the fuck I was thinking man (sobs and crying)"" while Dr. TC tells him ""It's okay,I'm here to help you. I'll take care of it. I'm gonna give you some space while I go figure this out. You won't have to worry about a thing"". 



     The next track, Au79, is just composed of hip-hop instrumentals to ease the mood of what just happened. ""Au"" is the symbol/abbreviation for Gold on the periodic table, and gold's atomic number is 79, ergo, Au79, the track's title. The next, and last track on Goblin, called ""Golden"" (referencing to the track before this one, Au79) begins with Dr. TC saying ""Tyler, you obviously have some fuckin problems"", deriving from the rape fantasies, him killing all of his friends, and the various dark and murder tones of Goblin that make it a deep, dark album that it was supposed to be. Dr. TC says afterwards, ""As this is the end of the session, is there anything else you wanted to say""? This relates back to the beginning of Bastard, when Dr. TC said ""There will be 3 sessions. Today (Bastard), tomorrow (Goblin) and The next day (Wolf)."" Later on in the song, Tyler realizes that Dr. TC doesn't help him with anything, and screams ""You don't help me with SHIT"" and Dr. TC  calls security after Tyler hesitates to calm down, after screaming ""I'm not crazy! I'm a table! I'm a fucking table!"". He then goes on to rap about a wedding, bride and groom, tying the knot."" This is meaning he was going to marry his gun, he the groom and the gun the bride, and tie the knot meaning to shoot himself. When security comes in after Tyler refuses to calm down, Tyler says ""no, get away from me."" and the nurses and security begin to tranquilizer Tyler with drugs as he starts resisting and yelling ""No one gave a fuck"". Dr. TC says, "" Someone gave a fuck Tyler. And, uh, the person that gave a fuck was me. See, you’re not, going crazy, it’s me, I’m your best friend Tyler. I know everything, I know everything about you. You’ve been helping yourself this whole time. Your friends, they’re just figments of your imagination. Dr. TC, see Tyler, I’m your conscience. I’m Tron Cat, I’m Ace, I’m Wolf Haley, I’m..."" Tyler finishes his sentence with a simple ""me..."" following by the album ending. As it turns out, Dr. TC/Tron Cat/Wolf Haley/Ace the Creator are all part of Tyler's conscience, and his friends were part of his imagination. 



     Now, Wolf goes to Camp Flog Gnaw (Flog spelled backwards is Golf, Gnaw spelled backwards is Wang) At the beginning of ""Wolf"", the track ""Wolf"" starts with Sam singing and playing on the piano.  Dr. TC, the camps counselor, comes in saying ""Music sounds good, Sam, you've been practicing."" and introduces Sam to Wolf. Dr. TC says ""Sam and his band  have been at Camp Flog Gnaw for a while"" and then he leaves to fill out field trip slips. Wolf, trying to be casually friendly, asks ""you guys like jazz?"", and Sam responds with ""look, wolf, prairie dog, whatever the fuck your name is. You stay the fuck out of our way and we'll stay out of yours, capisce?"" The next track, Jamba, is just Wolf rapping with Hodgy, until the end, Hodgy says ""Here comes that weak ass nigga Samuel."" The next song, Cowboy, is rapped by Sam/Samuel. One verse says ""Grab Salem and Slater and go around, riding bikes."" Salem (Salem=Sam+Haley. SAleM/saLEm) Salem is Sam's girlfriend at Camp Flog Gnaw, who he is very protective of. And Slater is the name of Samuels bicycle he rides sometimes with Salem on the handlebars. At the end of Cowboy, Wolf says ""Whoa, who's that?"" and Samuel responds ""That's my girlfriend, Salem. You stay the fuck away from her, alright?"" The next song, ""Awkward"" is about Samuel and Salem when they first met, and the awkwardness and other details of their first date. Sam expresses how much he loves Salem during this track. The song ""Slater"" a few tracks after this just describes Sam riding his bike, Slater. He says, ""My bitch is on my handlebars"", referring to Salem riding on his handlebars when Sam rides his bike, Slater. The next song, 48, is about Samuel rapping about his crack/cocaine business in all 48 lower states.One verse states ""They call me Mr.Treat-Your-Nose / If you need some blow (cocaine) / I can get it for the low"". He describes how he's sorry for selling drugs and ruining others lives, but he needs money just as bad as they needed the drugs. The next track, Party Isn't Over, is Wolf telling Salem to ""take a chance with a nigga like me"" because he knows she is unhappy with her relationship with Sam. The next part of the song, Campfire, describes Wolf and everyone at Camp Flog Gnaw (even Salem) around a campfire making smores. Wolf is having a good time, and is happy with his life and being at camp Flog Gnaw. 



     The next track, Bimmer, describes Wolf flirting with Salem, and at the end of the song, when Sam gets back from a drug deal, he asks where Salem is. A friend of his replies they are ""by the lake"" and Sam becomes angry and mutters to himself ""what the fuck?"". The next track, IFHY (I Fucking Hate You) is about Sam confronting Salem about hanging out with Wolf. Sam is jealous that Salem likes Wolf, and he doesn't want that to happen. The track ends with Wolf and Salem talking. Wolf asks Salem why he's a dick, Salem tells him that some shit happened back home and he ran away, then Wolf asks, ""what happened?"" The next song, Pigs, is about Sam, rapping about him killing a kid who bullied him, which is why he's at Camp Flog Gnaw. The next song, Parking Lot, describes Samuel and his 'crew' (aka Loiter Squad) are going to find and kill Wolf because he has been hanging out with Salem. Upon being warned Samuel is after him, Wolf responds, ""not if I get to him first."" In the next track, Rusty, Samuel shoots Earl Sweatshirt and kills him in hope it'll scare Wolf away from Salem. In a couple tracks after this, Tamale, Wolf was masturbating and someone caught him and took him to the camp office. 



     The next track, Lone, takes place with Wolf in Dr. TC's office. Dr.TC asks Wolf what's going on, he heard about some fights and stuff, and he wants to know what happened. Wolf starts rapping, and ends on the subject of his grandma dying. Dr. TC apologizes for his loss, and tells Wolf ""Last time I seen Sammy, he was looking for you."" Wolf replies, ""Fuck that nigga Sammy."" Puzzled, Dr. TC asks Wolf if he has seen him. Wolf replies, ""nah, but if I seen that nigga I woulda killed 'em."" And that is the end of, ""Wolf"". 



     Now, what I believe is, Bastard&gt;Wolf&gt;Goblin&gt;Sam (Is Dead). In Bastard, Tyler talks to Dr. TC about him hating his dad, and contemplates suicide in the end, but he gets over it. Then, Wolf is sent to Camp Flog Gnaw as a kind of vacation from what happened in Bastard. In Wolf, Wolf describes his troubles with Sam, because he is flirting with Sam's girlfriend. At the end, Tyler proclaims to Dr.TC ""If I seen that nigga, I would kill him"" and if the first track of Goblin is played afterwards, you hear ""You wouldn't do that. Kill yourself or anyone, you wouldn't have the balls"", and amazingly enough, it fits perfectly. And because Earl died in Rusty, it would explain why he wasn't in goblin. And if there are any references to Goblin in Wolf, that's simply because he was rapping as Tyler, The Creator in the real world. He isn't going to make ALL the tracks match the storyline, that wouldn't leave any fun for him. And then at the end of Goblin, Tyler kills all of his friends and goes pretty much insane, leading to him finally killing Sam. In the music video, After Sam is killed, you see his dead body laying in a pile with other dead OF crew members who were killed in Goblin. Anyways, that's my view on it, but we won't know for sure until Tyler tells us. Thank you for reading this long-ass post and sorry for grammatical errors :D

1364399731.0,274,self.OFWGKTA,1b4660,Track By Track Story of Wolf,Naquanrice,300,26,154,http://www.reddit.com/r/OFWGKTA/comments/1b4660/track_by_track_story_of_wolf/,"So i'm on my second listen and I think I have the story down.

Wolf - Intro to the album. Sam is playing the piano as Dr. TC walks in and complements him on his playing. He introduces Sam to Tyler and vice versa. As Dr. TC walks out he says he has to finish filling out field trip slips. Tyler tries to be friends with Sam but Sam isn't having any of that.

Jamba - Jamba means Fart in Swahili, meaning Tyler and Hodgy are just talking shit in this song. How much money they have and how they have gotten rich. At the end of the song, I think it's Domo tells Tyler he doesn't smoke so stop talking that shit basically. As he's talking to Tyler Sam appears.

Cowboy - I'm assuming this is a Sam song. He talks about Salem and Slater who must be people already at Flog Gnaw. I think the title Cowboy means that he rides alone. It's only him. At the end Tyler meets Salem.

Awkward - I think this song could be about Sam and Salem meeting and falling in love. The distorted voice could mean that it is Sam talking. The singing at the end saying, ""You're my girlfriend,"" must mean it's Sam singing to Salem.

Domo23 - No meaning to the title, it was the title of the beat when Tyler made it and never changed. I think the song represents Tyler's shows and his performances. At the end him saying, ""I don't want yo god damn lettuce,"" could mean he just wants to do this for fun and doesn't care about getting money from it yet they still give it to him.

Answer - A make believe conversation between Tyler and his dad in the beginning of the song. He talks about how his father not being there started his rapping career and he thinks of Clancy as a father figure. He never really calls his dad from the last line of the verse, ""if i ever had the chance to ask this nigga, and call him, I hope you answer."" The second verse starts and he's telling the problems he and his friends are having. He drops a hint that his grandma by saying she's just nostalgic meaning she's just in the past, something he remembers. So when he calls her she won't answer. Third verse comes and he's talking about a girl (maybe Salem). 

Slater/ Escape-ism - A Sam song (maybe). Talking about what kind of person he is. He's disrespectful to women and doesn't give a fuck. Sam is an angry person. Oh and Slater is a bike not a person. Sam likes to play jazz. At the end with Frank, Salem is sitting on Slater's handlebars, her hair blowing in the wind. Sam knows he's the man with Salem and Slater. Frank tells that Slater is just a bike and bullies Sam for talking to it.

48 - Nas excerpt, awesome. Sam song i'm pretty sure. He's talking about selling blow, which is something Tyler would not do. Sam is all over the map, he's in 48 out of 50 states. He runs the coke game. Mr. Treat Your Nose runs the country. Sam says he's sorry for what he's done to people's lives and dreams. He's in way too deep and he's scared to death. Nas is explaining how Sam feels.

Colossus/ The Bridge of Love - Tyler song. About how people dick ride him while he's trying to have fun at Six Flags. A guy comes up to him and explains his love for him. This guy worships Tyler and is going crazy. Tyler is telling him it's weird how much affection this guy has for him, but the guy keeps going. Tyler is shocked but still takes the picture with the guy. 

Partyisntover/ Campfire/ Bimmer - Partyisntover first. I think Tyler is hitting on Salem in this song, ""Take a chance with a nigga, like me."" Campfire now. Tyler and everybody are now at Camp Flog Gnaw. He loves it and is having fun. He's becoming a different person. Bimmer (love this song) Tyler is hitting on Salem again at camp now. ""Your man got a lame impala,"" talking about Sam. Tyler wants to take Salem away from Sam. He knows Salem is unhappy with Sam. Sam finds out that Salem and Tyler (Wolf) are together now.

IFHY - First off this Pharell feature is awesome. Now, this is Sam's ""song"" to Salem. He fucking hates her. He caught feelings being with her and is now hurt. Not sure what he's talking about with adding more color. He hates Salem but also loves her at the same time. The anger starts to build up and you can tell that Sam really loved this girl, he says he'll stop breathing if she leaves him. Tyler asks Salem why Sam is such a dick, Salem tells him he's not the guy he portrays to be and came to Camp Flog Gnaw because he ran away from home after what happened there.

Pigs - Sam song. This is about Sam's life before running away. Sam is bullied and hated by everybody and is lonely. Sam is talking about revenge and getting back at everybody. He wants to take over his town. Sam kills a little kid and killed his step father. He talks about killing all of his classmates and the girl that said no to him when he asked her to prom. There are four Sam's, I think it's Sam's group of friends that are helping him murder people. 

Parking Lot - Sam song again. The first verse talks about him raping a girl basically. Sam talks about how he's the shit again. His group is the Loiter Squad and they're getting together to get Tyler. Somebody warns Tyler that Sam is looking for him to kill him.

Rusty- Not sure what the voice mail means at the beginning of the song. Tyler gets Domo and Earl together to help him fight Sam. I think they are just meeting that's why they are sort of introducing themselves (how they just talk about themselves) to each other. Sam comes in at the end of the song and shoots Earl.

Trashwang - Lee Spielman going crazy on this. The fight song? I think it represents Tyler's group and Sam's group mixing. Or, it could be the rest of Sam's crew coming in after Sam shoots Earl and comes looking for Tyler. At the end Salem says, ""What the fuck was that?""

Treehome95 - A song that Salem (Coco O.) wrote. I'm not sure who Erykah Badu represents though. I'm not even sure who Salem is singing this song to in the first place, maybe to Sam after saying what the fuck was that she's trying to calm him down. 

Tamale - TAMALE TAMALE TAMALE TAMALE TAMALE TAMALE TAMALEEEEEEEE. A Tyler song I believe. I think this song is talking about Tyler acting up at camp (possibly after Salem went back to Sam). He gets caught jerking off and is taken to the office

Lone/ Jornada - Jornada means Day in spanish. Tyler is talking to Dr. TC in this song. Not sure why it's called day but Tyler is talking about the problems he's having to Dr. TC. At the end TC asks Tyler about Sam to which Tyler replies, ""If I seen that nigga I would have killed him.""

Alright, with all the new info about Doris released, it's time to set some guidelines about what's okay and not okay to post about Doris.

* **DON'T POST LEAKS DIRECTLY IN THE SUB.** Cannot stress this enough. You can PM people a link to the leak, but do not post it directly in the sub, it'll be removed and you'll be given a warning.

* Don't clutter the sub with the same questions over and over. The mods will make threads with some questions like what's your favorite song, how would you rate it, favorite beat, etc. 

* EDIT: Don't downvote people if they do not like the album, unless they're being an asshole about it.

Although the link on the right has the discography, it's not really complete, so this is a start to one, which I will edit. This is just the stuff I have right now, I'm still missing bits, so lemme know what's missing off this, and if anyone out there has the stuff, hit me up!

1368145811.0,140,self.OFWGKTA,1e1dko,I never knew how Odd my Future would be,bjpf,199,59,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/OFWGKTA/comments/1e1dko/i_never_knew_how_odd_my_future_would_be/,"When I first heard Tyler two and a half years ago, I was a complete mess. I hated my life. I had just broken up with my girlfriend after almost 4 years together, for reasons that I couldn’t explain. I didn't understand how I could be living a ""good life"" and be so upset behind closed doors. I made myself believe everything I was ever told growing up and it never made me happy.  I was depressed and dying was the best answer I could come up with to stop it.

Bastard was the song; that 30 second video clip of Tyler playing those dreary piano chords, spewing disturbing lyrics about slit wrist with his devilish voice, claiming to be the son of Satan.. was terrifying. And I loved it.

I was scared to love it, though. What if God knew what I was listening to? What would my friends and family think? I left it alone for a few days and eventually my curiosity got the best of me. I searched for and found other songs of his and Earl Sweatshirt’s with an equally demonic sound and structure.  Listening to it gave me a high that I’d never experienced from music in my life.

I slowly emerged myself into the world of BASTARD, EARL, and RADICAL. OFWGKTA was frightening at first; murder, drugs, rape, satanism, and the sincerity behind it all was an unsettling combination.  But, as I listened closer I realized that it was metaphorical and went much deeper than that.  It was real music and emotion coming from kids that hated the way things were. And they did it all on their own.  They were sad, a little crazy, and extremely gifted underneath it all.  For the first time in my life, I could actually relate to the music because it was about emotions that I felt in my daily life; not the bullshit from every other artist about women I’ll never get and money I’ll never have. 

These kids were trashy, hateful, outspoken, controversial, and fucking crazy.. everything that I had inside of me that I hid from everyone my whole life, including myself.  I began to explore these thoughts, beliefs, and doubts I held inside about religion, society, the world, and life.. I fucking loved it and I haven’t looked back since. Its been a long journey trying to find myself and have been constantly evolving.  I began to immerse myself into things I enjoyed that others may look down upon. I started to do things that others didn’t necessarily approve of and were judgmental about. I became more outgoing, creative, thoughtful, helpful, loving, caring, honest, and most of all.. fucking happy.

I lost my belief in stupid shit like fake green paper and the judgement of others and I started caring about myself.  I realized that corruption runs the world and greediness is the only way to get ahead.  I learned that people are not evil because of a lack of god; it was a lack of empathy. And those people are just wired in a different way and it might not necessarily be their fault. I realized that I can do whatever I want, because nothing actually matters; we just believe it does.  Society is nothing but the brain-child of a massive amount of molecular beings trying to survive in a different way than the other species on this planet.  I realized that religion is pathetically fake and there is no such thing as “God.”  The universe is too vast for such petty bullshit.  People are just afraid of the unknown, and our small minds simply cannot fathom the complexities of the universe, so we make up the answers in our heads as a defense mechanism. I am nothing but stardust and consciousness, and I will do what I please within the confines of this awful society of humans that believe they are much bigger than they really are.

Today, Tyler and Earl are still a huge influence to me.  I watched them two days ago. Live. 2 Feet away at all times. I MET them. I TOUCHED them. I RAPPED AND SCREAMED MY HEART OUT with them to the very songs that CHANGED. MY. LIFE.  It was the greatest experience I’ve ever had.. The culmination of a full transformation sparked almost entirely by this group had come to a climax at this concert in Missoula, Montana, 3 days before my graduation from college. Those same kids that originally set me on this path to personal freedom have grown up, much like I have, and were basically there fucking cheer me on into the next phase of my life.  

I’m planning to move somewhere big; maybe Seattle.  I’m going to learn the piano.  I’m going to understand computers better than I thought would be possible.  I’m going to take singing lessons.  I’m going to write rap, poetry, hell maybe even a book someday.  Some of it might not be good, but who the fuck cares; I’m doing it for myself, not for anyone else..  I’m going to travel and indulge in everything I want to. I’m going to do things with my life that I had always scared myself away from because I was afraid of what people would think. Hell, I'm even posting to Reddit for the first time (aside from the occasional drunken and now erased comments) even though I'm extremely nervous about it. And I’m going to continue to face these fears head-on and turn my life into a great experience.  I’m excited for the possibilities.  I’m really fucking excited.

And I give a lot of credit to Odd Future for this new-found and strange attitude I’ve taken on.  They’re influence has given me all the courage I needed to change myself.  With out that change, I would’ve probably killed myself by now, yet I’m living a life of happiness that I may have never seen otherwise.  The way I look at it is, not only did Tyler and Earl help save my life, they helped me start it.

""Do you want to know why this is the best music video that will be released this year? I'll tell you.
Odd Future has never been more self-aware then right now. In the beginning all you see is Earl, no Supreme, OF, Golf Wang, just Earl. He begins doing his own thing, but just as he's getting warmed up the camera pans to the more generic members. All dressed in Supreme, Tyler rapping about Golf Wang. Through most of the video you see Earl doing his own thing and then everyone else coming up and stealing his thunder. We se Earl chilling not giving a fuck in the pit with everyone else doing a bunch of edgy 2OFWGKTA4u bullshit around him. But Earl doesn't care, he knows in the end, he's the center of the group. Its the critics raving about Earl that keeps Odd Future going. Then you see Earl pushing Tyler in the cart. You want to know what that cart represented? You guessed it. The OF bandwagon, Tyler all alone acting a damn fool with Earl just pushing him along never complaining""",,False,,t5_2sa6t,False,,,True,t3_1a5t29,http://www.reddit.com/r/OFWGKTA/comments/1a5t29/whoa_symbolism/,

I preordered *Doris* today on iTunes, and got Hive as a free single when I preordered. I went to listen to it, and I was checking out the album in my iPod. I checked the release date for the album, and surprisingly enough, it wasn't August 20th.

[The release date according to iTunes is August 12th.](http://imgur.com/pIL6wGO)

The user also claimed to have one other track, FEET and 150 Molasses. Of course no one believed him, this is what caused him to post the snippet.

Since Doris is so anticipated the snippet quickly spread. Being posted to numerous other forums,vine, and of course YouTube.

A rumor spread over the internet that Earl had said at one of the shows ""GET READY FOR MAY 9TH"" However, only 1 KTT user had said this. Everyone else in attendance had denied it. 

This is where HonkeyGolfGoat comes in. He uses the rumor of May 9th. Is one of the first to Upload the snippet to YouTube. Even using some tech shit to change his location of his tweets to Spokane, where Earl was.

Many thought he was Earl. He was and is not Earl.

May 9th came and he dropped nothing. Many of you still beilieved him even after he claimed to have sent the album to Anthony Fantano. A beloved /mu/ reviewer, this is what gave away he was a troll from /mu/. 

He than posted a claimed snippet of a song called Jackal. Which was really just an edited version of this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1o3_OwqhP8 with a skit from South Park over it.

Despite earl tweeting this: 
https://twitter.com/earlxsweat/status/332695288076701698

Earl: jackal is not a song like idk where the fuck u niggas are getting that from. jackal is what i call girls that are from hell

Many of you still believed HonkeyGolfCoat. Hell, even VlogGnaw a.k.a Alec Hendo interviewed him.

I knew 100% he was a troll when he tried to bring me into the mix by using me as a scapegoat.


http://i.imgur.com/QrQzarD.png

He shortly deleted that after tweeting it.

Only 1 known person outside OF has Doris tracks, however we do not know who it is.





***TL;DR: HONKEYGOLFCOAT IS JUST A TROLL. ONLY A KTT USER HAS DORIS HOWEVER HE DELETED THE ORIGINAL THREAD WHERE HE POSTED THE 150 MOLASSES SNIPPET. HE ALSO CLAIMS TO HAVE ANOTHER TRACK CALLED FEET. ALSO STOP BEING SO FUCKING GULLIBLE JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE CAN UPLOAD A SNIPPET DOESNT MEAN THEY HAVE DORIS ***

Save yourself $50.,JahJahBinksNephew,132,33,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/OFWGKTA/comments/1ixn0u/warning_do_not_go_to_mac_millers_space_migration/,"Earl's Performance was awesome, don't get me wrong. Trying to enjoy songs like ""Drop"" was near impossible though. While Jumping around and pushing the other Earl fans (There were probably &gt;30 Earl fans of thousands of people there) all of Mac Miller's 14 year old white girl fans were screaming for us to stop being crazy (having fun). I'm not just talking about one girl, There were many girls screaming at the top of their lungs. We tried to tell them we'll leave when Mac Miller comes on but they weren't having it.

 I was one of two people who crowd surfed; when my leg hit one of the teeny bopper's boyfriend, he pulled me down to the floor and came at me with his ""Donald Trump"" Shirt. After landing two right hooks on the side of my head and yelling ""Don't do stupid shit"" my brother tackled him. 

We couldn't get anywhere near the front due to the 1000 Mac Miller Divas in front of us. Although I love Mac Miller's new album and where he is headed, the old Mac pulled in a crowd of about 85% girls under the legal driving age. Easily the worst concert I have ever attended.

Also, when the internet and Vince Staples performed, Many people were actually booing. Their performance was awesome but all the little kiddies seemed to hate their music.

Just a heads up.

I've been reading everyone's theories about Wolf's place in the trilogy, or if it's even part of it at all, and it got me thinking.
IT COULD easily not be part of it, just a fun concept album Tyler put together for the sake of making music, OR...

At the end of Goblin, Tyler has a mental breakdown after killing all of his friends. So he retreats into his own mind, his happy place, Camp Flog Gnaw, which is this perfect place with pretty girls and a beautiful lake, and all of his friends are there too. He chooses to be the altar ego he is most familiar with, Wolf Haley. Now, because this is all in his mind, it explains the presence of Dr. TC, who revealed himself to not actually exist outside of Tyler's mind in Goblin. 
The fact that it's still technically Tyler the whole album explains why songs like Awkward and Colossus show up. 
Now, I'm not really all that sure what's up with Sam and the rest, but I think they represent people he used to know who really affected his mind. Tyler has already said that Slater was the name of his bike, and we all know how much he loves bicycles. Salem could represent one or all of the many girls who stole and broke his heart. Sam could sort of be a combination of all the people he hates, with his shitty unwelcoming attitude. If there's one thing Tyler hates, it's people who steal girls from him, and that's exactly what Sam is doing.

To sum it up, Tyler retreats to his happy place after the traumatic events of Goblin, but is unable to even find peace there. 
There's like a 90% chance all of this is bullshit, though.",,False,,t5_2sa6t,False,,flair7,True,t3_1b54bg,http://www.reddit.com/r/OFWGKTA/comments/1b54bg/another_damn_wolf_theory/,

*We are the Sams, and we're dead -- it's just four of us
We come in peace, we mean no harm, and we're inglorious
We took their heads but we just took back what they took from us
I guess we lost ours*

And then we hear in the [Mac Miller MTV sketch thing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYq9ikPD9xg): We hear Earl says he is a member of the 'Dead Sams,' a bike gang. And then when it comes to the Hive video, we get these guys: http://i.imgur.com/xZQO7xlh.png .

And while figuring out that these guys are the 'Dead Sams,' is not a new revelation, but now we know why they are wearing those masks. Go back to the Tyler line: *We took their heads but we just took back what they took from us.* So whatever these guy's are wearing, they consider them their 'heads.'

Crashing while I'm jacking off."" Thus began the career of Earl Sweatshirt. The song [Earl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78_loMbmKJ8) was released, along with the rest of the EP, Earl, in March of 2010. Earl was the perfect introduction to audiences to a kid whose wordplay and flow far exceeded his age. With the release of the music video for Earl, Odd Future had begun to catch the spotlight. Earl's flow and delivery captured people wanting to hear more lyricism from Odd Future. The song is rife with the clever wordplay of Earl. The artist himself has said ""Earl [is] the track [he] will never be able to surpass.""   
   
Earl begins with an introduction to his demeanor, how he was sent to Earth to kill people with no remorse. He says a lot about the lyrical focus of his early career, rape and murder. Earl's vivid imagination colors an otherwise brash track with imagery and wordplay. Lines such as ""Go on, suck it up;/ but hurry, I got nuts to bust and butts to fuck and ups to shut and sluts to fuckin' uppercut."" display Earl's penchant for multi-syllable rhymes. The song also shows the brevity of the majority of Earl's songs. The song clocks in at 2:31 and only two verses, the second being only 8 bars long. This is a oft-used argument against Earl. The argument says his songs are much too short to be considered feats of lyricism, but Earl's wordplay packs many lines into those short verses. While the first verse was an introduction to Earl, the second was a diatribe towards the music blog, 2dopeboys with whom the group have a hate-filled relationship. Earl describes how the bloggers are soft and Earl also threatens to harm them.    
   
Earl is undoubtedly one of the better songs from the OF camp and is one of the premier songs of 2010.",,False,,t5_2sa6t,False,,flair4,True,t3_1j8klf,http://www.reddit.com/r/OFWGKTA/comments/1j8klf/earl_a_day_8_earl/,

* Hodgy is the worst actual rapper in OFWGKTA. His lyrics are not very good and I can barely handle his voice at times.

* Up until Chum, I didn't like a lot of the new Earl that has been coming out(his songs with Domo, Casey, etc.) Oldie and Home were good, however.

* Numbers was god awful.

* Most of the OF merchandise looks awful, besides the Earl sweatshirt and maybe the Jasper jersey.

What are some of yours?

EDIT: Also, you can include your unpopular opinions about the fanbase.

EDIT2: Got some more things I thought of.

* The Internet is the best sub-group in OF

* Besides Earl, Pyramid Vritra is the best rapper in OF

* Did I mention how underrated/overlooked JAOT and Internet are? Nobody ever talks about them in this subreddit. The only things that get upvotes are Frank, Earl and Tyler. I hate to say it but this subreddit is the worse example, besides YouTube comments, of the OF fanbase. Only caring about the big 3 and not some of the more underrated, and personally, more talented members like Syd, Matt, and Hal.

***

**I AM NOT SAYING THE ALBUM IS GONNA SUCK, NO ONE KNOWS THAT, BUT THE PROMOTION OF DORIS HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.**

If you haven't noticed, not many people are excited for Earl's album Doris anymore. Why? Because the album had some of worst promotion ever that's driven more people away than drawing people to the album. How exactly did has this album had bad promotion, let's find out.

***

* **NO ALBUM COVER**

Now this should be one of the easiest ways to promote album, reveal the cover art! One of the things that got people interested in the promotion of Tyler's and Kanye's albums was the cover art for Wolf and Yeezus, respectively. Now this is somewhat of a smaller issue, but you really can't reveal your cover art? 

* **VIDEOS/SINGLES**
 
If you're going to release your first single, you don't have to have your album release date set, it'll have people wondering when its gonna come out, that's somewhat good. ""Chum"" did a decent job at this. However, it took over five months for Earl to release the next single, that's almost half a year. And by the time you have a second single, you should reveal the release date or have had one set by now. ""Whoa"" did not do this. It was just another Earl video I guess. Then, ""Guild"" came out. It kind of came out of nowhere with little to no promotion and it didn't hurt that the song sucked and was not up to the quality Earl set with ""Whoa"" and ""Chum."" It sounded like something someone would just upload for the hell of it, just because they made it or they would want to put it on a mixtape. Problem is is that Doris supposed to be a major label (slightly) debut. Earl has not been consistent in releasing singles/videos.

* **LIVE PERFORMANCES**

Earl has performed at least 4 or 5 (if you're counting 20 Wave Caps) songs of Doris and if you count that with all the songs released (Chum, Whoa, and Guild), he's already shown 8 of the songs on the album. It's rumored that there is supposed be 13 tracks on the album. I haven't checked out most of the live performances but knowing that is bad. With everyone having iPhones and shit, its pretty easy for someone to record that new song thats going on your album, multiple times. Now it's okay to  perform some songs live, but if your album is 13 tracks, you don't need to release that many singles or perform that many songs live.

* **RELEASE DATES**

There have been a few rumored release times for Doris, keyword, times. No official date. We've heard it would come out in May, it didn't. And now we've heard it will come out in late July. Earl, it's okay to push back an album release date if it means the album will have better quality, but, for you there is no album release date to push back, just a timeframe. If it's coming out in late July, just have a goddamn release date if you're finished with the album.

***

Those are some of the things I can contribute to the album promotion being terrible. When you try to promote an album, you want people to check it out, buy it, anything along those lines, but with Doris, the promotion of the album has turned me away from buying it and all I really want is for the album to leak, just so we can listen and end this abysmal promotion of an album. Hopefully you take some steps from Tyler and other artists with the promotion of Gnossos and not fuck it up.

It's also good for blocking all the drama in my life I really don't want to deal with, and blocking the arguments between my family. I could say I don't belong in this family but I feel right when I listen to odd future. I'm really scared to express shit with my family escpecially telling my mom I'm atheist. What I'm trying to say is with their music I escape to my own world where I have a girlfriend, freinds that I hang out with daily and a life where money is the last concern.

1373665362.0,75,self.OFWGKTA,1i6ju7,[MODPOST] Let's set up some guidelines for the upcoming Clancy AMA,ReconEG,99,24,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/OFWGKTA/comments/1i6ju7/modpost_lets_set_up_some_guidelines_for_the/,"**EDIT: PLEASE UPVOTE. I DO NOT EARN ANY KARMA FROM THIS.**

Hey guys, since we got the Clancy AMA in a week, let's start setting up some guidelines so we can keep the AMA focused, fun, and not stupid.

* Don't just post comments that are straight hate to OF and/or Clancy, you'll be given a warning.

* Don't post inappropriate comments about Kelly or Chloe, that's weird as fuck and creepy. You'll be banned from the sub for a week if you do this.

* No stupid jokes like the ""horse sized duck/duck sized horses"" question. It's okay to post jokes, but if they're unfunny/stupid, they'll be removed.

* Don't plug your own shit to Clancy.

* Don't ask dumb questions like ""who's your favorite member?"" and such.

* Do not ask if OF is going to come to your city. 

* Like the first two guidelines, nothing inappropriate/offensive please.

If you guys think there should be more guidelines, tell us in here or message the moderators.",,False,,t5_2sa6t,1374274872.0,,YungLean,True,t3_1i6ju7,http://www.reddit.com/r/OFWGKTA/comments/1i6ju7/modpost_lets_set_up_some_guidelines_for_the/,moderator

From an outsiders perspective you wouldn't be able to tell if this was the actual OF subreddit or just a fat OF circlejerk. I'm a big OF fan and I would like to have a decent sub to come to to converse with my fellow OF fans about their music. Not see Earl's latest tweet about how he's a peanut or Hodgy beats wearing make-up or another picture of Clancy's daughter.
