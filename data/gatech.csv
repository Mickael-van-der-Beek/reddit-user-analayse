1367422384.0,136,self.gatech,1dhhy7,The reason why people are miserable here,Vergilkilla,164,28,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1dhhy7/the_reason_why_people_are_miserable_here/,"I'm happy to say I'm glad with my decision to come to GaTech. I've been here 3 years now and wouldn't trade it for anything. The academic pressure, lacking social environment, competitiveness among students, and pure bullshittery of some of the classes/tests (""when did we learn this?"") hardly bother me at all - I find solace in the fact that we are all in this together, and other areas of my life, even the social area bred from Tech, is enough to keep me going and to keep my head straight.

That being said - I know several people who HATE it here. I know people who have changed into different people because of Tech, and not for the better AT ALL. The front page of this website as of right now, has a post that is borderline ""ragequit-on-life"" level, all thanks to GT. 

And it's not ""growing pains"" - nobody else cries out like this at UGA, Auburn... not over the pure pressure of the school. Over there they are more likely to cry over what happened at the frat party last night, etc. (though that happens here, too, hah). You don't hear stories of people literally shaking with test anxiety elsewhere.

So why is Tech different? Why are people being TORTURED here - why have I seen more than one of my cool, calm, and nice friends turned into giant drug-abusing messes thanks to THIS school?

I've thought long and hard, and in a reach back to my past, I think i have an answer.

In high school I got all A's - even with AP classes, college prep, etc. You know the story - you probably got all A's too. You were the smartest kid in your class, always. The teacher loved you and would double-check things with YOU. The yearbook pins you as ""smartest"" - you were known school around as the smart kid who would go somewhere off his/her smarts.

I was all these things, and one day, after another triumphant 100+ grade only report card, I said in a modest response to a ""oh how do you do it I never got grades like this"" question: ""I work hard for this - this is the main thing I do - if I didn't get A's, it would be pretty embarassing."" 

My older sister overheard me. She said ""Well ____, you play guitar, right?"" I replied, ""Yeah, sure, I guess..."" 

""How about your friends - people like you; you make people laugh, aren't you proud of that?""

I reply along the same lines ""I mean, yeah, sure.... but you know, the academics are the real triumph.""

Then comes the salient line of the whole story (for all 2 people who reach here):

""I know... but don't let grades be WHO YOU ARE. Something like that changes too easily to be such a big part of your identity...""

My sister is an Asian Studies major at Belmont University. She'll be graduating this Fall and plans to teach kids Hindi or something like that. Stop laughing, stop laughing. Scoff as you will, that little token of wisdom she spouted is the reason I can claim the first paragraph of this post as opposed to ""I hate this place"".

Kids here... a lot of them were ""nerds"" or outsiders...the social development in high school was lacking. I don't think anyone can deny that. The only piece of identity they have is as ""the brain"". They come here... and their identity is completely compromised. They are a failure, now. There is nothing special about them - no REASON to be their friend because. Everything they have ever accomplished was for naught - because obviously it was a fluke.

Having your identity destroyed is a VERY VERY powerful and damaging thing. And that's exactly what happens to a lot of people at this school - I see it time and again.

TL;DR People here make ""getting good grades"" the centerpiece of their self-actualization story and then GaTech writes them a sequel where the first book was all a fluke and the protagonist is actually worthless because they can't get good grades anymore.",,False,self,t5_2r8t2,1367437035.0,,,True,t3_1dhhy7,http://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1dhhy7/the_reason_why_people_are_miserable_here/,

I took time to eat a meal at Woodies, and can personally confirm reports of unwarranted anger and hostility.  These are the kind of things I look for in both players and coaches, so I would like to announce a few changes to our very own GT football team, effective immediately

AL GROH - out as Defensive Coordinator
PEACHES from Woodies - in as Defensive Coordinator
While interviewing peaches I loved her tenacity, something 98 year old Al Groh seems to have lost. This should help our D be aggressive in future games. 

DANTE from Woodies - in as Middle Linebacker
This dude can cook some bangin pasta. Not the meanest of WDH, but his attitude can help him be a real leader on defense. 

VIRGINIA from Woodies AKA PASTA LADY - in as Running Back
I could not help but notice Virginia likes to stay in the back at all times, and avoid all human interaction unless absolutely necessary. These skills will help her avoid tackles and pick up useful yardage when I decide 5 times a game that I want to go for it on 4th down. 

Hope you all like my changes, and trust me, we will be recruiting more from Woodruff in the coming years. I am finding it a hotbed of local talent that could propel us to a successful season.

Stay safe techies,ElJefeDeGatech,108,9,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/1h9ygr/your_favourite_all_time_entry_almost_got_robbed/,"Story to come soon. Winded and waiting for ATL cops. Thank you GT police for being so prompt. We got the get away vehicle's plates so hope they catch them and we're a little safer on GT

EDIT:

IMG link: http://i.imgur.com/sr7fs2i.jpg

Normally never walk through Home Park with my phone out in order to avoid situations like this but was texting my friend about what workout we were going to do at the gym when the guy ran up behind me and snatched it from my hands. He started running away while shouting ""Fuck you motherfucker"" and my first reaction was to run after him. Was nearly at 14th and State at the time he snatched it.

Ran down 14th, behind Grace Midtown Church, down some connecting street (11th?), and ended up Atlantic. Saw two guys standing on the corner who were chatting it up so yelled at them to call the police b/c the guy stole my phone. Instead, they joined in on my chase. The guy who stole my phone turned and saw 3 people chasing him so he threw my phone behind him. One of the guys in front of me caught it and gave it back to me. Guy who tried to rob me must have been as winded as I was and was walking away at this point. 

Two guys pull up in a car on Atlantic and tell me that they saw everything that happened and that they'll help me follow the guy and to jump in. Get in their ride and call police while the passenger, Justin, snaps that pic while the guy is covering his face. We're trying to follow him when a getaway vehicle pulls up and they get in and take off. We got the plates, tell it to police, and they speed off. About 30 seconds later 2 GT police come screaming down Atlantic in pursuit. I start filing reports.

Thanks to everyone that helped me recover my phone. Went back in search of headphones and stopped by the house of the guys that helped me. Justin, if you're reading this, stop by Octane west side (by tech) sometime after 9PM tonight and have a couple beers on me as well.

Stay safe techies. Watch your surroundings better than I did.

We have approximately double the subscriber count of /r/uga. And we consistently have double the number of active users.

EDIT: For RATs, what I mean by Hate Week is the week preceding our game against u[sic]ga - it's typically called that, and the Technique runs an awesome newspaper on the same theme. &lt;/edit&gt;

Would /r/gatech be interested in performing a subreddit invasion, wherein we subscribe and upvote all sorts of Tech stuff to the top? It would require active attention on our parts, more than just normal reddit browsing - we would need to be consistently checking their subreddit and upvoting like mad.

It doesn't need (and probably shouldn't) be mean stuff, but perhaps things like trollface buzz, pictures of the Wreck, our team, bad pictures of uga, etc etc.

To start, SPS is just a really small group of maybe 20 or so students interested in physics, and one of the guys in the group has some sort of connection with Neil Tyson's agent, so as a sort of publicity stunt for the school and the group, we decided to try to come up with a way to get him to come here and speak. We're in the process of writing a bill to SGA asking for money, and to help supplement that we're trying to amass signatures of people who'd be willing to pay to come see him in order to prove that many tickets would be sold. 

So to help, one of the guys made a [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/BringNeilDeGrasseTysonToGeorgiaTech) to help spread the word of our crazy endeavor. So if you're interested in seeing this happen, like, share, etc. Also, people from SPS will be on Skiles walkway at various times from now til friday when we submit the bill. So keep an eye out for us, and if you wanna help us out and want to see Neil Tyson, definitely come sign the petition. I think most of us can agree it would be a pretty awesome opportunity if we actually pulled it off!

They charge outrageous hourly fees for the worst located visitors lots, even late at night.

Even if you have a permit: parked in the wrong area? That'll be $25.
Don't have a permit but want to study on campus late at night and choose the wrong lot to park in? That'll be $50. Did your meter expire? That'll be $25. Did you stay in the lot for 3 hours and 1 minute? That'll be charged for 4 hours.

I've been told that the Parking and Transportation department doesn't receive state funds, so they have to generate their own budget. They do this by continually raising prices and ticketing cars to no end. They charge even GT Facilities for their parking spaces on campus. That's Georgia Tech...charging Georgia Tech. 

It's a shady business and I wish more people hated them as much as I do.

EDIT: For those saying that whining online won't help, realize the difference between whining and bringing attention to a faulty system. I bought my parking pass last year. I received almost $120 in additional fees between confusion over what lots to park in on game days, my lot being full in the middle of the afternoon, and misinformation about what lots are open late at night. I voted with my wallet, I didn't buy it again this year and generally park off-campus and walk/bike to campus. But, there are nights where the conditions aren't safe to walk from certain areas or, hell, maybe it's a torrential downpour. This school should provide a reasonable system for parking for the safety and convenience of its students; the objective of Parking and Transportation should be to facilitate our needs, not destroy our wallets. As someone stated below, I'm not asking for free parking. I'm asking for a more reasonable system. 

So here's to whining. Clearly some people agree. If enough people whine, maybe we can draw enough attention to change the system.

It's called multi-level marketing, and no matter how much they tell you it's not a scam, it is. Here's how it works:

You spend a hundred or two hundred bucks buying the product yourself (**WARNING FLAG!**). You then resell it your friends and associates all over campus and make money. You bring your friends into this scheme, and you get a percentage of your friend's sales. If your friends bring in friends, you get even more money! You could pretty soon have a tree of dozens or hundreds of people who are all selling the product and giving you a percentage.

Can you make money this way? Yes, and that's the dangerous part. Only one in a thousand (maybe) has the connections, the number of friends, the drive, the social network to sell any quantity of the product or bring any number of friends into the scheme. If you're one of the 999 in a thousand, you're going to buy a couple hundred bucks of the product, sell a few dozen, and end up in the red. You simply don't have the connections necessary to make it work. Is it a scam? Not in the traditional sense, but it's a lot like the beer commercials that suggest you will have women crawling all over you if you drink a certain brand. They're overselling the potential, knowing good and well that you'll most likely put in more money than you'll get out. At least the beer people aren't pretending to be telling the truth, and aren't asking you to invest hundreds of dollars.

Think about it: if these people are trying to sell, say, an energy drink, why wouldn't they just market it the same way Red Bull and Monster do? Why wouldn't they get their product into Kroger and Walmart and make a million bucks? Spoiler alert, they're not a charity: they've figured out that their product isn't viable through conventional marketing, and the only way they're going to make money is by selling it to naive college kids who think they're going to turn a profit when in reality they'll never recoup half the money they sink into it.

**tl;dr Multi-level marketing makes a very small number of people rich by screwing over a very large number of suckers underneath them. If you're asked to spend your own money to buy into a sales job, or if you're told you can make money by bringing in friends underneath you, RUN LIKE HELL.**

1357680065.0,69,self.gatech,167er4,A GT Alum is a finalist for the Doritos Crash the Super Bowl contest,mantisman12,77,8,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/167er4/a_gt_alum_is_a_finalist_for_the_doritos_crash_the/,"&gt;I wanted to give you an update on something that is so exciting for me that I honestly can't sleep!
&gt;
&gt;Every year, Frito-Lay (more specifically Doritos) lets consumers compete for a chance to create a :30 second commercial for the Super Bowl.  They call it their ""Crash the Super Bowl"" competition, and thousands of aspiring filmmakers compete for a chance to have their spot shown during the Super Bowl.  Well this year, I've been selected as one of five finalists!  
&gt;
&gt;Out of the five finalists, only two spots will be aired during the big game: one of which is chosen by Doritos and the other is chosen by a public vote.  Here's the website where people are voting: https://apps.facebook.com/crashthesuperbowl
&gt;
&gt;And here's a website my team created to hopefully make it easier for people to get news and vote: www.doritosgoat.com
&gt;
&gt;I would love to get the Ivan Allen College and hopefully even the entire GA Tech campus/alumni behind this...  
&gt;
&gt;Sincerely,
&gt;Ben Callner
&gt;STAC 2007

Let's use our ridiculous voting powers to help this guy win!

If anyone else scraped through the classes that just seemed like more difficult iterations of your high school classes, I feel ya. That was me. I passed chemistry by two points, made Bs and Cs in many of my classes the first couple of years, and failed calc 2 the first time (did surprisingly well in calc 3, but that's beside the point).

However, I toughed out those damn cores and eventually made my way to.. you know.. the classes I INTENDED to pay tens of thousands a year for. I'm doing really well in those courses, but still, I'm far from the golden boy.. I still make Bs half the time and just do enough work to get by in courses I have less interest in. 

Now about to start my fourth year here, the day came that I was toughing it out for. Today I have three really nice job offers for the summer, all of which I feel like I couldn't have earned in only three years at other colleges. Tech actually did a damn fine job teaching me (especially starting about 3 semesters ago) and is worth the whipping and searing pain that I thought would be all in vain three years ago. 

For all us average kids thinking that Tech is going to be the death of you, just know that it pays off if you have goals, are proactive enough to follow up on them, and not let 4-credit-hour russian calculus classes make you think you're not good enough to earn your degree... eventually.

&gt;We are a student-run organization, built on the dedication and ambition of our members. The solar race car project promotes cross-disciplinary learning and interaction, and it necessitates engineering excellence, leadership, and teamwork from all students involved.

Over the past three years, we have been constructing Georgia Tech's **first** solar-powered electric racing vehicle.
Our car is named *The Endeavour*, with a car number of 49 in honor of the Space Shuttle Endeavour's [STS-49](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-49).

From June 24-29, we will be racing at the [Circuit of the Americas](http://c841724.r24.cf3.rackcdn.com/obrazky/56/56461.jpg) track in the [2013 Formula Sun Grand Prix](http://americansolarchallenge.org/the-competion/fsgp-2013-teams/) against universities across North America, including UT-Austin, Northwestern, Oregon State, and Iowa State!

Here's our [car](http://lh4.ggpht.com/-Eo6ULUWAZGU/UbqX6lrnguI/AAAAAAAABMo/rIovvXd1Co0/s1280/Side%252520shot.JPG), and our [team](http://lh4.ggpht.com/-Mb3A7pL7GZw/UbqX8Up8E-I/AAAAAAAABNs/Z7-FKNl-p40/s1280/Team%252520Picture%2525202.JPG) for reference.

The perpetrators use a tail vehicle to ""bump"" into the victim's vehicle.  When the victim exits the vehicle to inspect the damage, the perpetrators carjack them at gunpoint.  Please follow these safety tips to avoid being a victim of a carjacking:

-If you are involved in an auto accident, stay in your vehicle and lock the doors, dial 911.

-Watch the other driver's actions in your mirrors and be prepared to drive off quickly if you observe threatening behavior.

We operate out of Floor 2 of the [MRDC](http://imgur.com/KLI5N0F) in a space that currently includes five rooms, each of which is focused on different sets of equipment used across student projects.  That equipment ranges from basic soldering stations and power tools to a CNC Mill and Waterjet Cutter.  (note: our website is in the process of being updated, so the full list of equipment may be out of date)

Any **current** Georgia Tech student, faculty member, or research member can use the equipment in the studio.  With only rare exceptions - mostly for research groups - the use of our equipment is completely free and is not limited to class projects.  For example, a number of students have built electric scooters based off of Razor components that have a top speed around 30 mph.  Training on the machines is as simple as walking in and asking for help with a project; there will always be several Undergraduate Lab Instructors staffing the space who all know how to use the equipment.

We’re hosting this AMA because one thing we keep hearing from at least half the people that learn about the Studio is “if only I had known this place existed when I was a freshman!”  So, fire away!

1) Use the damn search bar. In the words of one Tyler Durden, ""You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You're the same decaying organic matter as everything else."" In the same way, you are not special in wanting to know about housing. Your questions about housing, whether or not to take your AP credit, campus involvement, Greek life, employment, co-oping, etc. have probably already been asked and answered. Look for those questions before asking a different one.

2) You will have time to speak with an advisor when you come to orientation. They will tell you what classes to take. In the mean time, if you really can't help but try to plan out your fall class schedule, check out your major's website, they have a list of requirements for your major that you should follow.

3) On the same note of classes, no, you will probably not get the schedule of classes you want in the fall, regardless of which FASET session you come to. The way that the system is set up is that while a class may hold 150 seats, only 25 will be opened up at each session so that kids who come to later sessions get an equal shot at each class. The only thing that will allow you to ""beat the system"" here is registering earlier in the session, which, btw, is entirely random as to who is allowed to register when. I've been an orientation leader twice, I promise you that I know how this stuff works.

Hopefully following these tips will make your life for the next few months a little easier. We're excited to have you coming to Tech and look forward to you being here in the fall.

Love, a rising fourth year.",,False,self,t5_2r8t2,False,,ISyE,True,t3_svqke,http://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/svqke/psa_attention_incoming_freshmen/,

It feels like every professor is out to get you, it feels like you won't have the strength to power through it, I get it, its near damn impossible to succeed. What will I do? Your first exam is a 40, when you've never done below an 80. Everything you saw in orientation was far from what the reality was. You are going through the worst, you think to yourself, there's no way I can actually do this.

That's fucking bullshit. Listen very carefully, the classes you will go through at this place will seem impossible. It will seem as if highschool was a silly joke. They will test your ability to plan ahead, to be organized,  to know when each and every exam is, and to utilize every resource in your power to come even close to succeeding. You will go through a hundred impossible scenarios and still come in far from being able to answer that question on that one exam where the professor could have given less shit about you.

Sure, you can be mad. You can be angry that this place had no sympathy for your skill. You can leave, drop out and change schools, if you don't have the willingness to put in the strength and dedication that it takes to succeed, you will not make it. But if you do, there is nothing in life that will fucking stop you from tackling the future with a tenth of the effort you put in here.

But you think you have it bad? Look around you. Please, do me a favor and have a look at the world. You’re at an institution that will mold you to be the best, and you think you’re suffering? You have no idea what suffering even means. Toughen up because its now or never. Don’t make a decision you’ll regret, when your sheer willpower could push you to bigger and better places. You’ve fucking got this.

Like I said, this place is built to make the best of the fucking best. Georgia Tech students are far more hard-working than any other people I have met in my life. This place has prepared me for anything. I’ve gone through internships and it felt like I was on vacation. This place is like an unforgiving father who wouldn't take no for an answer. Georgia Tech didn't take my shit, it told me to toughen up and actually read every paper, chapter and word the professor sent out. It told me that the half-effort I had put in through highschool simply wouldn’t be enough. You’ve grown up living a lie if you think high school was hard. You need to buckle up and actually figure this shit out. The spoon-fed bullshit is over. This is real life.

Georgia Tech told me that studying would not be enough, that success required that you went above and beyond your strength and put in 110%. It molded me into a stronger, more confident individual that I would have not been had I gone to any other school. I've visited friends at various competing institutions and I have never seen the dedication that I see here. I'll be graduating in three days, and all I can say is thank you.

Thank you all for helping me push through this school when all else was against me. Thank you for helping me keep going. For all of you who are fighting the tough fight, keep on fucking going. This is a difficult institution for a reason. You will learn far more than Physics when you take the class, you will learn discipline. Trust me, keep pushing forward. Don’t let anybody stop you from succeeding. Push away from every single distraction, the end of the road is fucking worth it.

I know that when I look in the eyes of another Georgia Tech graduate, I know what they've been through. We've been through this battle together, and we've fought each and every professor, together. We have defeated the roughest of times, and we have what it takes to succeed. There are very few institutions out there that come even close to this privilege. Don’t take it lightly.

Please do yourself a favor and review the companies that will be attending, the ones you're interested in, and then do some research on that company. Never go up to a company and say, ""so, what do y'all do?"" 

In Capstone and you're about to call a company for questions? Do some research first. Get on the company's webpage and dig around their technical site. Folks like to speak to ""intelligent"" students. 

Have an interview for a full-time, internship, or co-op position? Be early! Do not try to take Atlanta traffic into account if you think you're going to make it ""just in time"". Always have the mindset of being late when driving in Atlanta, especially if you have to drive through Atlanta. Also, if you're going to be more than 30 minutes late, call and cancel the interview (you should call regardless, but an hour is too excessive). Give your excuse and request an interview for a later date. Folks aren't sitting around at work just waiting to interview you, they're more than likely squeezing you into their schedule.

Whatever you threw at me hit me and nearly jammed itself in my bike wheels. As it stands, I was not injured but whether from surprise or actual damage to my bike I very well could have bee knocked off and hurt. Judging by your hysterical laughter as you drove past you and your friends thought it was funny. It wouldn't have been funny for anyone involved if I had been hurt. You would be in some serious trouble and I would be in some serious pain. People like you don't just do these things once though.

It is with great sadness that we in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering share with you the news of Scott Wills' passing on Friday, December 2, 2011. Details about services will be provided once plans have been finalized.

Dr. Wills grew up near Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He attended Georgia Tech and graduated with a B.S. in physics in 1983. Graduate study at M.I.T. yielded a S.M. (1985), E.E. (1987), and Sc.D. (1990) all in electrical engineering &amp; computer science. Dr. Wills became a faculty member in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech in 1991. Prior to joining Georgia Tech, Dr. Wills spent several interesting years working at Motorola (Plantation, Florida), Harris (Melborne, Florida), and Symbolics (Cambridge, Massachusetts).

Akshay Goil
6th September 1989 to 11th March 2012
Akshay Goil was a 5th year student at Georgia Tech looking forward to graduation in May.  He was a computer engineering major who enjoyed working with fellow students as a teaching assistant and a friend.  Akshay was known around campus as a generous, fun-loving and energetic young man, who enjoyed cars, travel and being with others.  
Akshay was very involved in many environmental concern groups and was appreciated by his professors for his diligent work in research. 

Born in Mumbai, India, Akshay came to Atlanta in 2007.  He is survived by his parents, Krishna and Anshu Goil, older brother Aditya, sister-in-law Aidan, and younger sister, Anchal.  
 
In lieu of flowers, donations will be accepted at the funeral home for a cause to be determined by the family in Akshay's memory.

I'm sure we could avoid like 90% of the muggings around Tech/right outside Tech if students stopped walking alone past midnight or so. There's a lot of pressure on the GTPD to stop crime around the area, but I feel like a lot of the responsibility also rests on the student body. 

I understand, a lot of people are new to Atlanta and may not know it's unsafe to walk around at night, especially right outside campus. I always tell freshmen I meet not to walk alone after a certain hour. Just make smart decisions and call a friend/Stingerette/taxi if you really need a ride!

It's explained in the link (so read it please), but basically the GT Ballroom in the Student Center is getting carpeted, thus ruining the monthly (300-400 attendance with live band) swing dance events at Georgia Tech. This is the petition being started to save the Ballroom and is being lead by the Georgia Tech Dance Association.

I'd only had it about a week, as my fiance gave it to me as a birthday present. It's the most expensive and most sentimental thing he's every given to me besides my engagement ring.

I've been so sleep deprived this week, and I had thought I put it back in my bag today around noon, but apparently I didn't. The battery is dead, but it's a blue 3DS XL, in a slightly padded velcro case that said ""3DS XL"" on the front flap. It has a DS game in it (My Japanese Coach) and has no screen protectors on it.

Please please help me find it. I am so upset. I can't believe I lost it. This is terrible.

My 3DS has been found as of 1:20pm! Apparently it fell out of my bag at work (in Tech Square) and a coworker of mine found it and put it on my desk (but never emailed me or anything about it).
So I woke up extremely early this morning to get to the lost and found. No one had seen it. I had emailed the dean, the Cathy's, professors, a TON of people. I put up flyers all in Klaus. Now i have to take those down lol

However, when feeding said cats that food often disrupts the food chain that, believe it or not, exists in the city. Opossums, rats, dogs (not that we've seen any of these, at least on East campus), squirrels, ants/roaches, etc. Now, as some of you may know, having opossums and rats around the quad and in the buildings is, to put it lightly, less than acceptable. As well, ants and roaches in the area may well 'leak' into the nearby buildings. So, please do not feed the cats in the area. They are feral cats, and if they cannot feed themselves then they will likely move or leave to find food. I'd trust that their feline instincts can do the job. I know it's nice to have cats around, and if they are feeding themselves then they will stay as long as there is food. However, they aren't our pets, nor are they in captivity.

Now, why am *I* telling you this? Many of you know, I work for Housing. Since we're the only 'enforcing' body that's constantly in the direct vicinity, we may be asking anyone we see feeding cats to stop (and potentially document them). So please, let nature take its course. They'll not only be helping us by controlling the nearby wild populations, but I think we'd be better 'stewards of the earth' if we simply let go.

edit: I get this probably isn't popular. You can still play with the kitties! Just don't feed them so much! (for example, folk has a rather large box of cat food. That's not necessary.)",,False,self,t5_2r8t2,1361220279.0,,ECE,True,t3_18rnmj,http://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/18rnmj/a_note_about_feral_cats/,

I was looking into creating a student volunteer Emergency Medical Service, similar to Emory University EMS. Basically, its a volunteer organization that provides students the chance to receive Georgia licensure as an Advanced Emergency Medical Technician. After gaining certification, students then serve shifts operating first response vehicles to respond to medical emergencies on campus and select off-campus areas.

I am trying to get something similar started at Tech. I have e-mailed Dr. Maureen Olson, Medical Director at Stamps, and am waiting for a reply. I have talked to several other staff/faculty at Tech, and all of them say it sounds like an awesome idea, but they can't help/don't know who can.

If any of you happen to know some people I could contact, that would really help out. Even if you don't, I'd like to get my idea some exposure and support.",,False,self,t5_2r8t2,False,,CS,True,t3_qm1as,http://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/qm1as/starting_a_georgia_tech_ems/,

**CoC**

 * How it was  done - Took the stairway closest to Klaus (backside of building). Door was not locked at the top.

 * Ease of Access - N/A only once

 * Worth it? - Lots of fun. Better view of Frats from Klaus.

 * View from top - No picture provided


**Klaus**

 * How it was done - Took a stairway with roof access. Have to go through door at the top.

 * Ease of Access - This was good. Now the door is frequently locked.

 * Worth it? - Yes! Good view of everything.

 * View from top - No picture provided


**Van Leer**

 * How it was done - Took the stairway closest to Bunger Henry. Again ... door at top.

 * Ease of Access - Have never seen this door locked. Apparently this has been locked frequently (thanks to studio_sally).

 * Worth it? - Good views. Some radio towers. All in all worth it.

 * View from top - No picture provided


**Howey**

 * How it was  done - I have only been to the very top to look from the telescope.

 * Ease of Access - I beleive access is *very* restricted. Good luck. Look into astronomy club. Also Bruce1337 says ""Scaled the outside wall, facing the construction zone. I've always said that because of that pattern in the stone, Van Leer is basically a ladder disguised as a building. The doors on the roof unlock from the outside only; so, once you climb up, it's an easy stairwell descent.""

 * Worth it? - Viewing the telescope is the only way to access the roof (I believe) and is definitely worth it.

 * View from top - No picture provided


**North Ave Apartments East (xCruise)**

 * How it was done - ""You can get on top of east by going up to the top of the stair case and using a credit card to open the lock. Then you have to crawl out a little access door and you can walk around."" 

 * Ease of Access - Sounds a little difficult but can be unlocked easily.

 * Worth it? - ""Best view of atlanta on campus imo""

 * View from top - No picture provided


**Student Center**

 * How it was done - Second floor balcony -&gt; jumping stairwell. Bruce1337 says ""The jump from the second story stairwell is more of a step to the roof. It's about | -------- | this far of a gap between the roof and the the stairwell. For anyone that can't picture what part of the student center, it's the roof above Subway/Taco Bell/Etc.""

 * Ease of Access - Sounds easy, never done.

 * Worth it? - Never done. Imagine you can see the Coke building. Again thanks to Bruce1337 "" The view is sub-par, but the seclusion is key.""

 * View from top - No picture provided


**Alexander Coliseum** Thanks to TenTypesofBread


 * How it was done - ""Hopped a fence, climbed up a dumpster, onto a light onto a ledge. Shimmy up between two walls to the top (careful one is a very thin ledge) onto roof. Walk up to the nipple.""

 * Ease of Access - ""harder than the others, and chance of getting caught by police (heard it done before)""

 * Worth it? - ""Beautiful view of campus and surrounding area. Potential for trespassing charge... you decide""

 * View from top - No picture provided


**Bobby Dodd Stadium** Thanks to TenTypesofBread

 * How it was done - ""sneak into stadium (easy). dont get caught (harder). Climb side bleachers to the top, and then climb the light fixtures."" Thanks to hypotheticalquestion, ""anyone can sneak into the football stadium, especially during spring semester, by jumping down from the Bursar's office staircase....""

 * Ease of Access - ""Easy to access, but gotta watch out for security""

 * Worth it? - ""beautiful view, but more likely to give you vertigo and set off your fear of heights"" ""Awesome~""

 * View from top - [Panaroma](http://i.imgur.com/6M7uo.jpg) thanks to wadamw


**Brittain Dining Hall** Thanks to hypotheticalquestion

 * How it was done - ""Be friends with any one of the stoners working there... plus, gives access to just about every freshman dorm surrounding it... also, if you just wait till the workers are distracted, go up the small staircase to the 2nd level, and from there you can get to the abandoned belfry, which is pretty cool.""

 * Ease of Access - Sounds pretty easy, slight sneaking involved possibly making friends.

 * Worth it? - Maybe the BoA?

 * View from top - No picture provided


**Ford Es&amp;T/BMED Building** Thanks to hypotheticalquestion

 * How it was done - ""Take the staircase from Ford ES&amp;T facing Ferst and climb to the top, theres a 10-15% chance the door is left unlocked during weekdays.""

 * Ease of Access - Sounds hit or miss, worth the try.

 * Worth it? - Baseball fields and track. Maybe the BME quad too.

 * How it was done - ""It's the tan building with all the round parts on it, [map](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=46.005754,38.583984&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=&amp;ll=33.777038,-84.400454&amp;spn=0.001625,0.002473&amp;z=19).  Haven't done this myself, but if you go up the stairs on the outside of the northern most round part there's a gate a the top that you can just shimmy through if you're skinny enough (nicknamed the roof the skinny club, but you don't have to  be ridiculously skinny).  The stairs go right past a bunch of offices, so be sure to do it on off hours, but other than that its pretty easy.""

 * Ease of Access - Easy, helps to be skinny.

 * Worth it? - ""Like I said, haven't been up there yet myself, so I'm not sure if the view's any good.""

I was originally planning on graduating in Spring 2014, but that isn't going to happen.  Thankfully, paying tuition is not a big issue for me.  However, my issue is that I am performing poorly academically and I think it's too late to turn things around.  I'm afraid that I'm not going to graduate or I'm not going to have a chance at a job when I do graduate.  I have a cumulative GPA of 2.26 and I was placed on academic warning.  I have had to retake more classes than I can remember.  Nonetheless, I have learned quite a bit and am performing well at my internship.  I am doing the internship this summer and was told I should do 3 terms of it and make it a co-op.  I do not know if this term of internship will count though since I was placed on academic warning after I registered for the co-op permit.  I enjoy the internship and I enjoy the material related to computer engineering, but because I didn't seek help and I made poor decisions, I'm doing pretty bad.  I don't want to switch majors, I don't want to give up, and I don't want to waste my parents' money.  What should I do?  What things should I consider?  Or am I just blowing things out of proportion or letting my depression take a hold of me?  I'd appreciate it if you were respectful in your posts, I know how some of these threads turn out... Thanks for reading, and I hope you're enjoying your summers.

Hey Everyone!! I just met with Dean Stein and I think it went over very well. This is going to be very long message so bear with me. I want to start out by saying that this is NOT whatsoever a debate or discussion arguing the ethics of pro life versus pro choice (as we have individuals on this group and campus who are both, neither, or either). This is also not discrediting the character of the individuals in GT Students for Life. The GT Students for Life group put up this event and display legally through Georgia Tech. The organization that they brought to campus, Justice For All, is legally allowed to put their display in areas that aren't the designated free speech area due to the fact that they were sponsored by GT Students for Life, which is a Georgia Tech chartered organization. Any comments or discussions regarding what I have said above are pretty unnecessary because what we stand for is irrelevant to that. If you have any concerns on the above, make your own group! That being said, I brought to him my concern of psychological risk associated with the nature of the campaign. Psychological triggers of the graphic and unavoidable aspect of the campaign may cause an individual to commit harm to themselves, regardless of if you believe it shouldn't (if you don't have psychological triggers, consider yourself a very fortunate individual). These triggers are just as real as if the group were to commit physical harm to people passing by, and present a risk and reliability factor to our campus. Dean Stein said that he has heard the feedback from the students, and this push for mental safety is a pretty new concept to this specific incidence (good job everyone!!). He said that today, a cabinet of faculty is meeting along with a legal team to discuss this issue, whether or not something can happen, and if anything can happen at all. He said that he would push this psychological safety issue as important, and see where it stands within policy and law. Continually, he said that it would be especially helpful for us to come together and write a singular letter to him, Dr. Peterson, Dr. Schafer, and Dr. Bras outlining this mental safety issue in terms of campaigns, who we are as individuals, and that we would be available to talk. I have created a google document if you would like to start on the letter to the faculty with me. Please message me with your gmail account, or what you would like to say if this is something that you are interested in, and I will add you personally to the google doc. Also, please only message me if you do not have the intent to sabotage our efforts and our letter. If you want to express your concerns, make a new letter. Also, he said that if we have any concerns, we can **respectfully and not in an army** talk to some of the leaders of GT Students for Life (they seem to really be open to this idea, they seem cordial, so show respect back) and their adviser through the Catholic Center about putting unavoidable images that can trigger someone to hurt themselves. That's really all I can remember though. Will this do something? Maybe. But I am so incredibly proud of everyone who has supported the effort for standing up for what you believe in. As a group of students, it really shows that we have the power to protect our mental safety, regardless of viewpoint on the issue that was being campaigned. I am indebted to you all, and I appreciate more than words can describe the devotion, dedication, and respect that you all have shown. If you have any comments, questions, or concerns, feel free to message me. Thank you all.""

Personally, I find Buzzport to be fairly ugly, it's difficult to navigate, and it doesn't really work all that well for a college renowned for its technological prowess. Then there's T-Square and its problems. So here is what I suggest:

Have the university host a competition to design a website/interface that works better than the current one. They get 6 months or however long they'll probably need to design this. Maybe have the students vote on it, since we're the ones it is mostly geared toward. In return for this, allow the student who wins to place it in their portfolio for graduate school or jobs. The fact that you designed your own university's website should look pretty good on a resume. Maybe add some monetary compensation as well for the top 3 or whatever would attract the most/best competitors.

This way, Georgia Tech gets a newly designed Buzzport and it comes pretty much free of charge. We have a lot of great computer scientists  at this school, I'm sure it should yield some good results. Or does anyone have a reason as to why this wouldn't work out? Like why they actually can't change it? I'm sure they would have tried to before since they admit at FASET that it's poorly designed.",,False,self,t5_2r8t2,1337214380.0,,BME,True,t3_tq65t,http://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/tq65t/designing_a_new_buzzport_competition_concept/,

And should they be deemed worthy, be passed around.

- If programming is new to you, or you claim to not have the ""mind"" for it, reduce it to a set of rules you memorize and apply, like you've done your whole life. For example: If ""num"" is some number, and ""vec"" is a vector, know that ""temp = vec(num)"" takes the num-th position of vec and ASSIGNS it to temp. This is known as indexing. You may as well have been reading the dictionary and learned a new word. Stop thinking computing is some kind of esoteric concept reserved for nerds. Oh and for the love of God, assignment is from right to left.

- Along the same lines, don't hate it; you're not making your work easier for you. Maybe you'll use it a lot in your career, so you're doing yourself a favor. Or you'll never touch it again, and it's just a stepping stone to graduation. (Probably the latter)

- When starting a new problem, it might help to ditch the computer science for a moment, try to rationalize your decisions, and prototype your algorithm. For example: I have a rack of shoes, but I got drunk last night and for some reason I decided to reorder them so I have no idea where anything is. Today, I'm feeling my wingtips, how might I go about finding them? I'll START at the beginning of the rack, and ask myself, is this pair my wingtips? IF not, I'll move on to the next pair. If it is, I'm done. I'll perform the check for EVERY shoe on the rack...hey, that sounds like a loop. Soon, this will be second nature.

- When going through examples, make damn sure you know what every line does. I find the fastest way to find out is to just TYPE IT IN AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. Not only that, you have the internal help that comes with MATLAB, and that thing called the internet. I've Googled my way to an A in most classes, including this one.

- If anyone offers to work in groups on homeworks, avoid them like the plague, because the inevitable is that nobody really does it, and someone always has a source for the ""answers"", usually ill-begotten from someone who actually gives a damn about the class. It's not too say you shouldn't work with other people, which I will endorse if the process is mutual learning, but don't mooch. Do your own homeworks, learn how to ""think"" like a programmer. You can do it. 

EDIT: As per Waffuls
&gt; And for god's sake, DO. THE. PRACTICE PROBLEMS. If you even half know what's going on, do the practice problems, learn the solutions, and you could probably get at least a B without even really understanding wtf is going on.

EDIT2: By i_never_lol
&gt; My #1 advice: Don't listen to all these fearmongers.

I'll leave this here before it becomes a rant, also I can't think of any other big piece of advice I'd rather give, and invite you all to post your own tips.

This is getting ridiculous. Personally, I was already pissed about the 6% increase that just passed, but this is ridiculous. If our tuition were to keep increasing at a rate of 9% anually, in-state tuition would pass $10,000 per year in just 4 years, and in 10 years would cost almost $10,000 **per semester**. Maybe I just don't have the right knowledge for this sort of thing, but I'm failing to see how raising tuition would make us a better school.

But CHRIST. You cyclists at Tech have a fucking DEATH WISH.

Stop at the fucking stop sign on ferst and atlantic and ferst and hemphill. 

Don't blaze your bike through those crosswalks that don't have a traffic light on them. I gladly will stop for you if I know you're coming, but you're much faster than a pedestrian. You zoom through those at the last second thinking you have right of way. Forget the fact that you're a vehicle and that crosswalks aren't for you, just do this for your own goddamned safety.

You think that ""oh I can handle myself, if no one's coming, why not go?""

What if we motorists also adopted that mentality?

But hypocrisy aside, seriously, just be safe. I don't want to hit one of you assholes.

EDIT: Admittedly I shouldn't curse and call names so much, but it gets frustrating when this sort of thing happens and you almost hit someone because of it.

EDIT2: This seems to have become a debate about cyclists on sidewalks more than the original point. Let it be known: I just don't want to HIT anyone because of cyclists disregard for traffic laws. Cyclists on sidewalks/walkways is a greyer issue that personally I don't care about in practice all that much (except for the rare douche flying through people), I argue more for the semantics of it.

Three  players got to round four, which is very impressive these days. However, the Georgia Tech player MaSsan got all the way to the losers bracket finals. This is the farthest a Georgia Tech player has gotten since MasterAsia's losers round 7 run at MLG Orlando last year. 
MaSsan did not lose a single map until round 5 against GoSuIllusion. He then proceeded to beat EGSuppy, prior to this considered the best collegiate player, 2-1. He finally was knocked out by FXOasd, a Code S level Korean terran. 

Additionally, Georgia Tech was recognized on the stream multiple times (as some other posts in this subreddit show).

We use Phoenix LTX equipment (Google it). We have 8 public guns, which usually means spares. 

IF you happen to have your OWN gun, then you are our hero.

We set up spontaneous battlefields. Tonight we are looking towards West campus. Some previous favorites have been Skiles, tech tower, and inside the student center. 

Optional donations should be in the form of AA batteries. 

We play at 7 most Sunday evenings.

Understandably, they need to blunt the impact of that cost somewhat, so a wash load now costs $1.50 (up from $1.25), and 10 minutes of drying now costs $0.30 (up from $0.25).

This wouldn't bother me all that much if they deigned to give us any word on the issue whatsoever. Hell, otherwise I'd be celebrating the loss of those shitty dryers (although the new ones remain untested by me) too much to care. I'd like to think that Housing has some level of responsibility to keep us residents informed. 
This, right here, is what I'd like to be get emails about.

I can directly confirm all this for East and North, so I presume it holds for North Ave as a whole. I have no idea if anything has changed elsewhere on campus.

edit: removed a misleading aside. 
When I originally wrote this I was a bit pissed off. I should grant that the housing directors generally do a decent job at keeping us in the loop, although this is a damn big miss on their part, summer semester or no.

I am socially awkward. I have a hard time connecting with other people, but am doing well academically. I am in shape and workout at the CRC more than a couple of times a week. 

I have recently overhauled my wardrobe a little by following some advice from [/r/malefashionadvice](/r/malefashionadvice)  and searching former asksubreddit posts, I have started being myself? (not sure whether I am doing this wrong). I am a pro at small talk and then ejecting (Hey how's it going...nice..take care/have a good one) but I am so fucking alone that it kills me. On Fridays, my limited friends are playing some videogames, but mostly I've spent the past couple of weekends alone in my room or walking out and about because I am clueless about clubs/bars that I can get to without a car. Even if I did, I don't know people to go with. It seems like being in a frat, would have been a great option to have something to do on weekends, but I am 2 semesters away from graduation, and it's a rather fucking lonely place to be. 

Most of my attempts at talking to girls are epic fail too. I have been on a grand total of 2 dates this semester, but most girls I like, I am too chicken to talk to, or they are taken or the others I don't want to mess up the social friendship/acquaintance thing that I have going. In my classes, seems like everyone has their own groups, so I feel alienated in the class. And the only other place that I see girls that I'd be interested in talking to are at the CRC which I made a pact with myself not to do. Mostly because I'd much rather do my workout and let the girls do theirs besides I couldn't engage in such behaviour because if I were a girl, I'd probably think of the guy as creepy? Unless they know each other which seems like the norm for all frat/sorority people at the crc or in classes/etc. 

Anyway my life seems to be in a funk and I am not even sure why I am studying to be an engineer anymore. I am unsure about life post graduation as the limited (two) summer internships that I've had have lead me to believe that I fucking hate my guts working on some stupid analysis and optimization stuff. 

TL:DR -&gt; I am fucking down and out and on the verge of what might be depression? plus I am clueless about life now. looking for your thoughts and suggestions and wisdom. Thanks.
