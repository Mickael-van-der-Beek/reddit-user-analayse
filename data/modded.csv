Perhaps it might be a philosophical question, a prevalent cognitive bias, a common fallacy, or just an ubiquitously applicable piece of knowledge.

These are the three first to come to mind for me:

* 
While most people are probably aware of the [placebo effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo), they might not be aware of how often it affects us, or most importantly, when it might affect themselves; I have lately found myself contemplating how much placebo has affected me in a situation.

* 
[Correlation does not imply causation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation). A simple concept that has made me examine not only scientific studies and statistics more carefully, but also claims of all varieties where a possible middle-step might have been omitted.

* 
Also, a memory bias that I'm unsure of the name of (I'd like to know); here are some examples: The clock is not actually more often 13:37 and 22:22 when you look at it, it just goes from a subconcious peek to a memorable coincidence when you find a significance. You see newly-learned words everywhere, and you did so earlier too, but without paying any attention to them. Someone who thinks he is inherently unlucky is just more likely to remember instances of bad luck than the opposite.

I bet all of you have concepts that make things more obvious, that you wish more people knew about; I'm curious to hear them!",,False,,t5_2rc8f,True,,,True,t3_kzwk7,http://www.reddit.com/r/modded/comments/kzwk7/what_concepts_should_everyone_have_knowledge_of/,

Even if Company B has a superior product, it's inferior advertising budget gives it little chance to compete.  That's bad for us.

A company can have a good business model, become very large and change practices, then inflate it's advertising budget to mask its shitty model.

There's the argument that ads bring awareness to a good product, and that's true sometimes.  However in certain ads, there is no meaningful content.  For example, product placement, TV ads where the announcer only says the company name and the logo flashes on the screen (contains no content), every ad in a ballpark, billboards, etc.  

Ads can even contain information meant to deceive.  Some are informative, but really the only goal is ""what will make us more profitable"" even if it's at the expense of society.

Also, ads suck, and I hate them.

That is not to say that working hard is not to be commended or valued at all, just not so highly. An example, if I may;

* Someone I know recently worked a double at the restaurant they work at. That means 15 straight hours of work. In my state, that means no overtime pay unless you work more than 40 hours a week. So we're talking 15 straight hours of minimum wage plus tips. When I asked them about lunch, etc, they scoffed as if taking a break to eat was out of the question. They barely had time to take short breaks throughout this 15 hour day.

Now, someone may look at this situation and applaud them for working so hard for so long -- for persevering throughout the day. I personally feel the opposite. I feel that this sort of attitude towards work, and people's lauding of said attitude, is very very detrimental to our society. It places *too high a value* on hard work for the sake of work. In turn, work is devalued.

I know people who never take their designated breaks throughout the day or their 30 minute unpaid lunch break. This, to me, is unbelievable. I'm not saying I always *need* a break, but it's the principle of it.

What do you all think? Is hard work *over*valued?",,False,,t5_2rc8f,False,,,True,t3_jp6kf,http://www.reddit.com/r/modded/comments/jp6kf/is_hard_work_really_a_valuable_or_indispensable/,

&amp;nbsp;

Primarily, what Real World influence would you say Reddit really has? If one were to try to explain this influence to someone unfamiliar with Reddit, what examples would you give? Such as:

 - specific interesting IAMAs
 - specific examples of our involvement in various social movements (such as the Rally to Restore Sanity and OWS)
 - specific examples of our involvement in helping right a particular injustice (such as exposing the identity of a criminal)
 - any statistics or other hard data (Mods/Admins, please chime in)
 - general perspectives on Reddit from outside sources (for example [how Reddit impacts news cycles](http://www.geekosystem.com/how-reddit-controls-the-internet-news-cycle/))

&amp;nbsp;

Secondarily, how has Reddit influenced you personally? For example:

- Were you the recipient of a redditor's kindness that has changed your life in some way, small or large? 
- Was Reddit instrumental in drawing attention to an injustice you suffered? 
- Were you scammed via Reddit somehow? 
- Did you find a job or lose a ton of weight thanks to Reddit? 
- Did you receive a random act of pizza that meant significantly more than a pizza normally should?

&amp;nbsp;

The goal here is to compile in one place a variety of examples illustrating Reddit's power of influence, however weak or strong, personal or collective. Please, share your views.

First of all, our little experiment has recently crossed the 7,000 subscriber mark, so thank you all for being a part of that!

With the increasing level of content submission and discussion taking place, we (the mods) thought it would be a good idea to set out some guidelines to more concretely define how we want this community to operate.  Thus far, the mod team has operated mostly without formal rules in place, but we think that some proper definition is in order as we continue to grow.  Hopefully, publishing these will set clear expectations, as well as making it easier for new users to join us.

To this end, we'd very much like to get input from the community on the set of guidelines we've proposed below.  If all goes well, we'll plan to move them into the sidebar in a week or so.

Cheers!

FelixP

Now I haven't done much research, and I know there are inequalities, but the standard of living seemed to be pretty decent/high in Libya before the Arab Spring.

Most western media outlets focus heavily on the fact that Gadhaffi has been in power for a long time and is a dictator, but how good/bad dodid the Libian people have it in reality?

Could someone with more Libian knowledge elaborate on this? I'd also like to read some unbiased articles on this.

Just a thing or two I read today. Naturally this is a biased approach as well. Hence my questions above.
