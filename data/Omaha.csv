Long time redditor and occasional poster to R/Omaha but mostly a lurker. Well I decided to take a risk and try my hand at owning a restaurant. Coming soon, hopefully late July we will be opening what will be known as Voodoo Taco on the NW corner of 90th and Fort. If you are familiar with the area it was previously Julios, Matts Grill and Salgados.

We will be a fast casual restaurant specializing in gourmet tacos. Ingredients will be all over the board and will be a completely unique concept to the Omaha area. We wont have your traditional ground beef tacos as we feel you can get those anywhere. 

I want to avoid making a shameless plug or using reddit to do advertising but I feel this could be of interest to some of you and would love to support the r/Omaha gang in the future when I open.

I have a Facebook page if you would like to keep up to date with announcements and news. https://www.facebook.com/pages/Voodoo-Taco/555725161134181

If you have any questions, advice, comments criticism etc feel free to pm me or post here.

Thank you r/Omaha I look forwarded to meeting you all. ",✓,False,self,t5_2qihb,False,approved,selfassign,True,t3_1gcrjg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Omaha/comments/1gcrjg/new_restaurant_coming_to_omaha/,

It is hands down the best pizza in Omaha.

Anyway.

My family and I have been going there for about a year. Everyone there, especially the owner Pudgy, is incredibly kind and gracious. Tonight, Pudgy's wife (Beth) came over to check on our meal. Of course we said it was worth the 20 minute drive from Midtown.

We made small talk. We mentioned a picture of Pudgy on the wall. Beth said, ""I wish he still looked like that."" We asked why he doesn't look like he does in the picture, and she told us he has had cancer for the last three years, and he's now on hospice.

We were shocked and saddened. Beth said his last surgery was unsuccessful, and the cancer has spread. He doesn't have long. She seems a bit overwhelmed having to take over the business AND her husband.

I know it seems like a lot to ask, but if you and your family or friends decide you want to go out for dinner, please consider Pudgy's. Even if you aren't into pizza, dropping by just to wish the family well would be incredibly helpful to them at this time.

I've talked with Knowltey about it and this will be linked to in the sidebar. 

This is a work in progress and I'm definitely open to suggestions. I wasn't quite sure how to organize things, if there's a better way please let me know.

Figured I'd share it here.  It could use some formatting love as bullets, etc didn't transfer from the email.  Perhaps tomorrow?  Maybe I should make a Google Doc for this and just update it once in a while... regardless, this could be handy for some people so here it is.  There are some rumors I have removed because I don't want to be that guy.  :-D

Someone asked me for a rundown of the Omaha Beer Scene since they will be visiting soon.  I figured a larger audience would be alright in case anyone ever decides to come visit us.  If you don't care about Flyover Country, you can move on with your life.

I'm not going to cover festivals, as that is another huge post, but I will go through breweries, beer bars and quite a few places that aren't open yet, but should be this summer or soon thereafter.

I'm not going to cover Lincoln or the rest of the state as that would double the size of this post, which is already going to be fairly large.  Plus I'm not nearly as in the know when it comes to the rest of the state.

The only place in Council Bluffs worth mentioning is 1892 which is a German Beer Hall that is frequented by bikers.  Just do yourself a favor and avoid Council Bluffs in general.

Breweries - Open Now

- Lucky Bucket Brewery - Brewery. Currently the largest in town, they are out west in La Vista.  If I could only have one beer from them it would be Certified Evil.  We happen to have a keg that we'll be tapping at TGIF today.  They also make a really good IPA.  Every time we have visitors from Oregon they usually take a 6-pack back with them.  They do tours and have a tasting room.  Check the hours as they can be a little odd.

- Nebraska Brewing Company - Brewpub.  The Melange A Trois is my pick.  However, anything in their Inception Series is worth checking out.  Although at $20 a bomber, most people find it a bit too pricey.  They'll generally have a lot of things on tap when you go.  The food is alright to bad.  The service is usually sub-par.  I hate saying bad things about the place because the brewer and his wife are cool people.  They are opening a new facility soon with a canning line, so we'll see what that brings.

- Upstream - Brewpub. Their regular lineup is alright, their seasonals shine.  The food is usually quite good.  A good choice if you find yourself in the Old Market district.

- Rock Bottom Gold Medal Tap House - technically not a brewery since they just ship in award winning beer from their other locations... if you know what this place is, great.  If not, you may want to check it out.  Beer is good, food is excellent.

- Laslzo's - carries Empyrean beer.  While not my favorite, they are responsible for bringing beer engines to Omaha and keeping them relevant.  If you're so far out west that you're not sure you're even near Omaha anymore, this is your only hope.  Food is good.

Beer Bars

Beer Corner USA - Crescent Moon, Huber Haus, Max &amp; Joes, Beertopia 
(disclaimer: I basically live at this bar, or at least two blocks away) The Crescent Moon opened as a craft beer bar in 1996.  
It's a constant on Draft Magazine's Top 100 Beer Bars in the US.  
Currently there are 36(-40?) American Craft Beers on Tap.  
Recently the owner decided to drop Blue Moon from the lineup since it didn't meet the spirit of that goal.  
One beer engine that rotates frequently
Downstairs in the Huber Haus, there are currently 15 German beers on tap and plenty of German bottles.  
Through a doorway is Max &amp; Joe's which has 13 Belgian Beers on tap and plenty of Belgian bottles.  
Next door is Beertopia, the bottle shop which has 600+ different beers.
Food is great if you like American Bar Food.  Most things are homemade, including the ranch dressing, which apparently is more popular in the midwest than elsewhere.  
The original Reuben was invented across the street and they sell a LOT of them there.  Frank's Kraut is supposed to be featuring the bar on their cans in the near future for this fact.  
If you want to relax and have some beers, Saturday at about 2pm is a good time.  Avoid it on Friday and Saturday nights, especially when school is in session as Creighton College kids turn the place into a meet market.  Unless you are into that sort of thing.  
Most often has proper glassware
Beer Knowledgable Staff

Krug Park
In Benson, the hipster area of town
~50 taps, one beer engine that rotates frequently
Across the street from Jake's and The Waiting Room, down the street from both Beercade, Infusion and the Benson Brewery.  Also next door from Lot 2. (I will get to these shortly)
In it's first year open, made Draft Magazine's Top 100 Beer Bars.
NO TELEVISIONS (good or bad depending on your world view)
No food
Staff is fairly knowledgeable
They make a mean mixed drink, including Bloody Marys for your Sunday hangover.
Proper glassware most of the time

Jake's
In Benson, the hipster area of town
Two bars, the small one is for smoking cigars as they are known for having a good humidor.  Also has a semi-outdoor area for smoking cigarettes and 'other'
~20 taps
Semi-Proper Glasswear
Generally knowledgable staff
Makes decent mixed drinks
Near all the other stuff in Benson

Beercade
In Benson
~20 taps
~20 Arcade Machines that rotate frequently, 3-4 pinball machines and a skee-ball machine
Staff could possibly be knowledgeable, no opportunity usually to find out.

Lot 2
In Benson, next door to Krug Park
Technically not a brewery, but they have two beers on tap made by John Farr who won Homebrewer of the year in 1996.  He is also opening his own brewery which I'll cover later.
Amazing food

Lauter Tun
Your best bet out west, there are about 35-40 beers on tap.  
There is a stage behind the taps, often jazz or bluegrass bands play here.  Banjo Loco is a good time.
Staff is knowledgeable about beer
Most often not proper glassware

Omaha Tap House
Good place to stop if you're downtown.
~15 taps
Great burgers!
Staff has usually been knowledgable in my experience, I've heard otherwise from friends.

Blatt Brew &amp; Table
Directly next door to TD Ameritrade Park - Home of the College World Series (I didn't know it existed either until I moved here)  It's also near the convention center.
Can either be packed or dead depending on what's going on nearby.
Staff is usually not the greatest
Food is overpriced and somewhat silly.
Burgers are great!
~20 taps

Brass Monkey
This place is different.  
It's a South Omaha dive bar (like a really divey dive bar) turned into a craft beer bar (around 35 taps).  
Often when you walk in, a bunch of locals are drinking Busch Light out of bottles.  
Often the beer sits too long and has off flavors.  
Often glasses of beer are sold for at or under cost.  Some people think the bar is a way to launder money since it doesn't make any financial sense.  
Can be a really good time, though.  
No food, although there's usually a crockpot of something hanging around and a popcorn machine.  
Two beer engines, although they don't usually employ them both.
No proper glassware
Staff knows little to nothing about beer

Library 
Northwest
35-40 taps.  
Usually has odd tap selection as the owner prefers scotch.
Glasswear and Staff Knowledge is iffy.
Owner is kind of a dick, and is creepy so I avoid it.  Doesn't help that it's all the way across town.

Opening Soon

Omaha Brewing Company, Benson Brewing Company, Farnam Brewing Company
Being opened by a bunch of New York lawyers who moved back after 'retiring' a lot of people think they are biting off more than they can chew by opening three places at the same time.  Just had some of their beer at a recent beerfest and some of it isn't good, but some of it is.  The first will be near TD Ameritrade Park, second in Benson and the third just down the street from the Crescent Moon in what people are starting to call the Farnam Beer District... I prefer the Blackstone Beer District.  We'll see how that sorts out.

John Faher's As Of Yet Unnamed Brewpub - will open on Farnam near Farnam Brewing Company and the Crescent Moon, as I mentioned earlier he was the Homebrewer of the Year in 1996 and is a really nice dude.  He makes some of the best beer in town.  I have high hopes.

Borgata Brewing Company - In the Old Market, head brewer will be the ex-head brewer of Lucky Bucket.  Will be a brewpub.

Infusion Brewing Company - In Benson in what people are calling the Benson Beer District, being opened by the owner of the Crescent Moon.

Another one that's in the planning phases and they might not want the cat out into the public eye or whatever.

Other Places To Check Out

Homy Inn - You can't leave Omaha without a visit here.  ~20 beers on tap and 2 types of champagne.  Yes, you read that right.  Worth doing once.  It's a bar for locals and has to be seen to be believed.  Wonderful decor and a memorable experience.  Not really a beer bar, per se.

Dundee Dell - In Dundee, they usually have ~10 beers on tap.  Staff isn't knowledgeable.  Food can be mediocre.  Has the largest Scotch selection I have ever seen.

1356728574.0,39,self.Omaha,15l9v5,Buyer Beware: Pool and Hot tub owners avoid Olympic Pool and Spa (local business) at all costs.,painis,51,12,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/Omaha/comments/15l9v5/buyer_beware_pool_and_hot_tub_owners_avoid/,"You know how you hear about local businesses being pushed out of the market by the internet and Wal-Mart. Well to avoid this when I try to buy local over online as much as possible. 

My Mom's hot tub had started freaking out and after doing a bit of research i trouble shot the problem down to the top side control panel just having a short and sending too many signals repeatedly. I jump online to price the part so i can tell her what the damage is going to be and then call the 3 pool companies in town to get the part priced through them. The first two are not Balboa Certified dealers so they could't get the part we needed. I understand that; that is how business works sometimes.

I then contact Olympic pool and Spa. They ask me to send them a picture of the part and try to get the model number. I did them one better by already getting them all the information and gave them [this direct link to the part and the picture.]( https://www.google.com/shopping/product/3448982877395348785?hl=en&amp;gs_nf=3&amp;gs_rn=1&amp;gs_ri=serp&amp;tok=-MHFCedEiEyR9_RpYYEk3g&amp;ds=sh&amp;pq=balboA+MVP260&amp;cp=15&amp;gs_id=9&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=balboA%20MVP260%20/&amp;pf=p&amp;safe=off&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;oq=balboA+MVP260+/&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;bpcl=39967673&amp;ion=1&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=837&amp;emsg=NCSR&amp;noj=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ToXLUOmhEeni2QXN1YHoCA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDoQgggwAA) He says he has the email and he will look through his database and price it for me. 

He calls back 3 hours later and says he has found it. It is $135 dollars which is bit more expensive but i understand this man needs to eat too and he is probably only making 35 to 40 bucks on the sale by getting it through his distributor. I say go ahead and order it. I thank him for his time and go about my business. 

The part comes in and I go to pick it up. I can see it's not the right part but I'm just some guy messing around with my moms hot tub. He is the pool guy after all. I raise my concerns but he assures me it is fine. I go home and try it out nothing works correctly. One button puts it into economy mode another that is supposed to turn on the light runs the jets there is no light button it just a mess. 

Now I know most errors are user error so i think I sent him the wrong link. I check the link in my sent folder That is when i see it. If you look in the above link you can see under [related items this item.]( https://www.google.com/shopping/product/13543399622709213265?hl=en&amp;gs_rn=1&amp;gs_ri=serp&amp;tok=-MHFCedEiEyR9_RpYYEk3g&amp;ds=sh&amp;pq=balboA+MVP260&amp;cp=15&amp;gs_id=9&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=balboA+MVP260+/&amp;pf=p&amp;safe=off&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;oq=balboA+MVP260+/&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;bpcl=39967673&amp;ion=1&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=837&amp;emsg=NCSR&amp;noj=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W_fdUPv6LYas2gXh7oGIBA&amp;ved=0CB4QrRI) This guy had the balls to use the work I did to try to cheat me out of an extra 52 bucks and send me the wrong part even after i confirmed the part number to him 3 times over the phone. 

I'm pissed but mistakes happen so i call him to try to resolve it. 

Owner: Hello this is Olympic pool and spa.

Me: Hi I was in there a bit earlier to pick up that hot tub part. It doesn't seem to be the right part and isn't coded correctly.

Owner: Sorry sir but we don't do refunds.

Me: Listen. I try to go through local businesses to help small businesses flourish. I have checked the part number and it isn't correct. You confirmed with me that it will work just fine or i wouldn't have taken it. I see the part you ordered isn't the right part and the number you confirmed isn't the right number. I am pretty pissed that you would do this but if you could just order the right...

Owner: Now you listen. Don't you cuss at me. I am a god damned business working the United States of America. I can choose to sell, mark up and price items as i see fit. You signed the order. You deal with it. 

Me: Sir I never signed anything. If i could just get the part we agreed upon I'll be out of your hair. 

Owner: Bring the card and the part into the store and we will just refund it asshole. 

I drive in and go to the desk. 

Me: Here it is.

Owner: We don't refund electronic items. Take the part and go home.

Me: So you had me drive here just to waste my time. 

Owner: Pretty much.

Me: But it isn't even the right part check the link i sent you. 

Owner: I did and it is the right part. You don't know what you are talking about.  

Me: You are sitting right in front of a computer i can pull up the email right now. It isn't the right part you ordered the 75 dollar part, charged me for the 135 dollar part and didn't even make sure it was compatible. 

Owner: It's my business I can do whatever I god damned well please. I work in the United States of America. 

Me: Okay now you listen to me asshole. You have 3 options. You take the part and give me the money back. I take the part and call the bank and get my money back. Or you take the part and I call the bank and get my money back. They all result with me getting my money back. The only option you have is whether or not you keep the part. 

With a glare the owner says ""Will you at least pay for the shipping?"" 

I left.

Never again. When amazon shuts them down It will make the pool part market in Omaha infinitely better. I know its long but buyer beware. They are greedy shysters that only care about their bottom line. 

TL;DR: The owner of Olympic Pool and Spa are giant dicks and when caught in a ""mistake"" will adamantly deny it and blame the customer. When trying to be civil and work well with them they still refused until I escalated it out of their control.

1334725474.0,36,self.Omaha,sfjyl,Went to Family Fun Center,bromaha247,45,9,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/Omaha/comments/sfjyl/went_to_family_fun_center/,"Went to the Family Fun Center for the first time since they closed down on friday with friends and figured a review comparing the old place to the new place was much needed considering how much is different. So here it is broken up into categories.

First in doors:

When you first walk into the doors and if you've gone into the old Fun Center before this place seems like a completely different building. The counter is an interesting but cool looking sheet metal and black, a much better looking counter than the ugly red and faded white that i remember. When i looked at the games i noticed they all had these weird boxes on them. The place was PACKED full of people and looking around i couldn't help but notice that it wasn't shady at all compared to the old building.

Counter:

When we walked up to the counter we had brought some old tokens with us expecting it to still be the old token and ticket games from the old place. Instead they sold us these really cool looking game cards that automatically save all the tickets onto the card for you. The guy at the register let us put all the tokens onto the card thankfully so that was a big bonus in my book.

Golf: 

First thing we wanted to play was the golf so we bought the golf balls and headed over to the course by the doors. Compared to the old golf course that I remember it is a BIG improvement. The course has a couple holes where there are like drawbridges and other odd moving parts. Thankfully there was no giant holes in the wall and graffiti on everything like the old one use to always have. Overall it's much better flow and looks alot better.

Games:

When we got done with the golf all of us had a couple bucks on our game cards and decided to play a couple of em. I could tell that they had gotten a few new ones in but unfortunately it was all basically the same games from before. On the plus side, i didn't have a single problem with any game i played. I remember years ago me and my parents went there and my parents decided to leave after about 10 minutes in there due to all the tokens and tickets jamming on us. Overall, love the idea of cards but please get some more retro games or new ones would love to see a centipede or other type in there.

Lasertag:

When we got done about 4 of us decided to go try out the lasertag because that was always our favorite thing to play whenver we went to the old one. Bought the passes and walked over there and HOLY HELL the line was long! The guy running it said it would be 45 minute wait. So we sat and waited what seemed like for forever watching each small group to go in one after another. When we were sitting watching the others go in and listening to music one of my friends went up and asked the guy if they were planning on getting more vests. He said that they were being worked on and hopefully soon they would have alot more vests. The family of 5 ahead of us decided that the wait was too long so we thankfully got to go in early. When you first go in it's basically the exact same same as the other fun center except ALOT more open. Overall it's always fun to play lasertag at the Fun Center and had the usual experience.

Paintball:

I had never known that they had paintball there but my friend was explaining to me how it worked and was pretty interested to try it out. Went and bought cards to play it and waited in line. Tip for anyone wanting to play paintball there... ask if they are running a tournament! There were soo many damn kids waiting around the area. I guess the school they went to decided to have a paintball tournament there. So we waited and waited and finally we just got smashed together with some other group that was waiting in line so it was 6 on 6. They showed us this video and i gotta say, I couldn't hear a damn thing! The room is so surrounded by outside noise none of us could hear it! After we watched the video the 3 guys running it got us all setup with real paintball guns and masks and everything. The game overall itself is quite the adrenaline rush! You gotta be careful in the arena though because I was running down by like some tire setup and slid on a bunch of those little things and landed on my gun! They sting a little but not for more than a second. Afterwards when we got done me and my friends went outside and looked at each other and noticed we had welts on us. Apparently I got one on my side I didn't really even feel, think it might have been the adrenaline or something.

Prize Area:

As we were about to leave we all decided to get some prizes from the little prize area in the middle. When we walked up fortunately there was no one else waiting so we were helped right away. The girl helping us scanned the cards and we got our prizes. The area itself looks basically the exact same except black and silver instead of the ugly red and faded white which was a much bigger improvement.

Final thoughts:

Overall I would have to say the Fun Center needed a makeover and they got it almost completely right. I don't like how it seems almost smaller than the other building and how it seems like there is much fewer games, but they made up for it on everything else they had. I would have to say I didn't think the old one or the ""ghetto Piazza Machine"" as we use to call it could make the switch-over to Millard. Obviously they were able to and to them I say congrats and am looking forward to coming there more often considering it's a fraction of the price of pizza machine but basically the same thing. Btw I also heard 2 guys working there at paintball discussing Reddit so I know you guys are on here.

The national weather service has issued a winter storm watch for our area for a pretty impressive, slow moving storm set to impact Omaha and the surrounding area over Friday evening and Saturday. 

While there is still some uncertainty in storm track  and precipitation type, it appears that 6+ inches of snow are quite possible in the immediate vicinity of Omaha.  Even though this storm is temporally near, this uncertainty is something which must be watched, as even small changes in temperature or track will significantly alter snow totals. 

[At present, the NWS expects a track just north of the city,](http://i.imgur.com/H9kGb.png) though I would probably say heaviest snows will actually fall just south of us. 

Keep an eye on the forecast over at[ weather.gov](http://www.crh.noaa.gov/oax/), and monitor travel plans closely.

Very white.  I've lived in/around (or visited enough to have a good feel for) Morgantown, WV; Washington, D.C.; Baltimore, MD; Philadelphia, PA; Rochester, NY; New York, NY; Pittsburgh, PA; Milwaukee, WI; Chicago, IL, and Houston, TX.  Omaha is the whitest city I've ever been to.  I went out Friday night and was out in public all of Saturday.  I saw maybe 25 non-whites.  

* Drinks are super cheap in Omaha.

* Omaha redditors are legit.  Some of them are [really helpful.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Omaha/comments/yduli/any_omaha_redditors_able_to_fulfill_a_ridiculous/).  Others drive sweet vehicles with bench seating.  At least one of them can kiss pretty well.

* The Drover has amazing steak.  Amazing like, ""I want to have sex with this steak"" steak.

* Talking like Bane with your friends after you've been drinking for +4 hours is much more fun than you might expect.

* Shooting assault rifles is ridiculously fun.  And expensive. And a little terrifying.

This is just a reminder post for the BarCraft event at [The Lauter Tun](http://thelautertun.com/).

[Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Omaha/comments/1jak9i/omaha_barcraft_beers_of_liberty/)

We are very excited to host the first BarCraft in Omaha!  We are looking to expand out to other games in the future, but tomorrow is all about Starcraft!  The official Starcraft page gave us a shout out the other day: [seen here](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151806105627457&amp;set=a.305747407456.191804.178337772456&amp;type=1)

[BarCraft facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/events/459112907518642/)
____

**Details**

Location: 3309 Oakview Dr. Suite 102, Omaha, Nebraska 68144

**Doors open at Noon**  - 4 hours earlier than normal.

**Entry**:  21+ is free entry, IDs will be check at the door and hands will be stamped with our logo.  Anyone under 21 will have to pay a cover (Right now the amount is slipping my mind, but I will edit this when I find out) and a lovely black X on both hands.  If you wash them off, you will be asked to leave (we do understand that washing your hands pulls ink off, but you can tell if you REALLY tried).  We are only letting up to 10 underage people in the bar, due to the fact that we cater 99% alcohol and 1% Non-alcoholic beverages.

**Prizes/Raffle**:  Blizzard was kind enough to send us a box of fun stuff! When you enter, you will get a ticket for drawings as the day goes on. You can acquire more of them by purchasing our Starcraft themed drinks.

Prizes include:

* Battle.net authenticators 
* T-shirts
* Bottle openers
* Stickers
* Lanyards 
* 2 Razer Spectre Gaming Mice (Starcraft: WoL and HotS edition)

**Food**: So far, no food is going to be provided, but ***YOU ARE ALLOWED*** to bring in outside food.  We have Jimmy Johns right next door and plenty of places will deliver if you are hungry.

**Drinks**: We have 2 shots and 3 mixed drinks that are Starcraft specific.  We will be making our regular drinks as well, but we encourage you to try at least one of the Starcraft drinks.  As far as beer goes, we have 22 taps and a lot of bottles.  The regular rotation should be up to date on the website, so have a look.

**End of Event**: The official event will be over when a WCS champion is crowned.  Feel free to stay after the event is over to continue drinking and conversing with fellow Starcraft fans.
___

Starcraft Themed Drinks:

* Archon (Drink)
* Zerg Creep (Drink)
* Vespene Gas (Drink)
* Hellbat (Shot)
* Stimpack (Shot)

All of them are very delicious (we have tested them on random customers).  I wish I had some better pictures, but drank a few before we thought about it.  [The small amounts left over](http://i.imgur.com/yd0Pnfk.jpg).  We have made some minor modifications to the drinks.

___

I have put a decent amount of work into this event, but /u/ieppenbaugh has put a ton of work and effort into making this successful.

**If you plan on getting completely trashed, please make sure you have a ride back home or ask myself or any of the workers to call a cab for you, we don't want anyone getting a DUI or worse.**

I was given Skyrim for Christmas, but I do not want it. Blasphemy, I know. Anyway, I don't have any friends to give the game to, and I don't wanna just go sell it at Gamers (I actually don't know if they'd buy it from me), so I'm giving it away.  
    
It's a hard copy, seen [here](http://i.imgur.com/CCwt2.jpg). I unwrapped the plastic from the case but I haven't even removed the disk from it. The code to activate the game is inside, unused obviously. I don't have much of a way to prove this, but I can assure you the game will work.  
    
I'm not asking for money or favors, or anything at all actually. I just want to feel like I've done something nice for someone. I was kicked out of my mom's house this week (I'm 18) and I'm currently living with my grandmother. I feel horrible after everything, and want a moral boost.  
    
I don't have a car anymore, meaning you'd have to come get the game from me yourself. I live around the 144th and Blondo area, and can give more specific directions to anyone who's interested.  
    
Happy Holidays and all that.

There is a possibility that I could move to Omaha from South Florida, my girlfriend is currently interviewing there and if she gets the position it may be a go depending on whether everything else lines up.  I would probably ask my employer if a transfer is possible, if so great, if not id have to look for something else. 

Unfortunately I have never been to Omaha. My GF says she likes it and reminds her of Germany a bit (landscape wise) or Denver minus mountains. The closest I have been to NE is Denver CO which i have visited a few times for a few days at a time. I must say I really liked Denver, but I know NE is not necessarily like it (no mountains). 
Have any of you lived in South Florida and moved to Omaha? If so which did you like best? Otherwise how about compared to Denver (sorry but as mentioned that's the closest i have to compare to NE).


We are both in our early-mid 30's, no kids, we like to stay active and by that I mean gym/spinning/martial arts etc..(which we do here)
We would love to do more outside activities but unfortunately the extreme heat year round is not very conducive here in FL. 
We are not really beach/water sport persons so will not miss that, we like mountains, although i know we would not  have that either in NE.
We hate the traffic here, not only is gets congested but people drive like assholes (tailgating, flipping off etc..)
We hate that there's no seasons (other than hot, hotter and hell)
We are not really into the south beach/crazy party scene so wont miss that. However a bar once in a while, restaurants and definitely rock/metal concerts are something we do like..
Speaking of music, no rock stations in south Florida how is that possible?!

Things we do like about South FL however i that, everything is close by, we have all the conveniences we need within a 10-15 minute ride (gym/martial arts/whole foods/countless restaurants), we don't have to deal with snow although i must say I would love to have some snow, just not all year round! 
Of course we have friends here so that's a tough one leaving behind but we'd be willing to do it if its for the best.

Unfortunately having never been in Omaha all i get is stereotypes when i mention it to people here...""Omaha? whats out there? only cornfields and pastures"" I know they are silly but obviously people here have no clue. Most people do like living here i guess so they could never consider the thought of leaving beaches and nightlife for the Midwest.

What do you like about Omaha and what do you dislike? Would you live elsewhere?

Thanks!!

So go you Omaha, I have a number of friends from your city, and I'm regularly impressed by it and it's populace.

I knew we had an online townhall, but I found out today via that same site that there is an Omaha app for reporting graffiti, potholes, downed tree-limbs, etc. And the crazy thing is that it's actually not too badly designed. There was an Omaha weather app that came out a little over a year ago, but it was awful; they never updated it, it force closed all the time, and during good weather it would tell you we were having a blizzard.

Anyhow, the new app is pretty cool, but if you haven't tried out the website it's not too bad either. You'll find it at www.EngageOmaha.com. Basically the site is a really easy way to give your input into the goings on of the city. One of the big things they just got off the ground is credit-card enabled parking meters. The idea started on the site, and through a system of votes, was taken to the top of the list, and to Mayor Suttle. They have already been purchased and will be installed sometime this year. 

TL;DR: Omaha has an app and a townhall website. If you want to have some say-so in what happens here, check it out. ",,False,self,t5_2qihb,False,,,True,t3_16kqd5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Omaha/comments/16kqd5/omaha_has_its_own_app_and_its_own_online_townhall/,

I ordered Madden '13 from Gamevault (across from Stinson Park @ Aksarben) months ago, and I called them today to see if they were having a midnight release. While they weren't having an event due to low interest, the person I spoke with, who I presume is the owner, offered to meet me at the store at midnight to give me the game I ordered. 

I wasn't expecting that at all, and they definitely won me over as a customer for life. I won't be going back to any of the shitty Gamers stores, and I won't be going to any of the gamestops or best buys, wal marts, etc either.

EDIT: I was accused of being affiliated in some way with Gamevault, and I assure you I am not.

http://i.imgur.com/3bX3i.jpg

There was also a Dart brand 20 oz generic white styrofoam cup with a chocolate milkshake in it. It would have happened during the end of the Husker game (10:00 ish), so the store would have likely been open then. Any idea of a place that fits these criteria? That is, sells chocolate milkshakes in generic cups and water cups with this style? I drove around asking gas stations and the like, but most use branded cups. So I'm assuming it would be a mom-and-pop store. Around Dundee area.

Any help would be appreciated, and if it leads to me finding these fuckers I'll gladly pay for the redditors meal next meetup (I might actually show up to one just for that reason).

Please, r/Omaha, show me your kindness and wisdom!

EDIT 1: Not gas stations. eCreamery may still be an option. They've been closed, however, so I haven't been able to see their cups. B &amp; G's was close. They have milkshakes, but not in their styrofoam, and the other cups don't look like the ones with shit in them. Broncos are branded. Petrows is closed on Sundays so I couldn't check there. Any other ideas? I feel like today would have been the golden day of ""Who got a chocolate milkshake and two waters last night"". Further it is away, less likely they'll remember.

but the big thing is, i really just don't know how to go about doing this. i have enough money for a plane ticket, but that's about it. if i were to go to omaha, i wouldn't plan on leaving until sometime in august or so, and by then i could probably have upwards of 500 dollars saved. 

here are my concerns:
1) will i get murdered/raped? is there a high crime rate?
2) when i get off the plane, where can i stay?
3) i have never planned any sort of trip before, and i'm scared.

i just really need a change. my parents fucked me over when it came to college, so now i'm stuck at home going to a community college. i wouldn't mind at all, but my parents are crazy and we fight ALL. THE TIME. all of my friends are going to college, so i figure i'll be just as lonely here as i would if i were in a new city by myself. 

if any native omaha-er is willing to help me plan my great escape, i will just be eternally grateful. i know this is what i want to do, and even it's the wrong choice or the right choice, i'm willing to take a chance and find out.

**EDIT:** i am currently at my friend's house in northampton, ma, and hopefully will end up living here. my friend greg and i talked, and ultimately we decided i just need some space from my family and everything. i think the omaha thing was just me being emotional and drastic, but it could happen some day. and i just want to say, redditors are a breed of their own. there is too much kindness here, i can't believe it. i read all of your comments and considered everything, so thank you for all the advice, everyone.",,False,self,t5_2qihb,1342161687.0,,,True,t3_wg2rk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Omaha/comments/wg2rk/life_advice_needed_involving_omaha/,

Wood floors throughout the entire place. A detached garage. Garden space in the backyard. The neighbors are super cool, i've never had any complaints.

PM me if you're interested and I can give you more info about the duplex. It's a cool place, and I'd like to see it go to someone who'll appreciate it.

I shopped around online and found that the lofts were wicked expensive. In this over priced world of pre-manufactured every thing I felt that I would eventually just pay up and have someone ship me a loft. Until I got the bright idea to have one made for me. I started with google, I mean who doesn't these days. I called a half dozen ""carpenters"" and ""handy men"". I was really surprised at the lack of professionalism that I experienced. I left detailed messages about my project and my contact information. No one got back to me.  
    
Next stop Craigslist. I bcc'd a [message](http://imgur.com/omTHr) to every skilled tradesmen whose email address matched with the key word search ""woodworking"".  

[This](http://imgur.com/cpa0q) guy one the job. This was the most professional, well thought out, and personal response I received to my original request for an estimate. Other estimates were ""I'll meet you at your place, but I am thinking $2000"". ""I can do ur projec for $1200 + expense"" Really? Did you even research the project or did you just throw out a number and not spell check your shit?!!?!?!  
  
My carpenter sent me this pic before he delivered http://imgur.com/M5p1S  

The final loft bed is better than I expected. The [pics](http://i.imgur.com/sWjlU) aren't the best because they are from my droid. But I have a huge desk for my sewing machine, my laptop, my computer, and whatever else I want. The entire structure takes up about 50 square feet and hold my queen sized bed too. Did I mention the desk is awesome? Oh, and the desk is made from birch.  
Best $600 I have ever spent, mainly because I got what I wanted, and didn't have to lift a finger.

Also, while you're following the law that says you should be in the street, please abide by traffic laws as well.  I'm seeing more of us around, and I'm a little afraid the cops are going to catch on and start ticketing us just like drivers.  The more we follow the laws, the longer we'll stay under the radar.  So stop at red lights and stop signs.  Signal your turns and lane changes.  Stay as far to the right as you can unless you're turning left.  Use lights after dark.

We walked in, found a table and ordered a pizza and a couple of beers.  It was $25 for a large pizza.  In total, we spent around $45 dollars.  We would have spent more if it wasn't for Goodnight's policy on water.

When our pizza came, we asked if we could get a couple waters.  We were told by our waitress that we could only get bottled water for $3.50 a piece.  For the 5 of us, it would have been $17 just for water!  The waitress told us that she couldn't even get us some cups with ice so we could fill them up in the bathroom sink.

After dinner, my brother asked the manager why they were instituting such a policy for customers that are buying food.  The manager told him that he didn't want everyone coming into the restaurant just for water.  He continued to say that we should have planned on spending more money next time.  He was condescending and made a scene in the front end of the restaurant.  I can understand the restaurant's hesitations, but no water even for customers buying food?    

I understand that restaurants in other areas can charge for water but can Omaha restaurants?  What if the customer is pregnant?  Drunk?  Diabetic?  Elderly?  Further, is this a policy that Omaha residents should get used to?  Honestly, such treatment of Omaha residents and its visitors is something that really bothers me.

I'm looking to create a free and open community of local beginner/amateur/professional programmers to meet in person to learn, teach, and share expertise with programming languages and tools. This would include anything from JS to R.

Here's why:
* Receiving help in person, especially for newbies is critical.
* I see communities in larger cities that provide this support for [MOOCs](https://www.coursera.org/) and haven't seen it in Omaha.
* If a member of the community lacks expertise with a particular language or tool, then interested members can collaborate to develop expertise.

Here's how, assuming participants have their own laptop:
* Use local libraries for Internet access and location, all but UNO close at 8pm Mon-Thurs or 6pm Fri-Sat, and are closed on Sunday. All the Omaha Public Libraries have study rooms except the Dale branch downtown.

Who is interested?

Do you have questions, comments, or concerns about this idea?

From the Colorado state line, US 6 starts going southeast. The first town it goes into is Imperial. US 6 conjoins with US 34 near Culbertson, passing through McCook. US 6 then moves to the northeast, through Hastings. At Hastings, US 34 diverges and moves north. US 6 parallels Interstate 80 north of Milford until it reaches Lincoln. At Lincoln, US 6 becomes Cornhusker Highway, and moves north of I-80, until Gretna. There US 6 moves due north and becomes the West Dodge Expressway and Dodge Street in Omaha. It passes through downtown Omaha on parallel one-way streets and runs concurrent with Interstate 480 in Omaha on its last Nebraska segment. East of Omaha, it crosses the Missouri River to enter Iowa at Council Bluffs, on a girder bridge completed in 1966 that replaced the Ak-Sar-Ben Bridge, which was the first road bridge to connect the two cities.

For the Elmwood Park pre-meetup please make reference of this image here: http://i.imgur.com/K6oUG.png

We will be located somewhere in the vicinity of the red circle. We may also be down in the brick area near the tunnel, so look there. If for some reason when you get there you can't find us, or don't know who we are call my number at (571) 402-4588.

After the Elmwood Park portion of the meetup we will proceed to Gerdas along the orange line. I would highly prefer that anyone that is going to be attending the Gerdas portion of the meetup be there either with us at the park or at Gerdas by 5 o'clock, as they will have another large party coming in around 6 and Gerda wants to be able to get us served before that group gets in. So please if at all possible get to Gerdas by 5.

After the group gets dinner at Gerdas we'll make a group trip over to Legends for a bit while we decide on where to go for the after-event.

If you are going to be coming to the meetup sometime after 5 o'clock give me a call at the aforementioned number so you can determine if we are at Gerda's, Legends, or someplace else.

Also for Gerdas, there is a parking lot with parking for Gerdas customers two building to the east of her actual building that should hopefully still have some spots open just so you aren't wandering around the neighborhoods trying to find an adequate place to park your vehicle.

TL;DR:

- Elmwood near red dot
- Be at Gerdas by 5 if you are coming to Gerdas portion
- Be at Gerdas by 5 if you are coming to Gerdas portion

EDIT: Thank you all so much, this thread is why I love reddit as a community.  I honestly wasn't expecting so many awesome, and useful responses.  You've all helped me feel less alone, it's good to know that there are others like me out there, if only just a few.

**EDIT** : I've decided to try and make this an impromptu meetup.  I will be at Caffeine Dreams Thursday the 27th at like 8:30ish. If anyone is free, or bored, or nearby please stop by and we can talk about science, or how crazy our religious friends are, or something. I hope enough of you check back and see this that I don't just sit alone all night. I'll be wearing an obnoxiously bright orange hoodie, it's so bright it sometimes pisses me off.  I'm not sure how crowded they'll be, but I'm going to try to sit inside.

Hey all, I would just like to thank those of you who have been showing up to play over the last few months.  I have some updated info for people who aren't in the know or who did not see the initial post.

The Omaha Chapter of the American Outlaws (a U.S. Soccer supporters group) has been putting on a weekly open pick up games all summer.  The weekly pickup game is every Thursday night at 6 p.m; we now play at St. Margret Mary field near 62nd and Dodge.  The games have gotten fairly large, with consistent turnouts of 20+ people.

In addition to the Thursday game, a group on meetup.com formed a weekly Tuesday night game that has a great turnout as well.  This game is also at 6 p.m. at St. Margret Mary field.  There is also a game on Sunday in Bellevue listed on meetup.com as well but the time/location details change.  The population of players at the games usually overlaps because people enjoy coming out several times a week to play.  We also scrimmaged the American Outlaws Lincoln Chapter down in Lincoln two weeks ago and had a blast.

Players of all age, gender and skill levels are welcomed to come out and play.  I would recommend wearing cleats for sure, shin guards are optional.  We see new faces every week and would love to see some more redditors on the field!

We're in Waterloo, which is a bit of a drive for some of you but because we're outside of Omaha city limits our selling permit is cheaper and we use all volunteer work, so our prices are significantly cheaper than anything you could find in Omaha.

As an added bonus for making the drive and beating the heat, if you tell them Sky sent you, they'll take an extra 10% off of your order. 

I know it's a bit of a drive to get there but if you're buying in any sort of volume, it'll be more than worth the drive. Plus it's supporting schools instead of the pockets of the for-profit stands!

So some friends and I are planning on going camping in a few weeks. We're going to do some hiking/backpacking and we're going to be sleeping in tents.

I think it would be cool to be around a lake, but that's not necessary. Mostly I'm hoping someone can inform me on the campground with the best hiking trails and best overall quality.

We've so far been considering Hitchcock Nature Center campgrounds, Platte River State Park, and possibly Indian Cave, but we're not sure yet. 

Thank you!

Where and what is popular these days?,Wax_Paper,23,8,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/Omaha/comments/15iall/young_omaha_redditors_i_feel_old_where_and_what/,"It's been a long time since I've been ""out on the town,"" and even *longer* since the days of regularly hanging out in spots like the Market, the Miracle Hills area of bars or the newer Slowdown/northeast stomping grounds...

Obviously places like the Old Market and downtown-in-general will *always* be hotspots, but I'm curious about how the scene has evolved throughout the past 5 or 6 years. What other areas of Omaha are fun and popular these days, whether it's well-known and trendy or ""divey"" and niche?

I'd also like to hear about the music scene these days, as well... I was a pretty hardcore member of the local music crowd from the early-90s, up until the Ranch Bowl closed (in 2004?) and just a bit later, when some of the last shows I remember seeing were at Sokol and that Irish bar next to the strip club on 72nd and Dodge... Actually, I've been to a couple gigs at the Slowdown since then, but those were for touring bands.

What else are the wicked little heathens in Omaha up to these days? Are warehouse and massive house parties still pretty popular? Are the same downtown clubs still dominating the dance scene like they pretty much always have? (And just for my own personal shits 'n giggles, is The Run *still* doing after-hours until 4am on the weekends? And did they *ever* finish building that fabled ""second dance floor"" in the back?)

Help me feel (somewhat) relevant again and tell me what's happening!

Cheers!

PS: If any younger redditors are curious about the hardcore Omaha party crowd a half-generation before them (what we did, where we went, how we made our small city seem big when we were the same age as you and your friends), just ask...

I remember a couple of threads awhile back with people attempting to put together an indoor team.  It seemed like at least 10+ people were interested but it just never happened.  However, there is still hope...

The Omaha Chapter of the American Outlaws (a U.S. Soccer supporters group) has put together an weekly open pickup game.  The plan is to have them every Thursday at 6 p.m. at Lewis and Clark Middle School in midtown (the practice fields, not in the actual stadium).  If you are interested just show up.  We played last Thursday and started off with 11 people and eventually played against another group of guys that showed up.  Fun was had by all.

For updates and additional information, check AO Omaha's facebook page at http://www.facebook.com/AOomaha.  Hope to see you out there!

Well, the only problem is that tons of people you are interested in the movement have no idea what reddit even is(which is why they are trying to do all of this through facebook). I was thinking that if enough of us were to go to the OccupyOmaha facebook pages(there are more than one unfortunately) and tell them that we have a legit forum setup at www.reddit.com/r/occupyomaha maybe we can get enough people involved to actually gain some traction.

Every team gets a dry erase board; you write down the answer to the question after each question is asked and your answers are checked live (almost eliminating cheating). Scores are recorded live and tracked on an excel spreadsheet projected onto the wall.  After all categories are over, there is a final jeopardy round where each team can risk up to 10 points.  

There's also new prizes:
- Random prize at intermission (usually a pitcher; chosen by hosts)
- 2nd place gets $25 towards their bar tab
- 1st place gets free tab + gets to make a category for next quiz

We've been twice now, it's pretty awesome.  The Slowdown has a ton more beer options than the Sydney but the downside is, obviously, the prices are much higher.  It's Tuesday nights at 9PM, 5-person teams.  I'm not sure if they are doing it this Tuesday since it is New Year's Day, might want to call the Slowdown and ask.

The economy might be to blame as well. Nobody wants to build anything, so nobody is hiring any AE firms, so nobody is looking for entry level workers.  But I don't like putting blame solely on the economy.

I guess what I am trying to say is (and I hate sounding like those Kaplan commercials) I can't get a job with no experience and I can't get experience without a job.  I do have a bachelors in AE, and I want to get my masters degree. But I'm worried I might still face the problem of having no actual experience vs the other 5-10 year experienced applicants out there.

----------

Locale preferences:

1. **Initial** venue must be all-ages. After-event locales do not have this restriction.
2. Public locale please, we aren't having official meetups at residences.
2.  Locally owned businesses take slight preference over national chains, but national chains are still considered.
4.  Locale should be able to support a group of 10 to possibly 20 without separation of the group to more than 1 table, taking reservations long in advance is a big plus.
5. Locale must not have a ""fee to enter"" and must be feasible for broke folks.
6. After-event locales will always be considered with preference to vicinity to initial locale of a particular meetup.
7. If a venue is far out it will be a slight disadvantage.


------------------
When posting suggestions please specify if they are closed on any days and if the hours cannot be easily found through a Google search post them as well.

- One suggestion per post please.
-

- Pro/con discussion of venues is welcome and encouraged.

- Specifiy whether it's an initial or after-event suggestion if it doesn't qualify for both.

- Have photos of the suggestion? Feel free to post them.

- Have a menu for the locale? Feel free to post or link that as well.

- If you downvote a suggestion post and tell us why

- If a post has 5 downvotes and only 2 explanations, only 2 downvotes will be counted. (This is also to ensure not counting the ""fake downvotes"" that reddit ocassionally applies automatically as an anti-spam measure)

I have no set breaks during these shifts, instead I eat whenever I'm able.     
  
Is there anyone here that's familiar with Nebraska labor laws to know if that's legal? I understand that if I work more than 40 hours in a week then I'm entitled to overtime, but if a week is strictly defined as Sunday through Saturday then I'm not eligible.  
  
I've looked through http://www.dol.nebraska.gov/ and http://www.nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/browse-statutes.php but haven't found anything that addresses my question.   
  
Wisconsin has the following statute: Chapter 103.85 Wisconsin Statutes provides that: Employers operating factories or mercantile establishments (enterprises engaged in retail trade) in the State of Wisconsin must provide employees with at least one period consisting of 24 consecutive hours of rest in each calendar week.  
  
I guess I'm looking for a statute like that but for Nebraska.   
  
Edit: 

For clarification, I am salaried. The first seven shifts are in one pay period, the second are in another. They've done similar things to me before (usually not more than 9 days in a row) but they split it between pay periods so they can have me work &gt;80 hours without overtime. I've been talking with my supervisor and it sounds like I might be able to switch with someone. I think I'll still talk to a lawyer so that I know my rights because I'm sure this will come up again.

After seven hours at my house on Friday the Centurylink techs informed me that 1 gig wasn't available...yet. The sales people on the phone thought it was when they set up the appointment. The four different techs at my house thought it was while they were trying to install it. Ultimately though, no. The 1 gig modem they tried to install was a 'prototype.' The best they could get me was 100MB. What is available is a 'soft launch' of the service. You can get fiber straight to your home but you won't get your 1 gigabit of speed until a later date. As far as pricing goes, I bundled, so it's $49.99. 

If you do want the service, wait. Go to [whatisagig.com](http://www.whatisagig.com) and enter your info there. Don't bother signing up now because it's not available.

**Edit:** After the debacle on Friday my wife refused to let the techs leave before they restored our internet service from Cox. Which they did. They came back on Saturday and had to call numerous different numbers before finally getting help from someone. This is the Centurylink techs mind you...*they* had trouble getting help. Once they got the Centurylink internet up and running they claimined their laptop was 'running slow' and couldn't test the connection and left. I've tested the speed four different times, three of the four yielded no higher than 2 MBps DL and the fourth was almost 9 MBps DL.

I'm putting a lot of faith in Centurylink and assuming there's just a bad connection somewhere and this isn't a widespread problem. I'll update again on Monday or Tuesday.

**Edit 2:** Everything is installed and working. For whatever reason, being connected to my wireless router caused some bottlenecking. Once I connected to the CL router I got better results. speedtest.net still has me at &lt;10Mbps. Verizon FiOS speed test has me at 300+Mbps. I get varying results based on which website I use.

I'm with BLUEBARN's Witching Hour, (a theatre company downtown,) and I wanted to let Omaha redditors know about a crazy event we're running all this month:

[THE GREAT FINDENING!](http://witchingblog.wordpress.com/2012/09/10/an-introduction-to-the-great-findening/)

It's a really unusual event, we're trying to do something new to get new audiences excited about us and what we can do. I can honestly say I don't think anything like this has been done in town before.

It's free to participate, and you can win prizes collected from local businesses!

Basically,

* All this month, submit scavenger hunt photos to us online and follow along on facebook.

* On October 11th, we're hosting an in-world audio walking tour. (you download the show onto your ipod-thingy and walk around.) We charge for this part.

* After the tour, there's a big party where we announce the scavenger hunt winners!

download the rules for more info:

Hope to see some redditors this month!

actually, here's a bonus mystery-clue to start you off...

I was wondering how feasible is a commute from Omaha to Peru for a job. My gf applied for a job in Peru State College, I know there isn't much around that area, and from the people she was able to talk to in the college most of them commute from Lincoln or Omaha. This however is a good 70 miles or so. Some people (faculty) in the college carpool form Omaha/Lincoln. Is this a feasible drive given weather in NE? 

We live in South FL where obviously we get a lot of torrential rains/storms but no snow/ice. How is US 75  as far as getting plowed in winter etc..?

If she was to get the job and we would move I think we would move to Omaha since it would be easier to find a job for myself there, also coming from a medium city (Ft. Lauderdale) we'd like to keep it that way instead of going to a smaller city or town (eg. Nebraska City one of the options I have heard..)

My wife and I recently moved here from Las Vegas where the word ""Hockey"" fell on deaf ears. Now that we're back in the Midwest I'm hoping to find a great bar to catch a hockey game a few times a week. There are the obvious sports bar choices but, to be honest, I'd rather just watch from home than go to a place like buffalo wild wings etc. So, are there any good hockey bars here in Omaha? 

Edit: 

Thanks for all of the suggestions! I'll be checking out the bars near west Omaha soon. If you happen to see a guy in one of the bars alone screaming at the top of his lungs while a Wings game is on, you'll know that it is me.
