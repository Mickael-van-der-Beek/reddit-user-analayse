Just in case someone else is in the same position, I thought I'd point it out; it lets you provide multiple substrings from the results that you want.

`ido` supports substring matching.  So, for example, let's say that you are trying to open a particular .c file in a directory.  You hit `C-x C-f` to run `ido-find-file`.  You think that there's only a single .c file in that directory, so you type "".c"", expecting only a single option to have that string in its name and come up.  To your surprise, there's both a foo-internals.c and a foo-externals.c file.

Well, if you deleted the "".c"" bit, and started typing ""externals.c"", that'd get you the file in question.  But that seems wasteful; you've already filtered the possible files down to just two.

You can simply hit `C-SPC` or `C-@` to save your existing set of matches, then plug in more criteria.  So `C-x C-f .c C-SPC ex RET` would get you the file that you want.

This is probably old hat to serious ido users, but I'd been completely oblivious to it, and certainly wanted it.",,False,,t5_2qhwu,False,,,True,t3_1a57gy,http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1a57gy/if_you_use_ido_make_sure_that_you_know_about/,

1361158454.0,55,self.emacs,18qa15,Dired discussion,wadcann,65,10,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/18qa15/dired_discussion/,"I'm curious as to people's opinions on [Dired](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/DiredMode), and what if any dislikes they have, or tips for use.

I'm writing this because I hope to inspire some people who have not tried dired to give it a shot.  I took a very long time after starting to use emacs to seriously try out dired: I'd been using emacs for years before that point, and really regret not having tried it beforehand.

I don't see a huge number of posts about it on here, and I wonder a bit whether perhaps a lot of people were just like me: holding off and having not really tried it.

For those who have not used dired, it's a file-manager that displays a menu of files and directories and permits operating on them.  The closest program to dired I'd seen beforehand would probably have been [Midnight Commander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Commander).

I really like using dired or other file-managers when operating on files that are hard-to-specify-by-name, like filenames with foreign language characters in them or where I need to see the list of files to pick from.

Some basics: you can get into dired by hitting `C-x d`.  If you're not using ido-mode, simply using `C-x f` and opening a directory will also work.  Once in, ^ will move up a directory, navigating to a directory and hitting RET will enter it, and navigating to a file and hitting RET will open it.

You can also get a dired buffer containing a selected set of files: try `M-x find-name-dired` or `M-x find-grep-dired`.

You can flag files for deletion with ""d"" and execute flagged deletions with ""x"".  Hit ""R"" to rename or move a file, and ""C"" to copy it.  There is a [lot more to dired](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html), but that was enough to start me out when I started out.

Some init.el snippits that I find helpful for dired:

dired is smart about .tar.gz files, and lets one open a browser simply by hitting RET while point is on one.  It's also possible to make it do the same with .zip files:

    ;; Handle zip compression
    (eval-after-load ""dired-aux""
      '(add-to-list 'dired-compress-file-suffixes
                    '(""\\.zip\\'"" "".zip"" ""unzip"")))

I use ibuffer for my C-x C-b binding instead of list-buffers.  This has the ability to group buffers.  I tend to wind up with a lot of dired buffers, so it's nice to group them together:

    (setq ibuffer-saved-filter-groups
          (quote ((""default""
                   (""dired"" (mode . dired-mode))))))

By default, dired spends a lot of screen space showing the permissions and owner and modification time and so forth of a file: more than half of an 80 column display.  I very rarely want to refer to this material...I'd rather use the space for filenames.  There's a nice package called dired-details that will hide this by default and permit hiding and showing that information with `(` and `)`, and an add-on to that called dired-details+.  Some of the systems I work on have dired-details+ installed, and some don't, so I use it if present, and if not, ignore it so that loading my init file won't fail.

There's also a nice add-on called diredful, which permits assigning faces to particular filetypes.  I like to color-code images and .exe files, so I load that if present as well:

    ;;; Dired
    ;; Use details
    (add-hook 'dired-load-hook 'my-dired-load-hook)
    (defun my-dired-load-hook ()

      (if (require 'dired-details+ nil t)
          (setq dired-details-propagate-flag nil)

        (progn (message ""Notice: dired-details+ not present"")
               ;; If we don't have dired-details+, at least try for dired-details alone
               (if (require 'dired-details nil t)
                   (dired-details-install)
                 (message ""Notice: dired-details not present""))))
      (setq-default diredful-init-file ""~/.emacs-diredful.el"")
      ;; We can function on systems without diredful, even though it's nice to have
      (if (not (require 'diredful nil t))
          (message
           ""Notice: diredful not present; not using extended highlighting"")))

By default, dired shows filesizes in bytes.  This uses up a lot of screen space, and is usually not very useful to read: I almost never want the exact byte-size of a file, but rather a summary of how large it is.

Also, many file browsers these days auto-detect numeric fields, and if they are present, sort files numerically by that field instead of lexicographically.  And example would be three files: foo-1.zip, foo-9.zip, foo-14.zip.  By default, dired will first list foo-1.zip, then foo-14.zip, then foo-9.zip, because ""1"" comes before ""9"".  However, it's possible to ask dired to sort things numerically.  Here's how I ask for human-readable sizes and files sorted numerically:

    ;; Make sizes human-readable by default, sort version numbers
    ;; correctly, and put dotfiles and capital-letters first.
    (setq-default dired-listing-switches ""-alhv"")

Normally, when I try to copy a directory, dired asks me if I really want to do a recursive copy.  I always want to do this, and even if I didn't, the cost of accidentally starting a recursive copy isn't really all that bad.  This stops dired from prompting me:

    (setq dired-recursive-copies 'always)

Dired can execute a command on the file that point is currently on if you hit `!`.  However, this is a blocking operation: nothing else can happen in emacs while this is running.  This is obviously a problem if one wants to, say, play a movie or do some other long-running operation.  `&amp;` will start the command in the background.  Unfortunately, that stores the command's output in a buffer named ""Async Shell Command"" which will cause two running programs to crash into each other and complain.  It's possible to ask dired to come up with a unique name for each:

    ;; Allow running multiple async commands simultaneously
    (defadvice shell-command (after shell-in-new-buffer (command &amp;optional output-buffer error-buffer))
      (when (get-buffer ""*Async Shell Command*"")
        (with-current-buffer ""*Async Shell Command*""
          (rename-uniquely))))
    (ad-activate 'shell-command)

I use [emms](https://www.gnu.org/software/emms/), an emacs-based playlist manager and media player frontend.  I like having a keybinding to add the media files in an entire directory tree to emms from dired.

I also like to have an easy way to enter wdired, and do so with `C-c e`.  Instead of renaming a file one at a time, it's possible to use wdired, where a dired buffer becomes editable.  Make all the filename changes you want, using all of emacs' powerful text-editing tools, and then just hit C-c C-c when done to apply the changes.

    (defun my-dired-mode-hook ()
      ;; Let us have a key that puts the dired buffer into interactive renaming mode
      (local-set-key (kbd ""C-c e"") 'wdired-change-to-wdired-mode)
      (local-set-key (kbd ""M-p p"") 'emms-add-dired)
      )

    (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook
              'my-dired-mode-hook)

I sometimes use dired to open various sorts of files, and it's nice to be able to have dired be able to suggest the type automatically:

    (defun add-dired-extension-list (command extension-list)
      (mapc (lambda (extension)
              (add-to-list 'dired-guess-shell-alist-user (list extension command)))
            extension-list))


    (add-hook 'dired-load-hook
              (function (lambda ()
                          (load ""dired-x"")
                          (add-dired-extension-list ""mplayer -really-quiet --"" (make-regex-file-extension-list (make-file-part-extensions '(""avi"" ""mkv"" ""mpg"" ""mpeg"" ""mp4"" ""flv"" ""wmv"" ""rm"" ""asf"" ""wav"" ""VOB"" ""ram"" ""divx"" ""mov"" ""ogv"" ""flc"" ""swf""))))
                          (add-dired-extension-list ""xterm -e mplayer --"" (make-regex-file-extension-list (make-file-part-extensions '(""spx"" ""flac"" ""mp3"" ""ogg""))))
                          (add-to-list 'dired-guess-shell-alist-user (list ""\\.cbr$"" ""comix --""))
                          (add-dired-extension-list ""evince --"" (make-regex-file-extension-list (make-file-part-extensions '(""pdf"" ""ps""))))
                          (add-to-list 'dired-guess-shell-alist-user (list ""\\.pdf$"" ""evince --""))
                          (add-to-list 'dired-guess-shell-alist-user (list ""\\.cbz$"" ""comix --""))
                          )))

A common paradigm in text-based file managers is the two-pane [orthodox file manager](http://www.softpanorama.org/OFM/index.shtml); Norton Commander and Midnight Commander are among these.  I'm not a tremendous fan of these, but they do have one very nice feature: I often work with two directories, and do things like want to do many operations where I move files from one directory to another.  It's possible to ask dired to, if there are two dired windows open, suggest the other as a target for operations from the first:

    ;; Try suggesting dired targets
    (setq dired-dwim-target t)

* Use emacsclient.  The most obvious thing to do is to use emacsclient instead of emacs; if you do that, a pre-existing emacs ""server"" instance will be used, if available.  That way, there *is* no emacs startup.  If you want a new graphical window each time, `emacsclient -a """" -c` is probably what you want; the `-a """"` will cause a new emacs instance to be started if one isn't already running, and `-c` will cause a new frame to be opened.

    I like running emacs in a terminal only, with a new xterm popping up containing an emacsclient instance if emacs is launched from, say, Firefox.  If you think you'd like the same behavior, I've just [posted a script](http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1auowq/script_for_using_terminalbased_emacs_as_editor_on/).
    
* Many packages require loading for use to be made of them.  Since this often requires modifying one's ~/.emacs.d/init.el file to contain a `(requires 'foo)` snippit, it adds to the difficulty of using emacs for new users.  Many Linux distros simply have emacs packages that must be loaded drop off a file in `/etc/emacs/site-start.d`.  Every time emacs is started, it executes every file in here, and loads every package installed on the system.  This makes things simpler for a user — he doesn't have to see any elisp.  However, it also means that every emacs instance startup runs slower as more packages are installed on the system.

    If you're comfortable with loading up what you want and don't like the startup overhead, you can run `emacs --no-site-file`.
    
* Where possible, use `autoload` instead of `require`.

    It's possible to tell emacs in your ~/.emacs.d/init.el, ""if anyone tries to run function `foo` and it hasn't been loaded yet, load `bar.el`, and then try again to execute `foo`"".  This is done via a statement like the following:

        (autoload 'ibuffer ""ibuffer"" ""List buffers."" t)
        (global-set-key (kbd ""C-x C-b"") 'ibuffer)

    The `global-set-key` function will tell emacs to run the fancy colorized, grouping `ibuffer` package instead of the simpler `list-buffers` when a user his `C-x C-b`.  The `autoload` function says ""if the user tries running function 'ibuffer, and that function hasn't yet been loaded, try loading a file called ""ibuffer.el"" or ""ibuffer.elc"" and then repeat the attempt.
    
    This way, if you don't actually use ibuffer in a particular emacs run, ibuffer is never loaded up.
    
    I use autoloading heavily in my init.el:
    
        (autoload 'gid ""idutils"" nil t)
        (autoload 'gnuplot-make-buffer ""gnuplot"" ""open a buffer in gnuplot mode"" t)
        (autoload 'ansi-color-for-comint-mode-on ""ansi-color"" nil t)

    So on most emacs sessions, these packages never need to load.

    Another really common time I need to autoload something is if I install a package to handle a particular filetype.  Then, whenever I open that filetype, I want emacs to load up the package with the mode required to edit that filetype, and switch to the mode...but I don't want emacs to read through code to handle a bazillion different filetypes unless it really needs to do so.  Sometimes, I have multiple possible modes to edit a filetype, and some systems have one mode and others another...I'd like to load up only the mode that is actually installed on the system and that I most like.  Heres' the function I use, and some examples:
    
        (defun find-in-list (f list)
          ""Find an element for which f returns true in list and return that element""
          (let ((templist list))             
            (while (and templist (not (funcall f (car templist))))
              (setq templist (cdr templist)))
            (if (null templist)
                nil         
              (car templist))))

        ;; Given a list of ((filetype-regex, (""libname"", ""Description"",
        ;; 'function-symbol)...)...), for a given filetype, finds the first

    In the above example, I'm loading up tuareg-mode for Ocaml files if it's available on a system.  If not, I fall back to sml-mode.  If that's not available, I just use whatever emacs defaults to.
    
    All code released to the public domain.

* Use locate-library to only use a particular feature if a system has it installed.
    
    I often work with older systems; some don't have, say, ibuffer installed.  I'd hate to have to maintain a different init.el for those systems.  What I do is make the load conditional on the library being present, so that my init file won't fail while trying to autoload a package that isn't present:
    
        ;;; ibuffer
        (if (locate-library ""ibuffer"")
            (progn
              (setq ibuffer-saved-filter-groups
                    (quote ((""default""
                             (""shell"" (mode . shell-mode))
                             (""dired"" (mode . dired-mode))))))

              (add-hook 'ibuffer-mode-hook 
                        (lambda ()
                          (ibuffer-switch-to-saved-filter-groups ""default"")))

              (setq ibuffer-show-empty-filter-groups nil)

              (autoload 'ibuffer ""ibuffer"" ""List buffers."" t)
              (global-set-key (kbd ""C-x C-b"") 'ibuffer)))

* Timestamp your load messages to profile loading time

    This one doesn't actually speed up loading, but it does help you see what is hogging your startup time.  Normally, packages print messages in your \*Messages\* buffer as emacs loads up; you can ask emacs to timestamp these so that you can see what it is that's causing the slow startup.
    
    Thanks to [other /r/emacs users](http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/16tzu9/anyone_know_of_a_reasonable_way_to_timestamp/) for helping me put this one together:
    
        ;;; timestamps in *Messages*
        (defun current-time-microseconds ()
          (let* ((nowtime (current-time))
                 (now-ms (nth 2 nowtime)))
            (concat (format-time-string ""[%Y-%m-%dT%T"" nowtime) (format "".%d] "" now-ms))))

        (defadvice message (before test-symbol activate)
          (if (not (string-equal (ad-get-arg 0) ""%s%s""))
              (let ((deactivate-mark nil))
                (save-excursion
                  (set-buffer ""*Messages*"")
                  (goto-char (point-max))
                  (if (not (bolp))
                      (newline))
                  (insert (current-time-microseconds))))))

EDIT: modified `find-in-list` to not eat stack space linear in the size of the list, as per nitroll's comment below.  Elisp doesn't do tail-call optimization!  Unlikely to break in the usage here here (since the list is unlikely to be long), but bad for a general-purpose list-processing function.

Can we ever expect to use CEDET without doing [heaps of configuration](http://alexott.net/en/writings/emacs-devenv/EmacsCedet.html)? Is development still going? How can I help?

**Edit:** I will leave the body of the post intact, but I am not *just* looking for something to work with Python. I had hoped that CEDET would give me for language support what `vc` provides for version control: a unified set of tools that I can use with various ""back ends"". It would rock pretty hard if I could work on Python, PHP, and JavaScript (and a sprinkling of other languages like Emacs Lisp and C) using the same tools. Thanks to `gcr` for [making me think about what I really want](http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1it8w0/whats_the_state_of_cedet_especially_for_nonc/cb80n7k).

Original post follows.

When I first read about CEDET I was really excited. It sounded like a fantastic project, and I couldn't wait to try it out. I even tried to use some pre-releases, though I wasn't able to get much use out of them.

When version 1.0 came out I tried it right away, finding that (a) it was quite a lot of work to set up, and (b) it was very focused on a few languages like C and Java. Cool, but I rarely code in those languages these days.

I looked forward to the 1.1 release, but when it came out I wasn't able to see many differences, though I appreciate that there was lots of work that went into the release.

Now that I am running Emacs 24.3.50 I see that version 2.0 is built in, and I am still having trouble leveraging it, or even seeing dramatic user-facing changes. Maybe I just need to read the entire Info page again.

* Is CEDET still [a lot of work to set up](http://alexott.net/en/writings/emacs-devenv/EmacsCedet.html)? 
* Are there updated guides for getting started?
* Where should I be looking to keep up with its development considering [the website](http://cedet.sourceforge.net/) appears not to have been kept up to date with the development of version 2.0?
* Even though I seem to remember Python being listed as a supported language, it looks like [the actual case](http://cedet.sourceforge.net/languagesupport.shtml) is that Python support is still somewhat lacking.

Finally, as somebody who works primarily with pretty high-level languages and has only a little bit of Elisp experience, what can I do to help improve CEDET?",,False,,t5_2qhwu,1374524104.0,,,True,t3_1it8w0,http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1it8w0/whats_the_state_of_cedet_especially_for_nonc/,

Long time lurker, first time poster. I work at Amazon.com, and in order to gain a better understanding of the experience our customers have when selling their own products, I created and am selling an GNU Emacs mug:

[http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004N1TRLA/](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004N1TRLA/)

I originally produced 30 of them. So far I've sold 16 to my coworkers. I have 14 left that I would love to sell to some redditors.

I know the price is a little high, but I did it for as cheap as I could for the small run that I ordered. **I'm not making any money off this**, and any money I have left over I'll donate to the FSF.

If there is a high amount of interest, I would be willing to produce a larger batch so I could sell them at a lower price.

Couple of questions..,Thehummel,34,2,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1jt30u/vim_user_trying_out_emacs_couple_of_questions/,"After been trying to really switch to Emacs a number of times, small things have always stopped me. Now i have finally sat down and trying to get more comfortable with Emacs. But there are number of things still bugging me, and that's why now sought out to you /r/emacs!


First of all, packages for Emacs is something that has been confusing me for some time now. I have set it up so i just can M-x list-packages and there i can access Melpa and Marmalade. I mark these things for install and execute them, fine enough. But do i have to go into my .emacs file and add them to load-path each time, and then (require 'packagename) ? Is there a more perfered way to handle packages or am i just doing it wrong? (I have included my .emacs file at the bottom of this post)


The next thing, is that my .emacs file is mostly consisited of things that i have taken from the Internet, small snippets that does various things. I think i understand most of them, but i'm not sure if it's good practice to do it way i do. Also, i have seen people have a init.el instead of .emacs. Is that perfered and if so, why?


In vim, i have been using the YouCompleteMe plugin for my auto-completion, and i have grown really attach to it. So having a auto-completion is a must for me. So i looked up the auto-completion package and installed it, but it seems like that the completion is only there for elisp documents and sometimes python. Is there a way to install extra languages into it, or is that something that needes enabling?


I think that is about it, here is my [.emacs](https://gist.github.com/runeandersen92/6164051) file.

Thanks!

I'm on Mac and use iTerm2 with zsh along with Emacs.app. I use witch to switch applications and shiftit to get some rudimentary tiling. Occasionally I use ansi-term or eshell but typically just switch to iTerm2. tmux looks like something I could improve my workflow significantly.

But running Emacs in terminal my color-scheme looks strange, function keys are not working and I'm missing a vertical line separating the line numbers. Possibly more problems... Anybody running emacs in terminal and has encountered/solved these issues?

How does it compare to running ansi-term in emacs with some window managing/tiling mode? I have some problems with ansi-term also (e.g. the function keys not being transmitted to zsh correctly) so this doesn't seem too enticing...

My suspicion is that emacs in tmux will be more powerful (and allows for the holy grail - going fullscreen :) in Snow Leopard)...

After ten years of using MS Money and three or four years of using GnuCash, I was thrilled to discover [ledger](https://github.com/jwiegley/ledger/wiki). The data file is a plain old text file that you edit in a plain old text editor -- and a very nice Emacs mode is provided for the file format. If you are a programmer, entering data in ledger feels a lot like coding in a very simple domain-specific language that was designed to let you concisely express the essence of your financial information.

Ledger itself is a cross-platform command-line utility.

The transparency of the data format has been an enabler for me. With Money or GnuCash, I was faced (nearly daily) with mysterious problems that I simply had no way to solve, because I couldn't see inside the programs. With ledger, all of the data is right there in the text file.

On the output side, ledger can produce its reports as structured XML files, which are then very easy to post-process using your favorite programming language and XML library.

I created a series of Python scripts that produce various reports that are custom to the way I run my own household budget (For example, automatically updating an Excel spreadsheet with a certain graph that I use as a metric of our financial progress. Example 2: Automatically importing the OFX files that I downloaded from my bank and adding the entries to my ledger file, marked up with default categories.) I have also created a series of batch files that invoke the ledger command with different commonly-used combinations of command-line options.

I have found Python + ledger to be a powerful combination.

If you like the Unix way (even if you're running Windows), if you like Emacs, if you are frustrated with gnucash, or if you are a programmer, I highly recommend ledger.

Something roughly 3-6 minutes that focuses on a single topic or task.  Anything from lists in org-mode, an intro to the emacs starter kit, working with Git, or a variety of other topics for those who are just getting into Emacs.

I'm on my third week or so of full time Emacs usage and I'm really enjoying myself.  I've also found that the Emacs community lacks a really good source for screencasts.  And typically the best way to learn something is to teach it.  So I'll hopefully be both benefiting myself as well as others.

I'll most likely follow the same structure as [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com/), jumping into a topic and explaining it clearly without a lot of cruft.

Any particular thoughts on topics?

**EDIT**

I should re-word things a bit after getting some feedback from some of you.  

&gt; I'm sorry to rain on your parade, but 3 weeks of Emacs usage don't give you nearly enough experience for a meaningful screencast.

and...

&gt; The issue of the blind leading the blind must be raised.

I think to start this is going to be a series of screencasts for those looking to seriously get into Emacs.  They're going to be beginner topics to most of you and will most likely be of no use for many of you.  I'm certainly not an Emacs expert and I'm not trying to portray myself as one.  I'm simply trying to contribute back to the community that I've found myself starting to become a part of over the past 6-12 months.  And during that time period there were very few solid screencasts to demonstrate some functionality that was explained in a text tutorial, but not completely obvious when trying to work it out.  Utlimately, the [Meet Emacs Peepcode screencast](https://peepcode.com/products/meet-emacs) was what really got me into Emacs.  I'd like to produce something similar but in more bite size chunks.

mattl brought up some distribution ideas as well in regard to format and licensing.  I'm looking to release video that will be at least 720p resolution so it can be viewed full screen so text is clear.  I'm also investing in a condenser mic to have great audio.  If anyone has additional thoughts on hosting, format, and licensing; I'm all ears.

Thanks for the feedback and criticism everyone; it's really helping me shape the way this is going to turn out.",,False,,t5_2qhwu,True,,,True,t3_a1uer,http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/a1uer/what_topics_would_you_like_to_see_in_a_series_of/,

I'll be perfectly straight with you here; I have some prejudice that means I doubt that I'm going to ever find Emacs' basic text editing *as good* as Vim. But, I do find the quality of some Vim plugins to be disappointing and I often find myself wanting more, couple that with the fact that Emacs seens to have more IDE-like features and my interest has been piqued in Emacs. 

I can't imagine myself doing anything with VimScript, so I often feel left wanting more. But one of my stumbling blocks with emacs is basic text editing. With Vim it has always felt fairly natural and at least 50% intuitive for command keys and making combinations of those commands. E.g.

d = delete
w = word
dw = delete word
d2w = delete 2 words

Also, there's other things such as typing ""$"" goes to the end of the line, which ties in with regular expressions. 
And so on. But when I try to start with Emacs the key combinations seem unintuitive and lengthy. Also, the use of the ""alt"" key seems a bit like playing Twister.

The question is, am I missing something with regards to learning key commands and key combos? Is there some easy way to remember them, or is it just a case of learning them. Also, does anybody actually use meta = alt or is that one thing that everybody remaps?

I'm not really interested in evil-mode as I would prefer to embrace Emacs as it was originally intended rather than trying to make it something it's not. 

Is there any way to mentally cross that bridge? Or is it simply a case of one or the other. Either choose Vim and it's great text editing features or choose Emacs and all of it's value-added advanced extensibility features? Or am I kidding myself about the fact that I'm a die hard Vim user who can't change?

I'm genuinely interested in your thoughts on these kinds of things.

I'd also be interested to hear from former Vim users who made the switch and why you made the switch. 

P.S. I am a lisp fan, so there is quite a pull for me towards Emacs, I just don't seem to be able to shake my Vim habit.


Edit: Big thanks to everybody who's replied. I have actually got a good few take away points from this that I've not picked up on in other discussions/tutorials/documentation. Primarily I think that I shouldn't be seeing it as something which comes out of the box that I should work with, but rather something that I should bend to my own means, and evil-mode could or should be one of those things. I'm going to take this into consideration and put a big effort into learning emacs, though I'm going to keep evil-mode on the back burner for now. It's often too easy to pick up Vim because I know I can get X done very quickly using certain features. I guess initially I'm going to have to just fire up emacs and spend some time looking up equivalent key combinations.

I am looking forward to specific major and minor modes and all of the things that emacs brings to the table, just as soon as I can get over that first hurdle of basic text manipulation.

Nothing too in-depth or fancy, I just enabled it and let it do its thing. From what I've seen, it seems to be mostly helpful. Mostly.

One thing I've noticed that has bitten me a few times, is that when I'm trying to create a new file that closely matches another one in my editing history, it *insists* on opening the existing file. For example, most recently I was trying to create a `README.md` file in a GitHub repo. I'd recently editing `README.md` files in two other repos. Instead of creating the new file, IDO insisted on giving me the choice of the other two files. I had to switch to a terminal and ""create"" the file with `touch` before IDO would actually open it.

Here is the part of my emacs config that relates to IDO:

    (setq ido-enable-flex-matching t)
    (setq ido-everywhere t)
    (setq ido-use-filename-at-point 'guess)
    (setq ido-create-new-buffer 'always)

    (setq ido-ignore-extensions t)
    
Unfortunately, I don't really know IDO well-enough to know what part of this is responsible for that behavior-- I'm not even sure where I cribbed the above lines from (thought it was from EmacsWiki, but I don't see the lines on the IDO page there). I thought I'd ask the collective wisdom here for help, before I just give up on IDO completely...

Seems like the perfect time to migrate a huge chunk of my life into Emacs!

I know Gnus and Wanderlust exist, but I'm curious if anyone actively uses them (or some alternative) with a similar workflow to mine:

* I use(d) Reader to aggregate a few active feeds where I read ~30% of the posts, and many sporadic feeds where I read everything. An interface like Dired is good, being able to expand a single item's content is even better.
* I send long articles to [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/), which if nothing else I believe can be done [via e-mail](http://help.getpocket.com/customer/portal/articles/482759).
* I like to use starred items to save the best content for searching in the future, which I hope Org can handle, but I'd like to capture a post as a *thing* rather than just the URL or something.
* Bonus points if there's a script for importing Google Takeout's JSON format for starred items, which has all the sorts of detail I'd want. [Example](http://pastebin.com/8BsQF8mP). I'd be willing to hack around to make this happen, since it doesn't seem so difficult...
* A searchable archive of posts I've read would be fantastic - sometimes I remember reading about some software, but not the site that posted it, and Reader's search was great for looking back years into stuff I'd read. Not necessary, though. If archiving starred items is possible, this should be possible too, with a hook or some `defadvice`.
* Being able to open the original in an external browser is pretty essential, but ought to be possible with `browse-url-browser-function` or something.
* Hopefully some sort of relatively easy way to add new feeds if I have their URL. Doubt it will be as nice as clicking on the feed and hitting ""add to Google Reader"", but maybe something [like this will do](http://blogs.openaether.org/?p=236), or using the ""send to external application"" functionality built into Firefox...

I realize that seems like a lot! I'm just curious if this functionality already exists, and if someone has a wonderful `init.el` I could copy.",,False,,t5_2qhwu,False,,,True,t3_1absue,http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1absue/replacing_google_reader_with_rss_in_emacs/,

It has been almost two weeks since I started using emacs. So far, I have just been using it as a text-editor with different/faster keyboard shortcuts. I have a few questions, would appreciate it if you guys could help me out with some of them:

* Considering the steep learning curve, it would help if I could ask questions directly on some forum or mailing list instead of google-ing for 30 minutes and figuring it out. Are there any forums out there that aren't hostile towards newbies with stupid questions?

* I don't know any Lisp. Would it be good to start learning it right away, or should I stick to copy-paste for the time-being?

* I've been using GNU Emacs, but I recently found out that there's also an XEmacs. Which one should I use? Should I not care about it at this point?

* Those of you who are working -- are you allowed to use Emacs at work, or are you forced to use other IDEs? (I know there's no fixed answer, I just want to know what happens in most cases)

* How do you deal with the 'Emacs hangover' (using Emacs shortcuts in other applications). It can get quite annoying. Does the brain switch from emacs-mode to non-emacs-mode easily after some experience?

* Why is it that vim is installed by default on most Linux distros and emacs isn't? :|

One idea I had was to make the Ctl and Alt keys sticky. Instead of C-x I would hit the ctrl key, take my hand off and then hit the x key and so on. In fact I would rather have the sticky ""command"" key to be on the right side perhaps more accessible. Maybe the / key or something like that .

As the title suggests, I'm a long time Vim user interested in checking out what emacs has to offer. I would consider myself to be a somewhat-above intermediate level vim user; I have a decent level of mastery over the modal interface, navigating and manipulating text, and customizing vim to suit my needs.

So why am I curious about emacs? Well from what I've heard, emacs is a lot more powerful in terms of what you can script it to do. Vim has vimscript and support for scripting it with python, perl, and ruby, but even then there's still restrictions as to what you can do. For example, graphically, you're restricted to vim's window-buffer model which is text only. That makes it a real pain to do something like integrate it with a debugger.

I mainly use vim for C++ and Java and in terms of code completion there's only a small handful of plugins. For C++ there's either the ctags approach (OmniCppComplete) which usually fails once you start doing anything complex, and clang_complete, which actually works pretty nicely since it gets information about completion from the compiler without the use of tags. For Java I use VJDE and javacomplete but they're pretty sub-par.

The reason I want to try out emacs is to see if it offers better tools for working on larger/complex code bases. I've heard a lot of things but I'd like to try it out for myself to see how it compares to vim.

And some final questions:

* as most of you may know, vim comes with a tutor program called 'vimtutor' which can be run from the shell and gives a quick run down of the basics. Is there anything like this for emacs? I noticed there's a tutorial link when you open it up so I'll probably go through that - any other recommendations for a beginner?
* I've heard that emacs is more like an IDE than a text editor; does it ship with support for code completion for C/C++/Java or are there separate plugins? If so, any recommendations for plugins? Any idea on how these compare to Eclipse/Visual studio code completion?
* To any former vim users: I know there's a vi-compatibility mode (viper) which I'll probably end up using (although last time I checked (several years ago), it was missing lots of things - like text objects, visual mode, registers), are there any new ones that support most vim features and not just vi? Also, would it be recommended to use these or to stick with native emacs bindings?

I think that's all the questions I have for now,

Some are forum users, and some are in real life.

Nothing wrong with that, of course -- it may be that there's a big need for org-mode's features.  But I have to admit, it's left me a bit bewildered as to how org-mode got all this press.

I only use a portion of org-mode's features, but it seems to me mostly to be a ""better text format"".  It adds the ability to embed some traditionally non-text-file features -- tables, auto-executing code, outlines, etc -- to text files.  I like that, and I've been writing .org files instead of .txt files recently.  However, it seems like the sort of thing that would be on par with integrating gnus with bbdb or something.  Fine as features go, but not the sort of thing that I'd normally expect most new emacs users to be doing off-the-bat or to be specifically-interested in emacs for.  More of interest to people who are trying to emacsify everything they do.

It could be that there's a big unmet demand for PIM-like features in Unix software, but I haven't seen a whole lot of people talking about, say, ical/diary/gnus support.

Eventually, I got it to work the way I like.

First, I installed pycscope. This will recurse through a source tree finding python source files, building a cscope database (cscope.out). This database can be used with cscope to lookup python symbols, and can also be used by the emacs cscope plugin xcscope.el

I found that with my emacs install (23.2) editing a python file did not activate the cscope minor mode.

To fix this, you need to edit xcscope.el. Near the bottom of the file are a few mode hooks that activate the cscope minor mode. You'll see hooks for c and c++ already there. I added a hook for python, so cscope is automatically activated when I edit a python file.

Original cscope mode hooks in xcscope.el

    (add-hook 'c-mode-hook (function cscope:hook))
    (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook (function cscope:hook))
    (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook (function cscope:hook))

New cscope hooks with python:

    (add-hook 'c-mode-hook (function cscope:hook))
    (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook (function cscope:hook))
    (add-hook 'python-mode-hook (function cscope:hook))

/r/DrawForMe looks promising, any other ideas? How do you comply with the GPL (which the emacs logo is licensed under) when it comes to drawing stuff? Would it be a violation of the GPL to print the emacs logo on a shirt?

Years ago when working with HTML and Emacs, nXhtml seemed to be *the* mode to use and the one everyone recommended. However, like I said, that was years ago and I'm wondering what has gone in the meantime when I haven't been messing around with HTML/JavaScript/etc in Emacs.

Do you use Emacs for your web development? Indispensable tools? nXhtml still the way to go? Pro-tips or other sage advice?

The stretches are not specific to emacs per se, however the injury is one many programmers encounter, and it is a potentially career ending injury. 

I had a pretty severe case of RSI at one point that took months to recuperate from, so I can verify that it is an extremely obnoxious and painful injury to have that you definitely do not want to have.

I made a lot of changes to my habits and do not have it anymore thankfully, but I never found any stretches or exercises that helped much in that regard while researching solutions for the injury.

I did the stretches mentioned in the video and my hands and wrists felt better than they had in a long time afterwards; ffualo felt better after trying out the suggestions as well.

I am definitely going to keep doing these stretches when I take my periodic breaks from work (breaks are a good and recommended habit both for cognition and avoiding hand injuries, so two birds are killed with one stone this way) and before starting the day.

There also was a recent post on [HN about keyboards](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6091239) and a thread from [this subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1edfmr/video_review_of_the_truly_ergonomic_keyboard/) that has better and more comprehensive information IMO, and there is an entire forum dedicated to it on [Geekhack](http://geekhack.org/index.php?board=125.0).

As an aside, there are also mice that are designed to avoid ulnar deviation entirely when using the mouse, however I have not actually tried those out myself; amazon reviews claim they are helpful and useful though and the theory behind their design makes sense.

If you have some first hand experience with those let me know as I am interested in the topic as my current mouse is pretty uncomfortable to use for very long due to the location of the middle mouse button and its small size.

The main reason I use it though is that it has a bunch of buttons on the side that are thumb accessible, which is nice in the context of video games.

For some reason the latency while using macros created with its software to interact with other programs is unreasonably slow and does not consistently work (on OS X anyways).

The design was pretty nice while testing the concept out for programming but unusable for anything other than experiment due to the latency and general hit or miss experience.

Anyways, my hands feel really great after doing the stretches, better than they have in over a decade or more and I wanted to disseminate that resource to the rest of you so that you can get the same benefits.",,False,,t5_2qhwu,False,,,True,t3_1iy4mj,http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1iy4mj/excellent_stretches_for_managing_and_avoiding/,

Enough so that I powered *all* the way through the tutorial.

I find, now, that I'm kind of stuck. I've installed a couple of plugins via M-x package-list and through Debian's emacs-goodies-el package, but as a serious Emacs newbie, I'm still trying to figure the basics out.

So, do you all have some good starting points for someone either coming from Vim or that explain some 'after-the-tutorial' things that might shed some light on the various features?

To give you an idea of what I'm asking:

  * Config file management (.emacs vs .emacs.d)
  * Themes
  * Major vs minor modes
  * Buffer management

There's probably more, but it's all I can think of right now.

To round things out, I'll clarify that I'm a web developer (HTML, PHP, CSS, JS, CoffeeScript, Stylus, Jade and HAML/SASS as well as Markdown) and I'm currently running Emacs on Linux, but my work machine is Mac OS 10.7 -- if that matters at all.

I'm a Web developer who has used every bad editor from Homesite to Dreamweaver. My personal preference over the past 10 years has gone from notepad to jEdit. What I look for in an editor is the ability to customize it in many ways without a lot of effort, in order to make it smoothly do what I need it to.

jEdit is the best fit I've found so far. On Windows, Linux or Mac, I can install it, open the plug-in manager and add a bunch of plug-ins that provide just the features I need and use. I can customize the appearance and interface in almost every way very easily. The only real drawback is performance. I commonly want to open and globally modify a hundred files, and it becomes painful in jEdit. Having read that it was loosely based on emacs, I thought I'd try emacs.

My first attempt at making it into an editor I can use was to add a tab bar showing my open files and letting me move between them. There didn't seem to be an obvious menu option, so I googled and found [this blog post](http://amitp.blogspot.com/2007/04/emacs-buffer-tabs.html) that looked promising. An hour later I have failed to figure out how to install it. What the heck? I understand that emacs is extended using lisp files, but is there really no central repository or auto-installation mechanism for them? Please tell me there is!

My question for the collective wisdom of r/emacs is this: what mail reader do people prefer now in Emacs 24? Gnus? VM? Something else?

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your suggestions. I have offlineimap running on my machine now, and am looking at the reader options. I'm still leaning towards VM because that's what I've used in the past, but mu4e looks compelling. I'll probably give both a go.

It basically contains a list of many latex commands, and their unicode counterparts, and makes emacs display the unicode symbol instead of the latex code.
So \vDash, \Sigma, \leq etc displays nicely.
It also converts some sub/super-scripts into equivalent unicode symbols, so e.g $a_1$ becomes $a₁$. It is highly reminiscent, and based on, some of the pretty-lambda code that is floating around. 

I put it out here as as someone else might want it. Also, I don't have much time fixing it up, so it comes as it is. Forks or contributions are highly welcome. There are a couple of things that makes it kind of crude:

- There is no customization, edit the code if you want to add more symbols.
- It can only change into single-char unicodes. 
- It cold be packaged as a elpa/marmelade package, but it is not.

I am also starting out learning a programming language (Erlang) and will try to use Org-mode gathering thoughts about what my programs are supposed to be all about, and what methods and functions I can use to achieve my goals.

It doesn't have to be fancy, but I would very much like it if it would return pages as a regular text buffer so that I can kill from them.  The main goal here is for reading text from manuals without leaving emacs and copying example code or text from the manual without much effort.

I know of w3, but it seems to be bitrotted to the point that it will not build.  I know of w3m and that it can be embedded in emacs, but that makes it difficult to grab code snippets and copy text.  The same goes for running a text mode browser (w3m, lynx, or links) from within something like an ansi-term environment.

Emacs wiki tells me of a project called ewb (emacs web browser) which failed to actually render the page (it just displayed the html response) and htmlr (htmlrender) that might be useful, but it isn't even really a browser.  In any event, both of these appear to be less of projects and more of a ""some code that someone posted on Emacs wiki"" thing.

* ido-mode - indispensable. 
* try not to kill buffers, so I can use `C-x b` with ido assistance
* bookmarks - just started using these, pretty nifty
* find-name-dired - searching for a pattern in a filename (slow if you pick a big folder)
* find-grep - when I want to grep for text in a bunch of files (slow if you pick a lot of files)
* opening a dired and inserting frequently used subdirectories, then just `C-s`'ing the names 

But, it feels pretty loose, with lots of edge cases where I end up tab completing through ido-mode again and again. I'm curious if there's a better way to find files that I'm just not aware of. Some problems I come across include

* finding files I recently had open
* files I've opened before, but not recently, maybe a few days ago
* opening files with the same filename in different directories
* I remember the filename, but not the directory it's in

In fact, I'd consider it to be a significant selling point of emacs.  However, emacs isn't perfect.  Some examples:

* Going backwards after following a hyperlink in a major mode.  In `M-x info`, this is ""l"".  In Help-mode (what you see after bringing up help with `C-h a` or similar), this is `C-c C-b`.  `man` and `woman` have no binding.  `pop-tag-mark`, `M-*`, which takes a user back to where they were after following a tag to its definition isn't exactly the same thing, but I suspect that for many users, when browsing code, this serves the same role.

* vc-mode (emacs's front end to Subversion, git, and other VCSes) has some odd bindings.  `C-x v g` runs `vc-annotate`, to get the annotated history of a file.  That would seem to mean that ""g"" would be a good binding for annotate.  However, if one hits `C-x v l` to bring up a log of vc history, hitting ""g"" instead reverts the buffer — instead, it is ""a"" that does annotation.

* If emacs is executed directly as `$EDITOR` to edit a file for some program, then the proper way to ""finish editing"" the file is to save the file and exit emacs with `C-x C-s C-x C-c`.  If I happen to be using emacs as a server, and opening a client with [`emacsclient`](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsClient), the proper way to ""finish editing"" the file is `C-x #`.  If whatever is being edited is a a sort of ""sub-shell"" (e.g. someone is using vc-next-action and writing a commit message), it's usually `C-c C-c`.

It would be nice if the same keybinding worked in each of the above cases.  Anyone else have their own keybinding consistency pet peeves?",,False,,t5_2qhwu,False,,,True,t3_mmk7z,http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/mmk7z/i_wish_that_emacs_used_the_same_keybindings_for/,

I know there are a lot of tutorials out there, but I'm looking for more of an intro as to how I could create my own customized environment: I work primarily with code of all sorts, so I'd like to get some productivity tips, like how to install new plugins (they're called modes?), add language support, syntax highlight, and everything else a complete newb to this editor (but not to programming) should know..

I recently started on C++ and I had customized cedet as per the 
famous page and was reasonable to use. Later when I tried to 
set it up in office, the whole cedet setup + emacs changed
quite a bit, lots of errors and even after fixing them, doesn't work
as good as my earlier setup.

want to do is focus on the main task at hand.

I still find it lacking in several ways, speed and accuracy in completion
being some of them.

Am I right thinking this way ? Is there a better tool that google hasn't
shown me, that can be used on emacs for auto-completion ?

EDIT: a tutorial on Shadchen and writing new user defined patterns is [here](http://dorophone.blogspot.com/2012/04/shadchen-el-introduction-and-defpattern.html).

Shadchen scratches my itch to program in a functional style in Emacs Lisp.  You can read about the library on the git page, but the new feature mentioned above is pattern matching/multi-bodied defuns.  Here is how you define a product function using the feature:

    (defun-match- product (nil)
       ""The empty product.""
       1)
    
    (defun-match product (nil acc)
       ""Recursion termination.""
       acc)
    
    (defun-match product 
        ((cons (p #'numberp n)
               (p #'listp rest))
         (p #'numberp acc))
       ""Main body of the product function.""
       (recur rest (* n acc)))
    
    (defun-match product (lst)
       ""Calculate the product of the numbers in LST.""
       (recur lst 1))

Documentation for each body is accumulated into the the documentation for the whole function, along with the pattern expression associated with each.

Self-recursion is handled by a trampoline but can be made to any of the bodies defined.  The macro `defun-match-` clears any previous `defun-match` definitions with that name before creating new ones. 

Like most macro-heavy code, it helps performance greatly to byte compile any code using this library.  

When byte compiling the library itself you get tons of warnings about using cl.el, which I'm of a mind to ignore.  Does anyone care about that stuff?

We use a large number of external libraries, and so having code completion is a very big deal and makes coding much easier.  Being able to see the doxygen documentation is nice also, but not essential.

CEDET should solve all my problems.  However, it's awfully slow.  Running semantic-ia-complete-symbol-menu takes a good 20-30 seconds per use.  This makes it so slow as to be useless.  Visual Studio, Eclipse, Vim's omnicppcomplete, and NetBeans are all able to handle completion for this project.  However, none of those are Emacs.

To quantify things a bit more, there are around 300K sloc in headers in this project, and a decent portion of those are included in every source file.  I've tried using GNU Global, cscope, ctags, and ebrowse to speed up the indexing, but nothing has helped.  I've defined spp preprocessor symbols to try to prevent the heaviest files from being considered.  Still, the running time is awful.

So /r/emacs, here is my question: Is there a way to get C++ code completion in Emacs working with this large of a codebase?",,False,,t5_2qhwu,False,,,True,t3_euo5l,http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/euo5l/help_with_c_code_completion_in_emacs_for_a_large/,

I fiddled with the Preferences.el file, I've copied it below.

Now my system seems way too complicated -- my problems are:

1. My documents are not wrapping properly, or automatically (i'm using M-q a lot) 
2. I have to click in order to LaTeX compile since there is no keystroke for that command, 
3. Similarly for ""Jump to PDF"" - it appears in my menu bar but not with a keystroke.
4. Auctex is not doing any indenting - this was one of the features I was hoping to use 

My main question is: could someone suggest a comprehensive approach to Latex with emacs, with the most up-to-date and best modes and settings?

Thanks.

Context coloring colors code blocks based on what the scope of the function is and the variables always have the color associated with the scope that the variables were declared in.

The idea is that discerning the scope of nested functions and variables declared within them is much more obvious, making debugging and following the code logic easier.

A proof of concept version of this was shown in Douglas Crockford's talk on [Monads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkZFtimgAcM&amp;hd=1).

Context coloring is explained at the 16:50 mark. 

An example of this for Javascript (what Crockford uses in the talk) is [here](http://i.imgur.com/ueFruz7.png).  

White represents global scope or an object that inherits nothing in the picture.

While you and I have overcame Emacs' barrier to entry, an issue I frequently see raised regarding Emacs (on Hacker News, among my peers, and a topic [Sabof touched on](http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/18qodi/svgmodelinethemes/c8hc2z0)) is Emacs default aesthetics.  The look and feel is a reason I see recommendations of Emacs dismissed out of hand despite the task being very suited for the platform.  As a result, Emacs appears out of date and thus not relevant to the modern user, which is unfortunate as Emacs is unparalleled in many ways.  

    There are other hurdles that a newbie faces (ones that are a solvable problem conceptually), but the appearance of Emacs itself is one that some people have to overlook.  In the interest of expanding the user base and thus the amount of potential contributors to Emacs development, it would be nice to rule out the aesthetics as a cause for avoiding the platform.

    With that in mind, what would be necessary from a technical point of view to put Emacs' look on par with the environments that are considered nice to look at?  I debated with myself whether making Emacs conform to a consistent appearance across all platforms or consistent with the OS' GUI, and due to the ubiquity of multiple computing platforms it may make more sense to have the GUI look the same everywhere so that the experience is consistent. 

    Examples of IDE/Editor environments that some people prefer (and notably the ones that my social group largely uses) over Emacs' look are those used in [Light-Table](http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/04/12/light-table---a-new-ide-concept/)
or [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) as an example.

    Ultimately, I would look Emacs to be much more approachable for mortals, and even among current users a UI update is desirable to bring Emacs interface to the 21st century.  Doing so would aid in the platform having more momentum for another 30+ years and keep helping people in their pursuits.  Personally, Light Table's workspace concept makes a lot of sense to me and is very smart as well as innovative.  I like that one of the primary design goals is for the UI stay out of the way and contribute to accomplishing things instead of taking away from concentration by being distracting.

2. Another question: does a comparable feature exist in Emacs for any mode that is comparable to the ""real-time debugging"" concept that Light Table has (more proof of concept than a final implementation as far as I can discern), which has significant work flow improvements that would make debugging much more apparent for humans.  

    I realize Emacs is exceptional at utilizing a REPL, however currently it does not do so to the extent demoed by Chris Granger (although Emacs is still exceptional to the extent that it does take advantage of a REPL and one of the killer features the platform has).  A type of interactive debugging within code seems like something very much in the spirit of lisp's design paradigm, and possible to implement with elisp.

3. Looking forward 10 years from now, does it make sense to push a complete Emacs interaction embedded in a browser and run Emacs as a server process or should Emacs focus on the current desktop implementations?

Having spent the last two years bouncing between various text editors for editing code (C++, Python, Lisp), usually having to use something designed for each individual language (ugh, bloat). Over the years I knew about Emacs/Vim (and their subsequent flame wars) I was put off by Emacs because of the Vim supporters, but I've found that Emacs is a little more intuitive and I can actually very basically edit text and save it without learning a myriad of commands.

However, this is not enough.

I wish to learn how to set up Emacs for Python properly on a Windows 7 pc. I want to do [this](http://utkarshsengar.com/2011/06/emacs-python/) for Python (I don't edit much C++ nowadays and the built in Lisp settings are fine). Can anyone point me to a detailed article on this?

I personally use Emacs less then 6 months and I am very happy with it. However, I think as far as text editing goes, modal editing is a superior way to Emacs chords. I also use several vi-originated modes that I like very much (e.g. ace-jump. dot-mode, zenburn theme). Undeniably Vim is powerful and it has a larger community (thus likely larger idea and resource pool).

There are however many features of Emacs that I enjoy and I don't think too compeled to switch to Vim at the moment. Does anybody use Vimpulse/Evil? What do you think of it? Are you an ex-vi user and use it just because of it?

I think in terms of larger underlying principles Emacs wins with 1) having the better programming language 2) its ""operating system"" paradigm, in my opinion also clearly won (apparently vim is now also closer to this route then a tiny, fast editor to jump in and out as it originally used to be). Vim wins in terms of text editing power. So the combination should be potentially the best? Are there many conflicts? Is there enough support?

Unfortunately, I haven't come up with a good strategy for assigning them keybindings.  The ""reserved"" prefix C-c is often cannibalized by major modes (org-mode, for instance, seems to use all possible C-c bindings).  The rarely-used C-z and C-\ in my setup are reserved for GNU Screen (yes, both of them.  Yes, I run Screen within Screen.)  

I'm sure I'm not the first person facing this problem, so I'd be curious to know what others have come up with.  Is it some C-[a-z] that you've decided to sacrifice?..  F-keys?..  Do you need no stinkin' keybindings, M-x FTW?..  I'd like to know!

--

Edit:

Some nice suggestions here (I particularly like C-. idea); I'm glad I'm not the only one pondering the binding issue.  I'd like to share the strategy that I adopted (starting today).  I've basically codified and made consistent some conventions I tended to follow already.  Here they are:

* Reserve F-keys (except f3, f4 which are bound by default to macro functions) for operations that require cycling through several states, necessitating several keypresses in succession.  Example: cycle code folding states, cycle buffers, jump between bookmarks in code.
* The bulk of user-defined keybindings should go through C-c [a-zA-Z] to minimize conflicts
* Reserve some keybindings for submaps, e.g. C-c {a,b,c,u,m,o}: for instance, bind user-defined functions to C-c u [a-z], bind macros to C-c m [a-z].  
* Bind very frequently used commands to non-reserved C-c [a-z].
* Use other bindings (unused C-S-..., or C-M-..., or M-...) sparingly and at your peril.

It might be useful to create a mode for global keybindings, as per [this SO post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/683425/globally-override-key-binding-in-emacs).
This is particularly handy for when you bind something outside the C-c namespace, because this method allows you to prevent your bindings from being shadowed by other modes.

Edit 2:

The approach above works very well with sugarshark's macro for defining submaps that he [posted in the comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ewliq/whats_your_keybinding_convention_for_your_own/c1bmsal); the code is at http://gist.github.com/767879 .

I can relate to the desirability of something like Mathematica notebooks as I also try to write everything in an electronic format, as it has certain advantages such as ease of backing up, searching, and efficiency.

Presently I use org-mode and LaTeX for such task, but one area where the solution is weak is its ability to do actual calculations of advanced mathematics. Emacs' calc mode is useful for inline calculations of less advanced mathematics, but once the domain enters higher level maths it is not possible to use for the task of either symbolic or numerical calculation, which is where Mathematica's notebooks are very exceptional.

While Emacs' org-mode and LaTeX capabilities are exceptional (and also its support for including in text diagrams), there is a need for a more proficient mode for the purpose of numerical and symbolic calculations. So, what are some options that exist which could fill in this role, and serve as a replacement for calc mode for users such as myself? 

Octave is sufficient for numerical calculations, but it is not very good at symbolic calculations.  Octave already has an Emacs mode (and it is also open source) so hooking that into org-mode for inline calculations would not be too taxing, but what could serve the purpose of more complex symbolic calculations in Emacs?

Preferably in both cases the solution would be able to translate LaTeX into the form the solution needs to do the task, then output the solution back into the text, and the solution would ship with Emacs by default.

If such a solution existed Emacs would be even more deft for the purpose of writing notes and reports and expand the potential user base that Emacs appeals to, as well as increase Emacs' utility for those of us already using the platform.",,False,,t5_2qhwu,False,,,True,t3_18biey,http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/18biey/brainstorming_regarding_computation_inside_org/,

I am constantly looking to improve my emacs setup, and today it's Python's turn.

I'm using a setup originally inspired by [Lei Chen's Perfect Python Environment](http://hide1713.wordpress.com/2009/01/30/setup-perfect-python-environment-in-emacs/) in combination with ipython.el as emacs-intern python interpreter.

Now the question: I usually start the ipython process through C-x ! and then start sending entire buffers (py-execute-buffer; C-c C-c) or regions (py-execute-region; C-c C-e) to the interpreter. 

What I am really looking for now is a way to execute single lines of code, preferably without loosing focus of the source file buffer (py-execute-region jumps to the interpreter after execution, and making each line a region before execution is certainly NOT the emacs way).

Any idea is appreciated!

PS: Also, upvotes for other python environment setups. I'm sure I have a lot to learn...",,False,,t5_2qhwu,False,,,True,t3_iznob,http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/iznob/emacs_and_python_please_help_me_make_it_perfect/,

&gt;   Save it to:
&gt;
&gt;   C:\Users\[YourUsermameHere]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
&gt;
&gt;2) Change some related settings in your Registry Editor
&gt;
&gt;   Start -&gt; Run -&gt; regedit -&gt; RET
&gt;
&gt;   Navigate to and change the following key values in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop\WindowMetrics:
&gt;
&gt;   BorderWidth ""0""
&gt;   PaddedBorderWidth ""0""
&gt;
&gt;3) Add a launch option to your Emacs shortcut
&gt;
&gt;   Right-click it -&gt; Add --internal-border=4
&gt;
&gt;4) Restart Windows
&gt;
The next time you start Emacs, maximize your screen and hit the hotkey for Fullscreen, Windows-Key + F11

I've switched to Colemak layout cold turkey two weeks ago and it's been great so far. Learning a new layout gave me the opportunity to do it right so I've been practicing text book touch typing technique but sometimes I feel like my brain is rejecting Emacs. 


Colemak does not have any incompatibilities with Emacs per se. My main complaint is that my brain still forces me to do one hand gestures that are not comfortable when touch typing. 

A few questions;

1. Do you press all modifier keys with the opposite hand? I already made caps lock another ctrl years ago but I still find myself doing spider like uncomfortable gestures with one hand. Do you have any other tips to prevent that (other than foot pedals)?

2.  Do you use sticky keys even though they don't have RSI? I tried it a little bit and seemed to be a better solution compared to use opposite hand to press ctrl, alt or shift when doing key combos (but that may as well be because I'm just not accustomed to doing that yet).

3. Experts suggest that textbook typing like how the old lady in the courtroom does instead of improvising as most programmers (including myself) do is much less tiring and a good way to prevent RSI. Do you use proper typing technique most of the time even though you use modifier keys a lot more than average typist?",,False,,t5_2qhwu,False,,,True,t3_oj39i,http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/oj39i/touch_typists_of_remacs_how_do_you_retain_proper/,

I have been using emacs for 4 years, but only the last one-and-a-half as a somewhat more deeper user than just yanking, killing and some mild emacs/elisp stuff. I found great tips, pointers and useful things on the emacswiki, but I have a problem with that.

There are a lot of pages, and I have read a lot of them, sure, but some of them really don't get the point through, and I am left wondering: *will I use this package ever?* (one such example would be icycles, I'm still wondering what use would I give it!)

I mean, if you *know* that dynamic abbreviations exist (or automatic text writing), you go to the wiki, search for it and learn a lot about this (which I like a lot as my previous link to my blog already pointed out). But what happens when you don't know you have a problem? (I know, this is a bad example as the emacs help/tutorial already covers automatic text, but it was the first that popped to my mind.)

It is like the ""blub"" paradox Paul Graham talks in I-don't-remember-which article: if you think in *blub*, you can't really think about other programming paradigms.

How do you find *that* package that solves that problem that you didn't realize you had? This should be something like a collection of tricks, but more read-ready than emacsniftytricks in the wiki.

1370363647.0,8,self.emacs,1fnrif,Questions about multiple modes (HTML/JS/CSS/Python) with custom template and file/buffer finding.,raugturi,11,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1fnrif/questions_about_multiple_modes_htmljscsspython/,"I've been a vim user for a couple of years now and decided to try out emacs.  I'm not installing evil because I want to actually try emacs, not vim in emacs.  However, there are a few things I'd like to get working as they were in vim (or better!) to keep me from losing productivity right off the bat.  The first is something I have to get working to be able to use it for work.  The second would just be really nice to have.

So, my first issue is that where I work we use a custom template style and I need to have emacs use multiple modes for it.  Ideally I'd like it to treat everything inside &lt;script&gt; tags as JavaScript, everything in &lt;style&gt; tags as CSS, everything between '&lt;?' and '?&gt;' (our custom tag) as Python, and everything else as HTML.  I'd settle for just figuring out the Python vs HTML parts because I try to keep JS and CSS in their own files as much as possible anyway.  Here's what I've tried so far:

1. [Multiple Major Modes](https://github.com/purcell/mmm-mode): I put the following into my init.el:

        (require 'mmm-auto)
        (setq mmm-global-mode 'maybe)
        (mmm-add-mode-ext-class 'html-mode ""\\.pml\\'"" 'python)

    But it isn't working.  I think it sees this as just really long HTML tags:

        &lt;?
            python code here
        ?&gt;
    
2. [web-mode.el](http://web-mode.org/): I put this in my init.el:

        (require 'web-mode)
        (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(""\\.pml\\'"" . web-mode))

    And again in this case it seems like it thinks everything is HTML.  I don't know how to tell it to treat &lt;? ... ?&gt; as Python either.

So before I go through trying to figure out which one to read up on and learn how to extend with extra tags, is there a preferred mode package for handling this situation?  I also looked at nxhtml but it's not in the ELPA repos, so I skipped it for now.  Most of the stuff I found is obviously for dealing with popular templates, not for custom ones.

The second issue is that I really want this: [ctrlp.vim](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim).  Specifically I want the fuzzy file finding part.  When I bring up the minibuffer from within a project or repository I want a way for it to show me all the files in that repo that match what I've typed so far, no matter how far nested they are.  I looked at Ido and Icicles, but both seemed pretty complicated so before I start learning one does anyone know which one will get me closest to Ctrl-P?

Update:  I found a way that's got me a lot closer for issue 1 using Multiple Major Modes like this:

    (require 'mmm-auto)
    (setq mmm-global-mode 'maybe)
    
    (mmm-add-group 'html-python
     '((html-python-output
        :submode python-mode
        :face mmm-output-submode-face
        :front ""&lt;\\?""
        :back ""\\?&gt;""
        )
       (html-python-code
        :submode python-mode
        :face mmm-code-submode-face
        :front ""&lt;\\?""
        :back ""\\?&gt;""
        )))
    (mmm-add-mode-ext-class 'html-mode ""\\.pml\\'"" 'html-python)
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist
                 '(""\\.pml\\'"" . html-mode))

Well, it's been that way for me, and I didn't know how to get around it, partly due to [cargo-culting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming) my color definitions.  However, I always see the same thing in many other themes, so I assume this just gets done the same way by a lot of other theme makers.

It doesn't help that googling or emacs help for min-colors doesn't come up with much useful.

Anyway, deep in the bowels of `custom.el` there's a macro called `defface` and that's where `(class color|greyscale|mono)` and `(min-colors  n)` are documented, (`C-h f defface` for the docs page)

This is how I figured out how to handle edge cases like a terminal running in xterm-256colors. 

## Usage Examples:

For your full 24bit display theme face settings use:

    (((class color) (min-colors 16777216)) (... define your face attributes ))

If you think a 16 bit display is likely (? I sort of doubt that but, ok.)

    (((class color) (min-colors 65535)) (... define your face attributes ))

for xterm-256color

    (((class color) (min-colors 256)) (... define your face attributes ))

I'm not sure where or what brought about the 88 colors boilerplate that seems to roll around, 16 colors is more likely after 256 colors (but please correct me if I'm wrong.)

    (((class color) (min-colors 16)) (... define your face attributes ))

And ...

    (((class color) (min-colors 8)) (... define your face attributes ))

Then we can get to greyscale...

    (((class greyscale)) (... define your face attributes ))

...and finally mono

    (((class mono)) (... define your face attributes ))

And there you go, the full range of display's covered.

If you have a special case that I haven't covered, you can get the number of colors available for a display mode by executing: `(display-color-cells)`

Hope this helps someone out, I should probably blog this ;) - grab my themes on marmalade/elpa ( and shameless plug  http://emacsfodder.github.com )

I decided to give Emacs another shot (I've been an Emacs user for a long time, although I've been using it like a ""desktop"" user). I'm an happy Vimer, but changing is good so I don't see why I can't master both :)

The problem is that, obviously I'm overwhelmed, and I'm trying to map features I love in Vim to Emacs. I've downloaded the excellent Prelude and I'm trying to figure out how to accomplish things I usually do in Vim:

* *Navigating*: I know I'm an heretic, but I can't put up with the Emacs standard navigation. I mean, for me &lt;C-n&gt; and &lt;C-p&gt; is a great deal more cumbersome that my lovely *jk*, so I'm using Evil just for navigation. Is that ""tolerable"" or is advisable to stick to the Emacs way? Why? Rationale would be appreciated!

* *Fuzzy searching*: Vim has the excellent _Ctrl-p_, Prelude comes with Helm that seems powerful but I can't understand how to use it. What I really want: fire up Emacs inside a dir, use fuzzy matching to find any file I want, even nested, in any child of the root dir, without specifying where to search

* *Acking* : Vim uses _vim-ack_ to do pretty much what _ack-and-a-half_ should do, but again, I can't figure out how to do it. I want to be able to search for a word under the cursors recursively in the root dir where I started Emacs and its child, as well as ""free search"", simply inserting a word or a pattern inside a prompt.

* *Code cleaness*:  this is quite an extra. I find whitespace mode of Prelude handy but visually cluttering. I also heard to the nerdvines that Emacs sometimes adds unwanted Control-M at the end of each line (that Vim promptly spot). Is it true? How to avoid them and write ""pristine"" code?

Thanks for your help, I'm looking forward to reading tons of tips from Emacs gurus :)

It is no longer called zf-mode. It is now call php+-mode (echosa/phpplus-mode on github). 

If you use this mode, please update your installs! If you installed via MELPA, I have submitted a new recipe for php+-mode. Once the pull request is done, you'll be able to grab it from MELPA again.

If you don't use this mode, please give it a try and give me feedback and bug reports on github. Better yet, fork, fix, and send a pull request! :-)

Also, in foreshadowing news, there are some exciting changes to parts of php+-mode coming in the near(-ish?) future (read: I'm working on them, and will release when ready). I won't say too much, but I will say this: snippets are completely changing the game. Using php+-mode will be faster and much, much more fun.

So, pass the word to any zf-mode users: zf-mode no longer exists! Viva php+-mode!

Edit: I was reminded that not everyone knows what php+-mode is! Shocking, I know! (Actually, not shocking at all.) So, here's a copy/paste of the run down on php+-mode from the comments below, where someone asked for more info:

Essentially, this is a better (IMO) php-mode for programming PHP in emacs. It was a parsing engine that allows for things like inserting, editing, and deleting methods with single commands; better, smarter, and somewhat customizable line breaking, support for creating and editing phpdoc blocks, support for running commands such as phpunit, phpcs, and phpmd and getting the results in the compilation buffer (don't have to drop to terminal to test), fast navigation (jump between methods, etc), TAGS file creation, project management (via directories and such), and a lot more features.

Now, I get back to programming and realize that I don't have efficient strategies for navigating code.  When I want to edit a class, I usually search its name but this doesn't necessarily bring me directly to the definition of the class but to places where it's used.

I have a good idea of the spatial arrangement of classes and methods in a file but somehow I don't know how to make use of that knowledge.  For me, a perfect solution would be to have a kind of bird's eye view of the file where only the first line of a class or method definition is shown.  Here is an example illustrating what I have in mind for Python:

    class Meter(Canvas):
        def __init__(self, **opts):
        def update(self):

    class Controller:
        def __init__(self):

Some convenient key combination would then show this bird's eye view instead of the actual code.  Moving the cursor to a class or method and pressing enter would close birds eye view and move the cursor to the corresponding position in the source file.  Does something like this exist?

How do you navigate source code?

**Edit:** Thanks everybody for great suggestions!  I learned a lot.  None of the solutions did exactly what I wanted but HideShow is very close.  Therefore, I extended it by a function called `hs-hide-leafs` which I adapted from `hs-hide-levels`.  Here's the code:

    (defun hs-hide-leafs-recursive (minp maxp)
      ""Hide blocks that do not contain further blocks in region (MINP MAXP).""
      (when (hs-find-block-beginning)
        (setq minp (1+ (point)))
        (funcall hs-forward-sexp-func 1)
        (setq maxp (1- (point))))
      (unless hs-allow-nesting
        (hs-discard-overlays minp maxp))
      (goto-char minp)
      (let ((leaf t))
        (while (progn
                 (forward-comment (buffer-size))
                 (and (&lt; (point) maxp)
                      (re-search-forward hs-block-start-regexp maxp t)))
          (setq pos (match-beginning hs-block-start-mdata-select))
          (if (hs-hide-leafs-recursive minp maxp)
              (save-excursion
                (goto-char pos)
                (hs-hide-block-at-point t)))
          (setq leaf nil))
        (goto-char maxp)
        leaf))

    (defun hs-hide-leafs ()
      ""Hide all blocks that do not contain further blocks.
    The hook `hs-hide-hook' is run; see `run-hooks'.""
      (interactive)
