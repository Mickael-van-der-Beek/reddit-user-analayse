It’s Jerry.”I couldn’t believe it - just Jerry and Me,“Play something” I said. “Play Sugaree.”The Fat man jammed - he was on a roll,With his sweet songs, he rocked my soul.Jerry spoke once, and his message was plain:“Gotta go now,” he said. “It looks Like Rain.”But I heard him exclaim as he walked out of sight,“Good Lovin’ to all, and I bid You Goodnight.""",,False,self,t5_2qpnj,False,,,True,t3_153vd4,http://www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldead/comments/153vd4/twas_the_night_before_a_dead_show/,

I don’t think any eulogizing will do him justice. He was that great, much more than a superb musician, with an uncanny ear and dexterity. He’s the very spirit personified of whatever is Muddy River country at its core and screams up into the spheres. He really had no equal. To me he wasn’t only a musician and friend, he was more like a big brother who taught and showed me more than he’ll ever know. There’s a lot of spaces and advances between The Carter Family, Buddy Holly and, say, Ornette Coleman—a lot of universes, but he filled them all without being a member of any school. His playing was moody, awesome, sophisticated, hypnotic and subtle. There’s no way to convey the loss.

I am 13. Before any of ya'll jump to conclusions; i'm not posting this to say ""Oh hey i'm 13 I listen to old music so you should like me cause i'm cool."" No. I just want to post here in honor of my grandfather. He's probably the biggest Grateful Dead fan I know, which says a lot cause I've lurked on here &amp; I've seen some pretty big Dead Heads.


I grew up with the ""The best of Grateful Dead, Skeletons in the closet"" album beside me in the truck, studying the album with the woman on it every time we rode. My Grandfather always had The dancing Bear shirts on, I remember each and every one of them. He rarely wore anything else. When I was 8 I saw a magnet on his fridge that had colorful dancing skeletons on it, saying ""Grateful Dead"" at the top. I grew up with this man, walking the short path to his house every morning so we could walk down to the boat dock &amp; swim.

He talks on the radio shows a lot. I remember him driving me, my brother, and my sister to school, hearing his voice and the radio and him smiling all the way. ""Tales from the Golden Road"" on facebook uploaded a picture of him with his many dogs, saying ""Get well soon Brian!"" Ya'll are probably wondering why i'm posting this.

He's in the hospital at the moment. Been in there for almost a week. Don't ask me why, but he's improving, they're trying to ween him off the ventilator to see if he can wake-up. He's impacted a lot of people with his stories on that show, talking day by day. One man said the ONLY reason he listens to that show is to hear My grandfather's stories, talking about his (many) Dead Head Dogs and events he's been through, he's overjoyed to talk about them, and people are overjoyed to listen to them.

I just want you all to give a thought or two for him, prayers or thoughts, which ever religion you believe in, I don't judge. This man impacts many people. With his words, stories, laughs, his bitching about nothing, everyone loves him. 

He's got maybe 8 to 10 Grateful Dead stickers on his door, seeing these stickers gives me hope. 

I just hope ya'll can spare some time to send him some good vibes, &amp; while I listen to ""Friend of the Devil"", I've got one more thing to say.

I love you. And i'm proud to be your granddaughter. 

Get well soon my Dead-Head GrandDad.

Good question!

Wikipedia says: ""David Gans, (b. October 29, 1953) in Los Angeles, California, is an American musician, songwriter, and music journalist. He is a guitarist, and is known for incisive, literate songwriting. He is also noted for his music loop work, often creating spontaneous compositions in performance. He is the co-author of the book *Playing in the Band: An Oral and Visual Portrait of the Grateful Dead*, and the host of the weekly syndicated radio show The Grateful Dead Hour.""

What Wikipedia doesn't say is David is the guy who talked Phil out of retirement, so thanks, David!

Barry Smolin, host of The Music Never Stops on KPFK in Los Angeles, says:  ""In a voice that communicates at once the bliss and the heartache of being alive in the world, David Gans croons like the warmest invitation, like a soulful bear hug, but with a sardonic edge at times and the unmistakably wry gleam of the trickster. Swift with allusions and wordplay yet always heartfelt and real, David doesn't need to hide behind irony. He's not afraid to say 'I love you' and mean it. 'Looking for a melody to sing a simple song... I find my inspiration where it's been all along,' he sings as a kind of invocation of the muse, a dedication to straightforward communication and the revelation of the familiar.""

Some of the most powerful lyrics I've ever had the pleasure of hearing.,kb-air,80,12,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldead/comments/1fhg3x/i_feel_box_of_rain_is_one_of_the_great_overunder/,"I was reading the annotated box of rain out of my big book, and was trying to learn box of rain, and started to sob uncontrolably. This is a masterpiece. 
box of rain

A perfect phrase, and perfectly resistant to firm interpretation. I always think of the boxes of Joseph Cornell, which evoke the same fleeting sense of loss as this song.
This exchange appeared in Hunter's mailbag on 8/6/96:

Date: Jul 25 1996 12:36 AM EDT
From: cebass@pacbell.net (Charles E. Bass)
Dear Robert,

After reading through a number of Mailbags posted at your web site, I finally decided that it was time to contribute a thought and a question.

Between your evocative, thoughtful lyrics and Jerry's powerful melodies, I have aphorisms and meditations a-plenty to help me through my days and in my life. For that, thank you, thank you, thank you.

I sat down the other day and figured out the chord changes to Mission in the Rain. My wife (who is not a deadhead) especially likes that song. Maybe it is because we live in San Francisco and there is a reference to the Mission. When I play it she always starts dancing.

Robert, if you would, please tell me what you were thinking when you penned the phrase ""box of rain."" What, for you, does a box of rain represent. I am not asking for the meaning of the song, or for you to explain the song to me -- I spent plenty of time on my own doing that. I am just terribly curious how you came to choose that image.

Well, I won't take any more bandwith. There is much I would like to say, but I've said it in my mind for so long now, it feels funny and self-conscious trying to put onto ""paper.""

Regards,
Charlie Bass

Charlie,
well, I don't like to do this, since it encourages others to ask about what I had in mind when I wrote a song, and mostly you'd need to have my mind to understand even approximately what I had in it. By ""box of rain,"" I meant the world we live on, but ""ball"" of rain didn't have the right ring to my ear, so box it became, and I don't know who put it there.

A close second: When Phil sings ""All I know is something like a bird within him sang"" when playing Bird Song with Furthur.

What about you guys?

1331421287.0,61,self.gratefuldead,qqtqd,"MrCompletely explain the spiritual heft behind Dead shows-- the best post to come out of this subreddit, imo",,66,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldead/comments/qqtqd/mrcompletely_explain_the_spiritual_heft_behind/,"This was posted a few months back by /u/MrCompletely and I thought I'd post it again in case some people missed it. Really hit the nail on the head and approximated what I always felt was beyond words, in the most elegant way possible.

&gt;Dead shows were engines of catharsis and ritual initiation as much as they were good-time parties and rock concerts. The overall structure of a show, once they settled into the 2-set pattern, was based on a prototypical acid trip: the happy start that slowly gets more intense and weird, the descent into darkness and final resolution into joy. This was entirely intentional on the band's part, even if it became occasionally perfunctory in later years.

&gt;The essence of the Grateful Dead lyrical theme is the bittersweet. The rose and the skull; love and death; joy and tragic loss; dancing in the face of sorrow, perhaps, but feeling the sorrow fully, not denying it or turning away from the pain. The band members all experienced personal tragedy and loss as young people, and around the time the pivot towards a deeper lyrical stance was made, they were under assault on all emotional fronts. Some of them lost family members. Altamont, and all it represented, happened; and with it the final death of the 60s dream, and though the band had moved on from that vision already, the blow still stung. And then they lost Pig.

&gt;And yet they didn't despair. They kept on truckin' on. They asked, What do you want me to do, to see you through? And they kindly told us that if, if they knew the way, they would take us home...but they didn't, so were were on our own.
I think this is a fairly profound and spiritually mature way to look at life. Death is real, loss is real, and there's nothing you can hold for very long. But we're still going to end the show with a dance party, because we're alive now, and we're all here, and it feels right.

&gt;The essence of acid is the dissolution of barriers, internal and external. Together we can withstand the punishing truths a little easier and feel the joy of living in the now, come what may. The hard songs, the true songs, they can help us get to that place of acceptance, when they hit us in a vulnerable moment. And everything about the shows was structured to create that moment, that still fleeting moment when the note hung clear in the air, framed by strange fingers of light, and we could finally see the truth of life for what it is, and share the freedom that comes with that, but without despair.

What about you?",redial2,66,4,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldead/comments/19hr1r/someone_on_org_asked_why_young_people_in_their/,"Some people's parents are heads. Mine are not. I first heard the Dead when I was about 19. I always loved music, and had gotten to a point where I had exhausted everything I knew of. I didn't know where to go musically.

I decided to go look through my father's CD cabinet -- hundreds of albums. I was standing there thinking to myself, ""I want something that's rock, but jazzy, and never gets old"". As soon as that thought was complete my eyes locked onto the one and only Dead disc in the whole cabinet. Skull fuck.

I pulled it out, popped it in my car, and went for a drive. My eyes went WIDE. I was blown away. I had never heard music like that before, and the thought that popped into my brain was, ""I should have been listening to this for my entire life"".

I was hooked. I downloaded the Fillmore West 1969 box set and realized that I had finally found something so complex that I couldn't listen to all of it at once. Before that I could listen to an album two or three times and have it memorized note for note. Not so with this band.

I dove right in. Reading about the Dead, listening to their music, everything. At that time Phil and Bob hadn't played together for a while, and that was a bummer. I wished they would, so I could hear them play live. Shortly after that The Dead 2009 tour was announced. I was fucking PSYCHED. Got tickets to three shows -- 4/18 and 4/19 in Worcester, and the next weekend in Hartford.

Shortly before those shows I met Greg, on happenstance. Turned out we both liked the Dead, lived close to one another, and had tickets to the same shows. We went, and we had a blast.

The first time I walked onto the lot was as mystical as the first time I heard the music. I have always been a weird guy, and I never quite fit in with any group of people that I had ever met -- until that day. Right away, and I mean right away, I knew I had found home. Not my house, but my real home. It just clicked. There was no denying it. I was where I was supposed to be. Right place, right time.

I saw those shows, and then I found out about the CT cover band Shakedown. Found out they were playing this little fest and I wanted to go. I couldn't find any info about it anywhere, but I got an email address from a friend who said I would dig it there. Emailed the guy, he sent me the info. He turned into one of my best friends, and when Furthur started we went to the Oakdale show in December of 09.

I didn't have a ticket, but I went anyway. Searched the lot high and low. There were a lot of fingers in the air, but I got one. We were way up in the balcony, but DEAD center. That show was fucking awesome. It is still one of my favorite Furthur shows.

From there I kept seeing Shakedown, going to Festivals to hear Phil and Bob play, seeing Furthur, and, of course, listening to The Grateful Dead. I just love it. I love everything about this whole thing. I was seriously depressed when I first found the Dead, and my life is totally different now. I love the life I live, and a large part of that is thanks to the Dead and the people I have met through the music.

I wouldn't give it up for the world.

And I am serious: He didn't hear Jerry from that time until this past August, when the prison finally started to allow MP3 files.
This man is FAMILY. He is NONVIOLENT and should NOT be locked up.

Jazz Combo rehearsal with my group at my college. We practice in an old house owned by the college just across the street from the music building. As we are all walking out and finishing up rehearsal I hear really loud music coming from a garage right next to us. I'm walking past and then I hear someone singing ""Loser""!! At this point I get really excited and me and my trombone player were like ""dude lets see if they want to jam??!"". 

So we stood outside in the freezing cold for another 10 minutes waiting for them to finish (because they were so loud they couldn't even hear us pounding on the door) and finally I muster up the courage and give a few healthy knocks... and this old washed up looking hippy with a beard opens then door. I complimented them on their sound and asked if they would like to jam with some horn players, and they obliged.

So we jammed out for like an hour with 5 total strangers and played Eyes, Shakedown, and Sugaree... had so much fun they told us to stop by next week. I'm so happy I finally got to jam with people who enjoy the dead (even if they were probably 20 years older than me!)

Also they had this garage decorated with a bunch of dead posters and jerry posters... it was so cool!

I'd forgotten how incredible it was...,rchase,47,3,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldead/comments/1h9frf/just_watched_the_season_finale_of_freaks_and/,"Most of you are probably familiar with 'Freaks and Geeks' so I won't talk your ear off.  Suffice to say that this short-lived masterpiece of late 90s tv programming revolved around a high school senior with an identity crisis.  Lindsay Weir, trapped between her life as a model student and her newly discovered 'freaky' friends, she spends the arc of the single season on a journey of introspective self-discovery and cliched teenage angst.

In the final episode, her guidance counselor hands her a copy of 'American Beauty' to cheer her up.  She meets two deadheads as a result, and this sets up the ending... which I will not reveal, because it is *awesome*, and if you haven't seen it, you really should. 

Set in 1980, there's also D&amp;D, and in addition to two classic 'Dead tunes, it also features Heatwave's ['Groove Line'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojaFHxonofw) so it's a win/win/win.  Oh yeah, and Joel Hodgson from MST3K as a disco DJ, so one more win.  That's 4 wins!

If you don't mind a little light piracy and have an hour to spare, I really recommend catching this amazing piece of television [here.](http://www.gorillavid.in/cnb/rkwllhu4ubs5)

What has always gotten me about the Dead is that they have this something that other bands lack. It's just something that I can feel when I listen to their music, something that hits me, and hard, even through computer speakers. When I listen to certain songs, it's like I've just reached musical Nirvana (not the band, mind you, but the place) and everything is perfect. The lyrics, the music, they just hit me and bring me to the verge of tears, but in the best way I've ever experienced. I've been sitting here, on my bed, listening to the same lyrics for the past 30 minutes at least:

Three girls wait in a foreign dominion / ride in the whale belly / fade away in the moonlight / sink beneath the waters / to the coral sands below

it's like these words satisfy my soul in a way I didn't know it needed to be, and what's more is that this isn't even the only song that makes me feel this way. There are a multitude of them that just make me feel at one with life, the world, and everything. 

To be fair, it's 4 in the morning, and I'm sure that sense is something in short supply within my mind right now. I just felt an insurmountable desire to share and a burning hope that this indescribable feeling is why you guys dig the Dead, too.

All the heads were dosed - just trippin' to space.
The joints were all rolled with precision and care,
With hopes that St. Stephen soon would be there.

The freaks were nestled all stoned in their beds,
While visions of Johanna danced in their heads.
With me in my poncho and her in my hand,
Just dyin to hear ""Uncle John's Band.""

When out from the stage there arose such a clatter,
I sprang to my feet to see what was the matter.
O' way to the stadium I flew with my stash,
I kicked down the gate - it fell with a crash.

the light from the orb, hanging so high.
Blinded me like I was Born cross Eyed.
And what to my red glossy eyes should appear,
A shadowed figure, could it be Mr. Weir?

No, too big to be Bob, too short to be Phil,
Could it be Mickey, Brent, or maybe even Bill?
He started to sing and the sound from his lips,
Assured me at once that he was Captain Trips!

His eyes how they twinkled, his dimples how merry,
I exclaimed in excitement, ""Oh Wow! It's Jerry.""
I couldn't believe it - just Jerry and Me,
""Play something"" I said. ""Play Sugaree.""

The Fat man jammed - he was on a roll,
With his sweet songs, he rocked my soul.
Jerry spoke once, and his message was plain:
""Gotta go now,"" he said. ""It looks Like Rain.""

But I heard him exclaim as he walked out of sight,

One day we were planning Fall tour and the next it over. 30 years running and it was over too soon. You could always count on seeing the same faces, in the same places, reuniting and catching up, regaling each other with stories from ""the world"". Remember these were the days before cell phones or social media. In the blink of an eye, not only was Jerry gone, but so were most of the people I spent my early 20's with. I often wonder what happened to those crazies, misfits, and wayward wanderers. Jerry lives on in my memories but so do the people I was fortunate enough to meet along the way.

I finally have worked up the courage to share this little tidbit that I ran across a while ago. I was looking over my 1970 pressing of [Workingman's Dead](http://i.imgur.com/BsARHx3) a while back, and I noticed that the album title on the [spine](http://i.imgur.com/I5ZHsGL) didn't actually match up with the actual title. Everyone knows the album as ""Workingman's Dead"", yet the spine says ""*The* Workingman's Dead."" 

Normally I would overlook such a small discrepancy, but then I remembered that the Dead had hidden extra meanings on other album covers (i.e. ""American Reality"", ""Ugly Rumors""). So I got to thinking. I realized that when ""The"" was added before the title, the apostrophe could be read as a contraction ( The Workingman *is* Dead) rather than the possessive.

 A cursory web search came up with nothing. I'm sure I'm reading way too far into this but I figured I would share my thoughts anyways.

What is the younger generation supposed to do? I was fairly young when Jerry died and never got the chance to experience any of that. I have made it to Phish shows and I have seen SCI a few times however  I was never captivated like my family was... Perhaps I made it to shows where they were not gelling(sp?) or just weren't ON those nights. It just didn't seem to feel like their experiences. What can we who missed out do? Who picked up the baton? I haven't been able to find anyone who even care's to these days. Was it a product of the times? Is this a phenomenon that we will never experience?

""you're only, what, 20 something? what could you possibly know about the dead?"". i was a little taken back. i replied, ""well i grew up listening to them, see the boys everytime they come around..etc"". he dogs me for never going on tour. i work 2 jobs, one of which has very demanding hours, just to support myself, i can't afford to go on tour. he dogs me for liking phish, too. he dogs me for not seeing jerry when he was alive. i was 10 years old when jerry played his last show. he says its kids like me that ruined the scene. he dogs me for having a dancing bear tattoo. says its not called a dancing bear, its called a berkeley bear (which in all my studying of grateful dead history, i've never heard of).

i know i shouldn't let this guy bother me, but i can't help but feel hurt. what's with this guy?

",jiminut,44,4,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldead/comments/mm883/honest_question_most_of_the_grateful_dead_lyrics/,"It's something I've often wondered. I'm not going to claim to be an expert but if I sat down with a pencil I could probably list 100 Grateful Dead songs and the vast majority have one of the following as a central theme or character: 

*Death or disease

*Murder

*Gambling 

*The Devil 

*The destruction of civilization and/or the planet

The band seems to take pleasure in having songs with ambiguous meanings or spirit, but there's a lot of their songs which clearly involve at least one character committing acts of violence or other abuse. 
Sure, they have a lot of other songs that don't clearly involve crime or death, but almost every original GD lyric conveys to me some sort of sadness or regret. Perhaps I'm generalizing unfairly. I'm sure there are exceptions but I can't think of many... 

As an example, I've arbitrarily selected Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, NY (10/31/79). There were 18 songs that night (one of the reasons I fucking love the Dead). After eliminating the (5) traditional songs and covers (unless I missed some), I'm left with: 

*China Cat Sunflower

*Cassidy 

*Loser

*Althea

*Lost Sailor

*Saint of Circumstance

*Shakedown Street

*Passenger 

*Ramble on Rose

*Estimated Prophet

*Eyes of the World

*Wharf Rat 

*Truckin'

Of those 13 songs, there are a total of three which don't clearly involve crime, death or general foreboding. I couldn't guess what China Cat is about except LSD, and Ramble on Rose is also ambiguous. Of the 11 left, two are positive in my opinion (Eyes and Cassidy). The rest are a mixture of darkness and light. But they all make me want to smile. Now why is that?

I have been a daily lurker/occasional poster and can't express enough love for this subreddit. It has the most positive community out of any subreddit and Dead based online community I have come across.

We all know and love archive.org. I thought I would share a trick a friend showed me for downloading (!) those sets that are listed as ""stream only"". For SBD-heads like myself, this is a godsend.

All you have to do is change the ""details"" of an archive.org listing to ""download"". Example:

http://www.archive.org/details/gd1980-11-29.nak700.wagner.miller.90104.sbeok.flac16

to

http://www.archive.org/download/gd1980-11-29.nak700.wagner.miller.90104.sbeok.flac16

You'll be taken to janky looking page that can be rough to navigate for those not too computer savvy. You have to download each song individually. This can be a pain, but worth it. The tracks are listed by number in the set list and a variety of formats. I always download the ""vbr.mp3"". For the above example the one's you'd want look like:

**gd80-11-29d1t01_vbr.mp3**

Choose a place to save it from there. Also for iTunes users, although the file name looks funny, the ID3 info or whatever it is called transfers really cleanly into iTunes. If you look in your iTunes Media folder (in your iTunes folder) you will see a folder called ""Automatically Add to iTunes"". If you save them all to there, it will autosort and make it nice and pretty.

Hope this information proves useful to someone! Cheers.",,False,self,t5_2qpnj,False,,,True,t3_pbe8s,http://www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldead/comments/pbe8s/an_archiveorg_secrettrick_or_your_hard_drives/,
1322515386.0,40,self.gratefuldead,msg9t,Intro to Torrenting for deadheads,MrCompletely,40,0,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldead/comments/msg9t/intro_to_torrenting_for_deadheads/,"This tutorial assumes you know very little about torrenting. Note that torrenting itself is legal, and most of the Dead related sites have all legal torrents.

I also assume you can hear the difference between lossy files (mp3) and lossless. That's the point after all. If you can't hear the difference there's no hope for ya.

**Abstract overview:** when you download files via a torrent, you aren't getting them from any one site. You're getting them from other users. When you complete downloading a fileset, you then are sharing or ""seeding"" to everyone else that's downloading.

**So first you need a torrent app and some bandwidth.** 

There are many free torrent apps. I have used utorrent on Windows for years and haven't found anything I like better: http://www.utorrent.com/downloads

I used Transmission for Mac for a bit. Right now I don't torrent on my mac so I don't know if there's anything better.

Setting up the torrent app to work right can be a bit of a pain. Once you get it set up it works easily though. One thing I like about utorrent is that it has a nice setup wizard that actually seems to work. There's lots of support forums and stuff for various torrent apps so I'm not gonna get into that here.

**OK so now you have a torrent app set up, now you need a ""tracker""**

A tracker is a website where people post and download torrent links. The easiest, public site for GD, JGB, Phish, Furthur, and all other legally traded sources is: http://bt.etree.org/

Another really great tracker is Workingman's Tracker. You don't need an invite to join, you just apply and then have to convince some guy you're human and not a robot. http://gdvault.com/ Totally GD specific, super kind vibe. Works the best if you're just picking up whatever is currently being seeded, as opposed to looking back for specific shows.

http://www.shnflac.net/index.php is another membership only tracker that has is GD/Jerry centric, but has a wide variety of other stuff too. I think you need an invite to join, sorry I don't have one to offer at this time.

Demonoid is an easy place to download official releases, if you do that sort of thing.

**Regardless of which tracker you use** you just click on the DL link to grab the "".torrent"" file, or click on the name of the fileset to go to a details page with more info and the .torrent file link at the top.

The first time you do this you'll have to show the OS which program to use to open the file. 

*Important distinction that seems to confuse a lot of people* - the .torrent file you download from the tracker IS NOT THE MUSIC. The music is in the ""fileset."" The fileset includes some number of FLAC or SHN files that can be converted to music, plus usually a text file and some other related technical bits. *The .torrent file just tells your program which fileset to get*. So once you add the .torrent file to your app, the fileset, with the music in it, will start downloading.

Once the fileset starts downloading, it takes anywhere from an hour or so to a couple days to complete. This just depends on how many people are seeding it, how much bandwidth they have, and how many other people are downloading at the same time. Heavily seeded shows, the ones that are most recent on all the above trackers, generally pull very very fast.

**So now you have some FLAC or SHN files** 

First of all, you can actually play FLACs directly, using Foobar for Windows. But if you want to bring them into iTunes etc you will need to convert them. You use a separate program for that. 

On windows I like Trader's Little Helper http://tlh.easytree.org/

On Mac I used to use xACT but I hear that XLD is more the way to go these days.

Basically you drop the FLAC or SHN files on the converter app and tell it where to put the output (usually WAV files by default).

Then you import the resulting files into iTunes or whatever program you use, and you're all set: full lossless CD quality shows.

**I know all the above sounds like a pain in the ass**, and if you only want a show or two, maybe it is. But if you think you might want more than a few shows, it's well worth the time getting the hang of it. Once you get used to it it's no problem.

I was bored earlier this week, so to keep myself occupied, I transcribed this story out of The Deadhead's Taping Compendium, Vol. 3. I've still got a few pages to go, but I figured that I'd throw this on the board before the weekend so the daytime ezaddicts could take a read.  


In 1987, one of the most significant developments in the entire history of live concert tape trading occurred. A huge stash of master and first-generation Grateful Dead soundboard tapes made their way into the hands of Deadheads. These tapes came to be known as the “Betty Boards” because they were recorded by one of the Dead’s recordists, Betty Cantor-Jackson. Betty had stashed these tapes in a storage facility and, after failing to keep up on monthly payments, they were put up for auction. The rest, as you are about to read, is history. Dougal Donaldson, one of the more passionate and through tape traders on the scene, now relays his perspective on his role in this grand series of events:

Dougal Donaldson: This was the summer of 1986. At this point I had been taping seriously since 1978 and had amassed a collection of more than 1100 tapes on cassette. I had gotten almost everything I wanted that was available at that time and was kind of stuck in an in-between space in terms of taping. There wasn’t really anything in the cassette world I wanted, and nobody in the reel-to-reel world wanted to bother with a lowly cassette trader they had never heard of. Here was my big chance to enter a new world of big-league, high-quality taping. I had moved out to the Bay Area from Maryland the year before, specifically for that purpose. I had already met a couple of the front-of-board digital tapers through a mutual friend. I was hoping if I could get digital clones of whatever they had, then perhaps I could parlay that into gaining access to some of the legendary collections that I knew existed in the mecca of Grateful Dead-land. Unfortunately, even that did not work.

As it came to pass, in January of 1987, I had the opportunity to purchase some reel-to-reel tapes out of the collection of a San Francisco trader who was transferring much of his material to beta hi-fi tracks. I now had some older material on actual reel-to-reel tapes! My thought then was to find a reel-to-reel deck with which to play these tapes and transfer them to digital. I put the word out to everyone I knew that I was looking to borrow one. Finally, my friend Brent told me about someone he knew named Stephen who was looking for a digital processor with which to transfer some old reel-to-reel tapes to digital. To me, it sounded like a perfect match, so I had Brent tell his friend to give me a call. When Stephen called me, he didn’t seem at all interested in the reel-to-reel tapes I had. He only wanted to know if I was willing to part with my digital processor for a couple of months in exchange for receiving copies of whatever tapes he transferred to digital. He claimed that they were all excellent sound-boards and that absolutely nobody had them, but he was very mysterious when I questioned him about their source. When I asked him what shows were on these tapes, he listed a few of the dates. Tapes of some of the dates he mentioned, such as the ’71 Port Chester shows and the ’78 Duke and William and Mary shows, ranked among the worst-sounding but best-played shows I had on tape. Others, like the ’72 Berkeley shows, were shows I had never heard of anyone having in their collection. Still others, like the closing of Winterland and Fox Theater ’78 shows, were widely available in excellent quality at the time. I was skeptical that this guy really had some great secret stash of tapes. After all, I had never heard of him.

I agreed to meet with him anyway, just to check his story out. I had my own car, after all, and could leave with my equipment at any time if I so desired. The meeting took place on a Saturday morning in the parking lot of the Whole Earth Access store in San Rafael. I was to go there, buy tapes, and look for a long-haired guy in a green Datsun. I bought a few boxes of blank beta hi-fi tapes and sat in my car waiting. Pretty soon a black BMW pulled up and out stepped none other than Bob Menke, at that time the most legendary of Bay Area tapers. He had been pointed out to me a couple of times at shows while his reputation was being greatly expounded upon. I had mixed feelings about this, as Bob had not been very friendly on the one occasion when we had been introduced, nor did he have a very positive reputation among tapers that I knew. However, if he was involved in this project, it must be more significant than I had originally thought. Finally, a green Datsun pulled up and out stepped a scrawny, Tennessee Jed-looking guy with stringy blonde hair. That was my man. I got out and walked up to him as a third car pulled up. From that car stepped a man and a woman with big smiles on their faces and looking like the prototypical shining, lively Deadhead couple. As I found out later, in their case, looks were in no way deceiving. They both turned out to be the kind of sharp, intelligent Deadheads that were typical of people who got on the bus in the seventies. They didn’t wear tie-dyes, but their clothes were beautiful and looked handmade. He was tall and lean with long, thick curly black hair tied back in a ponytail, and sharp, clear eyes. She wore a beautifully embroidered jacket over a dress and also had long, thick curly black hair. She looked just like the picture of the hippie earth mother I had in my mind. I introduced myself to Stephen, who introduced me to the couple. I immediately got a warm feeling from them, and could tell that my previous misgivings would prove to be unfounded.

They gave a quick hello and started in on explaining the plan. We were to follow them for the two-and –a-half-hour drive to their house. Part of the journey was on a deeply rutted dirt road, so there was some concern whether my little Toyota would be able to negotiate it. I said I was willing to make the attempt, and off we went. As promised, about two hours into the drive into the backcountry of the north coast, we turned off onto a dirt road that was, indeed, well rutted. It was a beautiful, sunny California day as we drove through oak groves and small vineyards. Along the way, we passed the occasional farmhouse, crossed over a wooden bridge, and over another bridge made from an old flatcar dropped into the creek. My initial trepidation was beginning to creep back when we came to a stop. The couple wanted to switch their vehicle into four-wheel drive to get through the next section. I looked ahead and saw a very muddy dip followed by a steep, curvy, freshly graveled incline. I shrugged and reasoned that in situations like these, one needs to keep with the flow. While waiting for the other two cars to make their way up the hill, it struck me that the couple leading us on this merry chase must have known they had found whom they were looking for, as the two cars following them both had vanity license plates referring to Grateful Dead songs. Finally, I revved up, splashed my way through the mud, and darted up the hill, fishtailing back and forth around the curves. When we reached the top, I found myself in a little cluster of small hand-built houses, the last of which belonged to our couple.

We all made ourselves comfortable in the living room portion of the small, cozy house. It was essentially a one-room house with a loft. They had built the house themselves and had moved in the year before. It was decorated with Grateful Dead paraphernalia, crystals in the windows, knickknacks everywhere, and had a casual feel to it, lots of stuff but not messy. The house, I later found out, was powered by some solar cells supplemented with a gasoline generator. The couple brought out three large boxes filled with reel-to-reel tapes, and placed them at our feet. While I picked through them, astounded at the enormity of the find, our hosts proceeded with their story.

It seems that there was a storage locker rented by one Betty Cantor-Jackson, former sound engineer of the Grateful Dead. Betty had neglected to keep up with the payments on the locker, so the owner, after sending numerous notices to her and receiving no response, told her to retrieve the items out of the locker and close her account. Again, there was no response, so the owner did what is usually done in these situations: he placed an ad in the local newspaper and auctioned off the contents of the locker. Most of what was auctioned included furniture, clothing, kitchen utensils, mostly common banal household items one would expect to see at a typical storage locker auction. The contents of the locker were displayed in a completely disordered fashion. However, among these items were hundreds of tapes. Many of the tapes were brand-new sealed 7” and 10” reels and take-up reels. Most of the others were cassettes, others were 7” and 10” reels, some in boxes, others not. The locker contents were divided up randomly into lots. There were three main parties bidding at the auction and a few minor ones. A box or two of clothing or other items would come up for bid, and thrown in with them would be a frying pan and a couple of tapes. After the first few rounds of bidding, the three main parties agreed it was ridiculous to drive up the prices, so they took turns on the various lots. This worked well for them until later in the day, when another bidder showed who seemed bent on bidding on everything and went home with several boxes of tapes, both cassettes and reel-to-reels. No one knows who that person was or where they went. This was the fate of most of the tapes sold at the auction. Since many of the tapes were thrown into various lots and since several people were able to get the lots, most of the tapes in the locker were scattered to the four winds.

With the possible exception of the last party, none of the bidders were there for tapes. They turned out to be a pleasant bonus. Unfortunately, a substantial amount of the items suffered form water damage. It appears that many of the items were stored in lockers located in San Rafael around 1981 or ’82, when there were floods. Those lockers did not escape that fate. There was a flight case full of tapes that also was full of standing water. The tape boxes had disintegrated and were unreadable. Some of the reels had unraveled and looked like spaghetti, while everything was covered in mold and smelled awful. This pile of tapes was left in a nearby dumpster.

Most of the bidders were people who make it their living to attend these auctions and resell the stuff at flea markets. However, one of the parties turned out to be big Pink Floyd fans. They were friends with our hosts, with whom they traded Pink Floyd tapes. Thinking that our hosts may be able to identify these tapes, they invited them to come over and look at the tapes. It actually took about six months for our hosts to make it over to their house, but when they finally did and tried to play the tapes, they were only able to get what sounded like one channel playing out of both speakers. When our hosts heard their story, they determined that these must be a batch of soundboard tapes recorded on a two-track tape deck.",,False,self,t5_2qpnj,False,,,True,t3_1eyxj8,http://www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldead/comments/1eyxj8/the_story_of_the_betty_boards/,

He got to be in the bus with them, stay in hotels with them, and probably share a joint with them, haha. He has told me so many great stories. For example, he said that somebody would confiscate drugs from the audience and give them to the crew. I love to hear his stories. He has a lot for other bands that he worked. He was a spotlight for U2. Some of the things he made are in the Rock and Roll hall of fame. So uh, that's it.

See right sidebar for ""intro to torrenting"" if you haven't done it before.

**Fall '72 is one of the alltime best runs of Grateful Dead music.** I personally consider it the second best extended stretch of performances, after only Fall '73. Unfortunately many of the sources are partial, flawed, or degraded. However some serious work is being done to correct this as much as possible and a handful of these upgraded sources are linked below. 

Houston [11.18](http://bt.etree.org/details.php?id=560687) and [11.19.72](http://bt.etree.org/details.php?id=561657)

The 18th is a fresh CM transfer of a set that features one of the alltime best performances of Playin' in the Band, a volcanic jam that drops right into facemelting mode and never lets up. The sound is very good.

The 19th is a careful remaster of a brilliant show that has previously been plagued by serious flaws throughout. Charlie's work has made this source much more than listenable though still not an A grade source. The performance features:

 * sharp playing on the ""small"" songs like BIODTL
 * prototypical versions of gems like Brid Song and Black Throated, beautifully done down to the little details
 * relative rarities like Box and Tomorrow is Forever
 * Dark Star &gt; WRS prelude &gt; Half-Step, 'nuff said

**Even if you don't get anything else I'd say these two Houston filesets are MUST HEAR material for all heads**

Nashville 10.21.72 - available [with](http://bt.etree.org/details.php?id=560171) and [without](http://bt.etree.org/details.php?id=560170) noise reduction. These are alternate versions of what's otherwise the same remaster of a formerly unlistenable set. I slightly prefer the NR version at least in headphones. The set itself is a skullfucker of the first order.

San Antonio [11.26.72 partial](http://bt.etree.org/details.php?id=560439) - another nice upgrade version of a fantastic Dark Star &gt; Bobby McGee that has long circulated in hard-to-listen-to form. Apparently Charlie is working on an upgrade to the whole show, which is awesome news. A truly great DS jam!

And finally one I have not listened to yet - a remaster of [10.18.72 Fox Theater](http://bt.etree.org/details.php?id=561661) - a show that would unquestionably be an official release if the master wasn't so flawed. Looking forward to checking this one out over the weekend, the Playin &gt; drums &gt; Dark Star &gt; Dew &gt; Playin sequence was a template-setting, groundbreaking moment and a highlight of the tour.

I'm not gonna give my opinion until other people have spoken their piece. But I'm probly gonna retire this username with the new year &amp; wanted to have the discussion before I do that.

If you haven't experienced it, that's fine.

But there is an experience that many of us have had, that is hard to talk about, and while it seems we're all talking about the same thing, it also seems like everyone has a different perspective on it.

Some people call it a group mind.

Some people talk about an ""energy feedback loop"" between the crowd and the band.

Some think it is an intrusion of the Divine, in some sense.

I've heard Kabalistic, Gaian/pagan, Tibetan Buddhist, and radically reductionist-scientific interpretations of the experience.

Some people think it's just a hallucination, or a ""group hallucination,"" whatever that means exactly.

Some people clearly feel it's best left out of the analytical/verbal sphere, which I respect.

Do you know what I mean?

How do you see it?

What roles do you think the band and crowd play? Does a ""leader"" figure such as Garcia matter? Do they play an active role, or just act as a focus?

Have you experienced it outside the Grateful Dead context? If so, what's the same and what differs?

Do you only experience it on psychedelics?

Do you have anything to say on this topic at all?
