From [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/r653g/time_to_take_out_the_trash/c43fxvw?context=3):

&gt;...

&gt;The simple truth is, there are a number of pro-AGW, environmental and climate sub-reddits. People who want to talk about that stuff can go to one of them and have at with anything they want. Nobody is stopping them, or wants to.

&gt;This sub-reddit is for those who are skeptical about AGW alarmism and want to talk about that. The pro-AGW folks who come here do so specifically to drown out the skeptical people they disagree with. They use all sorts of tactics to stifle debate, similar to the ones I described in the analogy above. That behavior is censorship of a very insidious kind. 

&gt;There are a number of pro-AGW supporters who frequent this sub who engage in civil discussion and add content to the debate. *Nobody has suggested they be banned.* I would further say that anyone who wants to come here and have a civil debate is more than welcome.

&gt;But the trolling needs to stop.

Anyhow from the the final sentences of the article,

Just because an idea is true doesn’t mean it can be proved. And just because an idea can be proved doesn’t mean it’s true. When the experiments are done, we still have to choose what to believe.

It just felt like the same old eco fear mongering (for the record I am a progressive, not a conservative). What finally made me think that it was really nuts was when I first saw how much the temperature is supposed to have gone up in the last 150 years. It's like .7C or something, right? I remember thinking that it was the most unremarkable change in temperature I could imagine. Then I started wondering how precise global temperature measurements are. Then I started thinking that if the average temperature remained flat over 150 years that would strike me as interesting and unusual. But a .7 degree increase seems like business as usual and definitely not something to be alarmed by. So, I know this is not exactly a refutation of the agw hypothesis but it was my ""bullshit"" turning point. Just wondering if anyone else had a similar moment and what was the argument, evidence, etc that caused it. Scarecrows if you want to tell about your moment when you said, yup, this is the real deal please go ahead. 
Edit: Greenfyre, thanks much for showing up and illustrating how the asshole comments always come from the warmers.

[NOAA report says Arctic sea ice disappearing at unprecedented pace](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/06/noaa-report-arctic-ice-climate-change)

...which links to an article in the Guardian. I decided not to take it at face value, and follow the link to the report. The section of the NOAA report which addresses arctic sea ice is [here](http://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/2012-state-climate-arctic-sea-ice).


On reading the report, you will notice that is doesn't state anywhere that arctic sea ice is disappearing at an unprecedented pace. What it does state is that in 2012, arctic ice extent had shrunk to a level lower than the previous record low of 2007. What the article doesn't state however, is that in the same year, arctic ice extent reached it's highest maximum level since 2004. Furthermore, as you can see from [this graph](http://arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere/IMAGES/seaice.anomaly.arctic.png), the rate of loss (and gain) of arctic ice has been steady for several years. 

This isn't just misleading propaganda, it is blatant lies, not even thinly veiled.

Maybe not causing warming, but certainly a large contributing factor, if not cause, of acid rain, and a direct cause of lower pH levels in oceans.

I just want to understand opinions other than my own and thought, 'Why not just ask?'  So I ask, does the Climate Skeptics community largely agree or disagree with those claims?  If so, why, if not, also why?  =) 

I did a cursory search for this topic, and I think I know the answer, but I wanted to let you guys speak for yourselves.

The term ""empirical evidence"" has been flung around here a lot lately but you should know what you're actually supporting.

You're supporting an hypothesis. Not only are you advocating an hypothesis as fact but you're advocating an hypothesis which is supported primarily by computer models. Rail and rant, link me a thousand links, obfuscate, deny and lie to yourselves all you wish you can not change these two simple truths:

Climate sensitivity is unknown. Despite all of the man hours and all of the dollars we have spent trying to estimate it our best efforts are just that - estimates. 

The effects of warming are unknown. Even *if* climate sensitivity is 3C we have no reason to believe that a warming globe will be catastrophic in any way. This hypothesis is supported by the output of computer models. Computer models are not evidence.

I'd also like to mention that the reasons for supporting these hypotheses grow weaker every day, after decades of predictions none of the catastrophes predicted have come to pass. This has been explained by 'global dimming' and the 'tropospheric hotspot', in science these are known as ""ad hoc"" hypotheses. 

The IPCC would have us believe that the warming before 1950 is due to natural variability and the warming since 1950 is anthropogenic. So all of the warming since the Little Ice Age is natural until 1950, all of the warming since then is man made and natural variability ceased.

The difference between modern civilization and older civilizations is striking, and it can all be attributed to energy consumption. Every form of civilization in the past was constrained by renewable energy, primarily wood and grain. When civilizations overshot those energy constraints, they contracted and sometimes disappeared entirely.

Ours is the first form of civilization that has been able to move beyond those restraints. Nevertheless, our economic output (typically measured as GDP) is still tied to energy consumption. It is true that we have reduced the additional energy requirement per dollar of increased GDP, but it is folly to think we can see economic growth without some marginal increase in energy use. On the flip side, this implies very real limits to reduction of energy use by way of efficiency. Efficiency improvements are already finding the tail of the law of diminishing returns.

I think it would be pretty uncontroversial to state that rich nations would like to remain rich and poor nations would like to become rich. In order for these two things to happen, energy use must continue to grow for several decades to come. This is what people desire, and they desire it so much that they will oust anyone that tries to prevent it. This suggests that the path to emissions reductions must be one of transition in energy production, not reduction in energy use.

Consider energy consumption in the U.S. In 2010, the U.S. consumed about 98 quadrillion BTUs. Just over 83% of this came from fossil fuels. Why are fossil fuels the preferred energy source? Because they are cheap. It's not like energy producers just love to emit CO2, so renewables and nuclear be damned. They use fossil fuels because nothing else is economically viable.

To transition to another source of energy in a short time period would be an undertaking of almost unimaginable proportions. Neither nuclear power nor renewables (especially not renewables) could accomplish it alone. Aside from biofuels, neither nuclear nor renewables produce liquid transportation fuel. The encouragement of biofuels use has already displaced food production (leading to soaring food costs) and led to riots throughout the world. Producing more biofuel than we are at present would be political suicide. This means transportation would need to become electrified where possible, putting an even greater demand on electrical production from renewables and nuclear. Such a major transition would take decades to accomplish. The capital needed for this sort of transition simply does not exist.

Further, suppose the U.S. were to embark on a project with a scope greater than the moon landing, the Cold War arms race, and the Interstate Highway System combined. (For this little hypothetical we must also pretend our national debt does not exceed GDP, that we do not have a large generation retiring and consuming more federal services, and that we are not throwing another $trillion per year on the national credit card.) Suppose this project could actually be pulled off. The end result? More expensive energy. The result of more expensive energy? Reduced competitiveness in global markets and a perpetual drag on GDP growth. Remember, rich nations want to stay rich. Would an ethereal threat that maybe something bad might happen 100 years from now salve the pain of transition and permanent reduction in wealth and status thereafter? Probably not.

Perhaps now you understand why I shake my head at the terribly naive-sounding suggestion that we'll just legislate emissions reductions into existence. Such a suggestion shows a complete lack of sophistication when it comes to finance, economics, politics, and the laws of thermodynamics and exhibits a religious, if misplaced, faith in the power of government. California is a great example. No single utility in that weird state met the mandate of 20% renewables by 2010, so the logical thing for that government to do was to legislate a mandate of 33% of energy from renewables by 2020. Delusion, thy name is California.
