1376157091.0,404,self.SkincareAddiction,1k3k7p,Attention all CeraVe in the tub users: I've found lids with built-in pumps that fit the tub!,squidboots,465,61,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1k3k7p/attention_all_cerave_in_the_tub_users_ive_found/,"Hey y'all!

Like many of you, I use CeraVe in the tub moisturizer for my face. Well, ever since my boyfriend found my tub and found out how awesome it is, he's been getting his grubby mitts inside and making me nervous about how hygienic the moisturizer was. So rather than go through the trouble of de-potting it, I looked for a lid with a built-in pump so both of us could use it without worry about dirt/lint/cat fur getting inside because *someone* (who shall remain nameless) doesn't always wash his hands before using it.

Anyway, [here is the lid I found](http://www.amazon.com/Pump-for-16-oz-Jar/dp/B005N9BHQY/) - it's $6 on Amazon and you can use Amazon Prime for it.

- [Photo of how it looks on my tub with the old lid right next to it](http://i.imgur.com/TJKdZZ8.jpg). It fit as is, no trimming of the straw necessary.

- *ninja edit*: [Artistic interpretation](http://i.imgur.com/yDbNTH3.jpg) courtesy of /u/padlocked

- [Gratuitous kitty cat photo](http://i.imgur.com/f9keo4M.jpg)!!!

However, **any tub lid that is listed as ""89-400"" (89 mm wide and 400 GPI thread finish) will fit the tub.** Just google it and you'll find all kinds of lids with pumps that fit, maybe not as expensive or goofy-looking as the one I found :) It takes a little bit to get the moisturizer up the pump for the first time (probably because it's so viscous), but it works like magic once the moisturizer starts coming out. I use maybe 1/4 of a pump for my face, it delivers a lot of product!

I sanitized it with rubbing alcohol prior to putting it in the tub, and plan on cleaning it out and sanitizing it again whenever it's time to get a new tub and plop it on.

Hope this helps you guys out!

------------------------------------------

**EDIT:** Wow, looks like we sold them out! I bet that supplier is scratching their head on why there was such a run on that product, lol.

Anyway, here are a couple of alternatives:

- /u/sports__fan shared [this tip](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1k3k7p/attention_all_cerave_in_the_tub_users_ive_found/cblmt1a) in the comments:

&gt;If you live near a Walgreens you can probably find a product called [Heel Rescue](http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/profoot-care-heel-rescue-superior-moisturizing-foot-cream/ID=prod1181994-product). The pump that comes with it fits the CeraVe tub perfectly. You'll have to trim the straw to make it fit but it works well.
&gt;
&gt;http://imgur.com/a/tLmH3
&gt;
&gt;The Heel Rescue costs about $9 with tax. Which is about what you'd pay to buy and ship a pump online.

Other pumps available for purchase online:

- ***USA:*** [Here's yet another lid on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Pump-China-Gel-Therapeutic-Topical-Reliever/dp/B001ANN6G6/) that I'm almost positive will fit (it's marketed to fit the same kind of product as the other one), but it is part of the Amazon Add-on Program so you have to buy $25 worth of stuff from Amazon before they'll ship it to you.

- ***USA:*** You can also buy a lid [here](http://www.essentialsupplies.com/~smartcart/cgi/display.cgi?item_num=DC89-PUMP28&amp;dept=Caps) and the pump to fit it [here](http://www.essentialsupplies.com/~smartcart/cgi/display.cgi?item_num=N3271-BLACK&amp;dept=) (you will have to cut the stem to fit in the tub) - sorry, they don't sell the white pump in quantities of 1, so it has to be the black pump!

- ***USA &amp; CANADA:*** [Here's the whole shebang](http://www.containerandpackaging.com/item/DP16) - it's ribbed so not as pretty but it's functional! You will also need to trim the stem on this one too.

- ***CANADA:*** [Here is a lid source](http://www.saffireblue.ca/shop/closures/89-400-closures/white-lidpump-and-7-dip-tube-89-400) that /u/functi0nal shared in the comments.

If anyone else finds others, please post them in the comments and I'll add it to the post! &lt;3

**EDIT EDIT:** 

Also, /r/smudgeofwhimsical made [a very informative post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1k3k7p/attention_all_cerave_in_the_tub_users_ive_found/cblcqq8) detailing how pumps are indeed more hygienic than other methods of product dispensation:

&gt; No, it's a great question. This [study] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC184433/) mentions that the type of closure prevents microbial contamination of cosmetics during consumer use. It doesn't mention how the volunteers used the products, ie if they washed their hands. But, it does mention in the abstract that a pump is cleaner than scooping. 

&gt; In the study volunteers used shampoo and lotion without preservatives for 2-3 weeks. The two different products, shampoo and lotion, were tested with different caps including slit-cap, flip-cap, screw-cap, pump-top.  

&gt; &gt; The standard screw-cap closure provided only minimal protection against microbial contamination of both the shampoo (29% contamination incidence) and the skin lotion (71%). The slit-cap closure on the shampoo container and the flip-cap closure on the skin lotion container provided slightly enhanced degrees of protection (21 and 39% contamination incidence, respectively). The greatest amount of protection (i.e., lowest contamination incidence) was provided by the flip-cap closure for the shampoo container (0%) and the pump-top closure for the skin lotion container (10%). As a result, closure type plays an important role in protecting poorly preserved products from in-use microbial contamination.",,False,self,t5_2tbbg,1376252595.0,,,True,t3_1k3k7p,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1k3k7p/attention_all_cerave_in_the_tub_users_ive_found/,

We mods decided to post a quick ""rules of the subreddit"" guide so that you all settle in fast and keep the front page full of high-quality content. : )

Some important things for you to do: **READ THE SIDEBAR**, **READ THROUGH PAGES OF THE SUB/DO A BOARD SEARCH**,  and take note that **WE DO NOT GIVE MEDICAL ADVICE!!** 
_________________________________________________________

**Rules**

1) This is a subreddit dedicated to *science-based skincare*.  What that means is that we look for peer-reviewed journal articles about skincare products, etc., to guide our skincare journey and decisions.  Please know that you'll regularly be asked to source a claim.  Don't be offended - it's how we manage to pick through marketing bull!  Blog posts without references to peer-reviewed journal articles are not appropriate sources.  Also, anecdotal evidence is fine, but you must be clear that the plural of ""anecdote"" is not ""data.""  Anecdotes can provide eyebrow quirks and inspiration, but they are not science.  In addition, many of our moderators have extensive background in scientific and medical research, so this is pretty standard for us.

2) **[We do not give medical advice or diagnoses](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/19ni63/psa_when_posting_please_try_to_stray_away_from/)**.  While it may get repetitive for us to say ""go see your dermatologist!"", the majority of us here are not medical professionals, and the differential diagnosis of a rash could be anything from shingles to prickly heat.  We can't tell, and besides, it's against Reddit's TOS.  Posts and comments asking for/giving medical advice/diagnoses *will be removed*.  Please report them if you see them!

3) **No self-promotion.** We do not tolerate product shilling or shilling of your blog, company, or YouTube channel.  These posts and comments will be removed. If you keep it up, we reserve the right to ban you.  If you find a blog post by someone else you like, great, submit it!

4) **No asshattery.** Excessive rudeness and phobias against people will be result in banning.

**Pro-tips and discussion**

- *Naturalistic fallacy and Safety First (from /u/chromiselda)*: We want to make sure that people take the right advice from us and aren't persuaded towards a harmful one. Manufacturers of skincare products have to do lots of testing on what they sell to make sure that it is safe for humans to use. When someone puts forth a non-traditional remedy, it too should be tested in a similar manner right? I'm not saying specifically a natural remedy, non-traditional can be chemical as well. The one thing we do know about the chemical and natural remedies that are running around in the market place is that they are fit for consumption - they wouldn't be able to be sold in public if they weren't.

  This brings me to my next point: Natural does not mean ""healthy"" or ""safe"". The term ""natural"" is really unregulated, and susceptible to things like greenwashing.  Natural does not mean ""effective"".  It can be all of those things. It can also be neither. This also goes for the word ""chemical"". It doesn't mean bad or dangerous. The body runs on thousands of chemical reactions, after all. But that doesn't mean that ""chemical"" is better or worse than ""natural"".

  We want to promote people proposing good solutions to the rest of this sub, and introducing us to remedies that will help us. But if they are things that haven't got a seal of approval from an authority on them, we do expect some evidence that they are:

  (a) Safe

  (b) Do what they say they'll do (for the average person that they are intended for).

  [This](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3266803/?report=reader) is a great article to read in general with a solid TLDR at the end. One paragraph particularly relates to this discussion:

  &gt; So what about products that are branded as natural or organic — are they more effective or safer to apply to the skin? “I think you’d be deceiving yourself a little bit there by thinking that just because it is natural, it is going to be more effective. There are caustic acids in lemons,” noted Cotsarelis. Stanley went on to note that juice from limes can cause a photodermatitis that is severe in people that have gin and tonics: “You see it all the time in people drinking those by the pool. It can be a severe pigmentation problem and can cause a bad reaction. And that is a natural product. Natural doesn’t mean it’s not going to hurt you if you put it on your skin. Poison ivy is a natural product, and you don’t rub that on your skin.”

- *[Dietary advice](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1gcpn2/reader_poll_share_your_thoughts_on_a_moderation/)*: Many people find that particular diets affect their skin and general health. There is a good way to recommend dietary advice and a potentially harmful way. 

  For example, let's take the ever so trendy ""detox diet"". Many people throw this idea around that ""detoxing"" is good for your body. However, with a little bit of research, you'll find that detoxing is actually a bit of a contradiction. There are toxins in everything you eat: fruit, vegetables, meats, everything. Simply cutting out meat and eating bananas doesn't mean your body will be ""toxin free"". In fact, in most cases these diets cause people to be more prone to fatigue and unable to concentrate well. It can result in an unhealthy lifestyle (even though that's the opposite of what you intended!) and also be dangerous. /u/Khokhmah said once, ""If your body was unable to rid itself 'toxins', you would be on dialysis"".  You should always consult a doctor or specialist first, before going on something like this. Starting a diet because you read about it on the internet is unwise.
  

  Another example is an elimination diet. This means you completely cut out a food, food group, of food substance, for a period of some odd months, in order to see if it has an effect on your body. This is a very murky area since we don't know someone's health background or what their culture is (if a particular group of foods or single food is a staple) or if they have a solid knowledge base about how to change the diet appropriately.  Elimination diet advice is not be recommended unless done so after prefacing the advice to consult a physician or specialist (like an RD or nutritionist). If someone suspects a food allergy or sensitivity, try to see an allergist to actually get tested: you may wind up with an underlying medical condition. [This](http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/foodallergy/understanding/pages/diagnosis.aspx) is the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease' link on elimination diets.

Many people come to look to revamp their current routines or create a new routine. While not all of the products mentioned here will work for 100% of people, this is a good place to start regardless of skin type/concern. 

The products mentioned are those commonly recommended on the sub and by no means is it comprehensive. In addition, the products mentioned here tend to be affordable/widely available/effective for most people.

First,  stop using St. Ives Apricot Scrub!!! The particles are large, non-uniform, sharp, and too abrasive to be suitable for facial use.

Next, you don't need to get *everything* at once! Be patient, take your time, and [Test patch](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/14sd25/i_just_learned_how_to_do_a_test_patch_properly/).  Include only 1 new product at a time.

If you can't seem to find a particular product in your country, a few online stores/companies can be helpful and ship internationally. These include [sasa](http://web1.sasa.com/SasaWeb/splash.jsp), [Paula's Choice](http://www.paulaschoice.com/), and [iherb](http://www.iherb.com/).  




- **Cleanser** 

  We frequently tell folks it's not necessary to cleanse 2x a day, particularly for those suffering with oily/dehydrated/dry skin types. Exceptions include things like post-workouts or if you've been sweating through the night.

  If your skin is feeling tight/dry/squeaky after cleansing, you should look for a new cleanser.

  *Cleanser Recs*
  
  ~ Cerave Foaming (US/Canada): Suitable for acne prone

  ~ Cerave Hydrating (US/Canada): Better for non-acne prone/dry

  ~ Spectro Jel (US/Canada): Suitable for acne-prones

  ~ Boots Sensitive Foaming Wash (UK/US/Canada/other?): Potentially suitable for all skin types

  ~ Eucerin DermatoClean, ""gentle"" (Worldwide): Suitable for sensitive/acne prone

  ~ [Oil Cleansing](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1cj3/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_ocm_the_oil/): Suitable for almost all skin types, but the oil/oils you use depends on your skin type. Those with SD should tread lightly with this method, as some oils can exacerbate the issue.

  
- **Exfoliation**

  Chemical exfoliation is the preferred method on /r/skincareaddiction, it tends to be more gentle than physical exfoliation *and* you can do it daily. You can learn more about the different types of chemical exfoliators in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1hj8yo/whats_the_difference_ahas_vs_bhas/) sidebar post.  

Lactic acid is the most gentle, so if you suffer with eczema/rosacea prone sensitive skin, start with lactic. If you're acne prone/have lots of clogs, start with a BHA.

  Physical exfoliation (yes this includes a washcloth and the Clarisonic!) should not be used more than 1-2x a week, and not if you have active acne, sensitive, flaking, or irritated skin.

  Exfoliation will be beneficial if you have any of the following concerns (not comprehensive): zits, uneven texture, congestion, blackheads, whiteheads, dull skin, dry skin, [sebaceous filaments (SFs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1fmg0t/some_more_information_about_sebaceous_filaments/), etc

  *BHA exfoliator recs (alcohol free)*

  ~ Stridex Maximum Strength Pads aka Stridex in the red box (US/available on iherb or Vitacost): If known serious sensitivity to light fragrance/menthol proceed with caution. These tend to work fine for the majority of people

  ~ Paula's Choice BHAs (Worldwide): Fragrance-free options, but pricier than stridex

  ~ BravuraLondon (UK): Various BHA products

  *AHA exfoliator recs*

  ~ St Ives Scrub Free Exfoliating Pads (US/Canada): 4-5% lactic acid. If very sensitive to fragrance or known fruit allergies, proceed with caution.

  ~ Silk Naturals AHA Toner (US based but will ship to some international locations): 8% Lactic acid. Contains aloe. Fragrance-free.

  ~ Paula's Choice AHAs (Worldwide): Varying concentrations of glycolic acid, fragrance-free

  ~ Olay Regenerist Night Resurfacing Elixir (Worldwide): 8-10% glycolic acid, fragrance-free

  ~ BravuraLondon (UK): Varying Glycolic/lactic/ AHA+BHA combos

  ~ Alpha Hydrox Oil Free Gel (US/ Parent company may ship international to some locations): 10% glycolic acid, fragrance free

  ~ Alpha Hydrox Swipes or Intensive Serum ( US/ Parent company may ship international to some locations): 14% glycolic acid, fragrance free

- **Moisturize**

  Everyone needs a moisturizer, even those with oily skin!  A lot of the time at least part of the oil production is commonly due to dehydration (aka lack of moisture). 

  *Moisturizer Recs*

  ~ Cerave Cream aka Cerave in the tub (US/Canada): Suitable for any skin type. Also works for the body. Fast absorbing, lots of humectants/ceramides.
  
  ~ Oilatum Natural Repair (UK): Suitable for any skin type. Similar to Cerave in the tub, though a tad more greasy. 

  ~ Cetaphil Lotion/Cream (Many locations worldwide): Suitable for any skin type. Slightly greasier formula to Cerave in the tub. 

  ~ Vaseline  (Worldwide): Suitable for any skin type. Good to add on top of moisturizer, or use alone to prevent water loss.

  ~ EltaMD Intense Moisturizer (US): Vaseline alternative, non-sticky/day friendly option.


- **Sunscreen**

  This is your choice, just be sure to wear it everyday and it's at least SPF30 with high UVA protection. It's even more crucial  if you're using AHAs, retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, or you're on particular oral medications.

  Proper amount for application is 2mg/cm^2. This is about 1/4 teaspoon (~1.2 mL) for the face alone. Reapplication should be every 1.5-2 hours (maybe even more depending on how nasty the UV index will be that day), and after every time you take a dunk in water. 

  Recommendations highly vary depending on location and type of finish you prefer. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/15tuqd/for_those_interested_in_trying_out_new_susncreens/) sidebar link on sunscreens gives you all you need to know.  Also, try a board search and look on the first few pages of the sub.

  Generally, if you are very sensitive or acne prone, you'll want to look for an all physical sunscreen or at least a physical/chemical combo.  All chemical sunscreens tend to cause stinging/breakouts/irritation for many people.

- **Spot Treatments/Masks**

  This will vary based on your skin type, personal preference as well. An effective spot treatment generally has antimicrobial/anti inflammatory properties. 

  *Spot Treatments to Consider*

  ~ Benzoyl Peroxide cream/wash:  If in a wash, leave on skin for a few minutes before cleansing off to allow the BP to take effect. Side effects can be dryness/redness sensitivity.

  ~ Sulfur ointment/cream: Tends to be less irritating than BP

  ~ Tea Tree Oil: Should be diluted with a carrier oil to avoid a chemical burn. Avoid if prone to allergic contact dermatitis. Potent fragrance.

  ~ Neem Oil: Very potent fragrance 

  ~ Clay masks: These will help clear pores and help bring some acne to a head.    Bentonite is the strongest, not great for dry/very sensitive skin, and should be mixed with Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV).   Kaolin/Rhassoul/French green are less drying and do not need to be mixed with ACV.

1360484373.0,248,self.SkincareAddiction,188mya,I've had acne for a long time and finally cured it. Here's a huge post of guidelines to follow that will probably cure yours too. [X-post from /r/acne],ljktklrjht,294,46,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/188mya/ive_had_acne_for_a_long_time_and_finally_cured_it/,"Basically, do as many of these at a time. Some may impact your acne slightly, some a great deal, and some not at all. I'd be pretty surprised if you still have acne if you follow all of these guidelines. You may have heard some of these already.

Also, a lot of the items on this list will not be skin irritants for you. For example, dyes and perfumes don't bother everyone. But I don't know if they bother me so I just avoid them. Even if you think you aren't bothered by them you may be. It's not like there's a shortage of products. If anything, avoiding common skin irritants just makes choosing products easier.

About me: I'm a 20 year old male who had acne for 6 or so years and spent a lot of time researching how to beat it. I obtained a lot of knowledge from reddit so I felt like giving back. I'm on a throwaway so feel free to upvote for visibility so we can cure everyone's acne.

Without further adieu..

* Change your pillowcase daily. If you're poor just buy a bunch of cheap white towels from Walmart. If you're lazy just rest your head on clean shirts. Also if you flip it over you can get a couple uses out of it.
* Dyes and perfumes irritate many peoples skins. Choose a detergent without these chemicals when doing the wash.
* Don't use a fabric softener. Can be irritating.
* Avoid dairy. This one actually cured my acne. I didn't eat much cheese but when I stopped my face completely cleared up. If you search [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) you will see a lot of studies showing a link between dairy and acne. Again, with some people there is no correlation at all. It depends on your genetics.
* The other dietary link to acne for some people is food high on the glycemic index. The glycemic index measures how quickly blood sugar levels rise after eating some food. Basically, try a paleo diet and cutting out sweets.
* Try to use lukewarm water. Very hot and very cold water irritates and dries out the skin. Contrary to popular belief, pore size is genetically determined and steam does not ""open pores.""
* While I'm on the subject, acne is interesting because it is one of those things in life that you have to kill with kindness. Harsh scrubbing will just exacerbate your acne further. It's a good metaphor for problem solving.
* Don't overwash your skin. For most people washing their face twice a day works best. With others once a day is actually better. However, rarely is it the case that washing his or her face more than three times a day gives better results.
* Prefer chemical exfoliation over manual. AHA's like Glycolic Acid and Lactic Acid and BHA's like Salicylic Acid are generally considered superior to physical exfoliation products because they don't irritate the skin (kill acne with kindness). A lot of people prefer BHA's for their anti-inflammatory properties.
* Prefer low concentrations of chemicals. Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) kills Propionibacterium acnes, the acne bacterium. If that is the sole cause of your acne it won't be much longer with BP treatments. That doesn't mean you should get a 10% BP product though. Studies have shown that 2.5% is just as effective without drying and irritating the skin as much. Also, don't apply it too often because you can get chemical burns. That happened to me a couple years ago when I was still a novice to acne research. Healed completely thankfully.
* Is acne only at one spot on your face? Only your shoulders or forehead, for example? Then the cause is likely something that touches those parts of your body, like greasy sheets or bangs. Try washing both with a detergent more often.
* Drink a lot of water. I'm sure you've heard this before in many different contexts. It's human fuel. 3 days without and you're done. Drink more water. How do you know if you're drinking enough? Your pee should be clear instead of yellow.
* Have a healthy diet. Acne is mostly caused internally and shows itself externally. You're probably deficient in Vitamin D and Omega 3 fatty acids, even with a good diet. Vitamin D is pretty much only obtained through direct sunlight and sunscreen/cloudy days/winter time prevents it from being synthesized. Also, the sun is bad because it causes skin cancer. Wear suncreen, hats, and take Vitamin D supplementation for optimal health. You can pretty much only get sufficient Omega 3's from a fishy diet and expensive grass-fed meats so I just supplement it instead. I only supplement Vitamin D and Fish Oil because even with an *okay* diet you're probably only deficient in those two things.
* If you move around a lot during sleep and your face is rubbing against a harsh fabric or oils it could irritate your skin. Try sleeping on your back with proper pillow positioning to maintain a neutral spine. Personally I have a bad back so I have to sleep on my side and just try not to move around too much.
* Don't touch your face. Your hands, and fingers especially, are probably dirty, or at least oily and greasy. The only time you touch your face is while you're washing your face and are cleansing/exfoliating/moisturizing/whatevering.
* Don't pick at your skin or squeeze parts of your skin. The only time you should really do this is after you've washed your hands during your skincare routine and should only attempt it if it's ready to pop and you only need to apply a small amount of pressure in order to release it.
* Don't use any product that clogs your pores. [Here's a list](http://www.beneficialbotanicals.com/facts-figures/comedogenic-rating.html) of comedeogenic ratings for products. Comedeogenic just means tendency to clog pores. This list doesn't mean that something with a 4 will definitely clog your pores though (depends on skin type/genetics/etc). Some people are fine with coconut oil, for example. I just chose to skip that step and just go with products rated a 0 like Shea Butter.
* Use a moisturizer if your skin is dry. How do you know if your skin is dry? Well, hours after your skin care regimen or after you wake up, is your skin dehydrated at all? Do you have any crusted skin near your eye area or does your skin feel really tight and not elastic? You may also only need to moisturize certain areas (combination skin). See how your skin normally feels without it and react accordingly.
* Cleanse your skin during your skin care routine. During the day and night bacteria accumulates, skin cells turnover, sebum is produced, oils are gathered, and products (make-up, sunscreen, moisturizer, etc.) are applied. It's just like brushing your teeth. Twice a day and feel fresh.
* Exfoliate, but not too often. It can lead to redness but also allows you to remove the outer layer of skin to reveal the newer skin beneath. Maybe a couple times a week. Chemical is great but physical can be good too, every once in a while. Try Extra Virgin Olive Oil and White Sugar rubbed on your skin a couple times a month, for example. Works great for the rest of your body too.
* Avoid the sun. Other than sunlight basically being carcinogenic by UVA and UVB radiation mutating DNA and causing skin cancers and [premature aging](http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/tim/2012/06/04/trucker-damage-face_web_620x350.jpg) but its ""positive"" effect on acne is mostly an illusion. After getting a tan acne may be less visible but that's just because your skin was damaged and is darker so it's harder to see. The reason why I said mostly is because sometimes sunlight can legitimately help acne by killing acne-causing bacteria with UV rays. Can be a decent short-term solution though.
* Use a moisturizer if you're going to be hit by harsh winds. Also, use a sunscreen if you're going outside (UVA rays penetrate clouds and are present all-year round).
* I generally like to avoid expensive products. Most of acne is caused by something already mentioned and most fixes are free and those that aren't can be purchased cheaply. Shea butter, oils, vaseline, sugar, gentle cleansers, and other basic skin care products are cheap. Even if something expensive does work, do you really want to depend on that forever? Don't be swindled in to the artificial markup. All the ingredients used in most formulations are cheap and massively produced. Other than for cleansing, I like to use single ingredients for skin-care.
* If you don't feel like researching ingredients, look for labels that indicated gentleness. Prefer descriptions like non-comedogenic, gentle, fragance-free, and paraben-free. Just note that these aren't really regulated and the effectiveness of a product is based on its ingredients and their proportions.
* Almost forgot to mention hormones. Changes and fluctuations with hormones can affect your acne. Women on their period, beginning menopause, pregnancy or changing birth control can all have an effect on your skin. I never spent much time researching this because I'm male but my best advice is to be scientific. If you changed your hormonal birth control and acne appeared shortly after and you haven't had it in years then it's pretty obvious what happened. Experiment with different types of birth control if this happens.
* Avoid stress. It sound weird but stress can cause acne and other conditions. Acne can be mainly hormonal and stress can effect your androgen and cortisol levels which can lead to sebum production, for example. Try meditating, avoiding stressful situations, avoiding negatives emotions, and stay relaxed.
* When in the shower, wash your face last, or at least after washing your hair. If you cleanse your face and then shampoo, oils and debris from your hair is washed off and drips down all over your face and the rest of your body. Generally, I like to do a top-down approach when showering to avoid this issue, however minor it may be.
* Avoid large amounts of makeup and the use of many different products. A lot of women cover up their bad skin with makeup and in turn just make their skin worse with all the products clogging their pores. It's a vicious cycle. You'd be surprised how well a good moisturizer and proper skin care can replace blush, foundation, and other prettifying products.
* Visit /r/wicked_edge if you believe your acne to be partially caused by improper shaving techniques. Basically, use a sharp blade on warm, wet skin with a good lather and shave with the grain to avoid skin irritation. Also you save money in the long-term with cheaper blades. Be sure to use an unscented shaving soap that is non-irritating.
* Use one towel for drying your hair and one towel for drying your body. Keep them separated so you can keep the oils separated as well.
* Pat your skin dry instead of vigorously rubbing it dry. After your shower wipe all the dripping water off of you with your palms so not as much will be absorbed in to your towel so they stay cleaner for longer.
* Exercise daily but try to do it at a time before when you normally shower. For example, if you shower in the morning, exercise before-hand and shower right after. Exercise increases blood flow and nourishes skin cells and helps flush out cellular debris.
* Accutane, even with its myriad of potential side effects, is the best cure for acne available right now. It works by decreasing the size and output of sebaceous glands. It also makes sloughed off cells less sticky. It can cause dryness of the skin, lips, mouth, etc. It can also cause liver problems, depression, birth defects if taken during pregnancy, etc. Talk to a professional if nothing else works.
* If you've tried everything and even bit the bullet and tried Accutane for its entire course and still nothing you still have an option. Waiting. A lot of acne is hormonal and will eventually clear up on its own, eventually.

1361745468.0,249,self.SkincareAddiction,195lue,PSA: Please DO NOT use baking soda on your skin. It is NOT safe.,JoanOfSarcasm,303,54,136,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/195lue/psa_please_do_not_use_baking_soda_on_your_skin_it/,"This is a bit of a rant, so please excuse the figurative arm-flailing. However, I popped into /r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide today and saw a post about baking soda as a skincare scrub.

**PLEASE** DO NOT USE BAKING SODA ON YOUR SKIN. I know most people here at /r/skincareaddiction know this already, but if you are new to this subreddit and are currently scrubbing your skin with baking soda and toning with vinegars, *please* stop. 

If you remember anything from your high school chemistry class, you'll remember that the pH scale works like this: 1 is acidic, 14 is alkaline. Things are either more acidic or more alkaline based on where they sit on the scale (unless it is 7, in which case it is neutral). As a reference point, your skin is roughly a pH of 4.5-5, blood is 7, an effective AHA or BHA is 3.5-4, baking soda is a 9, and the average WHITE vinegar (5-10% acetic acid) is 2.40-3.40.

pH is so very important in skincare -- too alkaline and the skin barrier is disrupted or damaged, too acidic and you risk burns. 

Vinegar and baking soda are household chemicals and they are not safer just because they are not in a bottle in the skincare aisle. Baking soda can be used to scrub stains out of a toilet while vinegar can be used to break down lime build-up on your tub or sink. These are *chemicals*. They are not safer than your Cetaphil cleanser just because they are only one or two ingredients. 

Skin care problems are generally caused by genetics, diet, and mistreatment of the problem to begin with, such as *scrubbing dehydrated, acne skin with baking soda*, which damages the skincare barrier and makes your face a bacterial breeding ground. Think of your skin barrier as part of your immune system -- it is essential for keeping the bad guys out and the good stuff in, such as moisture. Scrubbing it with a too-alkaline cleanser is increasing moisture loss and decreasing the ability to keep bacteria on your skin in check. Worse, by toning your skin with a product with a pH of 2.4-3.4, you are putting your skin at risk for *chemical burns*, which at best are uncomfortable and at worst will scar.

Please, *please* use products that are made specifically for use on skin -- your face is not a toilet bowl or a sink. They are balanced by cosmetic chemists and generally use tried-and-true ingredients for cleansing or moisturizing. 

For further reading on alkaline products and the skin barrier, here are some medical journals:

* [One](http://www.sebamedbikeday.de/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/Studien/Saeuremantelkonzept/1.06.pdf)
* [Two](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/1980979/reload=0;jsessionid=fILBJuhSpjuSVCb7W4kK.0)

* [Four](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/67/6/820.short) (WHO USED BAKING SODA AS A TREATMENT FOR A RASH!?)


...Phew. I can now go back to eating my sandwich and laying in bed, coughing.

Edit: I accidentally a word.

Edit 2: Skin care problems can be caused by more than what I listed above, but I'd say those are some of the most common reasons. Environment (hard and soft water) can also affect skin, for instance.

Edit 3: Bit of confusion over white vs apple cider vinegar. I am specifically discussing white vinegar. Apple cider vinegar has a higher pH (about 4.25, from everything I can read). However, it is still possible to seriously irritate your skin with ACV (I know I have) and I have to wonder how effective it is for exfoliation.

[TL;DR, my skin is SO super oily and I need some new suggestions]


I'm a 15 year old boy with minor cystic acne and some clogged pores on my cheeks, but my major problem is the MASSIVE amount of oil produced mainly in but not limited to my T-zone. As in I'm patting my face down with a tissue every hour or so to try to soak it up. My eyelids even seem to get sticky and gross as the day progresses.


My routine I've developed using the awesome advice from here has been improving the state of my skin tremendously, but nothing seems to keep the oil away. My skin is not very sensitive.


My routine:

Morning
1. Shave what little facial hair I managed to grow
2. Shower
3. Massage in 50% jojoba oil 50% witch hazel mixture into face
4. Wait ~10 minutes, then apply Missha SPF 42 BB cream


Night

This post is written to address those of us who shave (use of razor) or epilate (waxing, tweezing, sugaring, threading, or use of an epilator), which are far and away the most common forms of hair removal. Shaving is removal of the hair from the surface of the skin and above with a razor, and epilation is the removal of the entire hair from the follicle.

**Chemical depilatories (eg, Nair), hair buffing/sanding pads, and laser hair removal are *not* included in this guide, as exfoliation prior to treatment can cause at best more irritation and at worst more serious damage to the skin.**

---------------
So, with that out of the way...on to the fun stuff! There are **four** important skin preparation steps that ensure a good experience when it comes to hair removal and happy skin.

    1. Cleansing
        
    2. Exfoliation
        
    3. Softening Hair and Skin
        
    4. Minimization of Friction

Let's go through what is involved with each of these steps.

-----

Step One: Cleansing
--------

Having clean skin is crucial to preventing infections. Period. With all forms of hair removal, there is a risk of infection. Shaving involves the use of a sharp instrument to remove hair, and there is invariably a risk of cutting the skin with that instrument. Epilation involves ripping out the hair and, in the process, the creation of a small wound.

The easiest way to cleanse your skin is to shower. As you will see below, showering and hair removal really go hand-in-hand, and so I strongly encourage any hair removal to take place in a shower or immediately after a shower. Good old soap or body wash does the job just fine.

Some methods don't really lend themselves to this (in-salon waxing, for example), but that doesn't mean that cleansing shouldn't take place. At the very least, an alcohol swab should be used to disinfect the skin prior to hair removal.


Step Two: Exfoliation
-----

Removal of excess dead skin, or exfoliation, is crucial not only to successful hair removal with shaving or epilation, but also crucial to prevent ingrown hairs after the hair begins to grow back. There are two kinds of exfoliants: chemical and mechanical/physical. Chemical exfoliants are typically acids and can be super useful for keeping your skin healthy if your body has a difficult time keeping the skin cell conveyor belt moving. Chemical exfoliants, however, should *not* be used for hair removal, as these are specifically intended to aid in skin cell turnover over time or for dramatic resurfacing peels - not for the gentle, acute exfoliation required for hair removal. You want to stick to mechanical/physical exfoliants.

For best results, exfoliation should take place in the shower.

Mechanical/physical exfoliators are things like loofahs, washcloths, scrubs, and brushes. Not all of these exfoliators are created equally, though! There are two important considerations for the choice of an appropriate exfoliator:

1. How thick or delicate is the skin on which I am using it?

2. How soft or harsh is the exfoliator I am using?

Areas such as the face are notoriously delicate and therefore require a less harsh exfoliator. Scrubs should **not** have broken/jagged pieces (such as the ground walnut shell in [St. Ives Invigorating Apricot Scrub](http://www.stives.com/Facial-Products/Fresh-Skin/Invigorating-Apricot-Scrub/).) These cause micro-tears in the skin, which can be particularly damaging and irritating to the thin skin on your face. It is my opinion that these products can only safely be used on feet and hands for the removal of thick calluses.

Here are some general guidelines and examples for what you can use and where to use it:

***Face Area***

- A facial scrub with round micro-beads (eg, [Aveeno Positively Radiant Skin Brightening Daily Scrub](http://www.aveeno.com/product/aveeno-+positively+radiant-+skin+brightening+daily+scrub+.do) or [Ren Jojoba Microbead Purifying Facial Polish](http://www.renskincare.com/p/3075/Jojoba+Microbead+Purifying+Facial+Polish))

- A gentle soft-bristle scrub brush (eg. [Sephora Complexion Brush](http://www.sephora.com/face-complexion-brush-P0096) or [Clarisonic Facial Brush](http://www.clarisonic.com/))

***Armpit/Groin Area***

- A sugar scrub (eg, [Giovanni Hot Choclate Sugar Scrub](http://www.giovannicosmetics.com/products/item.asp?prodtype=BODY%20CARE&amp;cat=ECO%20CHIC&amp;subcat=BODY%20SCRUBS&amp;item=HSSCHOCOLATE-9) or [Alba Smoothing Sugar Cane Scrub](http://www.albabotanica.com/body/bath-shower/smoothing-sugar-cane.html))

***Arm/Leg Area***

- A sugar scrub (eg, [Giovanni Hot Choclate Sugar Scrub](http://www.giovannicosmetics.com/products/item.asp?prodtype=BODY%20CARE&amp;cat=ECO%20CHIC&amp;subcat=BODY%20SCRUBS&amp;item=HSSCHOCOLATE-9) or [Alba Smoothing Sugar Cane Scrub](http://www.albabotanica.com/body/bath-shower/smoothing-sugar-cane.html))

- A nylon bath towel (eg, [Salux Body Cloth](http://www.saluxshop.com/) or [Cure Series Exfoliating Bath Towel](http://www.amazon.com/Cure-Series-Japanese-Exfoliating-Towel/dp/B002KCCEGO/))

- A stiff bristle scrub brush (eg, [Fantasea Boar Bristle Brush](http://www.amazon.com/Fantasea-Natural-Bristle-Brush-Ounce/dp/B0035RE2TA/) or [Yerba Prima Tampico Bristle Brush](http://www.amazon.com/Yerba-Prima-Tampico-Brush-1xBRUSH/dp/B00016RIIA/))

- A natural loofah sponge (eg, [Ecotools Loofah Sponge](http://www.luckyvitamin.com/p-74892-eco-tools-loofah-bath-sponge) or [Aquasentials 6 in Bath Loofah](http://www.amazon.com/Aquasentials-6in-Bath-Loofah-2pk/dp/B001BLZGZ6/))

You will note that I listed sugar scrubs but not salt scrubs. Salt scrubs are much harsher and more irritating than sugar scrubs without providing any additional benefits. Therefore, I advocate utilizing sugar scrubs instead salt scrubs in all cases.

I have also omitted those [nylon bath pouf loofah thingies](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_OHL1ZxgUhkY/TEX022s9v6I/AAAAAAAALic/pLoqqplM5TA/s1600/bath-pouf-274x300.jpg) you see everywhere because the nylon bath towels I listed do a MUCH better job of exfoliating, last longer, can be disinfected more easily, dry faster, and provide just as much sudsing power. Plus it's much easier to scrub your back with one!

Also, a special note about armpit/groin area: I have put armpit/groin area as its own section because these areas are difficult. There is a compromise that must be struck between removal of excess skin flakes around thick hair, removal of antipersperant/deopderant residue (which can be especially difficult even with soap), and the inherent sensitivity of these areas. Therefore, I advocate using a sugar scrub exclusively on these areas. I find it to be a good compromise between effectiveness at removing deoderant/antipersperant and excess skin flakes around thick hair, as well as with gentleness. I have used the Giovanni sugar scrub I linked above on my armpits and bikini line for years with *amazing* results. 

Step Three: Softening Hair and Skin
-------

This step is easy - the most effective and efficient way of doing this is with heat and moisture. Take a shower! Showering softens hair and skin and allows for more effective hair removal.

When shaving, the use of a good shaving cream can also help soften the hair for more efficient removal.

Step Four: Minimization of Friction
-----

When dragging or applying an implement across your skin to remove hair, it's important to reduce the amount of friction on hair and/or skin. When shaving, that typically means using some kind of shaving soap or shaving cream. For epilation, it really depends on which method you are using. Threading and tweezing don't involve much contact with skin and therefore this is not much of a concern.

For waxing, sugaring, and use of an epilator, a thin coating of cornstarch or baby powder on the skin immediately before hair removal is ideal for the reduction of friction. This will help prevent damage to your skin (important after exfoliation) and, in the case of an epilator, allow for more efficient removal of hair by preventing the tweezer head from getting slowed down by dragging across your skin.

---------

So that's it! You should be a pro at healthy and efficient skin preparation for you hair removal method of choice. Following these practices not only makes for a more efficient and pleasant hair removal experience, but also helps ensure that the following days and weeks are in-grown hair and infection-free! With that in mind, it's a good idea to continue to exfoliate in your body area of shaving interest 1-2 times per week to keep in-growns at bay.

There are three other important universal tips when it comes to the actual process of hair removal:

1. **Always use a sharp/clean tool**. This not only helps with better hair removal, but it helps keep you from getting infections, and can help your hair removal implement of choice have a longer and happier service life.

2. **Always try to remove hair in the same direction as it is growing (with the grain.)** This not only helps reduce irritation, but in the case of epilation, it significantly reduces the chance that the hair will break at the skin surface when you are trying to remove it. This not only helps you keep from getting ingrown hairs, but it also gives you a longer period of time between hair removal sessions! **EDIT**: See [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1d8c1u/guide_hair_removal_skin_preparation_and_you_a/c9o90oh) with more information from /r/wicked_edge regarding shaving with the grain and against the grain.

3. **Always moisturize after removing hair**. Moisturizing your skin after what can be a traumatic experience for it will drastically reduce any irritation you have from the hair removal experience and ultimately also aids in preventing in-grown hairs. This is especially critical for areas where there is continuous skin-on-skin contact (eg, armpits and groin.)

Oh, and one more thing - for you ladies and gents out there who are currently unsatisfied with your shaving routine, I'd like to point you in the direction of **/r/wicked_edge**, where there a ton of really helpful people there who hook you up with better tools and better shaving techniques.

1374625390.0,228,self.SkincareAddiction,1ix7q3,How I got rid of my reoccuring monster zit,Ecm563,268,40,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ix7q3/how_i_got_rid_of_my_reoccuring_monster_zit/,"Hi SCA friends! I had THE LARGEST pimple of my life three days before my best friend's wedding last week. I fixed it within 24 hours and didn't have to deal with the embarrassing photos with a giant red monster on my cheek. I used a combination of things I've read here, and just general wound care knowledge from work (I'm an ICU RN).

First, a bit of background on the thing that came from under the skin (my pimple I named Satan). I have had Satan for a few years now, on and off. I feel like I can just never really rid myself of this evil thing and right about the time I think I finally got rid of him, there he is again in the same spot. Satan usually starts out as a whitehead that turns into a small cyst. This time around, Satan decided to start showing up about a week before the wedding I mentioned. I tried to leave it alone, but I knew that it would be a gruesome raised bump by the time the wedding that no amount of makeup could cover up.

So I took matters into my own hands. After I got home from work about 3 days before the big event I took a shower. Satan was pretty plump and ready to pop (I know, I should have taken pictures). If you even looked at it the wrong way it was going to explode. I washed my hands with soap, and used two tissues to gently pop the mound. I then carefully washed the area again with soap and applied 4% hibiclens (you can get it at cvs) with a q tip to the area of carnage. I let it sit for 2 minutes and used a sterile cloth with sterile water to take away the excess liquid after the 2 minutes were up. A few points about hibiclens. Do not get it in your eyes, mouth, or nose. Do not wash your face with any cleansers after you apply it because it could render the antimicrobial inactive. It works it's magic even after you irrigate the excess off your face by breaking down the membrane of the bacteria (gram positive and gram negative for you nerds out there). I let my face air dry after irrigating the excess hibiclens off. I substituted the 3M nexcare acne patches that everyone raves about with some hydrocolloid patches that I use on patients (it's honestly the same as the nexcare patches). You can find them at cvs as tough hydrocolloid pads. I cut one of the pads down to the size of Satan and slapped it on him for 24 hrs (luckily I had the next day off work).

When I finally peeled off the patch the following day, there was no more Satan. Just a small red mark to remind me of how much he cares. I could handle a little PIH as a trade off. The hydrocolloid bandage helps suck out the excess exudate (dead stuff in the form of pus), and helps with faster healing and less scaring. I really wouldn't recommend this for ALL of your acne, especially since you run the risk of scaring and PIH, but it def helps with those pesky giants that can ruin pictures and self esteem. I hope it helps!!

EDIT:

*Just to reinforce this: Hibiclens is an antimicrobial that is VERY irritating to your eyes, nose, mouth etc. Please try a skin test before using it to see if you're allergic, or have any kind of reaction to it before putting it on your face.

*This is just what worked for me. I really do hope it does for you as well, but as we all know in the acne-prone caste that what works for you, doesn't always work for me. 

*Fair warning to anyone with super sensitive skin- some of the hydrocolloid patches are very very adhesive and can be quite irritating when removing them. Usually the longer they stay on, the less adhesive they become. Kind of like my ex boyfriends. 

*Just putting a hydrocolloid patch on a closed pimple isn't going to do a whole lot, unfortunately (even with the Hibiclens). It will create a water-proof barrier, but that's about all. If you try and pop the pimple before it's come to a head, you REALLY run the risk of serious scaring (but you knew that already). 

*I am not a doctor, I just make fun of the ones on TV (and in the break room when Dr. Idiot gives me a really dumb order). 

*AND WOW. I had no idea that this post would become popular. I will come up with a new post on my skin care regimen (oh and I'll include pics). Thanks so much kids!!

1362944140.0,224,self.SkincareAddiction,1a1cj3,Everything you wanted to know about OCM: The Oil Cleansing Method but were afraid to ask! ,ieatbugs,266,42,295,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1cj3/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_ocm_the_oil/,"Hi everyone! I'm Kristy and I'm your resident Oil Cleansing Evangelist and I'm here to tell you all about it.

**Background**: Oil Cleansing was never very popular in the US, although it's been used in Asia for quite some time. I think we associate oily with dirty culturally so it's been viewed with some skepticism. A year or so ago someone published a website with their version of it (not the regimen I'd recommend, it recommends steaming your face which we know is bad) and it spread through the internet and became super popular.

**Why does it work?** The principle that causes oil to dissolve oil is called dissolution theory. I think part of the reason people experience such great success with this type of cleansing is that in people with dehydrated oily skin, overcleansing skin causes more oil production, but most of the products geared toward oily skin are about removing dirt and oil which can actually make it worse and cause 'rebound oil production.' It's easy to get caught in a negative feedback loop here.

**Who Should Try it?** Anyone can try it. If you find regular cleansers too harsh, this might be a good option. It will probably work best for dry, dehydrated, and skin that's oily from dehydration.
I personally was oily and acne prone due to dehydrated skin. I never realized I was dehydrated until I tried the OCM. 


**OK, I'm convinced. How do I do this?**

Before we get started, a *word of warning: Test patch with new oils first. This method can, in a small percentage of acne prone people, cause super crazy bad breakouts. If someone is seriously acne prone, it might be really hard find out what oil actually works.* Acne prone folks should gear towards oils that have bactericidal and/or anti inflammatory properties.

That said, I used to have really intolerant skin and it worked fine for me, so you never know. I had to exhaust all of my options before I was willing to take the risk, and it paid off.

**How to Oil Cleanse:**

- You can use any one or multiple oils in any combination you like. They have different properties and will produce different results. Watch it with the castor oil, it can be really drying.
- Some popular choices are: Mineral oil, sunflower oil, olive oil, meadowfoam oil, jojoba oil, coconut oil (watch it with this one, this can cause crazybad breakouts in some people). You can get olive, sunflower, coconut in the cooking aisles at grocery stores, but some of the more exotic you might have to order from Garden of Wisdom. 

1. Wet your face with warm water. Not hot, and don't steam it.
2. Apply oil. You can premix it and store it or just use it directly from a container (make sure it's sterile though, if you put your fingers in the container it's just gonna grow bacteria)
3. Massage oil into face for a minute or two
4. Wipe oil off with warm washcloth after massage
5. One or two drops of olive oil or another oil may be used to moisturize the skin after the cleansing oil has been removed from the face. Personally I like to use argan oil.

**That's it! If you have any more questions, add them as comments and I will address/update as needed**

Switching to one that doesn't contain sulfates or cocamidopropyl betaine might do a lot for your skin.

I was super skeptical that this would make a difference, but my experience has totally convinced me. I had this area on the right side of my chin, under the corner of my mouth and all the way down to my jawline, that was pretty much always broken out. I always assumed it was hormonal or from talking on the phone or something.

I was using some Crest toothpaste that contained sodium laurel sulfate and cocamidopropyl betaine and switched to one that didn't contain sulfates, but still contained cocamidopropyl betaine (it was [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Crest-White-Luxe-Glamorous-Toothpaste/dp/B009PIJLMQ)) after someone mentioned switching toothpastes on here. My chin cleared up a little bit, but not a huge amount. I had fewer cystic pimples but still a lot of superficial breakouts.

Then, when I traveled abroad this summer, I switched to a random toothpaste I found in a Bulgarian grocery store (it's called Dentalux, [here's](http://i.imgur.com/H13pDGi.jpg?2) the ingredients) that contains neither sulfates nor cocamidopropyl betaine. I've been using that for about a month and my chin has almost completely cleared up! It's amazing.

Then I visited my boyfriend last week and used his toothpaste (Sensodyne Pronamel), which contains no sulfates but does contain cocamidopropyl betaine, and I got a few superficial breakouts in the same area on my chin again. But they've been clearing up easily since I switched back to the Dentalux toothpaste.

So anyways. There was some discussion a while ago about coconut-based ingredients like cocamidopropyl betaine and how they might cause irritation or breakouts for some people, and since it's a common ingredient in toothpaste apparently, if you have persistent chin breakouts, you might want to try to track down a sulfate and cocamidopropyl betaine free toothpaste!

Sorry for the wall of text, but I hope this helps someone! :)

After reading all your thoughts in the threads here, I realized that I was going about my skincare the wrong way. Things that I thought were good, like using the strongest products available or that 'tight' feeling in your face after you wash, were turned completely on their heads.

When my skin was at its worst, I regularly had very noticeable zits near or on my nose, mouth area and chin. I couldn't understand what I was doing wrong, when I'd wash my face multiple times a day, dress my problem areas with an 2% alcohol and erythromycin solution, and dab really strong salicylic acid on my face (I kept having to wash it off because I'd burn myself!). I'd never touched a moisturizer in my life!

Now, I wash my face with a mild cleanser before bed and dab any dodgy looking parts with a little basil oil-based pimple cream. In the morning, I rinse my face in the shower and put on some sunscreen and moisturizer. That's it. I have almost no zits, and when I get them (usually around the time I have my period), they're small and gone overnight. Skin care is so much cheaper, less effort, and less of a time sink than it used to be. Most importantly, it's 100 times more effective. It's nuts.

It didn’t matter what I tried, shaving cream, moisturizer and exfoliating… It just always happened. 

I had refrained from regularly shaving my upper legs in years and only saving it for special occasions. My leg hair is rather thin and not too dark, but it was noticeable. I tried waxing with regular exfoliation but the ingrown hairs were too much to handle. I had resorted to bleaching it because it was the only way I could diminish it appearance.

Finally, after reading some recommendations in this sub and some trial and error and research, I developed a routine that gives me no bumps, irritation or ingrown hairs in my upper legs.

1. Gently exfoliate with a exfoliating glove and a bit of body wash with Salicylic acid on it. I use the Pink Grapefruit Neutrogena one because it’s the same one I use for my bacne. Warning: Do not overdo this cause you might irritate the skin.

2. Use a no-scent moisturizing shave cream. I found this [Alba Botanica]( http://www.vitacost.com/alba-botanica-very-emollient-natural-moisturizing-cream-shave-unscented) at Whole Foods. A little goes a LONG way. It doesn’t irritate my skin at all and it doesn’t leave a residue-y feeling afterwards.

3. Rinse it all well with cold water

4. Use witch hazel astringent pads (Thayer’s) and gently apply it to all the shaved area.

5. After legs are dry, moisturize with coconut oil (I use the NOW solutions one, but I’m pretty sure any will work). I’m pretty sure you can use other oils, I just chose coconut because it was the cheapest but if you have acne sensitivities you might want to find one that is non-comedogenic.

The bumps have disappeared almost completely, and the few that appear are barely pink, not very noticeable and disappear in a couple of days.

This might seem like a lot of work, and perhaps you probably have to tailor it to your needs; but I am just happy that I can finally shave my upper legs without having to worry about ugly red bumps!

I also use it as part of my evening routine, and was very excited to visit Marrakesh to pick up some of the stuff first hand!

I attended a spice course whilst there and was given a short lesson on Argan Oil.  Please if anyone has anymore information update me or correct me if I've been provided with the incorrect information.

I can't remember the exact number but it was something like 160% of Argan oil production is sold.  Cutting argan oil is rampant as there is more demand than supply.  Most often it is cut with olive oil, and or vegetable oil.  Buyer beware.  If it's a good deal then it is definitely too good to be true.  The extraction of argan oil is a long arduous process and is not cheap.  On the back of this, it is very important socially to rural women of Morocco (as this is the only place in the world it grows).  Argan oil is produced almost exclusively by women's cooperatives which provide a livelihood to otherwise socially destitute women.  So buying Argan oil is a good thing!   Just be wary of the sellers.  I've been advised that a way to test the purity of your argan oil is to put it the in freezer.  If it separates into layers, you have a problem.  I tested mine and it froze solid, so I was happy. I was slightly worried as to how this might actually affect the oil though (someone know??)

Also the smell - it shouldn't really smell like anything.  If it smells nutty, then it's probably cooking grade, as the nuts have been roasted and then pressed.  The cosmetic grade should have no strong scent.

After having gone to the dermatologist and revamping my routine, I also worked on breaking my picking habit.


Morning routine:

* Wash face with CeraVe foaming face wash
* Pat dry with clean towel
* Apply topical ointment (1% clindamycin gel) to full face
* Apply Cetaphil moisturizer around my eyes, the sides of my nose, and mouth areas
* Gently pat a few pumps of CeraVe AM cream with SPF to all face except near eyes
* Make up: BareMinerals foundation with SPF, a touch of BareMinerals concealer/blemish powder, followed by a light dusting of Bare Minerals mineral veil (this seems to really help my face deal with excess oil during the day)


Night routine:

* Look in mirror and examine carefully for blemishes. Push away the urge to pick and grab my trusty dental floss, and floss my teeth until they're wonderfully clean and plaque free. Continue to resist the urge to pick.
* Wash face with warm water and CeraVe foaming face wash. Rinse face twice with soaking wet wash cloth. If there is any more soap residue, splash water on face until gone.
* Pat dry with clean towel.
* Gently apply Cetaphil moisturizer on whole face.
* Continue to resist the urge to head back to the mirror and pick.
* Change to fresh pillowcase every night before going to sleep.



My skin is so much happier than it ever was before, and I'm using fewer products than ever before. I might be using a lot more floss than previously, but without the damage caused by picking, my pores seem more immune to blackheads forming and the wrinkles I'm slowly developing with age seem to be slowing down in their formation.

Does anyone else have a gentle routine that they use?

1364938151.0,142,self.SkincareAddiction,1bjjwc,Teach It Tuesday - Post Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation (PIH),niccig,166,24,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1bjjwc/teach_it_tuesday_post_inflammatory/,"The question of how to get rid of post-acne dark spots has been coming up a lot lately, so it seemed like the perfect topic for a Teach It Tuesday. I suffer from this myself, so I did a little bit of digging into the subject.

**First, some terminology**

This post will focus on post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, which are the dark marks that remain after an acne lesion has healed. It’s commonly referred to as “acne scarring” but it isn’t a true scar, since it’s often transient and doesn't involve changes to the collagen in the skin. Even though this post won’t go into other types of acne scarring, I’ll leave some descriptions here for the sake of knowledge.

*Hypertrophic scarring* - raised lumps of scar tissue where an acne lesion was. Sometimes there is an overgrowth of scar tissue that extends beyond the original inflammation site (keloid scarring). This type of scarring is common on the torso.

*Atrophic scarring* - depressions in the skin due to a loss of collagen. Depending on the shape and area covered, these are classified into rolling, box or icepick scars.

**What is PIH, and what causes it?**

Post-inflammatory hyper pigmentation (PIH) results from an overproduction of melanin following inflammation of the skin. Cytokines and inflammatory mediators can have a stimulatory effect on melanocytes, which results in increased melanin production. Inflammation can also cause the destruction of basal keratinocytes, resulting in an accumulation of pigment at the injury site. It can occur after any type of injury to the skin, including acne, dermatitis or traumatic injury, and can exist at the dermal and/or epidermal layers. While it isn't physically harmful, many people seek treatment due to the social and emotional effects.  

**What are the risk factors?**

PIH can occur in anyone. However, it's usually more common, noticeable and persistent in people with darker skin types ([Fitzpatrick types III-VI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzpatrick_scale)). The color of the hyperpigmentation can vary depending on skin tone and location in the skin (dermal vs epidermal), showing up as red, purple, brown or bluish. There's also a correlation between the intensity of the original inflammation and the intensity of the resulting PIH. Repeated inflammation at the same site (such as reoccurring acne cysts) can exacerbate the effect. 

**Well, how do I avoid it?** 

PIH is notorious for taking a long time to treat, so as they say, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Avoiding inflammation altogether is the best way to avoid PIH, but the second best is to be prompt about treating any skin conditions that might cause it. Also avoid doing anything that causes inflammation to become worse (I'm looking at you, pimple-poppers!).

**I already have it! How do I make it go away?**

Fortunately there are lots of well-studied treatments for PIH. Below are some of the most-researched topical treatments.

**Sunscreen** - These treatment options increase the skin’s sensitivity to the sun, so a high-SPF/PPD broad-spectrum sunscreen must be used along with them. Otherwise, there’s a good chance that not only will the treatment for PIH fail, but they’ll actually cause additional photo damage to the skin. Used on its own, sunscreen can help prevent any existing hyperpigmentation from becoming worse.

*Retinoids* - These vitamin A derivatives are commonly prescribed for acne but can also assist in fading hyperpigmentation. They work by increasing epidermal turnover, facilitating melanin dispersion and removal. Adapalene (Differin), tretinoin (Retin-A) and tazarotene (Tazorac) have all been shown to be effective in clinical studies. The most common adverse effects of retinoid use are redness, dryness and irritation. Retinoid dermatitis can lead to additional hyperpigmentation, especially in darker skin, so it can be beneficial to start with a lower-strength retinoid and gradually increase the amount and frequency of use. Retinoids can be prescribed by your doctor.

*Chemical Peels* - Superficial chemical peels with alpha hydroxy acids are common treatments for PIH since they are generally well-tolerated. Chemical peels work by promoting exfoliation and dispersing basal layer melanin. Glycolic, lactic, and salicylic acid peels have all been shown to be effective in treating hyperpigmentation. Glycolic acid may also be effective in treating superficial atrophic scars because it increases dermal collagen synthesis. Depending on the active used, the concentration of the active and how long the peel is left on the skin, the ‘depth’ of the peel can be controlled. Potential side effects include a burning sensation, redness, and skin irritation/sensitivity. Salicylic acid can potentially cause dryness, especially for people with drier skin types. Excessive irritation can lead to additional hyperpigmentation, so it’s important to choose the ingredients and strength of the peel carefully, taking your skin type and any allergies/sensitivities into account. Patch testing is also extremely important in order to minimize any adverse effects. Peels can be performed by your dermatologist, and kits are also available for use at home.

*Vitamin C*- The antioxidant properties can help suppress melanin synthesis. Other benefits include anti-inflammatory effects and possible photoprotective properties. L-ascorbic acid, the most potent form, isn’t very stable in solution, so vitamin C products should be chosen and stored carefully. It is most effective when combined with other treatments. Vitamin C is available in many OTC products.

*Daily AHAs* - In addition to use as peeling agents, alpha hydroxy acids can be used as frequently as every day in lower concentrations to promote regular and even exfoliation of the skin. Over time, this can assist in fading hyperpigmentation. Many skin types can tolerate regular AHA use along with other PIH treatments. Many AHA products are available over the counter. 

*Azelaic Acid* - This is a dicarboxylic acid that was developed for the treatment of acne and rosacea. In addition to fighting acne by killing bacteria and decreasing keratin production, it can help fade hyperpigmentation through tyrosinase inhibition and cytotoxic effects toward abnormal melanocytes. It is generally well-tolerated, but may cause redness, burning, irritation or allergic reaction. Azelaic acid (commonly sold under the brand name Finacea) can be prescribed by your doctor.

*Niacinamide* - a form of vitamin B3. It works by inhibiting melanosome transfer from melanocytes to keratinocytes. Clinical studies seem to be using a concentration of at least 4%. In general, it does not cause irritation and is well-tolerated.

**How long will it take to go away?**

The healing process is somewhat unique for each person, so the amount of time needed for treatment can vary widely depending on your skin, the severity of the PIH, the treatments you choose, and your consistency in applying the treatment. In some cases, it may exist long-term or permanently. For many people, especially those with darker skin, a minimum of 3-6 months of treatment is necessary before significant improvements are visible, and it could take a year to several years before the condition is completely resolved.

It doesn't discriminate between dry, oily, or combination skin and can be aggravated by topical skin care as much as lifestyle (binge drinking or smoking, for instance). 

It's hard to describe dehydrated skin, since I feel it can present itself differently in many people. However, in my experience, it's generally skin that appears lackluster and dull, sallow or ""tired,"" and when pulled taut, it almost seems to wrinkle a bit. Dehydrated skin doesn't ""bounce back"" easily and is more prone to congestion (bumps, blackheads) and acne. It generally soaks up moisturizer yet looks oily in spots and feels dry as a bone in others.

The first thing to consider, and the most obvious, is moisture content. Do you drink adequate amounts of water a day? This doesn't mean chugging water until you feel like a portable kiddie pool, but you should be drinking 4-6 glasses a day. 

Another facet of moisture is how much moisture is around your skin and what is on your skin to drink that moisture up (and hold it to the skin itself). For people in drier environments or simply those of us prone to dry or dehydrated skin, I highly recommend investing in a warm mist humidifier (cold mist must be cleaned more frequently and makes a room feel clammy). I run mine virtually every night, and it makes a noticeable difference in how plump my skin remains throughout the day and night.

You also want to be paying attention to what kind of ingredients are holding moisture to your skin and how you are using them. I'm talking humectants here, such as glycerin, hyaluronic acid, and squalene.

[Glycerin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerol) is easily the most recognizable and common humectant. It should never be applied straight, though a couple drops can be added to your favourite moisturizer if you feel in need of a boost. It *is* fairly sticky though, so I wouldn't recommend adding more than two drops. On that note, I recommend against doing this during the day, since it can make skin more ""shiny"" and sticky. 

Glycerin is found in most skincare products and is widely available. It is also an acne trigger in a small number of people.

[Hyaluronic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronan) is a naturally derived ingredient that can hold up to 1000 times its weight in water. It is very light, thin, and usually is not sticky. It is most commonly found in serums, but is also becoming more widely used in creams and lotions. It is best applied to damp skin (not sopping wet, but not completely patted dry either) during your water-soluable phase. If you're using it as a serum, follow it with a rich moisturizer.

Some people find hyaluronic acid drying. Your mileage may vary.

Some examples of products containing hyaluronic acid:

* SERUM. [Garden of Wisdom Hyaluronic Acid Serums](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/hyaluronic.html) are fabulously light-weight and effective. They are also very reasonably priced. You can purchase a sampler pack to try, which has enough product to last you 1-2 months, depending on usage. I suggest trying the cosmocil CQ blend of preservatives if your skin is sensitive.

* CREAMS AND LOTIONS. [CeraVe](http://www.lovelyskin.com/products.asp?MID=119) products are fabulous if they work well for your skin. I'm sure readers of this subreddit get tired of hearing us talk about CeraVe, but they are reasonably priced, widely available, and contain great skincare ingredients, such as niacinimide, hyaluronic acid, and ceramides ([which may be beneficial for eczema in some people](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18306855)). It is recommended that you spot test CeraVe products if you are acne-prone.

* UK OPTION. [Hydraluron Moisture Booster](http://www.boots.com/en/Hydraluron-Moisture-Booster-From-Indeed-Labs-the-people-who-brought-you-Nanoblur_1262210/) is available from Boots and may be a great choice for people who are not sensitive to algae ingredients and just want a basic, no-frills HA product they can buy from a brick-and-mortar store. I've never used it personally, but it does seem to get rave reviews from people who use it.

[Squalene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squalene) is a natural, organic compound that is usually derived from olives. It's close sister, squalane, is a hydrogenated derivative that has longer shelf life, but she has a lower cost and is therefore more profitable in cosmetic applications. People who have a sensitivity to olives or break out from topical use of olive oil should spot test products with squalene before using. 

Some examples of products containing squalene/squalane:

* US OPTION 1. [Solvere](http://www.lovelyskin.com/details.asp?PID=115991&amp;amp;MID=545&amp;amp;PG=1) is a regularly recommended, no-frills moisturizer for those who do well with squalane. 

* US OPTION 2/UK OPTION 1. [La Roche-Posay Toleraine Fluid](http://www.dermstore.com/product_Toleriane+Facial+Fluid_677.htm) is a cosmetically elegant, light moisturizer. It applies very light and thin, yet moisturizes beautifully if you have oily or combination skin.

* UK OPTION 2. [Oilatum Natural Repair Face Cream](http://www.boots.com/en/Oilatum-Natural-Repair-Face-Cream_9627/) is a fabulous option for UK residents on a tight budget. It is a great little moisturizer that packs quite a punch for roughly £8.

Your success with the various humectants are very individual. Some people prefer hyaluronic acid for their extra moisture while others prefer glycerin. Whatever you choose, keeping extra moisture around will allow your humectants to work to the best of their ability.

The next thing to consider when aiding dehydrated skin is your product usage. Are you using several topicals that dry or irritate skin? Some examples of irritating ingredients are:

* Salicylic acid
* Benzoyl peroxide
* Tea tree oil
* Topical acne medications (Rx treatments, such as Aczone, Retin-a, Retin-a Micro, Differin, and Tazorac)
* Sulfur topicals (such as Murad's spot treatment [3%], De la Cruz Sulfur Ointment [10%], and Queen Helene Mint Julep Mask)

If you're not using any of these ingredients but feel your skin is dehydrated, make sure you're not using a cleanser that strips the skin and makes it feel dry and tight after cleansing (prior to applying moisturizer). *Your skin should never feel this way after cleansing, it is a sign of a damaged skin barrier.* It should feel pleasantly fresh, not squeaky clean. Some common cleansing ingredients and products that cause dry skin in many (but not all) people:

* African black soap
* Plain ol' bar soap
* Dr Bronner's soap
* Acne cleansers, such as Neutrogena's Deep Clean Facial Cleanser or orange bar
* Cleansers with SLS or SLES, such as Purpose
* Drying clay masks used too frequently (such as Aztec Secret Indian Clay Mask)

If you're using an irritating non-RX product, it is advised that you use only one at a time and only once skin is healed and can tolerate it. Even anti-acne products can cause acne if they are irritating the skin and disrupting the skin barrier. Please allow at least one week for your skin to heal if you feel you've overdone it (bland moisturizer, bland cleanser, sunscreen).

If it's an RX product you're using, please contact your doctor for advice.

For those of you using a harsh cleanser (*glare*) or one that makes you feel dry and tight after use, I highly recommend you shelve it and try a gentle, non-sudsing cleanser, such as CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser or Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser. This will cleanse the skin without stripping it of its much-needed moisture.

The most important thing with skincare is listening to your skin and working with it rather than fighting against it's nature. When skin is dehydrated and breaking out, you must treat the disease, not just the symptom. Once you have established a high-moisture, gentle regimen, and your skin has had time to heal (1-2 weeks), you may gradually begin to re-introduce potential irritants such as benzoyl peroxide or tea tree oil.

Hopefully this post has been helpful and answers questions I see many of you posing every day. Please feel free to ask questions and I will do my best to answer them!

It is, in short, a powertool for cleansing your skin. I'm sure we've all heard the hype and the discussion about this $100+ tool -- that it clears acne, ""deep cleans"" pores, and cleanses ""6x better than your hands alone.""

I've seen a couple users on this subreddit having issues with the Clarisonic, and I really quickly wanted to address those issues and hopefully save people who are really interested in the Clarisonic some potential pain.

First, please keep in mind that the Clarisonic is *absolutely* an [exfoliating tool](http://blog.clarisonic.com/2013/02/27/exfoliation-and-the-clarisonic/). How else does skin look ""brighter"" and pores ""clearer""? Part of cleaning skin is removing dirt, makeup, old sebum, *and dead skin*. You over-do this and you get break-outs -- the ol' ""Clarisonic purging,"" which isn't purging at all but merely irritation from too much exfoliation. 

I also want to point out that the dermatologist that has authored the report regarding cleansing with the Clarisonic (Cosmetic Dermatology, Feb 2005) was *paid* by Clarisonic. Another caveat of the research is that the brand names of the cleansers were not mentioned, nor did the ""manual cleansing"" group ever use a makeup remover prior to cleansing. And as we all know, **most** makeup requires a double-cleansing with an oil-based cleanser to remove all traces of foundation, concealer, mascara, etc.

Furthermore, the other published piece of information about the Clarisonic, describing how the sonic cleansing system works, was also paid for the company that sells Clarisonic (Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology, June 2006, pg 181-183).

In short, Clarisonic's ""dermatologist"" claims aren't reliable and you should take the them with a grain of salt.

Now, I'm *not* telling you *not* to pick up a Clarisonic if you want to, but please don't believe it will reduce wrinkles, pores, or even necessarily blemishes. Have realistic expectations before you splurge on it!

With that said, here's a quick, short list of do's and don'ts:

* DO double cleanse if you're wearing makeup. Remove your makeup first with an oil-based cleanser and your hands. Rinse. Cleanse with your Clarisonic.
* DON'T use more than 3x a week if your skin is sensitive. Unless your skin is very tough, you should not use the Clarisonic twice a day.
* DO back off on your Clarisonic usage if you see unusual breakouts or redness and irritation. This is skin irritation from over-exfoliation.
* DON'T use the Clarisonic if you have Rosacean skin or are prone to broken capillaries.
* DO be careful when using a Clarisonic on acne-prone skin, which is very sensitive to irritation.
* DON'T press hard! It only takes gentle pressure to exfoliate your skin, even with a manual scrub or washcloth.
* DO be careful about using a Clarisonic in tandem with retinoids or retinols, which make your skin very delicate and sensitive! For that matter, please be careful with all exfoliants (chemical and manual) when using tretinoin products.
* DON'T be tempted to use more scrubs on your face or over-do it with the AHA/BHA while using the Clarisonic. It provides ample exfoliation for most skin types -- trust me! Using your Clarisonic 2-3x a week and your AHA 2-3x a week (PM) is enough (in fact, that would be a nightmare for my skin).
* DO change your brush heads every 3-4 months with new ones. 
* DON'T keep your Clarisonic in the shower, where it can get moldy. 
* DO clean it frequently with antibacterial soap or alcohol. 
* DON'T use the Clarisonic in conjunction with anything gritty. It will ruin the motor (and possibly irritate your skin).
* DO listen to your skin -- no matter whether it's with a Clarisonic or an AHA or a washcloth or even a new cleanser. Your skin knows what it needs. Learn to identify the signs of product breakouts or irritation breakouts and you're on your way to clearer, healthier skin, Clarisonic or not.

Anyways, that's all! It's 4:30 AM again (WHY do I always write these before bed?!) and I am starting a new job tomorrow (after 1 year of being unable to find steady work -- YAY!). Please feel free to add to the discussion -- both positive or negative -- and poke me if I left anything out. :)

Edit: Added a couple I left out.

Edit 2: I want to note, regarding rosacean skin -- Rosacean skin, in my experience (my whole family has rosacea -- yay, Celtic genes!), is more delicate than usual. My mom, a lover of all abrasive scrubs, has many broken caps along her cheekbones and nose as a result. Now, this evidence is purely anecdotal, but it is something that has been parroted to me by my dermatologist as well. If you have rosacea but can use the Clarisonic or scrubs successfully, great! However, if you find your skin is delicate or very sensitive to scrubs, use with a light hand. Broken caps are much worse than a couple of patches of dry skin!

Source: Nolan, K. and Marmur, E. (2012), Moisturizers: Reality and the skin benefits. Dermatologic Therapy, 25: 229–233.



 Quoted from the text: 


There are four main classes of moisturizers: occlusives, humectants, emollients, and rejuvenators.



**Occlusives**


Occlusives work by forming a hydrophobic layer on the surface of the skin providing an exogenous barrier to water loss. Because they prevent evaporation from the skin, they can be particularly effective when applied to already dampened skin. Occlusives are the most common type of moisturizers used in formulations [1].



Although occlusives are not the most appealing of ingredients to consumers, due in part to their greasy feel, petrolatum, the prototypic occlusive, it is actually the most effective moisturizer and reduces transepidermal water loss by 99% [7]. Petrolatum is the most commonly used active agent in skin care products, after water [1]. Occlusives are well tolerated among individuals and are often used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. A recent study [8] found that an over-the-counter (OTC) petroleum-based skin moisturizer (Aquaphor Healing Ointment, Beiersdorf, Wilton, CT) was as clinically effective in treating mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis as a more expensive ceramide containing prescription barrier cream. Petrolatum also can help restore the stratum corneum barrier by penetrating into its upper layers and initiating the production of intercellular lipids, including free sterols, sphingolipids, and free fatty acids [9]. Petrolatum is also able to reduce the appearance of fine lines caused by dehydration. Although principally an occlusive, petrolatum can also act as an emollient (discussed in more detail later) and fills the spaces between desquamating corneocytes making the skin smooth and soft.



Dimethicone is the second most common active agent in moisturizers today because like petrolatum, it is also is hypoallergenic, noncomedogenic, and nonacnegenic [10]. Dimethicone is among a family of silicones that comprise the basis of all oil-free moisturizers [1]. However, petrolatum is superior to dimethicone in decreasing fine facial lines of dehydration or for healing skin [9]. Dimethicone is permeable to water vapor and therefore if the skin barrier is compromised, dimethicone will not reduce transepidermal water loss. This however is beneficial in some foundations and sunscreens, in that it allows for the evaporation of perspiration, preventing the skin from feeling warm developing miliaria [1]. Like petrolatum, dimethicone can also act as an emollient.




**Humectants**



This second major class of moisturizers are able to increase the water content of the skin by enhancing water absorption from the dermis into the epidermis. Some also think that humectants are able to hydrate the stratum corneum by absorbing water from the external environment [11]. In contrast to occlusives, humectants have several hydrophilic hydroxyl groups, and their hydroscopic properties allow them to attract and hold water molecules. Because of humectants’ ability to enhance water absorption upward from the dermis, these compounds can cause excessive water loss from the dermis through evaporation into the lower humidity environment. This occurs especially if the skin barrier is compromised. Because of this phenomenon, in formulations humectants are always combined with occlusives that prevent water loss. Humectants include hydroxy acids, propylene glycol, and urea.



The most common humectant used in moisturizers is glycerol or glycerin. This hydroscopic compound is the most effective humectant and can also activate transglutaminase activity in the stratum corneum, accelerating the maturation of corneocytes and reducing scaling in xerotic skin [11]. Glycerin also has some unique characteristics including its ability to produce moisturizing effects in the skin long after it is no longer present. Glycerin is able to produce this effect through modulating water channels in the skin, known as aquaporins [1]. The principal aquaporin in the epidermis is aquaporin-3. Interestingly, aquaporin-3 expression is increased in human skin diseases, with elevated transepidermal water loss [1]. Overall, when combined with occlusive agents, glycerin has the ability to produce significant moisturizing effects in the skin.



**Emollients**


This class of moisturizer is used to improve the appearance and texture of skin by filling in the crevices between corneocytes. This contributes to increased softness and smoothness of the skin and improves its overall appearance. Some common emollients include essential fatty acids, which are found in various natural oils. These essential fatty acids like linoleic acid can be oxidized to eicosanoids, which are important signaling molecules involved in inflammatory pathways and the immune system. It is therefore thought that fatty acids may also influence skin physiology [11].



**Rejuvenators**



This final class of moisturizers is intended to replenish essential proteins in this skin. Collagen, keratin, and elastin are skin proteins that are often found in rejuvenators. Because these proteins are relatively large, a considerable limitation to rejuvenators is their difficulty penetrating of the stratum corneum [12]. Although rejuvenators may not be able to successfully replenish proteins in the dermis, they can have a role similar to emollients and improve skin appearance by creating a film that aesthetically smoothes the skin and stretches out and fills in fine lines.



**Ceramides**



Although not a class of moisturizer, these lipid molecules have been used increasingly in recent years in the treatment of atopic skin and in cosmeceuticals. Ceramides are an essential component of normal stratum corneum and function to help maintain the integrity of the skin barrier. In 1990, it was found that the level of ceramides was greatlyreduced in the stratum corneum in patients with atopic dermatis. It was subsequently concluded that an insufficiency of ceramides in the stratum corneum is an important factor in atopic dry skin [5]. Subsequently, ceramides have been added to many moisturizes used in the treatment of both atopic and normal skin. Because ceramides are oil soluble, they can easily be incorporated into moisturizers; however, many products with ceramides, especially prescription formulations, can be prohibitively expensive [6]. Although ceramides have been shown to improve barrier function of damaged skin [3], recent studies have shown that inexpensive OTC nonceramide products can be just as effective in treating mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis [3].

If you use makeup brushes, it's important to keep them clean because you're just putting all that lovely oil, bacteria, dead skin cells, etc back on your face each time.  Just make sure you're cleaning them properly depending on the materials so you don't damage the brushes.  Clean makeup brushes = happy skin!

1370684772.0,109,self.SkincareAddiction,1fx45x,AHAs and BHAs - What's the difference and how to choose for your skin type,JoanOfSarcasm,125,16,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1fx45x/ahas_and_bhas_whats_the_difference_and_how_to/,"If you've been a part of this subreddit for longer than a week, you've probably heard the abbreviations ""AHA"" and ""BHA"" tossed around fairly regularly. That's because we *love* chemical exfoliants here on this subreddit, and I'm here to explain to you the difference and which you should try (skin type dependent).

**To start, an AHA is short for ""Alpha Hydroxy Acid.""** To put it simply, alpha hydroxy acid is your dead skin ""detacher."" Imagine your skin as many cells, held together by a ""glue."" AHA works by loosening up this glue and letting the cells fall away easier. This helps to reveal brighter, healthier, and plumper skin beneath. It is most commonly found in the following three forms: Glycolic, lactic, and mandelic. 

* **Glycolic**. The most common of all the AHAs, this acid has the smallest molecular structure, which allows it to be the most effectual on the skin but also the most potentially irritating. I recommend looking for it in low concentrations if you are new to AHA products -- 8-10%. Alpha Hydrox is a commonly recommended line of glycolic acid products. Has a mild humectant property.
* **Lactic**. The second most common of all the AHAs. This is the basis for the beloved St. Ives pads. The molecular structure is larger than AHA but not as large as mandelic. It is highly recommended for sensitive skin types, such as rosacean skin. Lactic acid is also milk derived. It has great humectant properties.
* **Mandelic**. The least common, but one of the best choices for acne-prones. It has a large molecular structure, meaning it takes longer to work its magic on skin and is thus less irritating. It is also anti-bacterial/anti-microbial. It is derived from bitter almonds. Mandelic also has moderate humectant properties.

Many studies also have proven that AHAs increase dermal thickness and improve collagen density as well as quality of elastic fibers.

* [SOURCE 1](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/8642081)
* [SOURCE 2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2133.1996.d01-1088.x/abstract;jsessionid=8F1BD9BC1178A87ADF7E90B6EBD17F44.d02t02?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;amp;userIsAuthenticated=false)
* [SOURCE 3](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962296906027)
* [SOURCE 4](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1524-4725.2001.00234.x/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;amp;userIsAuthenticated=false)

AHAs are a great choice for dry skin -- they all have some humectant properties (meaning they hold moisture to the skin) and are water-soluable. This means they work best on bare, clean skin. 

If you are using the OCM, I highly recommend wiping away much of the oil before application, as excessive amounts of oil will inhibit the AHA's full effectiveness. A residue should not make too much of a difference, however. 

If you wish to buffer AHA, simply put a small amount in with your moisturizer at night. 

Your routine would look something like this (water soluble -&gt; oil soluble):

* Cleanse -&gt; Pat dry -&gt; Toners -&gt; AHA -&gt; Serums -&gt; Moisturizers -&gt; Any additional occlusives (ie. Vaseline) -&gt; Sunscreen

AHAs do increase photosensitivity, so *please* wear a sunscreen during the day! **[I highly recommend making sure your sunscreen is stable.](http://www.skinacea.com/faq/sunscreen/s01-sunscreen-stability.html#.UbL1Dfk3u1s)**

I also recommend only using an AHA 3x a week, if you are sensitive-skinned, though some can use it every night without issue. If you are new to AHAs, introduce them every third night and build up to every other night until you know your tolerance.

Moving on...

**BHA is short for ""Beta Hydroxy Acid.""** BHAs are a bit more complicated than AHAs. They work by penetrating the pore and essentially ""degunking."" This is what makes them preferred for oily and acne-prone skin, though *acne-prone skin can certainly benefit from an AHA!* 

For the purpose of this post, the BHA we will be talking about is **salicylic acid**, which is derived from salicin. Because of this, it is not advised to use salicylic acid products if you have an asprin allergy. 

Salicylic acid has no humectant properties, and in fact usually causes drying of the skin, though it is usually more gentle than other common acne treatments, such as benzoyl peroxide. It is also oil soluble, so don't worry about your OCM messing with it's effectiveness!

The most commonly recommended BHA on this subreddit is Stridex ""in the red box"" since it is alcohol-free. However, if you cannot tolerate menthol, *I highly recommend Paula's Choice exfoliants.* I personally use the [CLEAR Regular Strength 2% BHA Liquid](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/aha-and-bha-exfoliants/_/CLEAR-Regular-Strength-Anti-Redness-Exfoliating-Solution-With-Two-Percent-Salicylic-Acid/) and it has not done wrong by my extremely sensitive skin. If you need a stronger BHA, check out [the 2% BHA Liquid](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/aha-and-bha-exfoliants/_/Skin-Perfecting-Two-Percent-BHA-Liquid-Exfoliant/). It is not as gentle as the ""regular strength,"" despite also being 2%. This is likely due to the other ingredients that act as a delivery system for the product.

**[Also, as far as we know, BHAs do NOT increase sun sensitivity.](http://tinyurl.com/md2pu6u)**

Your routine will look identical to the routine above for AHAs when using BHAs: 

* Cleanse -&gt; Pat dry -&gt; Toners -&gt; AHA -&gt; Serums -&gt; Moisturizers -&gt; Any additional occlusives (ie. Vaseline) -&gt; Sunscreen

This is because *most treatments work best when applied to clean, bare skin*. 

Same thing as AHAs -- If you are new to BHAs, start slow, and build until you find your tolerance. Some may find they can use BHAs twice a day.

**So in summary:**

* AHAs - Drier skin types. ""Unglues"" dead skin. Glycolic, lactic, mandelic. Humectant properties. Causes photo-sensitivity -- use only PM and wear a stable sunscreen AM. Repairs photoaged skin. 
* BHAs - Oilier skin types. ""Degunks"" pores. Salicylic acid. Can be drying. Does not cause photo-sensitivity. Can use AM or PM. 
* They CAN be used together, though I highly recommend adding them *one at a time* and finding your tolerance for each individual product before introducing another exfoliant. Sensitive-skinned folk should proceed with caution.

I had acne in high school, and then started breaking out again last August (I am 24). It may be hard to tell from the pics but around the chin and cheeks I was getting hard cistic acne. Some of it was so deep it wouldn't even reach the surface. I also had it on my back and butt. I tried diet (no dairy, bread, or sugar), but that was not working. I saw a dermatologist in October, and started taking medication in the beginning of November. The first picture was from Jan 9th, 2013. Not when my acne was the worst but still pretty bad.


I started with doxycycline 50mg twice daily. As well as Tretinoin cream .05%. That really didn't do much for me. They then bumped me up to 100mg Doxy twice daily, and gave me clindamycin and benzol peroxide 1.2%/5% (I think that really helped prevent new breakouts).

By April 1st most of my breakouts had gone away. I also started birth control, and my derm bumped me up to tretinoin .1% to get rid of some of the left over scarring.


I also started using ponds wet cleansing towlettes to remove makeup, and cetaphil for moisturizing during the day. My advice would be to be patient and dilligent.

________________________________________________________________________________________

Many people come to look to revamp their current routines or create a new routine. While not all of the products mentioned here will work for 100% of people, this is a good place to start regardless of skin type/concern. 

The products mentioned are those commonly recommended on the sub and by no means is it comprehensive. In addition, the products mentioned here tend to be affordable/widely available/effective for most people.

**But PLEASE keep in mind that skincare is not an exact science and no one can guarantee success for an individual.**
Recommendations on here have been the most well tolerated that we've encountered and users report a high degree of success with them. However, sensitivities are possible with any product and no product can guarantee 100% efficacy and tolerance in an entire population.
______________________________________________________________________________________________


First,  **stop** using St. Ives Apricot Scrub!!! The particles are large, non-uniform, sharp, and too abrasive to be suitable for facial use.

Next, **don't buy everything at once: include only 1 new product at a time**. Don't buy a new full blown routine if you don't need it!   Be patient, take your time, and **[Test patch](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/14sd25/i_just_learned_how_to_do_a_test_patch_properly/).**  .

If you can't seem to find a particular product in your country, a few online stores/companies can be helpful and ship internationally. These include [sasa](http://web1.sasa.com/SasaWeb/splash.jsp), [Paula's Choice](http://www.paulaschoice.com/), [iherb](http://www.iherb.com/), and [mmmule](http://mmmule.com/).  

Now, onto recommendations!!


- **Cleanser** 

  We frequently tell folks it's not necessary to cleanse 2x a day, particularly for those suffering with oily/dehydrated/dry skin types. Exceptions include things like post-workouts or if you've been sweating through the night.

  If your skin is feeling tight/dry/squeaky after cleansing, you should look for a new cleanser.

  *Cleanser Recs*
  
  ~ Cerave Foaming (US/Canada): Suitable for acne prone

  ~ Cerave Hydrating (US/Canada): Better for non-acne prone/dry

  ~ Spectro Jel (US/Canada): Suitable for acne-prones

  ~ Boots Sensitive Foaming Wash (UK/US/Canada/other?): Potentially suitable for all skin types

  ~ Eucerin DermatoClean, ""gentle"" (Worldwide): Suitable for sensitive/acne prone

  ~ [Oil Cleansing](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1cj3/everything_you_wanted_to_know_about_ocm_the_oil/): Suitable for almost all skin types, but the oil/oils you use depends on your skin type. Those with SD should tread lightly with this method, as some oils can exacerbate the issue.

  
- **Exfoliation**

  Chemical exfoliation is the preferred method on /r/skincareaddiction, it tends to be more gentle than physical exfoliation *and* you can do it daily. You can learn more about the different types of chemical exfoliators in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1hj8yo/whats_the_difference_ahas_vs_bhas/) sidebar post.  

  Lactic acid is the most gentle, so if you suffer with eczema/rosacea prone sensitive skin, start with lactic.  If you're acne prone/have lots of clogs, start with a BHA (salicylic acid). If you are combo, and want the humectant benefits of an AHA, try Mandelic---partly oil soluble AHA. 

  Physical exfoliation (yes this includes a washcloth and the Clarisonic!) should not be used more than 1-2x a week, and not if you have active acne, sensitive, flaking, or irritated skin.

  Exfoliation will be beneficial if you have any of the following concerns (not comprehensive): zits, uneven texture, congestion, blackheads, whiteheads, dull skin, dry skin, [sebaceous filaments (SFs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1fmg0t/some_more_information_about_sebaceous_filaments/), etc.

  Since AHAs/BHAs work at a lower pH to exfoliate, it's helpful to wait around 10-15 minutes before applying your next product (ie-moisturizer). If you don't have time to wait that length of time, at least wait until the AHA/BHA is dry.

  *BHA exfoliator recs (alcohol free)*

  ~ Stridex Maximum Strength Pads aka Stridex in the red box (US/available on iherb or Vitacost): If known serious sensitivity to light fragrance/menthol proceed with caution. These tend to work fine for the majority of people

  ~ Paula's Choice BHAs (Worldwide): Fragrance-free options, but pricier than stridex

  ~ BravuraLondon (UK): Various BHA products

  *AHA exfoliator recs*

  ~ St Ives Scrub Free Exfoliating Pads (US): 4-5% lactic acid. If very sensitive to fragrance or known fruit allergies, proceed with caution.

  ~ Silk Naturals AHA Toner (US based but will ship to some international locations): 8% Lactic acid. Contains aloe. Fragrance-free.

  ~ Paula's Choice AHAs (Worldwide): Varying concentrations of glycolic acid, fragrance-free

  ~ Olay Regenerist Night Resurfacing Elixir (Worldwide): 8-10% glycolic acid, fragrance-free

  ~ BravuraLondon (UK): Varying Glycolic/lactic/ AHA+BHA combos

  ~ Alpha Hydrox Oil Free Gel (US/ Parent company may ship international to some locations): 10% glycolic acid, fragrance free

  ~ Alpha Hydrox Swipes or Intensive Serum ( US/ Parent company may ship international to some locations): 14% glycolic acid, fragrance free

  ~ MUAC Mandelic Serum (US/ ships internationally): 10% mandelic acid, fragrance-free

  ~ Avene Cleanance K (US/Canada/Europe/Aussie/possibly other locations): AHA/BHA product.  2% Lactic, 6% Glycolic, and 1% Salicylic. Slightly more expensive than the other recommendations. Fragrance-free.

- **Moisturize**

  Everyone needs a moisturizer, even those with oily skin!  A lot of the time at least part of the oil production is commonly due to dehydration (aka lack of moisture). 

  *Moisturizer Recs*

  ~ Cerave Cream aka Cerave in the tub (US/Canada): Suitable for any skin type. Also works for the body. Fast absorbing, lots of humectants/ceramides. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1k3k7p/attention_all_cerave_in_the_tub_users_ive_found/) thread has info on getting a pump lid for the jar.
  
  ~ Oilatum Natural Repair (UK): Suitable for any skin type. Similar to Cerave in the tub, though a tad more greasy. 

  ~ Cetaphil Lotion/Cream (Many locations worldwide): Suitable for any skin type. Slightly greasier formula to Cerave in the tub. 

  ~ Vaseline  (Worldwide): Suitable for any skin type. Good to add on top of moisturizer, or use alone to prevent water loss.

  ~ EltaMD Intense Moisturizer (US): Vaseline alternative, non-sticky/day friendly option.


- **Sunscreen**

  This is your choice, just be sure to wear it everyday and it's at least SPF30 with high UVA protection. It's even more crucial  if you're using AHAs, retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, or you're on particular oral medications.

  Proper amount for application is 2mg/cm^2. This is about 1/4 teaspoon (~1.2 mL) for the face alone. Reapplication should be every 1.5-2 hours (maybe even more depending on how nasty the UV index will be that day), and after every time you take a dunk in water. 

  Recommendations highly vary depending on location and type of finish you prefer. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/15tuqd/for_those_interested_in_trying_out_new_susncreens/) sidebar link on sunscreens gives you all you need to know.  Also, try a board search and look on the first few pages of the sub.

  Generally, if you are very sensitive or acne prone, you'll want to look for an all physical sunscreen or at least a physical/chemical combo.  All chemical sunscreens tend to cause stinging/breakouts/irritation for many people.

- **Spot Treatments/Masks**

  This will vary based on your skin type, personal preference as well. An effective spot treatment generally has antimicrobial/anti inflammatory properties. 

  *Spot Treatments to Consider*

  ~ Benzoyl Peroxide cream/wash:  If in a wash, leave on skin for a few minutes before cleansing off to allow the BP to take effect. Side effects can be dryness/redness sensitivity. [2.5%](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1j4l9o/just_want_to_share_what_my_doctor_told_me_today/cbb2fen) is also A-OK to use, and can be just as effective as the higher concentrations with just less irritation.

  ~ Sulfur ointment/cream: Tends to be less irritating than BP

  ~ Tea Tree Oil: Should be diluted with a carrier oil to avoid a chemical burn. Avoid if prone to allergic contact dermatitis. Potent fragrance.

  ~ Neem Oil: Very potent fragrance 

  ~ Clay masks: These will help clear pores and help bring some acne to a head.    Bentonite is the strongest, not great for dry/very sensitive skin, and should be mixed with Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV).   Kaolin/Rhassoul/French green are less drying and do not need to be mixed with ACV.

http://imgur.com/a/cyP1C

picture of my skin at its best:
http://imgur.com/wGmDKm9


warning: this might be long and/or confusing, I am very distraught right now and extremely frustrated.

my skin type: I am not sure what type of skin I have.  I know I have sensitive acne prone skin.  but it is often dry and flakey.  the only time I get oily is when I am wearing makeup, which I do very often. I think I might have hormonal acne, because I will break out with hard cystic acne a couple of weeks out of the month, then it will calm down after my monthly cycle ends.  

other problems: I get very bad cystic acne deep in my skin. I usually only get these on my chin or around my mouth, but I have recently gotten a couple of the left side of face on my upper cheeks.  I have large pores the are constantly clogged.  I have these weird small bumps that look like they are filled with gunk but are hard to pop.  i also have clogged pore looking things that i can squeeze and a never ending noodle of puss will come out (sorry to be so gross im just trying to explain what i deal with) not to mention little white heads here and there.  but most the the problems are around my mouth/lips and on the apples of my cheeks/around my nose area

what ive tried to do: first of all let me say i cant afford to go to a derm, but i am not opposed to seeing an esthetician if it is affordable.  i have been using aveeno clear complexion foaming face wash to wash my face, makeup removing cloths before i wash, then i use face moisturizer.  but i have just started using OCM with castor oil and avocado oil.  I have done A TON of research on this before i started so Im almost positive im doing it right BUT i got a HUGE HARD cyst on my chin the day after starting :(

other products i may use:
lush's celestial moisturizer,
LUSH enchanted eye cream,
olay day time moisturizer,
witch hazel (not often),
st ives exfoliating pads (2x a week),
i also don't use towels to dry my face i let it air dry and pat some of the water with my hands

i have also used a couple of other products that i actually really like, but im not sure if they are doing my face any good, or actually may be causing some of my problems. i will list the product, how i use it, and the ingredients because they are lesser known:

OSEA ADVANCED PROTECTION CREAM: I use this at night before bed after i wash my face, before i put moisturizer on...
its supposed to even hyper pigmentation, fine lines, and stimulate collagen production:
INGREDIENTS: aqua, algae extract*, dipalmitoyl, hydroxproline, coco caprylate/caprate, cetearyl glucoside, olive, glycerin*, aloe barbadensis leaf juice*, macadamia seed oil*, grape seed oil*, jojoba seed oil*, capryloyl glycin, vitamin E, avacodo oil*, chondrus crispus*, undecylenoyl glycin, glycine, calendula officinalis flower extract, anthemis nobilis flower extract*, potassium ascorbyl tocopheryl phosphate (natural vitamin C), citrus medicalimonum peel oil*, xanthan gum, sodium benzodate, potassium sorbate (*certified organic) ( 100% natural derived ingredients) 

OSEAS red algae mask: HG mask for me at the moment. when i have a cystic acne break out it soothes my face and helps ease the pain and i always feel like my acne is less inflamed and my skin has a slight glow after using this. i use this 1x a week but not every week...
INGREDIENTS:  red algae gel extract, glycerin, corrective oil complex, cocoglucoside and coconut alcohol, sodium lauroyl oat amino acid, French red clay, frech pink clay, magnesium aluminum, silicate, cahadian willowbark extract, multifruit extract, sesame oil. jojoba oil, sodium magnesium aspartate, water lily extract, chamomile extract, red wine extract, lactic acid, vitamin e, calendula extract, greentea extract, grapefruit seed extract, xanthan gum, phenoxyetanol

i also have a face lotion that i use on my infant son, and i was wondering if i could use it as a gentle face lotion:
natures baby face and body lotion:
ingredients:
organic aloe barbadenis leaf juice, safflower seed oil, ethylhexyl palminate (from coconut), glycerl stearate, sorbitan olivate, shea butter, macadamia ternifolia seed oil, olive fruit oil, jojoba seed oil, glycerin, rosa centifolia flower water, natural vitamin E, cellulose gum, xanthan gum, organic comfrey extract, organic chamomilla matricaria flower extract, organic calendula flower extract, amino acid, amino acids, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, glycine, citric acid

This **is asking for medical advice**, whether intentionally or not. 

For example 1:  We don't know the severity of your itchy dry spot, or if it's something to be concerned about. We don't know if you have an underlying skin condition that needs to be addressed. There's just no way to tell, and nobody should be attempt to play doctor. 

For example 2 (and others similar), a general rule of thumb is if it is inflamed, oozing, looks infected, spreading, itching, blistering, etc--Please contact a medical professional before posting this over the internet. 

Keep in mind that *nobody* can  provide a differential diagnosis to you over the internet. Just because something may *appear* to be similar to someone else, this does not mean that it IS what that other person has.  

 If you have a question like these examples, the **best place** to get a good answer is a **medical professional**--whether it be your derm, NP, primary care, PA, or free clinic.

These sorts of questions promote a *healthy* discussion between people, without asking for any diagnoses. These sorts of questions aren't outright requiring medical attention, but medical attention could be recommended or sought out if needed.



If you have a new rash, spot, weird looking blemish,  your skin is turning orange with blue spots-- PLEASE call your doctor's office or locate the nearest clinic. 


It's unsafe to be asking people to look at pics/answer questions of undiagnosed potential medical problems, we cannot provide a differential diagnosis for you. 

All of the mods discuss posts before removal.   The aim of this is to minimize the amount of potentially negative advice that could exacerbate a ""misdiagnosed"" condition.


As far as comments go,  please *refrain* from suggesting DIY at home medical procedures. We don't want anyone to accidentally harm themselves.

Thanks!!!



**Additional Information: When should I suspect something is infected**

*Symptoms of infection may include:*

1. Increased pain, swelling, redness, or warmth around the affected area.

2. Red streaks extending from the affected area.

3. Drainage of pus from the area.

4. Fever.

*Elaboration*

- **Warmth**: An infection may feel hot to the touch. This happens as the body sends infection fighting blood cells to the site of infection. 

- **Swelling/Hardening of the Area**: An infection may begin to harden as the tissue underneath are inflamed. 

- **Redness**: An area that gets red, or has red streaks radiating from it to the surrounding skin may be infected. 

- **Drainage From the Incision/Wound**: Foul-smelling drainage or pus may begin to appear on an infection. It can range in color from blood-tinged to green, white or yellow. The drainage from an infected wound may also be thick, and in rare cases, chunky.

- **Pain**: Your pain should slowly and steadily diminish as you heal. If your pain level increases for no apparent reason, you may be developing an infection.

Edit:  I went into the lush store today and even though the manager was not in the 3 girls there were super nice and had me fill out a product complaint form and they will send off the info along with the glass to head office tomorrow.  The girls were wonderful, I was immediately offered a full refund and a few gifts for bringing to their attention, They said I could also have store credit (instead of the refund- they allowed me to choose) which I used to buy a different gift set, They also gave me 2 additional small gift sets with different bath bombs and a vanishing cream.  They were unable to get onto head office on the phone but they said they would have them email me as soon as possible.  Honestly they made it a really positive experience and they were quite sympathetic about the situation.  So I could not have been happier with how they reacted - in the sense that they tried to get their head office on the phone right away and advised the would report this first thing on noonday.  So I will still email their head office about it to insure that they take as much action on this as possible.

Apologies for the intermediate pic, I couldn't find any sans tinted moisturizer!


I started using the MUAC peels at the lowest concentration, and gradually working up to double layers.  


I started with the 40% lactic and after a few months of double layering, I went up to the 55%, then after a couple months, I stopped at the 65%.  I wouldn't do the peels during the summertime because I baked in the sun. 


I started with the 12.5% TCA all over the face, but it just made me really dry.  I upped to the 15% after a couple uses, but just spot treated.  I now use the 18% on the annoying hairline area only.  




The TCA is totally unnecessary in my opinion, I just kept hoping I'd get crazy results like I've seen on blogs, but I just don't think it's for me.  I really just don't want to waste my bottle.  I  find lactic works great with zero dryness/downtime.  


I can't do glycolic in peel concentrations because I get itchy bumps on my forehead for a few days when I use it.


I started .05% tretinoin a month and a half ago, so I haven't been using my peels. I think I'll hold off until the fall, just in case I end up in the sun.  



Hope this is helpful for those looking to fade sun damage/hyperpigmentation/refining fine lines.   


Patience is KEY and so is sunscreen.   : )

First of all, coconut oil is composed mostly of saturated hydrocarbons, specifically [triglycerides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglycerides).  It's about [92% saturated fats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_oil#Composition_and_comparison).  Olive oil is mostly unsaturated (only about [14% saturated fats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_oil#Composition_and_comparison)).  Mineral oil is also fully saturated ([mostly alkanes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_oil)), as is petrolatum (Vaseline) - petrolatum is just made up of larger alkanes, so it becomes a solid instead of a liquid.


Several double-blind studies have been performed to compare the performance of coconut oil to other oils.  In one study, the trans-epidermal water loss, skin hydration, skin lipid levels and skin pH were compared between coconut oil and mineral oil [1].  It was found  ththat coconut oil and mineral oil performed similarly to each other, due to their similar saturated hydrocarbon nature (the saturated hydrocarbons are hydrophobic, and this gives them their occlusive properties).  In another study, the antibacterial action of coconut oil vs. olive oil on *Staphylococcus aureus* was examined [2].  It was found that coconut oil had a greater antibacterial action than olive oil.  It's thought that the saturated triglycerides in coconut oil are broken down on the skin by bacterial action into monoglycerides, particularly the compound monolaurin.  Monolaurin has been clinically shown to be bactericidal [refs in 2].  As olive oil doesn't have as much saturated fat as coconut oil, it's thought that this is why it does not have as much antibacterial action.  In addition, it's been shown that bacteria do not develop a resistance to monolaurin as they do to traditional antibiotics [refs in 2].


Finally, several studies have examined the penetration of mineral oil, petrolatum, and several vegetable oils into the skin and their effect on the skin [3, 4].  It was found that the oils and petrolatum only penetrate the top layer of the skin, and the oils all caused modest swelling (10-20%) of the stratum corneum (a measure of their occlusive properties/hydration), while petrolatum caused moderate swelling (60%).  In addition, transepidermal water loss was similar for all the oils (moderate) while petrolatum had minimum transepidermal water loss.  While coconut oil was not tested (jojoba, sweet almond oil, soybean, and avocado were), I would feel safe to guess that coconut oil would perform similarly in these measures as the other oils.


In summary, coconut oil has been shown to have occlusive properties similar to mineral oil, with the benefit of antibacterial action.

The other day I was at someone else's house, sleeping. He has a mirror by his bed for some reason. When I woke up I saw how I sleep... on my left side. I got a wrinkle from gravity; when I sleep, gravity pulls my (fairly large) lips down and folds the skin in the wrinkle area. I was like ""oh"".
Now I try to sleep on my back, or my right side to even things out.

TL;DR: I'm so fucking lazy that I gave myself a wrinkle from sleeping too much.

1362106631.0,89,self.SkincareAddiction,19ftrr,Teach it Tuesday (Thursday):  Dark Circles &amp; Under Eye Wrinkles,yvva,97,8,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/19ftrr/teach_it_tuesday_thursday_dark_circles_under_eye/,"*I'm still gathering info to make a more comprehensive Derms versus Estheticians schooling/training, but until then I thought this would be a good topic to cover*


Dark circles/wrinkles under the eye are very common issues that get brought up. I thought in the interim it would be helpful to chat about some common causes and ways to treat these. 


** Products**

I mention Vitamin C serums and Retinoids quite a bit in this post.    OTC retinoids I trust are by the brand Avene--available in many parts of Europe and the US.  Avene's eye gels/creams are the only true eye cream I will endorse on here until another cost efficient, eye specific ( meaning lower concentration of retinoid), well formulated retinoid product pops up into existence---If you guys know of one, please post.  Vitamin C serums that are good include those by: Nufountain, Silk Naturals, &amp;  MUAC Pretty much if you can find one with a good pH and well packaged, it would do the trick.


**Under Eye Wrinkles**     


 More likely than not, that creasing under your eye has probably been there since you were a child. I'll throw my eyes up [here](http://i.imgur.com/v2KynGl.jpg) to use as an example. You can see the left side (easily seen because there was some concealer migration) that there are visible wrinkles.  These aren't damage or abnormal, but rather the natural contour of my eye. If I track back to childhood photos, they've always been there.    


Now what will help actual wrinkles? Suncreen to prevent further damage, a retinoid to increase collagen production/cell turnover, and maybe a well formulated vitamin  serum with L-Ascorbic acid.


**Dark Circles**

There are 3 main causes of dark circles, which can either be the sole cause or a mix of them.

**1. Hyperpigmentation**

This is darkening of the skin under your eye. If this is the cause, something topically applied to lighten the skin is you best bet. Kojic berry acid is potentially helpful, though not enough research is out there to determine in what concentration it's effective or even if it really IS effective. 


Things that definitely are known to reduce hyperpigmentation are AHAs --be very careful with this, vitamin C, retinoids, and even another RX topical that I'm not mentioning due to to the harshness/side effects/ link to cancer. The latter can be discussed with a physician if ever other treatment under the sun failed and you're truly miserable, I'm not even sure it's safe for use around the eye.



**2. Visible capillaries due to very thin skin:**


The skin under the eye is thin and delicate. Due to this, people can sometimes get visible capillaries/little blood vesels, which from a decent distance look like circles.

 You can either go to your derm or local med spa and get these zapped with a laser or, you can try to thicken the skin in the area to help make the caps less visible. 

Retinoids/(possibly)Vitamin C  can also help to thicken the skin over time as well. 



**3. Tear Trough/Suborbital Volume Deficiency**


This is literally due to the structure below your eye.   Nothing topically applied will cure this, though with proper placement of a brightening concealer, the appearance could be reduced.  The *only* thing that does ""fix"" this are fillers---either by your derm/NP/PA. 


For the tear trough, the area around your nose and orbital bone is hollowed, therefore casting a shadow, which gives the look of dark circles or contributes to your circles.  [Example](http://i.imgur.com/BGbsKve.jpg)


For suborbital volume deficiency, there is a larger area under the eye which lacks volume. You can probably see this from the closeup of my eyes above or check out another example [here](http://i.imgur.com/77MMsKq.jpg)




**Vitamin K cream disclaimer**


Some people claim that eye creams with vitamin K work ( with spider veins/ visible caps) by penetrating skin and clotting the vessels/capillaries, which in turn essentially kills them.


Consistent evidence is lacking on the efficacy of this, though I have read a couple studies that it may be helpful in post surgical bruising. Again, more evidence is needed.


Though, say it was effective...There's nothing to stop it from penetrating healthy capillaries/vessels and knocking those off too. It's not selectively choosing what to ""kill"".  *Personal Opinion Warning*: I wouldn't want to tamper with it to find out.    YMMV though.


If you guys have anything to add please do!  Hope you enjoyed it!



**EDIT** fixed links!   Also, there are various environmental factors than can contribute to dark circles/puffiness such as dehydration ( so stay properly hydrated, a good indication is if your urine is clear), lack of sleep ( so make sure you're getting enough sleep, however many hours is good for *you*, no one size fits all for sleep), stress/emotional problems, and allergies.     



**EDIT 2**  There are other retinoid products on the market, skinacea.com lists some of them.  They differ in concentration and the retinoid derivative.  Avene uses the most potent OTC form, which is why I mentioned this versus the others. You'd likely see results in a more timely fashion.



**EDIT 3** As one of the lovelies on here pointed out, it should be indicated that not every retinoid product is listed on Skinacea--it's an easy to read site with concentrations of the retinoid in the product and an easy to understand description of the strengths.

Around the time /u/ieatbugs asked me to be a mod this past November, I had a punch excision of a mole. The results came back with atypical cells--which was very scary since melanoma runs in my family. 

Even with this scare I don't think that I would have been able to fully kick my no-sunscreen/tanning if it wasn't for this subreddit.


Quite frankly, I just didn't feel comfortable/honest telling other people they need to wear sunscreen especially if I was planning on going to bake in a tanning bed or go bake outside in the sun. In addition, I started to see the large number of people from all around the world who DO protect their skin on a daily basis and are careful about UV rays. 

It's been so helpful to have such a large group of people push me and others into seeing the light about the importance of daily sunscreen, and learning about sun protection in general.  For example, before I started coming to this sub, I had NO idea that sunscreen needed to be applied in a certain amount. I just assumed some sunscreens were bad because I applied them once and burned through!


I REALLY thank you guys for aiding in being an unintentional support group of my bad habits. And I thank you for pushing me to push others to be more smart about their skin.

1368233728.0,87,self.SkincareAddiction,1e3r4b,My 5 month progress pics starting halfway trough treatment. Month 2-now! + how I did it. Beware of long ass story inside!,aquaticbub,107,20,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1e3r4b/my_5_month_progress_pics_starting_halfway_trough/,"About 5 months ago, in late December, I woke up and realized holy shit, I have terrible acne. I had never thought of it before, but it just hit me. My face was absolute shit. Boom, from that day on I was depressed every morning. But Im not here to get pity or to tell you how shitty it was - I'm here to inspire those who think they have no hope! I started by going to the derm. Got doxycycline (antibiotic) and epiduo. Told to try it for a month and come back. You see, I had never done research on acne. Didnt know how to pop it (or that you shouldn't!!!), didnt know about scarring, about moisturizing, about benzoyl peroxide, hell I barely knew about washing my face! But I started to fight it. Hard. I tried to scrub it off every night in the shower, washed my face 3-4 times a day thinking it would help. Little did I know I was making it worse. I would go home after rowing practice and just not say a word to my family. I alienated my friends. I would wanna cry but I just couldn't. The depression hit hard and only made it worse. But that was the turning point. I realized I had the most invaluable tool in the world: the Internet. So I came here. And here I thrived. I learned of things I never would've learned myself because no one bothered to teach me: my dad had to work and thought I was being too sensitive about my acne, and I didn't see my mom much. After about 2 weeks of doxycycline, I quit it, being frustrated that I didn't see results. I started on minocycline, hoping for faster, visible results. Little did I know it could take a few months. So boom, month 1 down. Less pimples, still lots of cysts and scars. I hadn't stopped picking (horrible habit!) and hardly watched my diet or what touched my face. And that's when I made a connection. I realized I need to fight this and fight it hard. So I used my biology skills (favorite subject) and looked up how acne was caused, what it was, what scarring/hyper pigmentation was, how to regulate oil, etc. I bought some multivitamins and zinc to combat deficiencies and help skin immunity/healing. Turns out masturbating causes zinc deficiency and can even cause acne, so as hard as it was (no pun intended) quit that. Knocked out all sugar, dairy, and white bread. Never let anything I didn't know was clean touch my face. And that's when I started to see a difference. My skin was loving it. I got moisturizer to help combat the epiduos dryness, and sunscreen to help reduce scarring. After about a month, I took my first progress pic. As you can probably tell I was afraid of cameras. Well that day I felt so good about the progress that I had to take a picture. Now when you see that picture you'll think ""That's progress?!"" But yea. It was. A lot. So, I sputtered along, still depressed, but gaining confidence every day (helps healing too!) and I did some research on why I wasn't 100% clear yet. Fiddled around with some things, and came to a website that claimed something called 'Apple Cider Vinegar' could heal scars and kill acne. Why the hell not. Picked up a bottle and fell IN LOVE. Now some people hate the smell. But you know what it reminds me of now? Salad and kicking acne's ass. My favorite smell. And it's all been downhill from that moment. It started to clear, my scars began to fade, and I felt amazing. Now I had some rough patches when I'd break out from eating dairy, or sugar, or masturbating (probably the most common), but I began to outgrow it. And about 1 week ago, I had the first day in 5 months where I didn't think about how my face looked. To anyone. I didn't care, because it looked fucking awesome. That's when I decided to take another picture. You see, acne beats you physically AND mentally. Makes you feel like shit on the inside too. But you can beat this. After countless people telling me to 'just wash my face' or to 'just eat better', I was done. This is for you out there that feel like giving up. I beg of you to not give in. Don't let acne win. We CAN beat this. We're all here for you. If you need help, never even hesitate to PM me. Ill help however I can with knowledge I wish I had known 6 months ago. And looking back on it, 6 months ain't SHIT. You got this, stud/studette. Have hope.

Hey everyone!  I've been meaning to post these photos for a while.  I went my entire life with clear skin, minus one or two pimples a month around the time of my period. Then, I moved from Florida, US to Melbourne, Australia and my skin went insane! I wasn't sure if it was the change in climate or some crazy hormones that just happened to go haywire at the same time as my move (and i'm still not sure!).  

Anyway, after irritating the hell out of it, trying every 'natural' cure under the sun, my doctor prescribed me epiduo and my skin HATED it.  It got so brutal and my breakouts went from 6 spots on a cheek to 20-30 per cheek.  After doing some reading on the clinical trials of epiduo, I was not at all pleased with the results and didn't want to waste my time for what may have been something around a 30% success rate.  

So after hearing a lot of people rave about acne.org, I spent a week reading every forum and guideline.  I started a strict regimen of gentle cleansing, benzoyl peroxide, and a moisturizer and doing this twice a day.  It took four months but now my skin is almost entirely clear.  I still have post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, but I'm not so upset about it anymore

My regimen now (as acne.org shipping to australia is so ridiculous) is-

AM and PM

-oil-cleanse with grapeseed oil

-tone with alcohol-free witch hazel

-apply one finger length of 2.5% benzoyl peroxide (i'm looking to stop using the BP after my current tube runs out)

-apply a mixture of water, vegetable glycerin, and jojoba oil as a moisturizer.

Session #1 Follow-Up + Pictures.,spunky-omelette,97,11,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1dd15z/update_laser_hair_removal_adventures_i_did_it/,"Last time, on Laser Hair Removal Adventures (haha): 

I [posted about a scheduled consultation(s)](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ch673/i_just_scheduled_a_consultation_for_laser_hair/), then included a [follow-up after the consultations](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1cndus/update_i_had_my_laser_hair_removal_consultations/).  Someone asked if I could keep you guys posted, so I hope this is okay!

So to recap, I have PCOS, but it's pretty much under control and treated (no out-of-the-ordinary-and-outrageous hirsutism-fueled hair growth, weight is perfect, acne is decent, etc etc).  However, I've always been very fluffy, especially my arms.  Having dark hair + pale skin is apparently the best type to be if you are looking for laser hair removal, which is why I have been considering this. 

Laser hair removal is really more of a *reduction*--you go for several sessions to get as much hair as possible (because all your hairs are at different stages in their growth cycle).  If you are a good profile and the laser is a good match, usually you really won't have a lot left and just need some touchups once in a while.  I don't expect to be some hairless mythical creature, so this is a good fit for me.

I ended up selecting the second clinic I went to for a consultation.  I was pleased with how thorough they were in answering my questions, the quality of their lasers, the credentials of their staff, and their long-standing reputation.  They were very ""no-nonsense"" and did not try to push my anything.  Even though I asked a zillion questions (""IS AN AHA ON MY ARMS OKAY!?"")  they were awesome.  I chose to pay upfront for all sessions (pay for five, get the sixth free), since I figured given my hairiness it'd save money in the long run.  It wound up being cheaper than the other place I checked out as well.

**Pre-laser Prep**

This was really freaky stuff.  Before laser hair removal, you have to shave the area that's being treated.  I've never shaved, waxed, plucked or really removed any of my arm hair before.  It was SUPER freaky--I felt extremely sensitive and.... tacky (not poorly-dressed tacky, but in a super-sensitive-tactile-way).  Even my sleeves made me feel kind of sick.  I used a very gentle sugar scrub to exfoliate first, since I didn't want to try anything with chemicals on an area I've never really done much with before.

**The Laser**

THE LASER HURTS, JUST TO GET THAT OUT OF THE WAY.  :(  I'm a big mush when it comes to pain tolerance, so to *me* it hurt.  It wasn't excruciating, but lots of wincing, grimacing pains.  The clinic used a CynoSure laser, but first they applied the same kind of gel that is used for ultrasounds. The only purpose in this was to reduce discomfort. This particular laser machine blows very cold air on the area, and they maneuver a little gun inch by inch, delivering a beeping laser zap to each spot.  The squishy areas of my arms hurt most.  

The entire procedure, both arms start to finish was about 15-20 minutes tops.  To be honest, I was so wrapped up in marveling over the nakedness of my arms combined with the squirmy rubber-band-snapping discomfort that my judgment of passing time is probably off.

**Immediately After**

There was definitely redness and swelling.  Some descriptions online I read sounded like sunburn, but for me it felt like razor burn.  It was kind of a prickly irritation.  They helped clean me off, then I bundled up and went home.  The biggest rules were to avoid sun exposure (and use a beefy physical blocker sunscreen), and to stay away from any sort of sweat-inducing exercise + hot water.

This was awesome because I got out of dishes for a while... but anyways, the sensitivity wore off after about four days.  However, it's still really important to keep using sunscreen!  (I was using [BurnOut's](http://www.burnoutsun.com/index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=2) sunscreen, and while it definitely isn't cosmetically elegant, I really would rather just be sure it gets the job done).

**One Week Later**

Still wearing sunscreen and now introducing exfoliation into my routine again.  I guess the hairs that are under the surface and have died are called ""pepper spots""--they're supposed to push out to the surface and look like they're growing, but really they're shedding and will fall out.  I tried an AHA the other night, and it stung!  I'm not sure if that's a good sign or not, but I haven't used it since.

I really never paid a lot of attention to the *skin* on my arms... I've always been so preoccupied with hating the hair.  I feel like now is the time where a lovely relationship founded upon exfoliation, sunscreen, and respect will blossom!

**TL;DR - Had my first laser hair removal session.  I have newfound respect for the skin on my arms and definitely want to pamper it!**

(Pic courtesy of Wiki) 

The epidermis is the top layer of skin, and it  is avascular (has no blood supply). 


On the face, the entire epidermis is only 150 microns (or .15mm or a sheet of paper) thick. 

The major cell of the epidermis (which accounts for almost 95%) is the *keratinocyte*. Other cells include, melanocytes, Langerhans’ cells, and Merkel cells.
 

The facial epidermis is comprised of several layers ( we generally refer to #4 on ScA when we talk about exfoliation, I'm not getting into the extra layer that's on hands/feet): 

1. *Stratum Basale (stratum germinativum)*: This is the base layer of the epidermis, where keratinocytes are formed from columnar, undifferentiated cells (I think these cells can also be referred to as the ""basal keratinocytes"").  Half of this cell layer will differentiate and become keratinocytes but the other half will just continue to proliferate to replenish the layer.  Frequently it's described as being one cell layer thick, but it can be even 2 or 3 layers thick depending on the type of skin (like glaborous) or for those with a hyperproliferative epidermis. As  keratinocytes are formed, they  get pushed up and at each new layer, gain more keratin. This layer is also where we have melanocytes (pigmentation), langerhans (immune), and merkel (for touch) cells. 
2. *Stratum Spinosum*: This is the prickly layer of the epidermis, where  and also contains Langerhands cells. Keratin starts being synthesized in the keratinocytes in this layer. Keratinocytes still have their nucleus here. 
3. *Stratum Granulosum*: This is where the keratinocytes lose their nucleus and can be considered granular cells (different sources are saying different things on what to call the cells, just know their nucleus is no longer). These cells contain keratohyalin--protein structures that form dense cytoplasmic granules which aid in the granular appearance, hence the name ""granulosum"". The *lipid barrier* is formed here when lamellar bodies discharge their lipid contents. This lipid layer is also important for intercellular cohesion in the stratum corneum and partly responsible for barrier function.
4. *Stratum corneum (SC)*: This is the topmost layer of the epidermis ( about 10-40 microns thick) This layer is comprised of *corneocytes* or the most matured keratinocytes--the cells are flattened out, lipid-depleted , fully keratinized, and have now lost their cytoplasmic organelles. They are suspended in the lipid matrix that was released by lamellar bodies of the stratum granulosum. The corneocytes are attached together by *corneodesmosomes*. The corneocytes in the SC layers are not all in the same differentiated state.   *Desquamation* happens here,  when the body sloughs off the top layers of the SC, via releasing desquammatory enzymes to break the corneodesmosome bonds. The Natural Moisturizing Factor (NMF) is found in this layer and contributes to hydration. This layer is also what people commonly refer to as the ""dead layer"". This is also the layer we generally address when we talk about exfoliation, acid mantle, and barrier function. The combination of this layer plus the lipid layer is how we preserve said barrier function/acid mantle--this is a physical + chemical barrier.   This layer needs to be properly hydrated in order to keep skin nice and smooth.   




The entire process from formation of basal keratinocytes from the epidermal stem cells, to desquamation, happens every 40-56 days and the turnover time in the SC of facial skin alone is around 1 week.


**Extra Tidbits**

- Normal facial skin is around a pH of 4.5 - 5.5--This helps to ward off bacteria such as P. Acnes (responsible for acne). Those with impaired barrier function disorders such as eczema, psoriasis , ichthyosis tend to have a higher pH. Those who are acne prone also tend to have a higher pH 6+, which creates an ideal breeding ground for bacteria. This could in part be due to hyperkeratinization and lack of proper desquamation which leads to impaired barrier function (Source 4 has great acne videos/explanations)

- The desquamation/differentiation process can be shortened if the body is introduced to inflammation (either internally or externally). This is commonly seen on inflammatory skin lesions with dry/crusty scales. This scaling is actually incompletely differentiated corneocytes. Dandruff and psoriasis are examples of this. In the case of psoriasis, the SC turnover time is actually a few days!  This is the reason why heavily moisturizing, anti-inflammatories (for psoriasis/eczema), and exfoliators are commonly advised to help prevent this crusting.

- Trans Epidermal Water Loss (TEWL) is how barrier function is measured, and the face has a higher TEWL compared with other areas of the body.

- If you impair barrier function, the TEWL will return to normal within 3 days, however the SC will still remain dehydrated, and will take 10 days to repair. The lipid content remains normal, yet the amino acid content (like the NMF, responsible in hydration) remains low. Skin recovery is also impaired at a neutral or higher pH.   This is why when doing deeper chemical peels, physically exfoliating, etc you must focus on keeping skin hydrated as much as possible, it is also why using stripping cleansers is such a bad idea--as you are messing up your barrier function on a daily basis.

- Natural Moisturizing Factor (NMF) is comprised of amino acids or derivatives like pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (PCA) and urocanic acid, together with lactic acid, urea, citrate, and sugars. The NMF is essentially a natural humectant.

- Scars less than one year old have increased TEWL and also could lack lipids.

- Intercellular lipids include: one of each type of ceramide, cholesterol, and fatty acids

- Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) are thought to increase epidermal thickness via increasing hydration (possibly by the NMF) over time. While the full mechanism isn't understood, they act to prevent corneocytes from bonding together, act as keratolytics, decrease corneocyte clumping, and promote individual corneocyte desquamation. Beta hydroxy acids (salicylic acid) break corneodesmosome bonds (why is why you can get dryness/peeling as a side effect), but don't lead to an increase in NMF and they are not keratolytics. They all work best under a pH of 4, with BHAs working optimally around a 3.

Add your own and I can edit them in as we go. 

* **Stop inspecting your skin at pore-level.** Put the magnifying mirror down and walk away. If someone is viewing your face at pore level, they're either a doctor or someone you're kissing. If the former: they're doing their job. The latter: they don't care. 

* **Stop touching your face.** If you must touch your face, use clean hands

* **Stop picking at your skin.**

* If you wear makeup, **clean your makeup brushes.** /r/MakeupAddiction is a great resource for information on how to best do it.

* **Stop using scalding hot water on your body via washing or compresses.** Skin doesn't like being burned and it can make sensitive skin even worse. Warm water at most, lukewarm better. 

* Before throwing money at new skin care products, **try changing your detergent to a gentle one,** one of the ones suggested for babies. Also consider ditching the dryer sheets.

* **Change your sheets regularly.** *I didn't add this as a magic acne fix, it's a good idea for hygiene and I personally feel I sleep better in clean sheets.*

* If you check your weather online, **check the hourly forecast to see what the UV Index is.** When the UV Index is higher, you'll need to be diligent about reapplying suncreen more often than the recommended two hours. 

* **Exercise!** but don't linger in your sweaty clothes. Change and rinse off as soon as you can.

* If you have bangs or long hair, **pull your hair up/back and off your neck/forehead/face** if you're going to be sweaty and **go easy on the silicone based products.**

* As always, **stay hydrated.**

* **Avoid excessive drinking.** 

* **Don't smoke.**

Finding this sub has really helped me start to get those things under control, so I thought I'd share what's been working for me. As always, this is just my experience, not medical advice, and ymmv.

So first, my skin type - combo/oily, easily dehydrated with acne that seems to be primarily hormonal.

The biggest change that I made that helped get rid of my acne was discontinuing hormonal birth control. Dual-hormone methods give me migraines, and single hormone (Mirena IUD) made my skin go bonkers. I would have had it removed sooner if I'd known that was the problem. My breakouts calmed down a lot about 2-3 months after I had it removed.

Without further ado, [progress pics](http://imgur.com/a/T4vJy)

There's a sort of timeline in the picture descriptions if you click on the link (I don't think RES shows descriptions), but here's a quickie breakdown-

Past 2 years or so - tried various forms of topical antibiotics, lower-strength retinoids and medicated face washes, all with pretty much no success. I had pretty much constant discomfort (and frequently outright pain) from cystic breakouts.

October - started using Retin-A, clindamycin phosphate lotion and oral antibiotics. Also had Mirena removed.

November-ish - found this sub. Started getting dehydration under control by building up retinoid use gradually, eliminating sulfates, moisturizing twice daily and putting Aquaphor over my moisturizer at night.

December-Jan - gradual decrease in the frequency &amp; severity of breakouts.

Feb - had my first cortisone injection for a monster cyst (which fortunately seemed to be pretty isolated). Very pleased with the results, though I did experience a depression at the injection site. Also started using St. Ives Exfoliating Pads daily and switched from Retin-A to Tazorac .05%

Mid-March - breakouts are small and infrequent, so I decided it's time to work on hyperpigmentation issues. Began doing weekly 40% lactic acid peels (from MUAC).

Now - So after all this, I haven't had any new breakouts in over a month. My worst hyperpigmented spots - mainly on my cheeks - have faded from angry-looking purple to just red :-) Unfortunately the severe breakouts I had back in Sept-Nov have left some atrophic scarring, which sucks. Once I finish up my sample of the 40% lactic peel, I'm going to start using the MUAC 40% glycolic peel, since glycolic is a bit stronger and I came across several mentions of it in medical studies on treatment of atrophic scarring. I'm also really interested in trying the dermaroller, but I'm not sure if combining that with retinoid use is a good idea :-) Luckily my skin isn't overly sensitive and I have a fairly high pain tolerance. I'd definitely be interested in hearing any experiences or advice.

My routine as of right now is:

**Morning:**

* Water rinse

* St Ives Exfoliating Pad, then wait to dry

* Clindamycin lotion

* A small amount of First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream

* Elta MD UV Clear SPF 46

* Makeup

**Night:**

* Remove makeup with Yes To Cucumbers wipes, and olive oil for eye makeup

* Massage mineral oil in to dislodge any clogged pores and make sure makeup is all washed off

* Wash with CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser (possibly an unnecessary step), wait to dry

* Tazorac, wait at least 30 minutes

* Generous amount of FAB Ultra Repair Cream

* Thin layer of Aquaphor

**Weekly:**

* MUAC 40% lactic peel for seven minutes, usually on Friday or Saturday. I also skip the Tazorac the day of and day after the peel; I know more time off is usually recommended, but I haven't noticed any increased irritation or flaking. 

Anyway, I thought some of this might possibly be helpful to others, and I'm also hoping that it will encourage other folks that it *is* possible to get skin problems under control. I know it's super easy to get frustrated and feel like things aren't going fast enough, but of course these things take time.

1370291579.0,80,self.SkincareAddiction,1flrii,"On striae disternsae, aka stretch marks.",Khokhmah,92,12,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1flrii/on_striae_disternsae_aka_stretch_marks/,"Due to the popularity of the recent stretch mark thread I decided to do a little digging in PubMed. Here is what I found:

1. Lasers are your best option for reducing stretch marks. [590nm intense pulsed light show highly statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001) reductions in the length, width and color of stretch marks. Patient satisfaction was also higher with the 590nm wavelength light than with 650nm wavelength.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23383747)

2. Silicone shows promise as a scar therapy and a stretch mark therapy. I read several controlled trials regarding the efficaciousness of silicone gels and sheets vs. placebo, compression dressings and cocoa butter. [In one study, collagen levels were higher, stretch marks were flatter and melanin levels were lower in the silicone group's stretch marks than the control group while vascularity was decreased in the placebo group.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23579949)

3. Vitamin E oil is actually contraindicated. There is no evidence to support this and in fact it can increase skin damage. Sorry I misplaced my sources for this one, looking for them now. 

4. Cocoa butter, olive oil, almond oil....no positive results indicating that they are at all effective for stretch mark therapy. But see point 6. 

5. Needle therapy shows promising results. [43% of participants in a small 2012 study] saw marked improvement in their stretch marks. However this study population was very small, 16, and the results are less than stellar. I'd wait for more data to come out before I started needling myself. 

6. Several studies [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22863639) [2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22594386) [3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22994859) did indicate that it is important to keep the skin well hydrated during scar and stretch mark healing. This can help lessen the appearance and severity of your stretch marks, but it won't fully remove them. Whether you choose cocoa butter, olive oil, bio oil, whatever your moisturizer of choice is, doesn't really matter.

7. Retin-A. I found [one study that says that Retin-A is very effective against stretch marks](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2312898) and [one study that says that Retin-A does not reduce the apperance of stretch marks](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7956336) However the second study has a sample size of 90 while the first study had a sample size of 20, so I'm inclined to trust the negative results study more. YMMV on this one. HOWEVER Retin-A [IS effective for scar treatment](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22086527) based on that alone I would suspect that it would have some effect against stretch marks. Also because it has a similar exfoliating effect as glycolic acid which has been shown to be effective, also leads me to suspect that Retin-A would be beneficial. 

8. [Daily application of a 20% Glycolic acid solution is also pretty effective](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9723049) Glycolic acid has the benefit of being cheap, safe, well studied and well tolerated by darker skin types who can't use laser treatments. And in this study increases epidermal thickness and elastin content of the skin. 

9. I could not find anything about Bio Oil specifically but I would probably lump it in with point 6. Use it to keep your skin well hydrated if you like it.

I decided to look up bentonite clay and discovered that its pH is between 8 - 9.7 (depends on brands: [Living Clay](http://www.livingclayco.com/livingclay1.html)'s bentonite clay is 9.7 and [Garden of Wisdom](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/4032831/4581040.htm) is between 8.3 to 9.1 - I am not able to find pH info on Aztec Secret) which it is slightly alkaline than [baking soda (pH 9)](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/195lue/psa_please_do_not_use_baking_soda_on_your_skin_it/). Our skin is between 4.5 to 5.5.

Undiluted apple cider vinegar's pH is between 4.25 to 5 and when it is mixed with bentonite clay, the pH will be neutralized.

Distilled/pure water's pH is 7 (neutral) but the problem is that we all normally use tap water. It might range from 6 to 8 - it depends on county and city. Distilled water or tap water with bentonite clay, it still leans to alkaline.

It is super important to mix bentonite clay with raw ACV to balance out the pH.

Interesting information on pH scale: [pH 10 is 10 times more alkaline than pH 9 and 100 times (10 times 10) more alkaline than pH 8.](http://www.elmhurst.edu/~chm/vchembook/184ph.html) Can you imagine from pH 5 to 9? That's around 400 times or... 100,000 times? Meh, my math might be off. Hope someone here can chime on the difference between pH 5 and 9. (*Answer: 10,000 times*)

(With photos!),Flintydeer,88,13,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1egolo/my_successful_battle_with_mildmoderate_acne_and/,"[My Experience summed up in a Photo album](http://imgur.com/a/eFg4m)  
    I have never had severe acne, but my skin has never been that great either. After finally getting off of Proactiv, I began to experiment with different moisturizers and cleansers, but nothing really helped my skin. After about a year of experimenting I came to the conclusion that it would just have to be something I would deal with forever. I would cover up with makeup, but still cringe at the state of my face in the mornings and after taking my makeup off.    
    Recently I subscribed to both r/Makeupaddiction and r/Skincareaddiction and began to learn more about proper skin care. I also found acne.org and learned a lot about skin care from there as well. 

**My regimen now consists of:  
* Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser  
* 1 Pump of Acne.org 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide on my problem areas(Let that oxygenate for about 10 minutes)  
* Dermalogica skin smoothing cream mixed with 3-6 drops of jojoba oil.** 

 It's taken approximately 3 weeks, but I have seen some major changes in my skin! My problem area is now clear, and my husband even remarked on how soft my skin is!   
    I am on the look out for a good SPF to add to my regimen since I don't use foundation anymore, which was my main source of SPF. I'd be open to suggestions :) 

Thank you so much r/skincareaddiction!

*Taking Zinc and Vitamin D 
*Drinking Green Tea
*Stopped using harsh spot treatments
*Using apple cider vinegar and honey
*Used the new Garnier Dark Spot Corrector Moisturiser
*I also got the contraceptive implant and I think maybe this balanced my erratic hormones. 

I still have uneven skin, and acne scarring, but I felt so confident today with my skin being better than it has in years I went for it and wore no foundation to work. This was incredible for me, I would never usually leave the house without it.

I'd been washing my face with baking soda for ~6 months after finally ditching ProActiv (which gave me horrible cystic acne). I was horrified to learn that baking soda is possibly one of the *worst* things you can put on your face. My skin was so dry, and the breakouts were still a problem. 

I poured through as many posts here as I could! Two weeks later, I don't have *one* pimple on my face! Not a single one! My face is hydrated, moisturized, clean and so happy. The large pores on my face -I thought these were genetic and I was just simply doomed to watch silently as they got worse and worse - are so much less noticeable now.  Here's my routine: 

AM: 

* Wash with CeraVe foaming in the shower.

* Spot treat pimple with tea tree oil; spot treat old pimples (now red spots) and excessive dry spots with aloe vera oil; light tea tree oil over my forehead to reduce bumps

* Moisturize with CeraVe in the tub

* CeraVe face lotion SPF sunscreen - it takes a minute or two to soak in, but no white mask and very minimal sunscreen smell! Awesome. 

PM:

* Wash with about a quater-sized dollop of my oil mix (1/2c sunflower oil, 1/2c olive oil, 1/16c castor oil); rinse and wipe most of the oil off with washcloth

* massage face with baby/mineral oil; rinse

* wash with CeraVe foaming

* Exfoliate with St. Ives pads/Stridex red box (alternate days)

* Spot treat pimple with tea tree oil; spot treat old pimples (now red spots) and excessive dry spots with aloe vera oil; light tea tree oil over my forehead to reduce bumps

* Moisturize with CeraVe in the tub

Today I used the Stridex AM after using St. Ive's PM - my face was pretty dry after, so I'm going back to only exfoliating at night - a routine that worked beautifully. 

So far, I don't have *any* complaints about these products. I use a mattifying powder (Invisible 10 from Neutrogena) when going to work, but I've completely stopped using my liquid foundation and blush (except for business meetings). My face is getting so clear, with so little blotchiness or spots, that I found that I *love* going mostly makeup-free. :) And I was a gal who wouldn't set *foot* outside without a totally done-up face! :D

1368350568.0,70,self.SkincareAddiction,1e6d3p,[REMINDER] Please be careful when using retinoids and AHAs or BHAs (such as St Ives pads and Stridex in the box),JoanOfSarcasm,83,13,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1e6d3p/reminder_please_be_careful_when_using_retinoids/,"Hey guys!

I've noticed this popping up lately and I just wanted to clarify for you all. Please, *please* be careful when using exfoliators (such as AHA and BHA) in conjunction with retinoids, such as Ziana, Retin-A Micro, Retin-A, and Renova (to name a few). 

I'm not going to go too much into detail because it's 4AM and I *really* need sleep, but in short, retinoids increase your cell turn over and they communicate with the cells to ""teach"" them to create more ""normal"" shaped skin cells. To put this into perspective, the average time of skin cell turnover in an adult is 28 days. In children it's closer to 14. Retinoids speed that back up. So you shed skin quicker (hence the snake-skin peeling), your skin burns, and is very irritable. It also thins out the ""dead skin"" cell portion of the epidermis over time and plumps the dermis, which is what makes it so great for combating wrinkles but so brutal if you don't wear adequate sunscreen.

So what does this have to do with exfoliators like AHA and BHA, you ask. Well, for many, retinoid-treated skin is *extremely delicate* skin. This means that it's more prone to broken capillaries or irritation. Now think of an AHA as a distant cousin of retinoids -- they also thin out the very top layer of skin. Using them both at the same time is generally bad news. Many people may experience irritation, redness, burning, dullness, and/or sensitivity. For others, they may experience an elevated number of break-outs (break-outs can be attributed to irritation -- too much rubbing, scrubbing, and chemical exfoliating can all cause this). 

BHA is similar, but it can be drying *and* irritating -- two things that retinoid-treated skin usually already is! 

If you want to use AHAs with your retinoids, please wait at least 1-2 months to allow your skin to adjust to the retinoid usage, and then *gradually* add them into your routine. Your skin shouldn't need too much excessive exfoliation with retinoids.

Also, you may experience flaking during the first few weeks on the retinoid (or months, depending on how sensitive your skin is) and may be tempted to reach for the AHA. Don't! Instead, I highly recommend oil cleansing/massages. This will allow you to moisturize your skin and *gently* remove the clumps of dead skin that you wake up with. **Stay away from harsh physical exfoliators, like the Clarisonic, during this breaking in period and never use them if your skin is at all prone to broken capillaries!** 

Keep in mind that everyone's skin is different, so you may tolerate AHA and BHAs used in conjunction with retinoids, while someone else may not. However, I urge you to err on the side of caution and love, as skin is so delicate while using retinoids. 


(*A side note about BHA and AHA used together, since I've seen that question as well* --- pH is also a big factor when it comes to exfoliants, as many of you know, and we generally recommend against combining BHA and AHA *at the same time*. It's perfectly okay to use AHA in the evenings and BHA during the mornings **as long as you use sunscreen**.)

I break out on my cheeks and chin mostly (though it used to be my forehead.. it seems to be migrating down my face). I get the occasional normal blackhead, and often get these absolutely insane, deep blackheads that take months to come out (I've tried extractors, masks, everything.. patience is all that works sadly). 

I have always been incredibly lazy about my pre-bed ritual. I almost never removed my makeup - I tried to rationalize that I was using mineral makeup so how bad could it be to leave it on my skin?

Well - I've been washing my face every night before bed for the past 2 weeks and then using a cotton ball with vitamin E oil on my face to remove the last traces of makeup afterwards.

It's like a miracle has happened.  I haven't had a new blemish in over a week. My scars and hyperpigmentation are starting to fade. My complexion is SO much smoother. I'm using less and less concealer as the days go by because there is less and less to conceal.

I CAN'T BELIEVE IT WAS THIS SIMPLE ALL ALONG. I am *SO* mad at myself for wasting so many years being a dirty lazy bum!

***[Dermatologists stress any dietary changes need to be combined with proven medical treatments to fight acne.](http://www.aad.org/stories-and-news/news-releases/growing-evidence-suggests-possible-link-between-diet-and-acne)***

Although early studies dating as far back as 1949 have raised the possibility that an association between dairy consumption and acne may exist, the evidence supporting this theory has been weak. However, studies conducted in recent years have continued to examine the influence of dairy products — particularly milk — on acne severity.

* In 2005, a retrospective study was conducted in which 47,355 adult women were asked to recall their high school diet and if they ever had “physician-diagnosed severe acne.” The study found that acne was positively associated with the reported quantity of milk ingested — particularly skim milk.
* In 2006, a study examined the self-reported food consumption as well as the frequency and amount of pimples experienced by 6,094 girls aged 9 to 15 over three years. The study found positive associations between the prevalence of acne and the intake of total milk, whole milk, low-fat milk, and skim milk.
* A similarly designed follow-up study conducted in 2008 demonstrated similar results among a group of 4,237 boys who were asked questions about their food intake and severity of acne. In this study, acne was associated with consumption of skim milk, but not total milk consumption (which included whole milk or low-fat milk).

Dr. Bowe noted that there were several flaws in each of these studies, but dairy does appear to be weakly associated with acne, with the strongest association being skim milk. The exact mechanism behind this association is unclear, but Dr. Bowe suspects that hormones and growth factors in milk might play a role.



**AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY EXPERT ADVICE:** 

“While more clinical research is needed to determine dairy’s impact on acne severity, I advise patients to talk with their dermatologist if they believe certain dairy products aggravate their acne,” said Dr. Bowe. “Given the benefits of calcium and vitamin D — especially in a growing adolescent population — patients who choose to limit or avoid dairy products should supplement their diet with appropriate levels of calcium and vitamin D.”

This is how I cleared my closed comedones thanks to you guys!,absitinvidia,78,12,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ca5ok/utterly_grateful_to_this_subreddit_this_is_how_i/,"I'd like to start off by saying that I have been lurking here for a few months, reading posts and then doing extra research if needed although most of the times the community here does an excellent job of explaining things. 

Before coming on here I was constantly plagued with closed comedones, especially on my forehead. It made me feel so uncomfortable when I talked to people especially in certain kinds of lighting that made them so obvious. Like millions of little bumps that plagued me for the past while. So on here I learnt a lot of things especially about AHA's and BHA's. I have combination skin, with really dry mouth and cheek area and an extremely oily tzone. So here is how I improved my complexion and enjoy nice skin. I don't attribute my skin clearing to any one factor, but a combination of factors that I learnt off here. Before this subreddit, I was completely oblivious as to what to really do.

1. Really cut down on milk and cheese. I mean there are times where I'll have it like in an iced cappuccino like once a week but it's not an everyday thing anymore
2. Cut out breads. No more bagels!
3. I eat a better diet. A lot of fruits veggies, meats, quinoa. I also eat a few vitamins every other day as I'm a bit paranoid about overloading. I eat vitamins e, A, C, B complex and B6. Then I have a zinc tablet, fish oil capsule. 
4. I've started to exercise a little because I heard it increases circulation to the face and head and I really want to have better skin and maintain nice hair. 

Ok so here is my skincare routine. 
 In the morning
-I use my clarisonic plus with this neem facewash my mom got me when she went to India. She had gone in December and just brought it back for me because Neem in India is considered pretty holy grail. I had read a few things about it on here and decided to use it. It's a Neem and turmeric gel face wash. 
- I moisturize with either my tinted Nars moisturizer or the Cerave depending on whether I'll be staying in or going out. I had the lotion until today. I bought the tub today. Yay!
-Then I put on Sunscreen. At the moment I use Aveeno 30 SPF, I'm waiting for it to finish so I could maybe look into another one. I don't mind it, but I would like to experiment with Sunscreens as this is actually my first time using sunscreens and maybe something will be better than Aveeno for me. 
- Then any make up such as blush and eyeliner

At night time
- I use the oil cleansing method with jojoba oil (THANK YOU GUYS). I've really liked the oil cleansing method. I haven't tried any other oils other than jojoba. But I'm really liking it so far. 
- I use my BHA by Paula's choice
- I then moisturize with Cerave lotion and sometimes I use Aloe Vera. Just depends on my mood. I like the nice cold, soothing feeling of the Aloe
-  I've also started to put on jojoba oil on top after to seal in the moisturizer. Recently I've been using vaseline too sometimes.

Weekly Specials
- Aztec Healing Clay - LOVE THIS! 
- A Turmeric mask which I make at home and store in the fridge. I also love this, leaves a yellow cast but I love how my skin looks and feels after. Also, for those of you who want to get rid of the yellow cast, try yoghurt immediately after, it helps for me. I also put yoghurt into the mask as well.
- Paula's Choice Resurfacing 10% AHA (Love this too)
- I also randomly put on Manuka Honey and Tea Tree Oil if I ever get a spot on my face. I'm not sure if it helps, but I always feel like my spot has instantly been shrunken. Although I don't really get actual acne spots. Just the occasional flaming of my closed comedones if I don't take care of them. 
- I also use a brown sugar and honey scrub if my face feels too flakey especially after the AHA. I'm not sure if I should be exfoliating that flakey skin off but it hasn't done any damage so I guess it's okay
- Oh and I also have the Ocean Salt scrub from Lush which I do use occasionally especially if I have a party to go to. I'm not sure why, I just feel like it gets rid of the flakey skin and creates a clean base to put make up onto. 

I'm also waiting on GoW's Glycolic Acid 10% pads. As well as African Black soap. I probably don't need these products, but I'm one of those optimistic buyers. I do like to try other products and see how they work with my skin. I learn about my skin that way. Although I know I shouldn't be experimenting that much. 

I do apologize for this post being long, I seem all over the place with my products. I guess sometimes I have moods for different products. But I am just so excited and wanted to let you all know how much you have changed my life and decreased my frustrations immensely. I'm not cursing my skin all the time. So I cannot express how grateful I am for your wealth of knowledge and genuine desire to help others!

I thought that most people had the same issue until I found this sub.

So I did what everyone who browses this sub does - I bought the holy grail products. Cerave face wash, Cerave in a tub, Aztec healing clay, sunscreen, and witch hazel. I got so excited that I threw out my old products (Basis face wash, Desert Essences face wash, neutrogena creams, a couple moisturizers, and some more junk) to make room for my new and improved routine.

BAD IDEA. This new routine hated my skin more than any routine I've ever tried. I was so discouraged! My skin was breaking out bad, and I felt so frustrated.

After asking the community, I decided to set up an appointment with a dermatologist. I had never been before, as I had assumed dermatologists were for people with *real* problems. I didn't think my situation warranted professional help, but boy was I wrong. He prescribed me Finacea 15% and told me to wash my face with Panoxyl (I got the walgreens brand instead - same thing). The difference was HUGE!

[See for yourself the 1 month transformation!](http://imgur.com/a/mZVUU)

So here is my routine:

Morning:  
Wash with Panoxyl (10%) or just rinse with water, depending on my mood. Apply a little Finacea to problem areas. Follow with Clear Skin Neutrogena sunscreen and my makeup routine.

Evening:  
Wash with Panoxyl (10%) twice. Apply Finacea to problem areas (around nose and mouth).

I do not moisturize. Every moisturizer I've tried has broken me out so bad. My skin is not dry (not oily either). It doesn't itch or flake. So right now I'm not using any moisturizer and my skin is totally okay with that.

Skincareaddiction, your holy grail products may not have worked for me, but thank you for all of the knowledge I've gained from you guys and for encouraging me to see a dermatologist.

I had to be put on antibiotics both times, and it was not a fun experience. I asked my doctor why I was only now getting staph infections after picking for years, and she said I had hit the ""tipping point"". I should also note that when I was picking I was always sure to use an alcohol wipe first, then squeeze with clean hands, and I would always follow up with neosporin. It didn't matter, at least not for me. I have had 2 in the span of 4 months. Now I don't squeeze or pop, no matter how much I want to. The blackheads are the worst, I really want to go at them - but I have decided to try the OCM for those.

What is thought to be taking place when dry skin occurs is that the intracellular matrix (the substances between skin cells that keep them intact, smooth, and healthy) has become depleted or damaged, bringing about a rough, uneven, and flaky texture that allows water to be lost. But adding water won't keep that moisture in skin unless the outer barrier is maintained or repaired. To prevent dry skin, the primary goal is to avoid and reduce anything that damages the outer barrier, including sun damage, products that contain irritating ingredients, alcohol, drying cleansers, and smoking. All of the research about dry skin is related to the ingredients and treatments that reinforce the substances in skin that keep it functioning normally.

As for drinking lots of water each day, if all it took to get rid of dry skin was to drink more water, then no one would have dry skin and moisturizers would stop being sold. Keeping your liquid intake up is fine, but if you take in more water than your body needs, all you will be doing is running to the bathroom all day and night. The causes of and treatments for dry skin are far more complicated than water consumption.

Want to see a truly disgusting B&amp;A?",niccig,71,9,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/192koj/hey_everyone_i_got_my_first_cortisone_injection/,"I couldn't really find much about what to expect with cortisone shots, other than ""hurts, works fast"" so I thought a little B&amp;A and review might be helpful to someone else.

I have pretty crappy cystic acne and have been doing pretty well lately, right up until the last week or so, when I started breaking out again. A few days ago two really ugly spots popped up on my right cheek, in the same place they always do. For some reason the ones in that place are always really really painful and disgusting. They hurt even when I'm not touching them (I only touch to wash or put on makeup), and it hurts to move my face. They usually take around 3-4 weeks to stop hurting, and then another month or so to flatten down. I've had pigmentation there for years because it keeps flaring up.

This time I decided not to screw around, and I called up my dermatologist to see if she'd give me a cortisone injection. She fit me into her schedule, and I got it done around 8:30 on Thursday morning. The nurse called me in, reviewed my current prescriptions with me to make sure nothing had changed since last time I was there, and then the doc came in. She had me lay back on the table, cleaned the area with alcohol, and injected each of the two cysts. She cleaned it up a bit and had me hold some gauze on it for a minute or two while we talked - since I was there and clearly still having breakouts, she recommended switching from Retin-A to Tazorac cream. She was nice enough to grab me some samples so I can make sure my skin can handle it before I go pay for the prescription. 

The album is linked below, and fair warning, it's kinda gross (and potato-quality pictures). The first image is before I went, last was taken around midnight-ish tonight (Friday). There's some more info in the imgur descriptions.

[Album](http://imgur.com/a/VPnZg)

And omg guys, this was way more effective than I thought it would be. I had a similar breakout in the same spot back in November, and it literally had just flattened down a couple weeks ago. Same exact results in less than two days - definitely wish I'd tried this before.

It *should* go without saying, but I will anyway - **cortisone injections are a medical procedure that has risks**, so you shouldn't just go do it willy-nilly. The main risk is scarring, in the form of hypopigmentation, atrophy of the tissue around the injection site (pitting) or infection. So far no weird infections, but it's too soon to tell if I'll see any scarring. I also found it to be quite painful, which is unsurprising - those particular spots were already plenty painful, and then the doc jabbed a needle in a couple times (as gently as possible though). Both spots throbbed for a good 30 minutes or so afterward. Twas not pleasant. And I had to go to work afterward.

So overall, I'd say if you've got really painful cysts, or one that comes up that you need to get rid of quickly (for weddings, big work presentations, whatever) it's an option that's definitely worth exploring. Dermatologists always seem to be booked up, so be sure to ask in advance how to go about making the appointment/under what conditions they'll do it (apparently it works best if you do it in the first few days). And it looks worse before it looks better, so you might want to do it more toward the end of the day if that will matter to you :-)",,False,self,t5_2tbbg,False,,,True,t3_192koj,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/192koj/hey_everyone_i_got_my_first_cortisone_injection/,

Their scrubs are just as harmful as the vilified St Ives Apricrot scrubs. Irritating essential oils (lavender is a common one) and fragrant oils increase oil production and many of the products marketed towards acne prone skin contain them. They also like to add citrus fruit additives like grapefruit, lime, and lemon which are all harmful to the skin.

* 1.  Do you ever purchase more than 6 skincare products in one shopping tri**P**?
* 2.  Are you unable to remember all of the skincare products you've purchased?
* 3.  Do you experience headache, anxiety, insomnia, nausea, or other unpleasant symptoms when you stop using skincare?
* 4.  Have you t**R**ied but failed to cut down your skincare collection?
* 5.  Are you annoyed by criticism about your favorite products?
* 6.  Do you feel gu**I**lt about abandoning a product?
* 7.  Have you ever needed a face mask or exfoliant to steady your nerves?
* 8.  Do you hide your collection from fami**L**y and friends?

* 11.  Even though you know something breaks you out, do you feel the need to try it *one more time?*

Skincare Addiction, also known as product hoarding, is a type of impulse-control disorder.  Skincare Addicts can’t control the impulse to apply creams, buy new serums or constantly oil cleanse.  Skincare Addicts will hoard collections of oils, lotions and cleansers that take up their entire bathroom and begin spreading into the kitchen and bedroom.  Some addicts have products in every room.  

Baking Soda is an often reported “gateway drug” for a Skincare Addiction.

We are brainstorming ways to keep the front page full of quality material - informed and well-thought-out posts - which means that we would like to keep the new queue relatively free of repetitive questions.  The majority of questions can typically be answered by:

1. reading the sidebar,
2. doing a keyword search in the search bar (even if the search function generally sucks), and
3. spending time reading front page material for a few days/weeks.

To deal with this issue we are *proposing* a new submission rule that would require a reader to have 25 comment karma *within this sub* before submitting a post.  Our intention is to encourage new users to:

1. read the material we already have,
2. not post a question that has already been answered, and, 
3. most importantly, to contribute to the community.

For example, Friday's simple question post would be a good and easy way to obtain comment karma.  Additionally, we feel that 25 comment karma is a relatively low bar!  Our intention is *not* to discourage new users, but rather *encourage* you to be engaged with the community.

The sub is growing at a rapid pace, which we are very excited about!  This idea is only a proposal (it has not been implemented) and we would love to hear your feedback!

Hope you're all having a lovely weekend. It's been a while since we had this discussion, and as our subreddit has grown by literally thousands since the last time, we thought it was a good time to remind people once again: **Please take care of the advice you give out and read on this subreddit.**

All of it is not true, and all of it definitely does not work for everyone. Some people may recommend products with wild claims of ""It's the miracle cure! Rub it twice a day and all your problems will vanish. Plus, bonus, it's natural so it must be good!"" Please take care when reading things like this.

We mods do our very best to weed out comments that give these wild claims without providing proper evidence to back them up. Ultimately, there are hundreds of comments and threads made every day so we can't keep up. We need you to help us out, and remember to question what you read, especially if it sounds *too good to be true* and relies on logic such as ""If it's natural, it must be good!"" / ""If it's got chemicals in it, it will slowly kill your skin!"" Both of these can be true for specific instances, but are definitely not right every single time.

We are a **science-based subreddit**, and take this very seriously. Spreading false claims doesn't help anyone, it just sends more money to the corporations and may even worsen our conditions. If you see a claim being made that you think doesn't sound right, please comment on it asking for a source or evidence.

That's all I'd like to say for now, thank you all for being a wonderful sub!

[Here's a link to the discussion we had about this last time](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/12j2jh/the_golden_rule_for_rskincareaddiction/) which discusses more reasons why it's dangerous to spread advice that is not properly backed up.

Final note: Blog posts are not evidence. If someone links you to a blog which ""proves"" that chemical X or oil X is good for curing a symptom, please do not trust it. An example of a source that does count is a peer-reviewed journal. You can find them using [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) or [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.co.uk/).

Benefits of coconut oil, hair, skin, food, blah blah, but I was too skeptical to try it out. I finally caved in, after I noticed how much in beauty products I have accumulated in order to keep up my appearance. 

So, I purchased an experimental 16oz jar 2 weeks ago and substituted coconut oil for every lotion, oil, creme, moisturizer, conditioner I had. I set away all my products and used coconut oil daily.

 The results are amazing. I have never felt so... fluffy, for the lack of a better word, in my life. My skin is very smooth, my hair is shiny, my hands soft, my face blemish-free. I use it as:

* body lotion
* face moisturizer
* hair conditioner
* hand cream
* cooking oil


[These are all the products](http://i.imgur.com/7BR0MzN.jpg) that I put away for 2 weeks and I haven't gone back to using any of them since. And I used them all before, with OK results. Coconut oil doesn't compare. 

* The Body Shop: satsuma body butter - $19.00
* Organix: nourishing coconut milk oil - $7.99
* Vaseline Intensive Care: Cocoa Butter oil - $7.49
* Extra Virgin Olive Oil - $16.99
* Macademia: Leave-in cream: $21.99
* The Body Shop: satsuma body lotion - $12.00
* Sally Hansen: nails &amp; cuticles hand creme - $7.99
* Clearasil: rapid action treatment cream: $9.99
* Garnier: Moisture Rescue Gel - $7.00
* Alterna: Bamboo Shine Luminous Shine Mist - $22.00

**total cost: $132.44**

That is about 4-6 months of product here, so in a year, I will spend $270.00 on maintaining my hair/skin. In comparison, I use about 0.3oz of coconut oil daily (I got a sample packet of 0.5oz and it last 2 days). So that makes 110oz a year. [That is 2 jars of 48oz plus 1 16oz jar](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003B3OOPA/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01). Total cost of that one? $120.00 a year. 

The stuff is not chemically treated, it's healthy and has no artificial crap and it saves me $150.00 a year. 

If you haven't tried it yet, please give it a shot, I promise you, you will not be disappointed.

I knew I wanted a BHA type of exfoliator because of my skin type. For reference, I have combination/dehydrated skin. I have visibly large pores in the areas around my nose (I think everyday glasses wearing has somewhat contributed to this). I have occasional minor breakouts and uneven skin all around (yay clogged pores and KP, anyone?). I have always been self-conscious about MY NOSE, the worst offender. I have had sebaceous filaments for the past 10 or 11 years. I never knew what to do about them, so they stayed on my nose, as nothing (steaming, salicylic acid face wash, etc. from my pre-reddit days) worked. They were terrible, large, and dark!! Anyway, here is my small victory story:

Upon stumbling on this subreddit, I bought the Stridex red box pads. I used them every other day after cleansing at night. I would wait about 15 minutes after using the pad before moisturizing (remember my dehydrated skin?). I did this for five weeks or more (I know it was at least five weeks though). I used them at night because I didn't have time during the morning, as a full-time student. Also didn't want to dry out my skin too much when I first started using the pads. Other than my face feeling softer and a bit smoother, I did not see other visible differences, and continued agonizing about the sebaceous filaments on my nose. Applying sunscreen everyday was the worst step because the sunscreen would stick? clump? to the SFs on my nose. So instead of black dots on my nose, now I had white dots sticking up on my nose. Great. Regardless, I continued on with this routine because I had to finish up my sunscreen (Neutrogena Pure &amp;amp; Free Liquid). I could feel the bumps from the SFs on my nose everyday, before and after sunscreen application.

Yet, on one glorious day, I carried on with my morning routine as usual, and applied sunscreen. I did a double take as I noticed the absence of the white bumps on my nose. My nose looked... and felt... smooth!! The sunscreen didn't get caught on my SFs. At night, after cleansing and such, I examined my nose and found that my SFs were slightly lighter in color and smaller! I am now so glad I stuck with chemical exfoliation. :) 

Unfortunately, I do not have before/after pictures to show. :( I truly wish I did! My face is now smoother with reduced breakouts.

Thank you, /r/skincareaddiction for all your help! I must remember to be patient with skincare. :) I love this sub!

 I give her product recs, make little samples for her, tell her explicitly what to do---basically ""moisturize with this twice a day"".   She never ends up using anything I give her (even after it's been confirmed she is not allergic).  

Then when I go over to visit her house, I see new random expensive products that are not only geared towards more oily skin types, but they have ridiculous claims that will never hold up against any science and also, cheaper dupes are available!!!

The most recent product I found was some PTR firming eye cream.  All it feels like is a silicone primer, for the record.


""Whyyyy"", I ask her, when I see this money wasted. 


 ""Oh, the nice sales girl in Ulta said this is scientifically proven to be firming"", she responds.


This is just so frustrating, because not only does she complain to me on a weekly basis and ask for advice, but she'll take recommendation from people who make a profit of her buying their products!!!!

1362946368.0,59,self.SkincareAddiction,1a1f1c,Keratosis Pilaris (KP) -- Managing the Condition at Home,JoanOfSarcasm,67,8,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1a1f1c/keratosis_pilaris_kp_managing_the_condition_at/,"Keratosis pilaris (also known as KP) is a common, harmless skin condition where a protein in the skin known as ""keratin"" forms hard plugs within the hair follicle. It is usually referred to as ""goose bumps"" and appears as hard bumps. It is most commonly found on the backs of the arms and thighs, but can appear anywhere on the body, including the face (where it is commonly mistaken for acne).

The bumps will be very rough, sometimes appearing [completely skin colored](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-geh0uxMLnX4/TqYUVqUIqEI/AAAAAAAAAI8/fGQJQo5xpmw/s1600/keratosis-pilaris+arms.jpg) and other times appearing a [bit red or pink in appearance](http://www.skincare4uonline.com/keratosis_pilaris_up_close.jpg).

This is best diagnosed by your skin care professional -- the Internet is no substitute for your doctor's medical advice.

However, if you have been diagnosed with keratosis pilaris and have struggled to manage it, here are some of the best, at-home ways I've learned how to cope with the condition.


**CLEANSE**

This is actually surprisingly important with KP. On a whim one night, I decided to do some research about SLS-free products, being as SLS toothpaste can irritate the mouth and cause canker sores in some individuals. Since SLS is in near everything we use, I figured, ""Why not KP?""

SLS, also known as Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, or SLES, also known as Sodium Laureth Sulfate, are common sulfates that add the 'suds' to some of your favourite household products -- from common toothpastes, body washes, and shampoo to dish soap, Prell shampoo, and laundry detergent. While there are health concerns over the effects of SLS, this post isn't to discuss that. However, it should be noted that some people are more sensitive to the potentially drying effects of SLS and SLES than others, and experience things such as dry skin and dry mouth (which leads to canker sores). 

While this evidence is anecdotal, I have noticed a tremendous difference in my skin by switching to SLS-free body washes. My KP has all but disappeared and there is nothing but extremely soft, supple skin where the chicken skin bumps used to reside. Your mileage may vary, but I highly recommend trying it for a couple weeks. 

You may find SLS-free body washes at a health food store like Whole Foods or Trader Joe's. I have not found one yet at the common grocery store.


**MOISTURIZE**

When shopping for a moisturizer for KP, look for ingredients such as urea, lactic acid, glycolic acid, or salicylic acid. Your experience with each may vary -- while I do well with glycolic acid and urea, other KP sufferers do not notice any difference when using these ingredients. Some favourite products with these ingredients (US bias):

* [Eucerin Intensive Repair](http://www.eucerinus.com/products/repair/eucerin-intensive-repair-very-dry-skin-lotion.html). This lotion is very thick. Some have described it's consistency to that of elmer's glue. It is very thick, goopy even, and can be difficult to spread. To use, apply a generous amount and work it into the skin, utilizing your body's own warmth to make it a more maneagable consistency. Recommended you apply it before bed.

* [CeraVe SA Renewing Skin Lotion](http://www.amazon.com/Cerave-Renewing-Skin-Lotion-Ounce/dp/B0071XPQQ2). Contains vitamin D and SA, which may be helpful for some KP sufferers. 


* Coconut Oil. Some KP sufferers have found relief in coconut oil. Note that coconut oil should not be used if you have a coconut allergy and should never be used on the face without first spot testing, as it can be very comedogenic. Please be aware that there is only refined coconut oil and VIRGIN coconut oil. There is no such thing as extra virgin coconut oil. 

* [Amlactin](http://amlactin.com/) products. Smell a bit ""odd,"" but contain lactic acid. Smooth consistency. Don't recommend applying it to freshly shaved bits, since the lower pH can be irritating. 


**SOAKING**

When I began running, I began soaking regularly in epsom salt baths. A surprising, unexpected bonus was that my KP began to disappear. I'm not sure why this is -- some KP sufferers think it is due to the moisture-rich environment epsom salts promote in the bath tub -- but it definitely diminished significantly. Of course, YMMV, but I felt it was worth noting.

I also recommend against taking scalding hot showers, which can dry out the skin and aggravate any skin condition.

This gives a snapshot of the classes of various common ingredients and their indications during pregnancy.  I believe even some oils should be avoided as well, but am unsure which ones, so talk with your healthcare provider.

As far as what is safe while trying to conceive or lactating, please talk to your healthcare provider. I believe there can be some overlap with the ingredients mentioned here.
______________________________________________________________________________________
- *Class D or X ingredients that should definitely be avoided* (these are the generic names, so be sure to check your ingredient lists): doxycycline, minocycline, spironolactone, tetracycline, 5-Fluorouracil, isotretinoin, tazoratone.


- *Oxybenzone* Active ingredient in sunscreen. Controversial, but some sources recommend avoiding deeply-penetrating chemical sunscreens. 

- *Zinc oxide and titanium dioxide* are physical sunscreens considered completely safe.

- *Salicylic acid* Class C.  A popular BHA chemical exfoliant (found in Stridex pads). High oral doses linked to pregnancy complications and birth defects. Occasional topic use is considered benign, but best option would be to temporarily switch to an AHA such as glycolic acid, which is completely safe.


- *Benzoyl peroxide* Class C. Because it is absorbed readily by skin, generally recommended to avoid during pregnancy.

- *Retinoids* Class C for topical applications and Class D for oral (such as Accutane). Type of vitamin A popular in anti-aging products. High oral doses shown to cause fetal complications; topical applications in moderation are considered safe. [Link to types of retinoids](http://www.skinacea.com/retinoids/types-of-retinoids.html#.Ud4RetLOtIk)


- *Amoxicillin* Class B.  Antibiotic.  Sometimes used to treat rosacea.  Considered safe past the third trimester.

- *Clindamycin or erythromycin* Class B. Antibiotic. Sometimes used to treat acne or rosacea. Considered safe past the third trimester.

- *Azelaic acid (brand name Finacea)* Class B. Used to treat acne. Considered safe past the third trimester.

**Summary of the safety classes for ingredients, products, or drugs in relation to pregnancy**

  **A**: *Controlled Studies Show No Risk*. Studies in pregnant women show the medication causes no increased risk to the fetus during pregnancy.


  **B**: *No Evidence of Risk In Humans*. Studies in pregnant women have not shown increased risk of fetal abnormalities despite adverse findings in animals or in the absence of adequate human studies, animal studies show no increased fetal risk.


  **C**: *Risk Cannot Be Ruled Out*. Studies are unavailable and animal studies have shown a risk to the fetus or are also lacking. There is a chance of fetal harm if taken during pregnancy but the potential benefits may outweigh the potential harm.


  **D**: *Positive Evidence Of Risk*. Studies in pregnant women have demonstrated a risk to the fetus. However, the benefits of therapy may outweigh the potential risk such as in life-threatening situations.


  **X**: *Contraindicated In Pregnancy*. Studies in animals or pregnant women have demonstrated positive evidence of fetal abnormalities. The use of the product is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant.

I am excited to say that I am one of the new mods in this sub (along with Khokhmah!). I have enjoyed the discussion and comments from users here and I'm looking forward to much more!

My Skin Background:

* Overall dry &amp; sensitive. I am acne-prone due to my dry skin, but a consistent routine with the right moisturizer has effectively erased my dry patches.

* Longtime user of tretinoin .01% gel - my HG product.

* After finding SCA I started the [beginner routine](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/19oiyy/the_starter_skincare_regimen_a_basic_routine_for/).  I previously used Cetaphil (cleanser &amp; moisturizer) along with various BP products.  After so many years of using BP and wanting to drop it from my routine, I came on over to SCA.  This is not to say that BP isn't good (it can be great!), but it just wasn't my cup of tea anymore.

* I'm also into OCM - if you've posted about OCM, I've probably replied :)

* Oh yeah, I also have mild eczema (woo sensitive skin!) which flares with changes in weather.  So outside of my face, keeping that in check is an additional hobby.

Interest in Skincare:

* I am a graduate student which means I have access to academic journals &amp; databases.  I can spend (read: waste) a whole day researching the newest reviews on acne treatments, AHAs/BHAs, best practices, etc.  This is almost always to the detriment of work I'm supposed to be doing. :)

* My skin has improved so much after following advice from this sub (and, of course, my derm!) that I wanted to be able to give back to the community.

That's when my acne started. I've always had oily/acne prone skin, but never anything like this. Full face and body cystic acne. My face was *always* in pain and I had to get particularly large/painful cysts drained by my doctor. I liked to say my face was perpetually a ""before"" shot in a Proactive commercial.

I got through the stress but my acne remained. I couldn't figure out why it wasn't getting better-I was using my CVS knock-off Neutrogena Wave to scrub with St Ives Apricot Scrub twice a day, then covering my whole face with a BP spot treatment (Target's PersaGel knock-off, and yes, I was applying it to my entire face), the spot treating with a SA and a sulfer gel. I started going to the tanning salon thinking it would help dry up my skin, thus eliminating the oil and solving my problems.

Needless to say I was probably singlehandedly causing my own problems. I was so self conscience though I would often cry and refuse to leave my bed if I didn't have to because I was in so much physical and emotional pain caused by my skin. 

Finding this sub has made all the difference in the world. I started with CeraVe foaming cleanser, Stridex pads, and Clinique DDM Gel (something I've been using for years-Even when I was brutally assaulting my face I always used moisturizer, as my mom drilled it into my head at an early ago how important it was). The CeraVe was irritating my skin so I switched to Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser and kept the other 2 products in my rotation, and I will be shopping for a good sunscreen next time I'm out. Going on about 8 weeks since I started following the routine, and my face doesn't hurt anymore. It doesn't hurt. It's clearing a lot, and the new breakouts are so much less severe than before. I have confidence I haven't had in years.

This sub is so amazing, because I'm sure everyday people like me, who think nothing will work for them because they've tried it all and have given up, will stumble upon SKA and realize they've been doing it wrong all along.

Both my parents when they were young took a lot of care of themselves with Indian products. My dad swore by neem. It's kind of sad that after they had children they absolutely stopped taking care of themselves and have kind of aged due to that. My mother still looks very young and as I started to have problems with my skin she started to tell me about her beauty routines as a young girl in India. My mother as a young woman had PERFECT skin. She was glowing. So lately we've been going to the Indian store together and rebuilding a little collection. I still want to try more of the remedies they used to use. I'm learning more but these are some of the products I currently have. I had a mini haul today for under 15 dollars. I think I will definitely be learning more from my mother and grandmother about the stuff they did there. Since my mom and my aunts seemed to have amazing skin, although I am sure there are other factors involved. I would honestly really suggest the neem to anyone with problem skin. For me it's a godsend. It is a bit drying, so you will definitely have to keep moisturized if you are using neem products but it definitely dries out impurities and keeps the skin looking amazing. 

I bought the almond oil, coconut oil, rose powder, neem soap bar, neem powder, neem oil, kalonji oil(black seed oil), and the castor oil. The old products are the amla oil, and the mustard oil. 
Also, the Indian store seems to have a lot of products that other stores sell for very expensive for very cheap prices. The quality in my experience has always been good. Also, my mother uses turmeric from India in cooking and now I use it on my face and it has been amazing. So if any of you have any Punjabi or any type of Indian stores close by, I would recommend checking them out. I'm Punjabi, so we go to a Punjabi store.

Edit -- I'll add mine. :)

* Cetaphil Lotion. The tldr is than retinoids made me break out. Badly. All over. For a long time. It took stopping them completely and a round of antibiotics to fix the breakouts, though nothing can fix the slight scarring I now have. Long story short, I avoided all coconut derivatives for a long time since coconut oil makes me explode in zits. Early this year, my skin was dehydrated as hell. I decided I'd try a standby to see if it helped. 

Oh it has. My skin is even and glowy again. Sure I still break out here and there, but I'm no longer patchy or dry. Love!

* GoW HA serums. I'm a skeptic. I generally avoid natural products since they contain at least 40 things that can make my face explode just by staring at the ingredients. However, I decided to give these a go on a whim. I. Love. Them. My skin stays plump and gorgeou beneath my Cetaphil lotion. Just wonderful. My favorite is the Blue Mallow. 

* Acne.org BP. I dislike most BPs. They're white, pasty, disgusting formulas that leave my face looking like a 'connect the dots' mask when I go to bed. This BP is fabulous - translucent, extremely effective, and there's so much for what you pay. Adore. 

* PC 2% BHA. I had never really used a BHA until two years ago. I bought 2 bottles during my search for the perfect skincare routine. I just finished them. I adore BHA. My face is very clog prone but thankfully handles BHA well. Keeps my pores clean and small. 

* Jason naturals body wash. Switched recently in an experimental effort to reduce my KP. I'd say it demolished about 80% of it alone, making it mild rather than moderate to severe. With the use of AHA body exfoliants, my skin is as smooth as butter.

Routines are different for everyone. Some, like myself, change them all the time just for fun. Others like a strict regimen. Some swear by toners, others just moisturize and use a cleanser. The only ""right"" routine is the one that works for you.



We are MORE than happy to help you out and critique, however, you need to provide us with a little more info and also know when you actually NEED a routine revamping.



1. WHY isn't your routine working for you? There needs to be something wrong with your happiness (personal and skin) in order for us to critique it!  



2.  What is your skin type, what are you trying to achieve, do you have any known allergies or sensitivities?




If you think you have pretty good skin, that isn't super dry or tight, or really oily, and barely any breakouts.... You DON'T need a whole new routine or a total revamping. You might just need one little tweak, like a non-drying cleanser or some vaseline on dry spots.




 Just make sure you're using a good sunscreen.

Vitamin C serum is one of the products mentioned that I use myself (Silk Naturals' Super Serum, thanks to recommendations from this forum!) and since I am in NYC I was worried about my serum holding up. The thread had some advice from a couple people to put Vitamin C serums in the fridge during heat waves.

Well, I emailed Silk Naturals explaining my storage situation (NYC heat wave and no AC during the work day), and asked if I should toss my serum. Their response:

&gt;Hi [MyName],
&gt;It's probably fine.  They're all slightly yellowish, and when they go bad they turn really brown and it happens rather quickly.  The form of Vitamin C that we use is very very stable, and it can be heated without being destroyed.  The real enemy of vitamin c is oxidation- and it happens no matter where you store it.  We don't actually recommend storing them in the fridge because condensation could build up, and that can play havoc with the preservative system.
&gt;Take care,
&gt;Karen

I thought I'd include the email since I know others on here use this brand as well.

Two particular things that haven't agreed with me are coconut oil and some sulfates. Today I discovered that some sulfates are derived from the lauric acid of coconuts, while others are petrochemical derived. This would explain why my reactions vary so strongly between sulfate-containing products: I have no trouble with petrochemicals while it takes weeks for me to recover from a coconut oil breakout. 

In addition to the coconut-derived sulfates, I learned that many fragrances contain coconut derivatives (such as Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride) and we all know that proprietary fragrance formulas don't list ingredients. Other common irritants such as Ceteareth-20, Cetyl Alcohol, and Cetearyl Alcohol are coconut derived. 

I used to believe that I was reacting to a variety of ingredients, but when I looked up the products that have caused me trouble in the past, they all had a high amount of coconut-derivative ingredients. Check out this ""non-comedogenic/hypo-allergenic"" [Neutrogena cleanser](http://www.neutrogena.com/product/liquid+neutrogena-.do?sortby=ourPicks&amp;refType=1) with about 1/3 coconut derived ingredients that made my skin freak out. I'm beginning to think my skin isn't as sensitive as I thought, rather, my trigger is hiding in more places than I realized. For the longest time I believed I was sensitive to BHA until I tried a product with a shorter ingredient list that has no coconut products. 

If coconut oil is comedogenic or irritating for you and you've had some bad reactions to SLS/sulfates in the past with seemingly unpredictable product reactions, this list of common coconut derivatives might be useful for you!

**Edit**: Please keep in mind that this list is just to help you start troubleshooting products and will only be useful if you have a coconut sensitivity (which is not very common). If pure coconut oil doesn't cause a reaction for you, then this list isn't likely to give you many answers. Also, manufacturing processes may sufficiently alter the oil to make it non-irritating for you, so take each item here with a grain of salt and approach your troubleshooting wisely.

You can't use Heinz or other cheap brands because it is filtered and pasteurized. It has no health benefits or values such as minerals and vitamins. It is more harsh than raw apple cider vinegar. Most cheap vinegars are synthetic.

Bragg's or Trader Joe's - they both are raw. The cloudy look is important - it is the mother: it contains vitamins and minerals. 
It is important to dilute with distilled water. Equal parts or 25% raw ACV and 75% distilled water. It depends on your skin's tolerance.  (/u/valentinedoux) 


While long used as a folk remedy, apple cider vinegar became well known in the U.S. in the late 1950s, when it was promoted in the best-selling book Folk Medicine: A Vermont Doctor's Guide to Good Health by D. C. Jarvis. During the alternative medicine boom of recent years, apple cider vinegar and apple cider vinegar pills have become a popular dietary supplement.

Most of these claims have no evidence backing them up. Some -- like vinegar's supposed ability to treat lice or warts -- have been studied, and researchers turned up nothing to support their use. Other claims have been backed up by studies, but with a catch: vinegar may work, but not as well as other treatments. For instance, while vinegar is a disinfectant, it doesn't kill as many germs as common cleaners. And while vinegar does seem to help with jelly fish stings -- an old folk remedy -- hot water works better.

Keep In Mind:

The main ingredient of apple cider vinegar is acetic acid. Apple cider vinegar should always be diluted with water or juice before swallowed. Pure apple cider vinegar could damage the tooth enamel and the tissues in your throat and mouth. One study found a woman who got an apple cider vinegar supplement stuck in her throat suffered lasting damage to her esophagus. In addition, vinegar has been known to cause contact burns to the skin.

A 2005 study looked at the ingredients of eight different brands of apple cider vinegar supplements. The researchers found that:

The ingredients listed on the box did not reflect the actual ingredients.
The ingredients varied a great deal between different brands.
The recommended dosages varied a great deal between brands.

Most disturbing, the chemical analysis of these samples led the researchers to doubt whether any of these brands actually contained any apple cider vinegar at all.",,False,self,t5_2tbbg,1364397595.0,,,True,t3_1b416l,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1b416l/the_science_and_history_of_apple_cider_vinegar/,moderator

I just wanted to spread the word about a new private beauty sub that's geared towards teaching and feedback on beauty basics. It's designed for both experts and beginners.

It is a *private* subreddit due to the fact there are some members who are not comfortable sharing their picture or other things in larger subreddits for a variety of reasons. We understand that for some people, this may not be exactly ideal, but we are not exclusive. There are only a few rules (which pretty much just boil down to not being an asshole or bigot).  Many of the current users appreciate having a ""safe space"" to ask questions and receive feedback in a smaller community.

We would love to have people of all skill types and we're hoping that maybe you'll be able to learn a thing or two and teach a thing or two at the same time!

If you're interested, please feel free to join /r/howdoibeauty by PMing the sub or you are welcome to PM /u/dutchesse, /u/niccig, and /u/McBitch.  Please feel free to ask any questions in the comments.

Early in the commercial, they show an image of blackheads on the skin, but they also show a close-up of a nose with normal sebaceous filaments.  The rest of the advertisement goes on to claim how great the product is at busting blackheads.

My beef is with the depiction of sebaceous filaments (which are a normal feature of the skin) as blackheads (acne).  So, beware of marketing! Rest assured, your SFs are normal.  

Some literature regarding sebaceous filaments: [Sebaceous filaments are cylindrical tubes of whitish-yellowish color, which can be expressed from areas of the face rich in sebaceous follicles by pinching the skin or by the cyanoacrylat-technique. Sebaceous filaments are most commonly found in the centrofacial areas and the alae nasae in postpuberal individuals with large facial pores and seborrhea. Sebaceous filaments are composed of a skeleton of 10-30 horny cell layers which enclose a mixture of bacteria, sebaceous lipid, corneocyte fragments and one hair. Following the expression of the filament the follicle refills within 30 days. The various portions of sebaceous follicles (acro- and infrainfundibulum) and the follicular contents are presented at the light microscopial and ultrastructural level. Follicles containing sebaceous filaments have a conspicuous granular layer and no acanthosis. Sebaceous filaments should be differentiated from a microcomedo and trichostasis spinolosa. They are a common morphological variant of sebaceous follicles.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/130839)  (G Plewig, HH Wolff, Sebaceous Filaments, Arch. Derm. Res. 255 (1976) 9-21.

Also, [Sebaceous follicles are limited to the face and upper trunk. They are characterized by deep, cavernous follicular canals, wispy hairs, and large sebaceous glands. The terminal fifth of the in-fundibulum, or acroinfundibulum, is lined with normal squamous epithelium. The internal
four fifths, or infrainfundibulum, is lined with a glycogen-rich epithelium. Its granular layer is meager and its thin keratin layer lacks a normal laminated structure. It sloughs readily to form a loose, porous mass of horny detritus in the follicular canal, or sebaceous filament, which permits sebum to flow through it. The patency of the infundibulum is not
easily maintained as it lacks rigid terminal hairs that act as wicks for the outward flow of sebum. It is not surprising that most acne lesions occur in sebaceous follicles.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1271924/pdf/westjmed00244-0093.pdf)   (DA Whiting, Acne Clinical
Review, West J. Medicine 131 (1979) 551-557.)

Edit: Some common means of identifying sebaceous filaments: common in the nose, chin, and forehead area; when squeezed fill back up in 24-48 hours; white, fleshlike, or light-gray colored (not black); when squeezed, express soft material and not a solid plug.",,False,self,t5_2tbbg,1371867003.0,,,True,t3_1fmg0t,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1fmg0t/some_more_information_about_sebaceous_filaments/,

I have tried a lot through the years, at a variety of price points.  I recently realized that I had used up all of my current body scrub before I had purchased a new one.  I decided that the timing was perfect to make my own.  I thought that it would be a fun, frugal project; I always could go to the store to get ""real"" scrub the next day.

I was blown away by the results.  Of all of the scrubs I have tried, the one that I just threw together with what I could find in my kitchen worked the best.  I didn't know that skin could be so soft.  Even better, I didn't need to use extra products for shaving and moisturizing; the oil in the scrub kept my legs silky and soft.

Okay, enough raving: time for the recipe. I just mixed good quality extra virgin olive oil and good kosher salt at a 1:2 ratio.  However, a coarse sugar with a drop or two of essential oil (or vanilla extract) added probably would give similar results with a yummier smell.

1370612515.0,48,self.SkincareAddiction,1fuzmz,Do you get a weird scaly flat 'rash' under your bra strap during the summer? It may be Tinea Versicolor! A harmless but unsightly overgrowth of natural yeast on the skin.,ieatbugs,62,14,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1fuzmz/do_you_get_a_weird_scaly_flat_rash_under_your_bra/,"Tinea versicolor is a common condition. It is estimated that 2 to 8% of the population of the United States has it. This skin disease commonly affects adolescents and young adults, especially in warm and humid climates. It is thought that the yeast feeds on skin oils (lipids) as well as dead skin cells. Infections are more common in people who have seborrheic dermatitis, dandruff, and hyperhidrosis.

**The symptoms of this condition include:**

* Generally oval or irregularly-shaped spots of 1⁄4 to 1 inch (0.6 to 2.5 cm) in diameter, often merging to form a larger patch
* Occasional fine scaling of the skin producing a very superficial ash-like scale
* Pale, dark tan, or pink in color, with a reddish undertone that can darken when the patient is overheated, such as in a hot shower or during/after exercise. Tanning typically makes the affected areas contrast more starkly with the surrounding skin.
* They may be mildly itchy.
* Sharp border 
* Pityriasis versicolor is more common in hot, humid climates or in those who sweat heavily, so it may recur each summer.
* Sometimes severe ""pin-prick"" itching in the affected areas; usually when the person's body temperature is elevated by exercise or a hot/warm environment, but the person hasn't started sweating yet. Once sweating begins the ""pin-prick"" itching subsides.

These spots commonly affect the back, underarm, upper arm, chest, lower legs, and neck. Occasionally it can also be present on the face. 

More info on symptoms: http://www.aad.org/dermatology-a-to-z/diseases-and-treatments/q---t/tinea-versicolor/signs-symptoms/tinea-versicolor-signs-and-symptoms

**Treatment:**

Recurrence is common and may be reduced by intermittent application of topical anti-fungal agents like tea tree oil

Topical antifungal medications containing 2.5% selenium sulfide (Selsun Extra Strength shampoo) are often recommended. Selsun Blue works for some people, but not all, because it only contains 1% selenium sulfide.[citation needed] Preparations containing more than 1% selenium sulfide are considered prescription strength. Products that contain 1% selenium sulfide include [ZunSpot] medicated cream. Ketoconazole (Nizoral ointment and shampoo) is another treatment. It is normally applied to dry skin and washed off after 10 minutes, repeated daily for 2 weeks. Ciclopirox (Ciclopirox olamine) is an alternative treatment to ketoconazole as it suppresses growth of the yeast Malassezia furfur. Initial results show similar efficacy to ketoconazole with a relative increase in subjective symptom relief due to its inherent anti-inflammatory properties. Other topical antifungal agents such as clotrimazole, miconazole or terbinafine can lessen symptoms in some patients.

Hope this helps someone!

I'd really appreciate some advice about what's wrong with it, and the best way to deal with it.

I'm 27 &amp; female. Always had good skin during my teens, &amp; frankly I never paid attention to it. I never wore moisturizer or suncream, or stuck with any particular regimen. In the last few years I moved to a harsher climate (northern Vermont) and my skin has really suffered. I have all these congested bumps all over my face, especially my chin, cheeks and temples. They periodically break out. It's mostly just on the surface, but sometimes I get deep, painful pimples (rarely).

Some pictures here - warning they are close ups! http://imgur.com/a/jRHi1

At the moment, I've been trying OCM. I use sweet almond oil, castor oil and sometimes a couple of drops of tea tea - I do this morning and night. Sometimes I moisturize with jojoba oil, othertimes with this stuff: http://www.alaffia.com/store/pc/Neem-Shea-Butter-Skin-Recovery-Face-Cream-10p121.htm

A couple of times a week, I exfoliate with [this neutrogena scrub](http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Naturals-Purifying-Pore-Scrub/dp/B004D2DQSY). Recently I picked up some of that Aztec clay, tried it a few days ago, didn't see anything miraculous but will stick with it.

So, what should I do? What are these bumps?! I guess I shouldn't be popping them... I'd be happy to spend some $ on products that work!

1363971560.0,45,self.SkincareAddiction,1at3kg,"pH's of 32  moisturizers some you've probably heard of, some you haven't and some talk of hydrophilic versus hydrophobic moisturizers.",yvva,51,6,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1at3kg/phs_of_32_moisturizers_some_youve_probably_heard/,"I came across [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Shi+V%2C+Tran+K%2C+Lio+P.+A+comparison+of+physicochemical+properties+of+a+selection+of+modern+moisturizers%3A+hydrophilic+index+and+pH.+J+Drugs+Dermatol+2012%3B+11%3A+633%E2%80%93636.) article which listed pH's of a bunch of US based moisturizers ( though I'm sure some big brands are available outside of the US).  I thought it may be useful. ( To note: One of the authors does work for Aveeno, which explains the Aveeno products mentioned,  however the data seems objective and doesn't promote one brand over the other).


As we know, maintaining the integrity of the skin's acid mantle/barrier function is very important. So when possible, it's best to use topicals that are skin identical pH's ( within the 4-6 range) or a bit on the acidic side. 


Another distinction the authors made was dividing the moisturizers into categories, the 2 main ones being hydrophilic versus hydrophobic--the first 7 are hydrophillic and 8-22 are hydrophobic ( they will have a more ""greasy"" texture due to the high lipid contents). The rest are divided into 2 more categories, though the authors don't say too much more than they are more alkaline.


*Hydrophilic moisturizers* hydrate more rapidly, however, they may require "" more frequent application because the extent of their moisturizing effects relies on the concentration of the product applied"". Water is retained more in the upper layers of the stratum cornem. (Some of the hydrophilic moisturizers listed here also include occlusive ingredients, like in Cerave Cream, so all is likely not lost.) 

*Hydrophobic moisturizers* can hold water both in the upper and lower layers of the SC. These have some occlusive properties, which means some of the product remains on the surface to protect skin from water loss. The authors go on to state that, "" They may also penetrate into deeper SC and change the packing and lamellar organization of the intercellular lipid matrix, further making it impermeable to water evaporation""---this, to me, is likely due to the lipid content of these sorts of moisturizers.

I'm new to r/skincareaddiction, though. I saw someone mention it in r/acne and I'm glad to have found a more active community!

Anyway, before the deal: I've had mild to moderate acne since early high school. I'm 29 now and still dealing with it. It's mostly hormonal, and I feel like I've tried everything under the sun. Currently, I'm using manuka honey masks, Paula's Choice BH 2%, and CeraVe (I've always used the lotion and/or the AM/PM stuff). I was using Ziana for awhile, but stopped because I sort of want to try to get pregnant soon and I don't want that stuff in my system.

Anyway, after reading a few comments in this sub, I decided to go out and get some of the CeraVe cream (the kind in the tub) from CVS today. I'm cheap, frankly, and the fact that it was $15.99 really turned me off (although I imagine it lasts awhile, right?) 

I have a CVS card and I'm signed up to receive emails, so I had a 20% off emailed coupon good on non-sale items. Then, in this week's Sunday paper, there was a 20% coupon that you could actually stack with the email coupon. (In other words, you can use both -- and get 20% twice. Example: $20 purchase. Scanning on 20% coupon brings you total to $16. Scanning the second 20% coupon brings your total to $12.80.)

At CVS, if you scan your card at the Big Red Machine (it's this coupon-spitting machine at the front of each store), you get a few coupons. One of the coupons that's coming out this week is a $5 off any $25 facial skincare purchase.

So, here's what I did:

* 2 CeraVe cream tubs @ $15.99 each = $31.98
* First 20% off coupon = $25.58
* $5 off of $25 = $20.58
* Second 20% coupon = $16.46

So, almost 50% off on each of them. $8.23 for each tub, which totally beats drugstore.com and stuff.

It sounds nice, right?

During facial, it was just dandy then after mask, she applied SkinCeuticals LHA Solution toner which they never used on my face before. It started to sting my face and I told her that it stings. She said my skin became slightly flushed so she wiped my face off with a damp tissue. She applied a cream on my forehead then on the right side of my face. I turned my face towards her and saw her holding Aquaphor. I seriously flipped out and basically told her get that fucking stuff away from my face! She tried to assure me that it is a healing ointment and it is suitable for sensitive skin. DUH! I know what it is! LOOK AT MY FREAKING FILE! I have a severe reaction with petroleum and mineral oil. She looked confused then she went out to get a nurse.

When they came back, I already had a severe flare up. Half of my face was swelling and it felt like fire especially on my forehead. It was terribly red as a cooked lobster. All workers came in the room, stared and whispered. The dermatologist said it was from LHA toner. I told her that I have a contact dermatitis. My skin doesn't do very well with petroleum-based products. I explained her my experience with mineral oil when I was young - the sensation and reaction is pretty much same as now. It only affected the area where she applied Aquaphor on my face. She never saw a case like that. I got prednisone, a buttload of thermal water spray and epidermal repair cream. Stayed there for almost two hours until my swelling went down.

I was insanely upset because I wrote petroleum and mineral oil for allergies and sensitive reactions - they should take that seriously. I am not some kind of hippie who thinks petroleum or mineral oil is very harmful because it causes cancer.

Today's facial was no charge and they tried to offer me 50% off for the next facial. I turned it down because I was still fuming.

It has been four hours since the incident. My forehead and the right side of my face still feel slightly burning. My right eye still aches. Will take benadryl soon and have a glass of wine. ;p

It was not until I watched and looked my self really closely in the mirror that I saw my peach fuzz and suddenly felt an urge to shave it off, though I didn't do it. I was just curious and wanted to ask if this was as effective as she claims it to be (I know she's no professional and she is using humor and a sarcastic tone in her video). Is it safe? Should this be done? Thoughts?",,False,self,t5_2tbbg,False,,,True,t3_1gokov,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1gokov/women_shaving_their_face/,

The girls were wonderful, I was immediately offered a full refund and a few gifts for bringing to their attention, They said I could also have store credit (instead of the refund- they allowed me to choose) which I used to buy a different gift set, They also gave me 2 additional small gift sets with different bath bombs and a vanishing cream. They were unable to get onto head office on the phone but they said they would have them email me as soon as possible. Honestly they made it a really positive experience and they were quite sympathetic about the situation. So Then I emailed head office and Selina answered and apologized again for it happening and advised that she was unsure how it happened as they do not have glass in the area that makes bath bombs but they will investigate it to find out what went wrong.  She was super nice in her email and offered me some products to make up for the disappointment.  

So I hope they do find out what went wrong as I don't want anyone to step on the glass and get hurt. I know they will never tell me what went wrong and I am a bit bummed about that but here is hoping no one gets hurt!

I have thick, dry, non-sensitive skin all over my body. Rough elbows, rough knees, almost scaly looking feet if I don't moisturize n exfoliate. On top of that, I've got thick coarse body hairs. Even tho I'm a woman, it's never felt feminine. I have to shave daily if I want to be smooth. My hair grows back spiky and I've got hair EVERYWHERE.... So since I was a teenager I've been looking for the solution for ingrown hairs.

Started with infrequent shaving, then using fresh razors every time, then using witchazel as aftershave, then scrubbing the fuck out of my skin with brushes, exfo gloves, sugar scrubs, then shaving with oil instead of cream or soap. Tried waxing, tried nair, tried damn near everything but laser. All of these techniques brought some form of relief but none completely prevented ingrown hairs.

For the last few years I've had generally smooth skin and a high-maintenance routine. But still, I have these tiny little bumps on the backs of my thighs and around my groin and all over my butt cheeks.

UNTIL NOW!

I found a soap bar called Crystal Peel that basically mimics microdermabrasion. It's not the cheapest bar of soap on the market but I am in love. Been using it for 2 months and I will never stop using it. I do not recommend this product for thin skinned ppl cuz it's pretty rough. It's exactly what I need. My skin simply does not respond to gentle coaxing.

I scrub my ass n my groin and my legs with this soap bar every day in the shower. I touch my skin after using it n it feels like a different person - so so so soft! I have managed to scrub off those tiny little bumps which were impossibly fine hairs that couldn't burst through my thick dermis. Now, I'm touchable. And NO MORE INGROWNS. I moisturize real good after with raw shea butter

So all you reptilian bitches like me, go get yourself a bar of Crystal Peel.

1370176256.0,38,self.SkincareAddiction,1fil8u,NOTHING has helped to clear my skin more than exercise. Bit of a rant...,Jestatic,49,11,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1fil8u/nothing_has_helped_to_clear_my_skin_more_than/,"Hi guys, this is my first post anywhere so I hope I'm doing it right.

A little bit of background information about me is that my mum is a very experienced beautician (for over 30 years) and has worked for some top salons over her career. She now has her own business and has a lot of regular customers, some of them in their 20s (like me) who have had their skin clear up since they started seeing her. My mum does do extractions when necessary, but she is very careful cross-infections and whatnot.

When I was about 16 I started breaking out and continue to break out even up until now at 20 years old. My skincare regime is to apply a toner/softener then a moisturiser every morning and night. I also cleanse my face once a day. I use primarily Shiseido products but also Thalgo. I don't use sunscreen as often as I should...

Anyway, I've tried having regular facials over the year but they honestly haven't helped the problem. And yes, I try to keep my face clean without touching the breakouts but the zits are still persistent. I've tried drinking heaps of water and eating heaps of fruits &amp; veggies. I'e never tried Proactiv or something similar because some of my friends had some bad experiences (dry skin, the product bleaching their towels orange). These days I get pimples around my chin and jaw, sometimes on my cheeks and forehead as well.

I started thinking about when my skin had been the best and when it had been the worst. I realised that my skin issues started at 16, when I injured my back and stopped playing basketball. I also realised that a year ago when I was doing volunteer work and 'farming' or building things each day, my skin was completely clear.

In the last 6 months I have tried to go for a 30 min power walk/run 3 - 4 times a week. I shower straight afterwards. SERIOUSLY, this is the best thing I have done for my skin. After 2 days of exercising, my skin is noticeably clearer. The redness has been reduced significantly. Afte about 4 days the bumps even out. Occasionally, usually at 'that time of the month' I will still get a bit of a break out but my skin is nowhere near as bad as it was before.

I've googled this to see if there's any science behind it and I've found that it might be the sweating that helps. I've also read that excessive exercise can make your skin worse. Whatever it is, and even if it's just a placebo effect, it is certainly helping!!

Of course I'm not saying that this will work for everyone - that is most definitely not what I'm saying! I can't stress that enough. I'm just telling you guys my experience and suggesting that for some people this may be helpful :)",,False,self,t5_2tbbg,False,,,True,t3_1fil8u,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1fil8u/nothing_has_helped_to_clear_my_skin_more_than/,

Anyway. I'm here in Thailand keeping a friend company as she recovers from surgery, and I'll be here for another three weeks. I would absolutely hate to go without moisturizer for that long, but I'm also kind of wary of buying products I can't read.

I'm a 14 year old girl and I need your help big time. I've never learned how to take care of my skin properly and I have A LOT of skin problems and going to a dermatologist is not an option for me right now. I went a year ago and was diagnosed with rosacea on my face and keratosis pilaris and folliculitis on my body. I'm very pale of Irish descent so every flaw shows up on my skin and I have a lot of little spider veins and broken capillaries all over my body too. :( I also have really oily skin (but it sometimes flakes and feels rough and dry?) and pores the size of moon craters and lots of little bumpy clogged pores or oil glands on my forehead. Oh! And lots of what I guess are sebaceous filaments, not to mention the red blotchiness and pustules from the rosacea. Please help me! I see so many other girls with nearly flawless, soft smooth skin and I don't know how they do it. I have lots of questions...

* What should I use to wash my body with, considering my folliculitis and KP? I've researched a lot and I'm thinking either sulfur soap, african black soap, panoxyl, or zinc soap. What do you guys think? 

* What is the best cream for KP and folliculitis? I've heard a lot about Am-Lactin or U-Lactin, or should I use something else?

* What should I use to wash my face? My face skin is quite sensitive and reactive so I really like to use natural ingredients. Could oil cleansing work? Or raw honey?

* What should I use to exfoliate my face? Acids sound kind of scary, but which one is the most effective for my problems?

* Toner? Serum/treatment? Moisturizer? 

* What can make pores smaller or at least cleaner and less inflamed looking? Can chemical peels help?

* What can I use to soothe the redness and inflammation the rosacea creates? I'm going to try to go to my family doctor and get on an anti-biotic or some medication. I have metrogel, but it doesn't work very well.

* I think my rosacea has already gotten worse. I've blushed easily since I was little, and when I was diagnosed with rosacea last year, I was only diagnosed with ""pre-rosacea"" and I just had some facial redness, but now I have some broken caps and pustules! :( I'm really paranoid because as rosacea progresses, it gets really awful looking and can deform your nose! Does it always progress like this?

* How can I bring balance to my skin? It's super oily, but it usually feels sort of rough and dry too.

* Is there anything that can help with spider veins and broken capillaries? 

* Any foods and supplements to take or to avoid?

* Can you rec me a good hand cream and chapstick? They both get so dry.

* Any other tips...

I think that's it. I'm so lost. I hope you guys can help me!!",,False,self,t5_2tbbg,1373753795.0,,,True,t3_1i8on8,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1i8on8/please_help_a_suffering_teenage_girl/,

Anyway, if you have a CVS card, all PF stuff is $6 off. This includes coverup sticks (light, yellow, and green). Makes them $.49 to $.79 cents apiece.

The mineral powder is normally $14 or so at my store, but you can snag it for $8 this week.

You don't need any coupons -- if you have a store card, the $6 comes off automatically at the register. To sweeten the deal, if you scan your card at the Big Red Machine (the machine that spits out coupons), some people are getting coupons good for $7 off any PF purchase or $3 off any PF purchase.

All of this is good through Saturday. I picked up 7 concealers, some liquid liner (just to try), a nice eyeshadow palette for hazel eyes, and something else (is it bad that I can't remember?!)

Anyway, I hope some of you find this post useful. Also, if you really want to go nuts, there's a manufacturer's coupon for $1 off any PF product in many 4/28 coupon circulars (if you still have your Sunday paper from that date).

I showered a lot less there too because of the water shortages. Bleh, I don't know. My skin is so fickle.

WHen I was in middle school, I started noticing i was one of those kids who just went through puberty significantly early.  I sprung from a lil kid in 6th grade to a 5'11 giant (well compared to others in middle school) in 7th grade.  With this growth came one of my darkest periods....puberty.

I was the first one to get a pimple.  No one else, just me. So being different in middle school, makes more people notice you, and in a notsogood way.  In 6th grade, my acne first arrived.  It came in groups. Started at 1, made its way to at least 50-60.  I started to skip school, and eventually got called into school to speak to a cop about missing so much.  

This lead to me looking for any skin clearing breakthrough.  I've done peels, antibiotics, creams, steaming, even fucking tapes, and nothing would have an effect, it actually usually made it worse.  With this frusturation came more and more acne.  

I'd grow my hair out, so that my entire forehead couldn't be seen. This of course made it worse, because the oil from my hair would get all over my skin.  Things just kept piling and piling up.  Fuck, there was a period where I didn't looking into the mirror for 2 years.  Until finally, my sophomore year of highschool, I said fuck it, and used accutane.  

Accutane is a pretty serious prescription.  It comes with a bunch of possible side affects, but at that point I honestly didn't care, I just wanted clear skin.  I was skeptical.  After having SERIOUS acne for 3-4 years, and using every treatment in the book, I thought this was just going to be another disappointment.  

With this prescription, comes what seems like a 10 page pamphlet on warnings, and a monthly blood test.  I started taking it, two pills a day, every day.  I noticed changes almost immediately.  My skin started to dry up, and lips started to bleed, but through and through after a month, My acne was almost 100% gone.  

I kept taking it, month after month, and slowly I became crystal clear.  People complain about the dry lips, but all it takes is having a carmex on hand all dey eery dey.  You're supposed to take the drugs for, if i remember correctly, 5 months.  However, I was a pretty advent athlete, and ended up fracturing my back in lacrosse.  They had to take me off of it, because there was a fear that the drug might have an affect on how my back healed.  

Even after stopping 2 months early, my skin to this day (I'm 20 now, took it when i was 15) remains awesome. All of those stupid creams that you had to apply to stop one pimple from turning into fifteen? gone.  Painful scrubs, and pads with shit that made your skin burn? gone. 

There is only ONE thing I apply to my face every day, and thats Cetaphil.  Cetaphil is a soft cleanser that makes your skin feel like sex.  Since I ended my usage of accutane, i can count the number of pimples i've had on one hand i shit you not.  

We all have problems, and I know that I was a beautiful person on the inside, but my acne cause depression, and self-esteem issues that would put a fat kid to shame.  After my face cleared up, I actually started looking in the mirror (which was something that haunted me for years, and it was nice to actually be able to look at your self in the face without wanting to break down :)). 

I was a pretty popular kid when I had acne, but after it was all gone, I was able to actually be happy with my friends.  No more shit talking behind my back.  No more comments like ""pizza face"" or ""Get a facial"", and especially no more ""Appalachian mountains"" nickname (probably the harshest because I didn't know about it for years until my friend told me). 

No more pain in my face every morning.  No more looking around my face for new pimples.  No more staying home from school in fear that people will see my new breakouts. And ESPECIALLY no more worrying about the lady friends judging me because of my skin.

I love my life now, but more importantly, I am able to finally say I love myself now, which I believe is one of the biggest keys to happiness.  If any of you guys have any questions about how to get through acne problems of your own, or my story please do ask!

tl;dr  Had a shitload of acne, ended it with miracle drug, left me a happy happy guy :)

1352842135.0,40,self.SkincareAddiction,1356nj,Mineral oil and it's benefits for skin. Don't be scared by it!!!,yvva,52,12,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1356nj/mineral_oil_and_its_benefits_for_skin_dont_be/,"So I submitted this earlier but my post got sucked into and eaten by cyberspace. I definitely think there is some debate between a lot of people out there who are scared of mineral oil or try and avoid it because they are under the assumption that it's bad for you.



  Turns out, it has a lot of benefits!!!



I came across this review article which I will be summarizing for you guys. I think it laid out the benefits quite well, and it also taught me more about it.   Clearly  I wanted to share the knowledge!!!! ( /u/ieatbugs already knows of this  : P   )  ( Source: Rawlings, A. V. and Lombard, K. J. (2012), A review on the extensive skin benefits of mineral oil. International Journal of Cosmetic Science, 34: 511–518. )






The difference between regular mineral oil and baby oil is that baby oil has a fragrance added to it. If you're sensitive to fragrances I don't suggest baby oil. 


It can be used to treat mild eczema when corticosteroids are not desirable and also to clean ears ( 2-3 drops).  



Although mineral oil's main benefit is to sit on top of skin ( as occlusives do to prevent water loss). This is due to its composition of straight alkyl chains---they form a barrier to help prevent anything from going in or coming out.  it's occlusivity is not 100% perfect though because the chains are not all the same length, so there are gaps here an there.



Also due to these chains is why it does not penetrate the skin--the molecular structure is just too large.  However, it does have a moderate moisturizing component ( which kind of goes back to it being an occlusive)


It is, in-fact,  non-comedogenic!!!! ( Insert cheers and sighs of relief here )  



It is highly emollient----making the skin feel soft. 



It has a moderate about of substantivity----amount in which a chemical stays on skin. This means it remains on the skin through friction,sweating, other watery substances.  ( On an aside, you want your sunscreen to have high substantivity) 



So what does this mean for your skin? Basically mineral oil can increase the thickness of the stratum corneum ( outer layer of skin), therefore reducing appearance of fine lines ( via retaining moisture) and also it helps to increase softness.



Mineral oil is a good alternative to vaseline/aquaphor if you really hate the thick/waxy texture.  Mineral oil, although not as awesome at preventing water loss, does a pretty dang good job and the texture is far lighter.  This is definitely something to consider to apply post moisturizer. 


Re-iterating the issue of comedogenicity ( pore clogging)---Basically back in the 70's it was thought that mineral oil clogged pores because of some rabbit studies. However, when trials were done on humans, this was not the case.   I'm just going to post the paragraph here because it's interesting and easy to read. Also, it is important to keep in mind that there ARE exceptions to all things. There will inevitably be people who are allergic to ""hypo-allergenic"" things, there will be people who happen to be sensitive to "" non-comedogenic"" things.  Genetic variation is just a fact.   Anyways here's the cool paragraph!   

""‘Acne cosmetica’ was coined in the early 1970s to describe the association between cosmetic use and acne breakouts. A variety of oils, including mineral oil, at the time were thought to be inducing this effect by blocking pores. Animal models were quickly developed. Fulton [36] described the comedogenicity of an extensive list of commonly used ingredients in skincare products of which mineral oil was reported to be mildly comedogenic but nowhere near as much as other ingredients. Conflicting results were found by Mills and Kligman [37] in their rabbit and human models, in which mineral oil was reported not to be comedogenic. The American Academy of Dermatology proposed guidelines to try to interpret the differences in the animal to human data, and they concluded that 1–2 comedones in animal testing would be unlikely to be an indicator of comedogenicity in humans [38]. This is precisely the comedogenic activity of 100% mineral oil reported in five studies, that is, zero. Furthermore, DiNardo tested in humans the formulations containing mineral oil up to 30% and found that there was no comedogenicity potential of mineral oil [39]. A wide series of products were tested that showed a comedogenic activity in the same range as the negative control. The overall conclusion is that mineral oil is **not comedogenic**. But this article also reveals that there is a difference between animal models and human models: the rabbit model is much more prone to comedogenicity than the human model, but all the earlier data that condemned mineral oil originate from animal models, a situation scientists even say will be difficult to correct [39]. ""  



For those concerned about photosensitivity, "" Its long-term usage suggests that any detrimental effect on skin is probably minor and only as severe as the changes in sun sensitivity that occurs between the seasons."" 



Overall  ""Mineral oil is an efficacious skin moisturizer providing occlusivity and emolliency. Its occlusive effects lead to increases in stratum corneum water content by reducing transepidermal water loss. Through this mechanism, mineral oil is used to treat dry skin conditions in both leave-on and wash-off applications. It has been shown to improve skin softness better than wax esters, triglycerides and fatty acids. Its effect is largely confined to the epidermal layers, and as a result of its limited penetration, it is considered to be a very safe ingredient for cosmetic use.""  




Hope everyone found this interesting.  I didn't know much about mineral oil before reading this. I just thought baby oil smelled nice and make my skin soft, at least temporarily.  





**EDIT**: I'm seeing the downvotes and not totally sure why?   I'm trying to spread what I learned today because knowledge will help you make better choices. So I want to re-iterate that I summarized the article here, it's not just my opinion.


**EDIT 2**: Just wanted to make sure if you're going to use baby oil on your face and you have sensitive skin, maybe do a test patch as baby oil is fragranced. I would suggest getting unfragranced mineral oil for face just incase--Snow River Wood Oil off Amazon, or you can get it off iHerb.  : )   



**EDIT 3**  While uncommon, people still can experience petrol based allergies, so reminding everyone to test patch again. : )",,False,self,t5_2tbbg,1375966136.0,,,True,t3_1356nj,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1356nj/mineral_oil_and_its_benefits_for_skin_dont_be/,

Skin type: Oily and sensitive/reactive skin. Chronic eczema sufferer. Prone to clogged pores and cystic acne. I rarely have whiteheads. Blackheads only occur if I used wrong products.

I make my own cleansers and moisturizers. I only splurge on sunscreens, serums and chemical exfoliants/peels.

---

**AM Routine:** 

* I splash my face with cold water when I wake up. I sometimes use [Thayers Alcohol-Free Rose Petal Witch Hazel toner](http://www.thayers.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=3&amp;products_id=14) after splashing water.
 
* I use [Garden of Wisdom Pre-Emptive Strike Serum](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/7398817/9703790.htm) - one pump for my face and neck. I let it dry for a minute. 

* Three or four pumps of DIY sea kelp bioferment treatment (think of [La Mer The Concentrate](http://www.cremedelamer.com/product/6719/12421/The-Concentrate/The-Concentrate) but my own version.) and 4 or 5 drops of my AM oil blend: jojoba+watermelon seed+hazelnut oil or other oils - depends on how my skin looks. Mix together then apply it on my face and neck. I also pat it gently on my eyes. 

* I use [La Roche Posay Mineral SPF 50](http://www.laroche-posay.us/_us/_en/consumer/catalog/ByType/Dry/anthelios-50-mineral-ultra-light-sunscreen-fluid.htm) or [Desert Essence Mineral SPF 30](https://www.desertessence.com/store/mineral-sunscreen). 

**PM Routine:** 

* I splash my face with water then pat dry. I use DIY cleansing balm aka cold cream (beeswax, jojoba oil and manuka honey) and do facial massage for five minutes then leave it on for another five minutes. I wipe it off with a cool washcloth. Every other or two days, I'd use DIY goat milk cleanser instead of cleansing balm. 

* I alternate between two serums: [GoW 2% SA serum](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/7495832/9490956.htm) and [John Masters Vitamin C serum](http://www.johnmasters.com/vcs.htm). After I'm done with John Masters, I'm gonna try [Silk Naturals Super Serum](http://host.silknaturals.com/creb/super-serum-must-have-p-845.html). After using SA serum, I wait 20 minutes to neutralize. 

* I spritz my face with [rose water](http://www.iherb.com/Heritage-Products-Rosewater-Rose-Petals-8-fl-oz-240-ml/6481) or [chamomile hydrosol](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3957554/4859059.htm) before using my PM oil blend: argan, tamanu, rosehip Co2 extract, seabuckthorn Co2 extract, chamomile EO (anti-inflammatory and antibacterial) and frankincense EO (anti-inflammatory and astringent) then a thin layer of [unrefined shea butter](http://www.cleopatraschoice.com/clc-0051.html).

**Weekly:**

* [GoW Mandelic Acid Serum](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/mandelicacids.html) once or twice times a week

* [MUAC 40% Lactic Acid Peel](http://www.makeupartistschoice.com/40-Lactic-Acid-Kits_p_32.html) once a week

[Original Post Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/15v5jk/help_cystic_acne_flakiness_and_sensitive_skin_can/)

You guys gave me a lot of really good advice so I thought I'd come back with an update... My skin looks AWESOME. For the first time in a year I have no pimples. Not one. After my post I took the advice I got here and ditched the salicylic acid pads and the scrub and I upped my retin-a usage from about once or twice a week to every three days (just started doing every other day this week). I also ended up ditching the clindamycin after getting chronic yeast infections (GROSS) that began a couple of days after I started using it - my doctor says it's unlikely that a topical antibiotic could be causing them but I haven't gotten one since stopping a couple of weeks ago (thank god). 

Currently my routine is: 

Mornings: Wash with Cerave Hydrating Cleanser, gently use a washcloth if needed. Swipe my face with FAB Facial Radiance Pads. GOW Hyalauric Acid Serum. Cerave PM Moisturizer (I don't like the AM one). Elta MD sunscreen (recently switched to this, I like it better than the Kiss My Face one I was using). 

Evenings: Take off makeup with Aveeno makeup removing wipes. Wash with Cerave Hydrating Cleanser. Retin-a or 2.5% benzoyl peroxide. Wait at least 20 min if using retin-a and then Cerave in the tub and vaseline. 

Looking at my old post I also switched my moisturizer from a heavy La Roche Posay one to Cerave - my skin doesn't need that heavy of a moisturizer anymore. I still have some hyperpigmentation but it's going away and the overall quality of my skin is so much better than even before I started breaking out. 

I ran into a guy on Saturday who I had been casually dating in November/December who only really knew me when my acne was at it's worst. I hadn't seen him since Christmas and the first thing he said to me was, ""WOW, you look amazing."" Made me realize that all of the stuff I've been putting on my face is finally working! 

**TLDR**: Retin-a is my miracle drug. Seriously, if it has been prescribed to you WAIT IT OUT. Start slowly and up your dosage every couple of weeks and then just wait - it took two months for me to see results but it was totally worth it. The adjustment period can be pretty awful but it WORKS. I'm sure not for everyone, but it's definitely worth trying if you're struggling with persistent cystic acne. :D",,False,self,t5_2tbbg,False,,,True,t3_17vmml,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/17vmml/update_and_my_success_story_with_retina/,

Regimen critique!,itscliche,43,7,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1dretb/the_time_has_come_regimen_critique/,"Let me preface my post by saying that I am so thankful for finding SCA. I had considered myself a skincare junkie beforehand (Acne.org user), but this sub really solidified that for me. It's a literal addiction! I find the science behind it quite interesting, and love using what's in my arsenal to solve skin 'problems'. It's really interesting to me.


[Here is a 'closeup' of my face.](http://i.imgur.com/PAn5RxL.jpg?1) Sorry it's not head-on. This was from a couple of months back. I can provide another picture if needed.


I am soon running out of cleanser and moisturizer, so I would like some input on what to get next! I haven't changed my routine up in three years (since I started the Acne.org Regimen) other than adding in small products here and there. 


I would describe my skin as oily/acne prone. Very oily. However, after reading this sub, I have beliefs that my skin *may* be dehydrated. I'm an 18 year-old male in Toronto, Ontario/London, Ontario (during the school year). My face always has a shine on it, even RIGHT after I put on moisturizer! I'm assuming this could be Glycerin or the Licohalcone (sp?) in my moisturizer (the Acne.org new Moisturizer – it's very, very light.) I eat very healthy (I have Celiac disease, so no gluten for me) and am fairly active (gym 4-6 times a week). 


Anyway, here is my regimen. I am looking for critiques! I don't want to break the bank on skincare products (I already have in the past), as I have a pretty steeply-priced hair removal journey in September. :P


Please let me know if you would like ingredient lists! I can provide those if needed. These routines are my minimal routines that I find myself doing most often. I sub in various other products on certain days.


**MORNING ROUTINE:**

* Cleanse with Acne.org Cleanser
* Pat dry (leaving face slightly damp) 
* Acne.org Moisturizer with 1-2 drops of Jojoba Oil (Acne.org Jojoba Oil) 
OR
* Acne.org AHA + Glycolic Acid Cream (If I use this in the morning, I won't at night)

**NIGHT ROUTINE:**

* Cleanse with Clinique Facial Soap Mild (clear green bottle)
* Jojoba Oil underneath eyes (one drop)
* Acne.org Benzoyl Peroxide cream (Only on certain days – when I have breakouts; I apply this liberally to my entire face)
* Acne.org AHA + Glycolic Acid Cream with 1-3 drops of Jojoba Oil (10 minutes after BP has set in)

**OTHER INFO/PRODUCTS:**

* I have been taking Fish oil with 1000mg of Omega 3, 300mg of EPA, and 200mg of DHA, twice daily for a year. 
* I have been taking a liquid gel multivitamin once a day (NOW Adam's Superior Men's Multi) since November. 
* Once a week I use the Aztec Secret Bentonite Clay with Bragg's ACV. 
* On some mornings, I use a L'Oréal eye roller with caffeine to get rid of dark circles. Doesn't ever work, but I've been trying to use it up. 
* I try and do the OCM (EVOO, Jojoba Oil, Tea Tree Oil) a couple times per week. 
* I'm always gentle with my face and often try and use cold/chilled water to cleanse.
* Once or twice a week I will use a [Body Shop Facial Buffer with my Clinique Facial Cleanser](http://www.thebodyshop.ca/en/skin-care/skin-care-accessories/facial-buffer.aspx). Is this too harsh? I'm always gentle with it, but I feel like I always wake up with oily skin when I use it. 


In general, I have been using blotting sheets and those harsh brown paper towelettes from public washrooms to combat oily skin. I often wake up with a very oily face (even on nights where I have put on only moisturizer!) My only complaint about my skin is how oily it gets (I've pretty well mastered the acne side of things). I drink enough water and my diet is very healthy, so I'm not entirely sure what else could cause my oiliness. I also just ordered NuFountain's C10 Serum which should arrive sometime this week.

Once again, does anyone have any suggestions for toning that skin and making it as firm as my normal skin? Is it something that can only happen a long time after I've lost the weight? If anyone is knowledgeable about this topic I'd love your insight, please.

1366144536.0,34,self.SkincareAddiction,1chgka,Ingredients to look for: Niacinamide,kindofstephen,44,10,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1chgka/ingredients_to_look_for_niacinamide/,"*Healing*

Niacinamide induces an improvement in wound healing.
Three groups were compared, one of which was treated with
an ointment dressing. In the second group, a dry viscose
dressing was used. The third group were given infusions
with Complamin® in addition to the viscose dressing. This
is a nicotinic acid salt with a xanthine corpus (xanthinol
nicotinate). Using the infusion treatment, it was possible
to reduce the time to wound healing from 15–17 days to
7–10 days.

*Skin Ageing*

Oblong et al.
24 found that in
ageing cells, niacinamide enabled NADP content to be
increased to a level comparable with that of young cells.
It was also possible to prove that niacinamide, as a
precursor of NAD/NADP, had a stimulatory effect on collagen synthesis, epidermal biopolymers (proteins) keratin,
ﬁlaggrin and involucrin

*Skin Surface and Wrinkles Improvement*

In the context
of a vehicle-controlled study, it was possible to show a
smoothing of the skin surface structure and a reduction
in wrinkle depth on the facial skin of women following 12
weeks topical treatment with niacinamide, results which
differed statistically signiﬁcantly from the inﬂuence of
the vehicle.

*UV Protection*

Gensler noted that it was also possible to
inhibit both photo-immunosuppression and photocarcinogenesis by the topical application of niacinamide.
There are no ﬁxed ideas on the mechanism by which
niacinamide exerts its beneﬁcial effects.

*Hyperpigmentation*

In two studies, Hakozaki30 has shown a reduction in
pigment disorders as a result of niacinamide. In the ﬁrst
study, facial pigment disorders in 18 Japanese women
were treated on one side with 5% niacinamide and on the
other side with vehicle only. The pigment disorders were
evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively using highresolution digital images and subjective judgements.
In both evaluation procedures, it was found that after
8 weeks of treatment there was a signiﬁcant lightening of
hyperpigmentation as a result of niacinamide compared
with the effect of the vehicle (P &lt; 0.05). In a second study
on 120 Japanese women, in the context of a three-part
study using the same evaluation parameters as in the
ﬁrst study, comparisons were made among an SPF 15 sun
protection cream with and without 2% niacinamide and
the relevant vehicle. As a result of niacinamide treatment,
there was a lightening of the skin after 4 and 6 weeks,
which was signiﬁcantly better than with either the sun
cream without niacinamide or the vehicle.

*Anti-inflammatory, Anti-Acne*

In total, 82% of those treated showed an
improvement in overall disease condition after 8 weeks.33
In the case of a comparable treatment with a clindamycin
gel there was an improvement in only 68% of cases

*Anti-Inflammatory, Anti-Rosacea*

In addition to an improvement
in horny layer moisture, there was also a reduction in
the reddening of the skin as an indication of the antiinﬂammatory effect.

They are more moisturising than AHAs while also exfoliating, antioxidant, dealing with pigmentation, encouraging the production of collagen and elastine. PHAs strengthen the skin’s own natural barrier function against irritants, so it's highly recommended for sensitive skin, or problems such as eczema, acne, cuperouse skin.


There are not many products with PHAs on the market (yet). Neostrata makes them and holds the patent for them, (I would recommend a moisturiser or something and not the cleansers, since it takes a bit of time for the acids to work on the skin). I used a DIY kit from Biochemia Urody, so I guess it's worthwhile looking for PHAs in DIY cosmetic site in your country.

Here's the first big mod post for this sub, please take the time to read it!

**Safety first**

We are a skincare subreddit. This means that a lot of what we talk about includes products and remedies that people will try out at home. We want to make sure that people take the **right** advice from us and aren't persuaded towards a harmful one. Manufacturers of skincare products have to do lots of testing on what they sell to make sure that it is safe for humans to use. When someone puts forth a non-traditional remedy, it too should be tested in a similar manner right? I'm not saying specifically a natural remedy, non-traditional can be chemical as well. The one thing we do know about the chemical and natural remedies that are running around in the market place is that they are fit for consumption - they wouldn't be able to be sold in public if they weren't.

This brings me to my next point: Natural does not mean ""healthy"", natural also does not mean ""effective"", but it **can be** both of those things. It can also be neither. We want to promote people proposing good solutions to the rest of this sub, and introducing us to remedies that will help us. But if they are things that haven't got a seal of approval from an authority on them, we do expect some evidence that they are:

(a) Safe

(b) Do what they say they'll do (for the average person that they are intended for).

Here is one example of what I mean:

- Detox diets. Many people throw this idea around that detoxing is good for your body. However, with a little bit of research, you'll find that detoxing is actually a bit of a contradiction. There are toxins in everything you eat: fruit, vegetables, meats, everything. Simply cutting out meat and eating bananas doesn't mean your body will be ""toxin free"". In fact, in most cases these diets cause people to be more prone to fatigue and unable to concentrate well. It can result in an unhealthy lifestyle (even though that's the opposite of what you intended!) and also be dangerous. In cases like this, if you do want to do a new type of fast, you should always consult a doctor or specialist first. Starting a diet because you read about it in the internet is a very, very bad idea.

I hope you get where I am coming from on all of this. Drugs and products that are applied directly to skin and solutions that directly affect what you are putting into your body can be very dangerous to you... if you don't know what you are doing. We want to make products and remedies more transparent and encourage people to use what will help them out. Some things aren't as simple as they are described on the cover. Other things are often placebos. Finally, some things aren't tested well enough and may have unforseen and undesirable side effects. We want to promote the use of safe and healthy skin care, and so if people are recommending non-traditional solutions, they need to back them up with a source.

If anyone wants to add something to this, please feel free to ask and suggest thoughts.

**Tl;dr; We are open to everyone's opinion. However, non-traditional solutions can be dangerous or simply not work. If you want to propose a non-traditional solution, you need to back it up with a source.**

**UPDATE:** Please also take a look at **[the latest meta post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1i0tr1/meta_hello_new_subscribers_please_read_this/)** that also addresses the naturalistic fallacy, which talks about the differences between chemical / natural and how each can be beneficial and harmful when not approached correctly. It's well worth your time.

I found this subreddit a few months ago cross-browsing from r/femalefashionadvice and some makeup subreddits but never realized how awful my skincare routine was.  As in, I didn't have one.  I used bar soap and... that's it, sometimes lotion if my skin got dry and peeled/sunburned.  After I started reading more about skin care, I decided to invest in a variety of different soaps (even Cerave, which was very drying) from cheap up to $50+/bottle brands, but... washing my face twice a day even using moisturizer was killing my skin.  Literally, like 4 days later it started peeling like crazy and everything would hurt.  I thought I was using the wrong soap, or moisturizer so I kept looking and looking...

Feeling stumped, I came back here to read up on what I was doing wrong and I discovered the oil cleansing method.  Being acne prone, I would never in a million years put oil on my face on purpose.  But every time I went for a massage that used body oil or grapeseed oil, my skin would feel amazing for the next week.  So I decided to try it.

I'm happy to say that I can now wash my face and it doesn't immediately hurt/feel tight/peel afterward.  Right now I'm using grapeseed oil to cleanse and argon oil for moisturizing, but I really can't believe how easy it was compared to the skin regiment I was following with soap/moisturizer and how much better it feels.  I thought I would make a giant mess of the bathroom with oil slicks that were impossible to clean up... on tile no less, lol.  It sounded like a nightmare but it turned out to be a really awesome risk.  Thank you guys so much for the advice here, and thanks for the referral to the gardenofwisdom website.  I ordered 2 sample packs full of oils that I'm hoping to tweak this routine with.  Just a shout out of appreciation, I hope everyone's having a good skin day like me. :D",,False,self,t5_2tbbg,False,,,True,t3_1jujb6,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1jujb6/ocm_is_awesome_newb_here_just_wanted_to_say_thanks/,

  So since i turned 13 years old i've been fighting acne, but it wasn't until the unfortunate age of 17 that my occasional breakout turned into full blown cycstic acne MONSTERS on my face that would torment me for weeks on end, or sometimes months. It was pretty bad, to say the least. Last year (age 25), after trying practically every single acne solution on the planet, including the best/most expensive prescriptions my dermatologist could muster, I decided to stop treating the symptoms, but actually start treating the cause.


  After a whole lot of research, I made my own regimen that has been working MIRACLES for me for the past year. My skin is clear, it is happy, it is no longer uncontrollably greasy. I will say though, that to see results took about 4 weeks, but if you decide to do this, keep with it, be diligent about it, and I believe you'll see the same results i did.


Here is my routine:

I wash my face in the morning and at night. Easy right? It is. But don't bother with any of that fancy junk... here is the real Holy Grail:


   **Step ONE: Jojoba Oil (100% organic &amp; cold pressed!):**

Yep. Oil removes oil, you guys. Take 3 (yes, just 3) drops after wetting your face with warm water and massage it into your face for a full minute. Relax, breathe, enjoy. If you're wearing makeup, after massaging for a minute, take a cotton pad, wet it, and use it to remove your makeup, add a little more oil if necessary, but please USE SPARINGLY. 


   **Step TWO: Dr Bronner's Liquid Soap:** 

I use the tea tree kind because i love the smell, but if you have more sensitive skin, go for the one for sensitive skin, it works just as well. Use enough soap to lather in your hands. Massage on your face for 30 seconds. Rinse. Then wash your face again with the soap for another 30 seconds. 


   **Step THREE:** 

Dry your face! Yay! Please use a clean towel.


   **Step FOUR: Dickinson's Witch Hazel Toner.** 

This stuff is CHEAP and works wonders. I can't even say enough good things about it. It doesn't smell great, but it really delivers. Use a cotton pad to spread it evenly on your face. Let dry.


   **Step FIVE: Jojoba Oil again.**

No need for moisturizer (unless your skin is begging for it, in which case, i highly recommend Lush's Vanishing Cream. Use VERY LITTLE of it. It is incredible.) just use the oil. Take two small drops and rub it all over your face. Massage gently. You are moisturizing, not removing oil. Don't forget under your eyes! If you use too much, no problem, just wipe it off a bit with a clean towel!


Okay, do this in the morning and at night. It takes about 10 minutes total. 


Now onto my vitamin regimen... 


   **Pantothenic Acid (B5) by TWINLAB:** 

This helps reduce your skin's sebum production while simultaneously reducing pore size and clearing up existing acne. I started at 10 500mg pills daily... 5 in the morning and 5 at night, for about 2 months, then i brought it down to my current dosage of 3 in the morning and 3 at night. 


   **Cod Liver Oil Pills by Carlson:**

This is an all-over-health vitamin. It does everything. Clears your skin, it is an anti-inflammatory (so it helps get rid of those red angry bumps all over your face) boosts your immunity, lowers your blood pressure, fights PMS, fights depression...everything. And everything it does, it does it WELL.
I take one 1000mg pill in the morning and one at night. It's important to space out your vitamin dosages because your body will be better able to absorb the nutrients. Yes, you might experience fish burps, but it is a SMALL price to pay for the gorgeous skin you're in for.


   **Zinc:**

This is a little known acne fighter. Many people don't get enough zinc in their diet and the effect of that tends to show up on your skin in the form of cystic acne. I take one 50mg pill in the morning and one at night.


   **Folic Acid by TWINLAB:** 

It is most famously known as a prenatal vitamin that is also excellent for hair and nails. Not many people know that it also makes your skin glow healthy and have a youthful appearance. This stuff is fantastic. I take one 800mcg tablet in the morning and one at night.


   **Evening Primrose Oil:** 

This is another one of those cure-all vitamins that not enough people use. It has a fair number of benefits, including anti-inflammatory properties, skin-health benefits (especially for those who suffer from eczema), and also aids in fighting menstrual pain. I take 500-1300mg (depending on the bottle i buy) in the morning and the same amount at night.


If you are diligent about this...wash your face in the morning, at night, and take your vitamins in the morning and at night, even after you start seeing results, i can almost guarantee you that you will finally have the skin you have always wanted. I definitely do. 


Feel free to ask any more questions if you have them!! I want to help everyone be as happy with their skin as i am!

",yvva,38,7,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/164hw3/acne_information_the_basics_patient_information/,"What is acne? — Acne is the medical term for pimples. Pimples happen when pores get clogged with dead skin and oil, and bacteria build up. Then the skin gets inflamed and can turn red or swell (picture 1).


Is there anything I can do on my own to reduce acne? — Yes. The way you take care of your skin has a big effect on your acne. Here’s what you should do:


Wash your face no more than twice a day. Use warm — not hot — water, and do not use harsh soaps. Instead, use a gentle non-soap facial skin cleanser. Do not scrub your face, because that can worsen acne and damage the skin.


Do not pick or squeeze pimples. This can worsen acne and damage the skin. Plus it can lead to infections.


Use a moisturizer. Moisturizers labeled as “non-comedogenic” and without scents or dyes are often best.
Avoid oil-based make-up and skin products. They can worsen acne.


Can I treat my own acne? — If you have mild acne, you can try non-prescription acne products. You might even try using more than one product at once. That might be more effective than using one single product alone. If you do not improve after 3 months, or if you have moderate or severe acne, ask your doctor or nurse for advice.


How is acne treated? — Doctors can treat acne using different types of medicines. Sometimes doctors suggest trying more than one medicine at once.


There is no one medicine or combination of medicines that works best for everyone. Instead, people often need to try different medicines until they find what works best for them.


Many of the medicines that doctors prescribe to treat acne also come in non-prescription strength. The prescription products include:


Retinoids — Retinoids are medicines that help keep your pores unclogged. Most retinoids are available in a gel or cream that you put on your skin. Examples include tretinoin (sold as Retin-A®), adapalene (sold as Differin®), and tazarotene (Tazorac®).


Products that help skin shed – Products such salicylic acid, glycolic acid, and azelaic acid help remove dead layers of skin. They can reduce acne by helping to unclog pores.


Antibiotics you put on the skin – Antibiotics reduce acne by killing the bacteria inside pimples. They also help bring down inflammation. These medicines include erythromycin, clindamycin, and others.


Benzoyl peroxide – Benzoyl peroxide kills bacteria and helps to unclog pores.


Antibiotics you take in a pill – Antibiotic pills work for the same reasons antibiotic gels or lotions work. But they tend to be stronger and can cause unpleasant side effects.


Birth control pills – Some of the skin reactions that lead to acne are controlled by hormones. For this reason, birth control pills can sometimes help with acne.


Isotretinoin pills (sold as Amnesteem™, Claravis™, or Sotret®) – One of the retinoid medicines comes in pill form. This medicine, called isotretinoin, is very effective against severe acne. But it can also cause serious side effects and birth defects. Women who want to take isotretinoin must follow very strict safety rules to avoid pregnancy. (This medicine used to be sold as Accutane®, but that brand name is no longer available in the US.)


What if I want to get pregnant? — If you want to get pregnant, talk to your doctor before you start trying to get pregnant. Many of the medicines used to treat acne are not safe for a growing baby.


Will my diet affect my acne? — Studies have not found a strong link between diet and acne.

This is for those you who have serious coconut allergies or break out like no other with any kind of coconut derived product.

This post is meant to give the basics everyone concerned with skin care should know, as well as perhaps provide a basis for further research.  I may edit later to include links to the journal articles supporting the facts I'm putting forth; as it stands, I have included a link to the BASF Sunscreen Simulator (which is a great tool to use, and which I will be explaining further as we go).

**Physical vs. chemical sunscreens**
First essential aspect to understanding sunscreen ingredients is in knowing the difference between physical and chemical sunscreens, and their functions.  A physical sunscreen literally acts to block and scatter UV rays - it forms a barrier on the skin for this purpose.  As a result, the ingredients literally sit on the skin, which can affect the way the skin feels, and can sometimes be heavy under makeup, particularly in popular formulations.  Physical sunscreens (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) generally have an excellent range of UVA blocking properties, although the amount of each needed to protect against UV rays can sometimes lead to cosmetic inelegance, and the full UVA spectrum is not covered completely by either.  This was ameliorated in part by the use of Z-Cote zinc oxide, which is literally micronized and coated with silicon in order to facilitate its cosmetic elegance and efficacy both.  There has also been controversy about Z-Cote zinc oxide for many of the same reasons outlined in ieatbugs' discussion on oxybenzone - people are afraid that Z-Cote is in fact so small that it may actually absorb into the skin.  Frankly (and this is my opinion here, not fact) I think that is alarmist.  Zinc oxide is an excellent sunscreen ingredient and actually has calming (and drying) properties for skin - one of the best to use if you're sensitive or oily, actually.  I wouldn't let fear of Z-Cote interfere with this.

Chemical sunscreens are literally that - chemicals added to sunscreen formulations in order to absorb and neutralize UV rays rather than reflecting them, as do physical sunscreens.  Chemical sunscreens have the potential to be far more cosmetically elegant than physical sunscreens, and are free of some of the issues that physical sunscreens have, such as the common feeling of having a ""film"" on skin (thankfully rare with a good formulation) or strange results when being photographed.  Following is an excerpt from the article linked by ieatbugs on the difference between physical and chemical (or inorganic and organic) sunscreens:

&gt;To make matters more confusing, there are several ways to describe the different types of sunscreens available today. In the scientific community, these sunscreens are referred to as organic or inorganic filters. No, this does not refer to whether or not you’ll find them at your local natural grocery store. Instead, it refers to whether or not it contains a carbon atom. So if any chemical compound includes carbon atoms, it is referred to as ‘organic.’ Organic filters include the chemical sunscreens found in many formulations. Inorganic filters are more commonly referred to as physical or mineral sunscreens. These include the physical compounds zinc oxide and titanium dioxide. These physical sunscreens sit on the skin and scatter or reflect UV rays. On the other hand, chemical sunscreens typically absorb the UV rays. These include ingredients such as avobenzone, oxybenzone and homosalate, among others.  http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/128ino/shedding_light_on_sun_safety_oxybenzone_does_not/

**Sunscreen facts everyone should know**
Here's some things to keep in mind now that you have a grasp on chemical vs. physical sunscreens:  the manner in which you apply them, the amount you apply them in, and the combinations of chemicals you use, all have an effect on whether or not you are actually getting sunscreen protection.  

* If you use a chemical sunscreen, you MUST wait 30 minutes for them to set before going out in the sun, or you are not protected.

* If you combine certain chemical sunscreens (most notably avobenzone and octinoxate) you will not be protected as they actually destabilize one another - and they are both very common ingredients both in sunscreens and in makeup and skin care products.  

* If you combine zinc oxide and octinoxate, however, your sun protection is magnified.  

* Avobenzone will stain your clothes yellow if you get it on the fabric.  

* Avobenzone will also destabilize on its own without further ingredient support - the only stabilized formulations including avobenzone I know about in the United States are in Neutrogena products.

* If you don't apply enough sunscreen, you will not get the sunscreen on the label.  And that furthermore does NOT mean that if you apply half the sunscreen, you get half the SPF labeled.  It means you get it squared.  Therefore, if you apply half the necessary amount of SPF50 you need, you do not get 25 - you get around 6 or 7.

* Having sunscreen in your foundation - or in your mineral makeup powder or sunscreen - is NOT sufficient.  In order to fully protect your face, you must apply at least 1/4 teaspoon, and another 1/4 teaspoon to your neck - a full shot glass for your whole body.  Anything less is insufficient.  And while geishas may look beautiful with that much makeup on their faces, it would look more than a little odd on the rest of us.

**SPF vs PPD**
Most people have heard of SPF, but relatively few people have ever heard of PPD.  PPD literally means Persistent Pigment Darkening, and is literally the measure for protection against UVA rays.  This is what you see on sunscreen labels that have ratings of PA+, PA++, or PA+++.  A decent PPD factor covers PA+++, and has a score of at least 8 on the BASF sunscreen simulator (link included below).  Most people believe that UVA protection is covered by SPF, but it isn't, unfortunately.  SPF does not account for those, and a high SPF is not a guarantee that you are being protected from UVA rays.  This is particularly cruel, because UVA rays are the ones most responsible for the breakdown of collagen that is responsible for skin aging, and what most people think they are being protected from when they buy a sunscreen with a high SPF.  There are only three FDA-approved UVA sunscreens in the United States:  avobenzone, titanium dioxide, and zinc oxide.  All others sold here do not capture or block UVA rays.  That is not to say that there are not other formulations available that protect against UVA rays:  two other chemical sunscreens, Tinosorbs and Mexoryls, are available overseas.  La Roche Posay is a company that produces sunscreens famous for having a high PPD factor that will in fact protect against UVA ray exposure.  It also has a reputation for being a bit greasier, for the most part, unfortunately.  I have tried them myself and while I didn't find them to be necessarily greasy, I did find that they stung my eyes.  Even so, these sunscreens are a great way to go if you are serious about preventing accelerated skin aging.  What tends to be true is that European formulations tend to be very on point with PPD protection while less cosmetically elegant, whereas Japanese-style formulations tend to be more cosmetically elegant with a slightly lower PPD.

**Okay so which one?**
There isn't a right answer to this question, or a wrong one (cliche achieved!) - what you need to do when looking for sunscreen ingredients is to assess your lifestyle and see what works better for you.  What you have to keep in mind is that your overall focus for using sunscreens in skincare is that you need the most effective possible way to block, absorb, or neutralize all those UV uglies coming to zap your collagen.  The best way to do this is to find one that you will wear, every day, in the proper amounts, without fail.  If you are often outside, or you sweat a lot, or are otherwise active, it makes sense to look into more water-resistant varieties.  I would suggest Shiseido or Anessa SPF lotions, as they are the most elegant versions I have found that are also water resistant (although these will often require you to double-cleanse at night with an oil cleanser - Shiseido does have a nice one).  If you are not often outside, or cosmetic elegance is extremely important, or perhaps you have oilier skin that needs a lot less in order to be happy, I would suggest a water-based version.  My favorite, and the one I wear daily, is Biore UV Watery Essence SPF50 (my skin is quite dry and I still love this product).  Feels absolutely invisible on skin, and washes off with nothing more than a regular cleanser.  However, there may be other formulations that will work better for you (and your budget).  The key is to find what works best for you and your needs, and stick with it.

**Further ways to maximize sun protection**
Antioxidants are going to be extremely helpful in fighting off and repairing sun damage both.  There are several ways to go about this:  one of the easiest is to use a (stabilized!) Vitamin C product underneath sunscreen every day as part of your regular skin care regimen.  Vitamin C will not only stave off sun damage, but it will brighten and refine your skin.  All-around win here.  Retinoids (one of the holy trifecta of anti-aging skin care) should only be used under a doctor's direction, and at night as UV light will destabilize them.  Retinoids (and their weaker cousin retinol) actually serve to thin the epidermis while thickening up the dermis by stimulating collagen.  No matter what marketing material you read, no matter what claims are made by hopeful skincare manufacturers, a retinoid is the ONLY ingredient FDA approved (and proven) to stimulate collagen, and hence, is the only truly proven ingredient that will work in this manner.  It is a double-edged sword in the sense that it does make your skin at once more sensitive to and more resistant to UV damage.  Also, it can be extremely irritating if not applied properly and scaffolded into skin care.  However, the benefits are quite worth it for those who are able to use, and well worth it to try.  Another way of helping protect skin from the sun is in Heliocare supplements - it is literally an extract of a fern that has been proven to prevent UV damage for a couple of hours.  A substitute for sunscreen it is not, but when used regularly it can certainly bolster up your protection, and it would be nice to take on days where you know you will be exposed to the sun for a longer period of time (its effects last a few hours).

Best of luck to all of you in your search for sunscreens and antioxidant care - I'll do the best I can to answer any questions you may have should you have any, and I hope you all find what you need.

I'm writing today because I see so many articles looking for help with a variety of skin problems. I hope this will help some of you who have **acne, flaking skin, itchiness, eczema-like conditions, rosacea, dermatitis, brandy nose etc**. Since it was an article posted here that helped me so much, I wanted to share my experience with you.

Let's start with some information about me. I'm currently 27 years old, and have had few skin problems. I never had acne as a teenager, no eczema, no allergies. I eat well, and try to take care of my skin, though not so rigorously as some of you. Overall, I'm healthy. I haven't gone to a general doctor in... well I don't know. I'm not much of a natural remedy person; I'd go for the prescription medicine over the vitamin/herbal route any day.

It was roughly three years ago that I started to notice dry skin on my face. It began on my cheeks to either side of my nostrils. At first, I thought it was extra sun as I had started wearing reflective sunglasses on a regular basis and I was outside more often. So I started using SPF 30 sunscreen on my face every day. The situation did not improve. It slowly got worse.

The most affected area of my face was in the creases next to my nostrils, but the dry, itchy skin formed into a patch that almost covered my nose and spread out almost to the outside of my eyes at its worst. I tried various moisturizers and cleaning solutions. From lotion to oils, petroleum jelly, cleaning with an astringent, steroid creams, etc. Some things helped temporarily but never for long. I noticed some other peculiarities: symptoms were milder when I changed my pillowcase often, intensity would come in cycles - good for a week or so then a breakout, some treatments would help for a while then I'd have a breakout, etc. I thought nothing of these at the time and assumed I was dealing with something like eczema. Unfortunately I don't have pictures, but my case looked a lot like the example here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Seborrhoeic_dermatitis.jpg

After several months and worsening conditions, I had a major breakout. I woke up one morning and the affected area was bright red, raw, and extremely itchy (think poison ivy). I tried to moisturize and not to scratch. Everyone noticed the problem, and I was going out of my mind. I finally made an appointment with a dermatologist for the following week. That evening or the next day I tried using a dandruff shampoo on my face. After a few minutes dead skin rinsed off like I was molting. That week the condition was the best it had been in months, though not completely gone.

At my dermatologist appointment, it took about 30 seconds to be diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis and rosacea. I was prescribed sodium sulfacetamide and went on my merry way. Finally glad to have a name to put to my ailment and a treatment to use, I began doing some research. Unfortunately, I found out that the causes of seborrhea are not very well understood. Various sources listed diet, bacteria, fungus, immune problems and genetics as things that caused or resulted in an excess of sebum causing seborrhea. Most resources agreed that it is a chronic problem that only seems to go away when your body decides it's time. This was somewhat disheartening, but I figured I'd see how well the prescription worked.

The sulfacetamide did well to control my seborrhea. I never had another bad breakout. It stunted the flakiness and moisturized my skin enough that after my morning regimen no one noticed the condition on my face. For three years I was content with the results and I came to terms with the fact that I'd be using a prescription cream in the long term.

In May of this year, I went on vacation for a week to a beach house, and spent a large amount of time outside in the sun and in a pool. By the end of the week my face was completely clear - to the point that I was considering not using my prescription and calling myself healed. Alas, it did not last. A week or two after I got home the seborrhea came back and my hopes were dashed.

In the following months my face got progressively (but very slowly) worse. Or maybe it was just that I had gotten a glimmer of hope and then was dissatisfied with my current results. Maybe it was actually that the prescription was expired. Maybe it was that I started wearing glasses and the nosepieces were in constant contact with my skin. In any case, I called up the doctor for a refill, but since it had been so long I had to go in for another consultation. 

Same deal. Seborrhea/rosacea. How's it working? You satisfied? Yeah, ok good. Here's a refill. Also it might help to start washing your face with Selsun Blue. This was a Tuesday in September. I picked up some shampoo and started using it, along with my refilled prescription. Cue /r/skincareaddiction. [You probably remember this article](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/z33nz/heres_some_happy_news_rosacea_could_be_caused_by/) that was posted that Friday. For me, this turned out to be very good news. I spent the entire afternoon at work researching demodex. I read reference works, results of studies, first person accounts. The more I read, the more I was convinced this was the problem. Everything started to add up. Breakouts that seemed to come in cycles, symptoms affected by how often I changed my bedding, clearing up while on vacation; these were things I noticed. Sources also described symptoms I hadn't noticed like enlarged pores. I explained about me at the beginning of this write-up so that you'd know I'm not a hypochondriac. But I was confident that was I had experienced for three years was finally explained.

I found this website: [demodexsolutions.com](http://www.demodexsolutions.com/). Perhaps like me, it looks to you to be quite hokey or even a scam. But upon further inspection I realized that all the information was consistant with what I had researched. It showed pictures and explained how to test for demodex. It has a forum with people asking for help and solutions. You didn't have to pay for the information up front. So even though it isn't so well designed, and the English is broken, I decided it's trustworthy enough.

I went home and performed the test as they suggested. I had a microscope in the basement and took a sample of sebum from 8-10 of my pores. I found 4 demodex mites, clear as the pictures they show on that site and others. Now I realize that most people have some demodex, but at a rate of 40-50% of pores I sampled convinced me 100% that I had found the problem. As you might expect I was completely creeped out. So after I ordered the ointment and cream I was up all night washing all my sheets and bedding and cleaning all around my bed.

It took about two weeks for my package to come, and I started using the ointment at night and cream in the morning. Within five days my skin was completely cleared up. It's been a month now and I've had no recurrence. I am still using both products and will continue for the recommended three months of treatment.

**I am not affiliated with www.demodexsolutions.com**, I'm just another average redditor who found a solution to his problem. You may be able to find products with the same ingredients elsewhere. But I understand the frustration caused by skin conditions where you stand looking in the mirror screaming ""WHY WON""T IT JUST GO AWAY?!"" I've been there.

That site claims **""Adolescent acne is for 90% caused by Human Demodex mites, Demodex Folliculorum &amp; Brevis, adult acne forms, acne rosacea, some other kinds of rosacea, brandy nose, widened large pores, itching face and scalp, itching eyelashes and eyebrows plus other demodex related skin problems.""** I only had seborrhea and rosacea, but because of information on their forums and in other studies I am inclined to believe that at least a large amount of these problems are caused by demodex. There are other conditions also attributed to demodex not listed here like atopic dermatitis. Even if it was only half of what they claim, that would be 45% of acne sufferers that could easily be treated. **Breakouts that come in cycles and changes in routine that cause breakouts are a good indicator of demodex.**

I don't know why western doctors don't admit that demodex can be a problem. I've read that they are taught that demodex are naturally occurring and cause no skin problems. But more and more studies are suggesting that this is false. In my case, I can only go by what worked and what didn't. It seems that it's rare to find a dermatologist that would thoroughly investigate your individual skin problem and look at all possibilities.

When I post here, I always suggest going to a dermatologist. Demodex certainly isn't the cause of every skin condition. Just be informed that it likely won't even be considered as a possibility. If you suspect your problem is demodex, get a microscope and test for it.

I'm not sure if this will help anyone, but my goal is to at least give you hope. It may be something to try, and it may end up working for you. I sincerely hope it does.

**TL;DR: Demodex mites live and die in your skin and cause all sorts of skin conditions like acne and dermatitis. www.demodexsolutions.com is a site that explains about demodex in depth and sells treatment to kill them.**

Edit (10/27/12): I thought it best to respond to a spammed comment below that is misinformed regarding Noble Zinc. Noble Zinc soap contains the compound pyrithione zinc with chemical formula C10H8N2O2S2Zn. This is not the same as zinc oxide (ZnO) which is one ingredient in the recommended treatment linked in this post. Treatments for pityrosporum yeast did not help me. (I tried both selenium disulfide and ketoconazole.)

Also, it's fair to point out that studies haven't shown statistically that demodex is the prime cause of acne vulgaris. However it is linked with increased severity and several acne-like conditions.

I could see them under my skin and feel them forming so it's not much of a surprise, but it still blows. I know it's not an allergic reaction, I was on a similar routine a year ago and this happened. I don't remember it being this bad, but my skin didn't start out this bad last time either. 

I've never been the self conscious type, but I'm embarrassed to leave my house. Makeup helps, but I still want to crawl under a rock and die.  I've declined going out with friends because I didn't want to be seen or didn't have time to put on foundation. I hate feeling like this, it's not me.

Anyways....on to my rave review.


This leaves a white cast, and yes, it's kind of a pain to rub in.  It's a bit greasy for 2-3 minutes, but then it sinks in/dries and it doesn't leave a residue. 

The UV index yesterday was in the 8-10 range, and it was around 92 degrees and humid. 

I did a 65% lactic peel a couple days ago, and also spot treated other areas with 18% TCA, so my face was very sun sensitive.  I also still have a deep purple scar that is still healing from a punch excision mole removal--this burns very easily, so I like to keep it covered.     My boyf has a farmer's tan and was wearing a tank top.  His skin is very fair and he is prone to blistering sunburns.


I slathered both of us in the stuff, since we were going to be outside all day.   I applied twice on his arms over 4 hours, and I re-applied maybe 4 times on myself.

He was so excited his skin didn't even turn the least bit pink, that we ended up getting a larger bottle on the way home.  

My skin wasn't burned AT ALL either.


I definitely suggest this stuff, if you don't mind taking the time to rub in the white cast. It was so effective and kind of felt healing on my skin.

But it's not okay to extrapolate it to say ""I did this and experienced this and so will you (and thus you should do it)"" for things that are still very unquantified/disputed in the literature/variable from person-to-person.

For example, someone could say ""I cut out dairy and my acne went away!"" to which I would say ""GREAT! Congrats :)"". However, if someone says ""I cut out dairy and my acne went away, so will yours and you should do it!"" This implies that a) I have bad acne b) there is a definitive causal link between dairy and acne, and c) all people's dietary needs are the same. I'll be like, no: d) I consume a ton of dairy and I don't have acne (knocking out a and b) and e) if I cut it out of my diet, my metabolism would be messed up.

Current skincare routine:
 
1) I use a make up wipe to remove my face makeup.

2) And then soak it (depending on how dirty it is, otherwise I grab a clean one) in homemade make up remover (3/4 water 1/4 olive oil, shaked like a polaroid picture) and remove eye make up.

3) I wash my face with luke warm water and a rougher wash cloth to get the rest of the make up remover wipe ""gunk"" off.

4) Then I pad it dry

5) ACV toner (OMG THIS IS AMAZING) (2/3 water + 1/3 ACV), focusing on the T-zone

6) I apply a soothing, restoring and moisturizing face cream (Danish brand, Plaísir 24 hr soothing cream)

**What is Rosacea?** Rosacea is a chronic and potentially life-disruptive disorder primarily of the facial skin, often characterized by flare-ups and remissions. Many have observed that it typically begins any time after age 30 as a redness on the cheeks, nose, chin or forehead that may come and go. In some cases, rosacea may also occur on the neck, chest, scalp or ears. Over time, the redness tends to become ruddier and more persistent, and visible blood vessels may appear. Left untreated, bumps and pimples often develop, and in severe cases the nose may grow swollen and bumpy from excess tissue. This is the condition, called rhinophyma (pronounced ""rhi-no-FY-muh""), that gave the late comedian W.C. Fields his trademark bulbous nose. In many rosacea patients, the eyes are also affected, feeling irritated and appearing watery or bloodshot.

Approximately 1 in every 20 Americans - 14 million people - are estimated to be affected with rosacea. As it is frequently misdiagnosed the incidence may be a lot higher. A Gallup survey revealed that 78% of Americans do not know anything about rosacea, its symptoms or what to do about it. 

**What does Rosacea look like?** Flushing, persistent redness, bumps, cysts and pimples, visible blood vessels, broken capillaries, skin thickening, scaly and dry appearance, plaques (raised red patches) and/or swelling. Images: [Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea](http://suggestlinkdirectory.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/rosacea.jpg) (mild or severe), [Papulopustular Rosacea](http://goodhealthhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Acne-Rosacea-5.jpg) (known as Acne Rosacea), [Rosacea Fulminans](http://www.onlinedermclinic.com/dz_images/1/3/13579793324e862172b5ba0.jpg) (large nodules) and [Phymatous Rosacea](http://derm101.com/LoadMedia.ashx?name=Rosacea&amp;filename=rosacea001g006d.jpg) (more commonly in males than females). [The Stages of Rosacea slideshow from mild to severe](http://health-tools.health.msn.com/rosacea/the-stages-of-rosacea-slideshow).

**What causes Rosacea?** The cause of rosacea is unknown, but researchers believe it's likely due to some combination of hereditary and environmental factors. Some of these factors include: Hot foods or beverages, spicy foods, caffeine, alcohol, temperature extremes, sunlight, stress and anger, strenuous exercise, hot baths and saunas, corticosteroids, prescriptions such as blood pressure medications and skincare products such as benzoyl peroxide, SLS and fragrances.

Rosacea is more common among fair-skinned people of northern European ancestry. However, studies have revealed that its incidence in many parts of Asia, including the Middle-East, South Asia, and China is growing, especially in regions that have undergone socioeconomic development in recent years. This has triggered speculation that lifestyle may be a risk factor, and not just skin color. Others say incidence has grown in those areas because healthcare and diagnosis techniques have improved.

**How is Rosacea treated?** The signs and symptoms of rosacea vary from one patient to another, treatment must be tailored by a physician for each individual case.

Treatment for the skin includes:

* Medicine that is applied to the rosacea
* Sunscreen (Wearing it every day can help prevent flare-ups; physical blockers are highly recommended)
* An emollient to help repair the skin
* Lasers and other light treatments
* Antibiotics

Patients should check with their physicians to ensure their skin-care routine is compatible with their rosacea. A gentle skin-care routine can also help control rosacea. Patients are advised to clean their face with a mild and non-abrasive cleanser, then rinse with lukewarm water and blot the face dry with a thick cotton towel. Never pull, tug or use a rough washcloth.

Patients may apply non-irritating skin-care products as needed, and are advised to protect the skin from sun exposure using a physical sunscreen (zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide) with an SPF of 15 or higher.

In addition to medical treatment, rosacea sufferers can improve their chances of maintaining remission by identifying and avoiding lifestyle and environmental factors that trigger rosacea flare-ups or aggravate their individual conditions. 

**What is the outcome of Rosacea?** There is no cure for rosacea. People often have rosacea for years.  

In one study, researchers asked 48 people who had seen a dermatologist for rosacea about their rosacea. More than half (52%) had rosacea that came and went. These people had had rosacea for an average of 13 years. The rest of the people (48%) had seen their rosacea clear. People who saw their rosacea clear had rosacea for an average of 9 years.

Some people have rosacea flare-ups for life. Treatment can prevent the rosacea from getting worse. Treatment also can reduce the acne-like breakouts, redness, and the number of flare-ups.

To get the best results, people with rosacea also should learn what triggers their rosacea, try to avoid these triggers, and follow a rosacea skin-care plan.

I've re-emerged from skin hibernation (meaning: I've done the exact same thing for about 5 years with mildly poor results but without the drive to do anything about it).

I'm a 33-yo two-time Accutane veteran (at 16 and 24) and still prone to the occasional 2-month cyst - a fact that I forgot in the last 18 months of pregnancy/nursing where I had an effortless clear glow. Then BOOM - hormones return and my usual cystic area (chin) expanded to full face. CHEEKS! FOREHEAD! WTF.

So. Overhaul. I started 6 months ago with a tube of RetinA (OTC for $6 here) and some Lisa Eldridge recommended cleansers, then lurked a bit on MUA. Then I found you guys and the wonderful sidebar, which I have read multiple times. And now. Ohhhh. Now, I want it all and have amassed a whole bunch of new stuff because I'm all over the place without a real plan.

- AM: Hand wash (ditched the Clairsonic) with Mario Badescu Enzyme Gel (it's a large sample so I need to find something permanent). Apply Josie Maran SPF 40 (but I think it's giving me little blemishes). Makeup.

- PM: No-water cleanse with Avene Extra Gentle Cleansing lotion. Apply RetinA 0.05, apply Dermalogica Overnight Clearing Gel to acne with Q-tip, bed.

I've also ordered ANR and it should be here in a few days, but then I read that I shouldn't add anything on top of RetinA to maintain efficacy?

The upside is that I've lessened the cystic breakouts and the fine lines on my forehead and around my mouth have really disappeared. But after lurking here, I realize that I could fix so much more. 

- I have flakes on my T-zone and corners of my mouth that are disturbing my foundation, but that's where I'm oily - does that mean more peel or more hydration? 

- I have acne scars, will the RetinA take care of that or do I start in with some acids?

- Am I supposed to be adding a moisturizer on top of the ANR? I haven't even settled on a new one yet - I have a tub of CeraVe on it's way to me so I'll be trying that next week. 

- What do I do with my huge stash of unopened backups from my old regime (philosphy's Help Me retinol, Omega 3/6/9 oil, Resurface microdelivery peel). Is any of it salvageable into my new routine?

Overanalysis paralysis has set in. Oh, and it's a bit more painful since I live overseas, so I have access to lovely French beauty-ceuticals, but cult products like CeraVe and MUAC will require a broker to forward to me.

Yeah. An embarrassing newbie novel.

I was looking at the face masks since they're only $7 and I've never used a mask before and it sounds like fun haha.

I recently had a pretty bad underground zit and it got me pondering. First of all, are all blemishes that do not have a 'head' considered cystic? When I was looking up remedies for this, often it referred to them as such but I never thought I had cystic acne. Just wondering on that front. If they aren't the same, what is the difference?

Second question - what is the makeup of an underground blemish? I know from reading the sidebar that for most zits it is sebum and/or bacteria buildup in a clogged pore, but is it true of an underground zit that it's composed of excess sebum also? 

If so, if the zit never comes to a head, where does the excess material go? Is it just reabsorbed into the body? 

I treated mine by washing my face like normal, using warm compresses, frequent Queen Helene Mint Julep Masks, and sulfur-based spot treatment. This made it less visible (and no longer red) within three days; however, when I feel over that spot there is still a hard little bump. What is that?

During the solstice. You literally cannot find stronger light intensity on the planet short of heading to the top of Kilimanjaro. This is the desert. No shade. Daily UV index of 11+. HOT. 90 everyday. Beach weather. And the beach is where I was for the vast majority of my time there. Swimming and laying in the sun.

Me: pasty white redhead from the Pacific Northwest. I haven't seen the sun in months on top of my naturally fair skin. We are talking WHITE here. The locals thought that I wasn't aware of this and would tell me that I was ""MUY BLANCA"" at least once a day. [Gratuitous bikini shot/reference pic](http://i.imgur.com/SE7eqFD.jpg) I'm sorry that the instagram filter actually makes it look like my skin has some color, that is an optical illusion. 

Sounds like a recipe for disaster doesn't it? No one could possibly spend a week in that kind of UV intensity and not burn right?

**WRONG**

I came back with only a few more freckles on my arms than when I left and not even a tint of pink. In my ref. pic. I had been in Mexico laying on the beach for 5 days straight by then. And nary a lick of burn to be seen.

I know that some of you think that there is no amount of sunscreen that will protect you form burning. I am here to tell you that you're just not using enough. And to give you my fail proof, no burn techniques. 

**Step 1.** As soon as you get up, before you even get dressed, slather yourself in sunscreen. I used Coppertone Waterbabies SPF 50. It's about the only thing available in a drug store that has physical blockers in it. Also no scent, gentle, high SPF, high PPD, cheap. Perfect. SLATHER! Thick, white. I would drizzle the sunscreen like delicious white sauce all over my body and then rub it in. 

Ok, so you've got your base coat on. Now just stand there naked for about 10 minutes letting it soak in. Cause otherwise you're gonna get white shit all over your clothes. That's gong to happen anyway but letting it soak in will help to minimize it. Rub it in until it is clear and then get dressed and eat breakfast. I recommend fried eggs and toast.

**Step 2.** When you get to the beach, you apply another coat immediately. If you're out walking round, dressed and in and out of buildings and under tress you can wait a bit longer. But in full sun apply it ASAP. Now go swim and have fun and get drunk on $2 margaritas and pass out in the sand. Note: the subsequent layers were not applied while nude. Just on any exposed skin. 

**Step 3.** Ok so you've been swimming and having fun for an hour or you've been walking around exploring for a few hours. Guess what time it is? YES! TIME FOR MORE SUNSCREEN! Apply another layer and let it soak in. 

Repeat step 3 as needed. For me I probably used 5 coats of sunscreen on a beach day. A full bottle, just for me, to keep from burning. Yes sun protection can be an expensive habit. 

Other tips:

* Wide brim hat while you're out walking around. Nothing beats shade for sun protection. 

* UPF clothing. When I was at the beach, in between getting massaged by gorgeous local boys and drinking margaritas in the sun, I wore a sporty UPF top with a hood. When I was out walking around exploring town and drinking margaritas I wore a UPF button down that is a bit more stylish. 

* Stay the fuck out of Cabo San Lucas. That place is a shit hole. 

Single downside: all of that wonderful water resistant zinc oxide? Well, it doesn't wash out of your bikinis or vintage silk dresses so easily. You're gonna have to give them some targeted hand washing in the sink to get that off. But, small price to pay for burn-free skin.

I have posted about the results of my use of Cerave's foaming cleanser [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1e2u2h/day_1_of_using_cerave_foaming_cleanser/)  Ergo, this post will be focused on St. Ives Exfoliating Pads.  

First off, I have used pads with a BHA or AHA from a total of five different brands.  These pads are as follows: Noxzema's Anti-Blemish Pads, Philosophy's The Microdelivery Mini-Peel Pads, Aveda Outer Peace Acne Relief Pads, Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Daily Face Peel pads, and the St. Ives Exfoliating Pads.  I found the Noxzema pads to be too strong.  They irritated my face, causing it to feel dry.  Philosophy's mini-peel pads made my face break out.  The material that Aveda's pads were made out of is a tougher material than the St. Ives pads.  They made my face a bit red.  As for the Dr. Dennis Gross regular strength peel pads, the smell was completely off putting.  I cannot place the smell exactly, nevertheless they smelled terrible.  I had no idea what to expect from the St. Ives pads.  Ever since I peeled off the covering on the container, it has been an amazing experience.  The smell, to me, is a light citrus.  The pads are so soft and gentle.  Their texture is akin to wet Shiseido facial cotton.  After the first time of using them, my face has had increased radiance and a smoother texture.  Along with the use of the Cerave foaming cleanser, my oiliness has decreased and my acne is disappearing.

I am so happy I am adopting the r/SkincareAddiction's Beginner's Skincare Routine.  Even though I am no beginner to taking care of my facial skin, I've been actively doing so for eight years, the products in the Beginner's Skincare Routine are amazing.  I recommend it for even those who are both rookies and non-rookies to having a skincare regimen.

There is some evidence (as noted below) that a silicone scar sheet plus Vit E could be beneficial, though more studies are needed (sources below).       There is conflicting  evidence that silicone scar sheets can help prevent and/or reduce the appearance of both keloid and hypertrophic scars-- [source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=O%E2%80%99Brien%2C+L.%2C+and+Pandit%2C+A.+Silicon+gel+sheeting+for+preventing+and+treating+hypertrophic+and+keloid+scars.+Cochrane+Database+Syst.+Rev.+CD003826%2C+Jan.+25%2C+2006%2C+DOI%3A+10.1002%2F14651858.CD003826.pub2).**




I was chatting with /u/ieatbugs and she thought I should make this a post of its own, since this Vit E topic comes up frequently on here.


No OTC topical currently exists to decrease the raised appearance of scars and the evidence is lacking about other topical treatments in reducing the appearance of scars in general. 

For this post, I'm only going to highlight Vitamin E, and not touch upon the other current OTC treatments, though I intend to create another thread on those sometime in the near future.


The general ( or mostly so) consensus as of now, is that one can reduce the symptoms associated with scar formation and also potentially decrease the appearance in fresh scars via moisturizing. New scars ( considered even up to 2 years old) have impaired barrier function--meaning they have an increase in TEWL (transepidermal water loss); this can lead to a more apparent scar once fully healed. So, to reiterate, moisturize those fresh scars!!!


[This](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17312518) provides one review of various scar treatment options.  This is the paragraph re: Vit E:


&gt; Vitamin E is the major lipid-soluble antioxidant in the skin and is believed by some to decrease scar formation due to its ability to inhibit fibroblasts and keratocytes in humans and rabbits in vitro.29,30 However, although no studies have demonstrated that vitamin E improves scars, evidence does exist that it causes harm. Vitamin E may be beneficial when combined with silicone gel sheets, though. A review by Parsa in 1988 highlighted the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin E in animal models but noted that controlled clinical trials in humans demonstrated no improved scar healing and a high incidence of minor adverse reactions.31 A double-blinded, controlled study illustrated that treatment of scars with topical vitamin E did not help in scar reduction but was associated with an increased incidence of contact dermatitis.32 Another double-blinded, controlled study conducted on patients after operative procedures for postburn contractures revealed that treatment with vitamin E provided no benefit in range of motion, scar thickness, change in graft size, or ultimate cosmetic appearance after treatment for 4 months but resulted in an increased incidence of itching and rash (19.9 percent in the treatment group versus 5.9 percent in the control group).33 Interestingly, one Italian simple-blinded clinical trial published in 1995 illustrated that more patients had significant improvement in the pain, itching, redness, swelling, and induration of their hypertrophic and keloid scars when they received silicone gel sheets with added vitamin E compared with patients who received silicone gel sheets alone for 4 (85 percent versus 55 percent) and 8 weeks (95 percent versus 75 percent).34




[This](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17097399) is another article reviewing various topicals. This is their section on Vit E and hypertrophic scarring:



&gt; Vitamin E (tocopherol), a lipid-soluble antioxidant, has complex effects on wound healing.50 It has been shown to penetrate into the reticular dermis and reduce the formation of oxygen radicals that impede healing and damage DNA, cellular membranes, and lipids. Vitamin E also alters collagen and glycosaminoglycan production and inhibits the spread of peroxidation of lipids in cellular membranes, thereby acting as a membrane-stabilizing agent.51 and 52

&gt; Despite numerous anecdotal reports claiming that vitamin E speeds wound healing and improves the cosmetic appearance of scars, little scientific evidence exists to support these claims. Jenkins et al,53 in an attempt to reduce scarring after reconstructive surgery in patients with burn, used topical vitamin E in the postoperative period. No significant differences were found in range of motion, scar thickness, change in graft size, and overall cosmetic appearance between the vitamin E treatment group and base cream control group 1 year after surgery. In addition, 20% of patients reported local reactions to the vitamin E cream. A subsequent double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating patients who applied emollient with vitamin E and emollient alone to each half of their scar from Mohs micrographic surgery (twice daily for 4 weeks starting soon after surgery) also demonstrated similar results. Twelve weeks after surgery, vitamin E did not help in improving the cosmetic appearance of scars or was detrimental in appearance in 90% of cases.54 A high incidence (33%) of contact dermatitis was noted. Limitations of the study included the use of the d-α-tocopheryl form of vitamin E, which has been widely associated with contact dermatitis, and the potentially diluted concentration of topical vitamin E (one crushed capsule of 320 IU in 1 g of emollient).

&gt; The use of vitamin E in scar management has other theoretic limitations. Because of its ability to inhibit collagen synthesis, the use of vitamin E early in scar therapy may reduce scar tensile strength and, hence, lead to the development of widened scars and even wound dehiscence.55

&gt; When used in conjunction with silicone gel sheets, however, vitamin E has been shown to improve pre-existing hypertrophic scars. In all, 38 patients (95%) who received silicone gel sheets with added vitamin E improved by at least 50% with respect to color, size, and cosmetic appearance, whereas only 30 patients (75%) using silicone gel sheets alone improved at least 50% after 2 months of treatment.56 This study led to the conclusion that the combination of vitamin E and silicone gel sheeting is beneficial in hypertrophic scar treatment, possibly as a result of a synergistic effect.

&gt; In conclusion, the evidence that topical vitamin E alone improves the cosmetic appearance of scars is poor. It is also associated with a high incidence of contact dermatitis. The use of vitamin E should, therefore, be discouraged.




I do want to note that many of you have great improvements with using Vit E on fresh wounds and that is great.

1375195624.0,30,self.SkincareAddiction,1jcmrc,I look like a polished pink bumpy.. something. I need help!,Eccentris,44,14,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1jcmrc/i_look_like_a_polished_pink_bumpy_something_i/,"Ever since I was a teenager I've had problems with extremely oily, bumpy, red-ish skin with huge pores (I didn't have huge pores initially, but they just kept increasing in size and never seemed to stop doing so). My t-zone is kind of plastic-like, flaky and hard in texture which makes it cast off light and shine, making me look ridiculous. Oddly enough I've never had problems with cystic acne. My acne tends to be these tiny bumps and that's it. I hardly ever get whiteheads. I suspect my oilyness might be due to dehydrated skin? [Here's a picture](http://imgur.com/m9P3aem) that I took the first time I considered asking for help here (but chickened out). I had just washed my face when the picture was taken so it's not oily yet. The shine is just light hitting the uh... plastic-like textured parts of my skin.

Over the last 10 years I feel like I've tried everything, and I've probably done more harm than good to my skin with all the harsh exfoliants and cleansers I've used. I live in a fairly small, european city. We only have one dermatologist and I've been to her a couple of times. She has prescribed me Tetracycline antibiotics in the past which have helped me a lot (still not making my skin look anywhere near 'pretty' but a definite improvement). However she says it's bad to take them for long periods of time, so right now I'm in a can't-use-it phase and my skin is looking worse than ever. I asked her about skincare routines and she says she doesn't deal with that and sent me to our city's skin-therapist who sold me an [md-formulations](http://www.bareescentuals.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-BareEscentuals-Site/default/Home-Show?brandId=MDF) kit which was extremely expensive and did absolutely nothing for my skin (may have made it worse even). 

Since nothing was helping me I pretty much stopped treating my skin altogether. I only use a very gentle cleanser and that's it. Doing that and nothing else is what seems to work best. And sunlight / tanning my face used to help a lot too (but after reading this sub I've stopped doing that). A couple of days ago I ran out of cleanser and didn't have time to go to the store. I then remembered reading about OCM here and figured, I have a couple of days off, might as well try it. If I break out like crazy it wont matter. I got [this oil](http://www.sephora.com/lotus-face-treatment-oil-P379064) for christmas and I'd never used it (oily skin + oil = more problems, is what I used to think) but I ended up doing the OCM with it that night and woke up with my skin looking better than ever. Not oily, but dewy. It looked more even in texture and less red, my pores looked less black.
[Here are some pictures of what my skin looked like after 3 days of using it (in different lights)](http://imgur.com/a/EDDE4). Still pretty bumpy..

This oil is really expensive though, there is no way I could keep cleansing my skin with it. I figured I could use it as a moisturizer at night and use some other oils for cleansing. So I got myself some castor oil and mineral oil (I used roughly 30% castor and 70% mineral). However, after using those my skin looked more red again and was back to extremely oily. But, since I've now seen the light with the expensive oil I figure there might be hope for me yet! So I'm here asking for help, and I have a couple of questions:


* Any suggestions as to what kind of oils might work with my skintype for the OCM? I've been reading on GOW but every oil I read about seems to be good for one of my symptoms, and I'm having trouble sorting out what to try. I've been browsing this subreddit looking at what others are using but I have yet to come across someone with similar skintype to myself. Most suggestions are for people with cystic acne or extremely dry skin. In fact, I have trouble even figuring out what my skintype is (dehydrated, oily, acne-prone, rosacea, all the above?), which makes it hard to browse for suggestions.

* I'm thinking about trying out some of paula's products (bha in the morning, aha at night) once I've figured out a good oil combination for my OCM. But, if I use OCM at night, can I then use AHA? Wont the oil left on the skin ruin it?

* Any other suggestions for someone with my problems you can think of?

I know it's cool to say ""Nah, my drugstore/DIY 100% Natural Avocado Face Mask is waaay better"" and for celebrities to come out and say ""Oh, all I do is drink lots of water and use Ponds!""...but really? 

I mean companies fund lots and lots of research and testing into these products, surely that must mean something?

I used to buy lots of cheap products, but now I stick to quality over quantity (not that all cheap products = low quality). In fact buying a slightly more expensive but well-tested product seems to have saved me more money because I stop my obsessive skin experiments. I've found that my one visit to the dermatologist and buying his line of skincare brand improved my skin so much that I stopped trying other products and actually *saved* money in the long run.

Of course, this is not to say that an expensive product is a good one. There could be lots of lemons among the expensive skincare brands, and lots of jewels in the cheaper/drugstore ones too. 

What do you guys think? Do you think expensive skincare products are generally better/superior? Do you think their prices are worth it?

Also: this is kind of an irrelevant rant but does anybody else find it weird that so many beauty bloggers make a career out of testing so much shit on their faces? They're always changing toners/moisturizers/conditioners etc etc. Wouldn't that make their skin go crazy?

I am not a doctor, I am not your doctor. Consider this patient to patient information sharing and advocacy.*

**If your dry skin is chronic, if your dry skin persists despite being hydrated and using non-irritating super moisturizing products, go to the doctor. Get your hormones worked up.**

FYI: When someone says “hormonal” they aren't just referring to your sex hormones. Your thyroid controls a whole bunch of body processes through hormones. If it goes screwy, everything can go screwy.


**THE UPDATE:**

[Once upon a time, I came here for help with my horribly always dry skin. I got it. Help was awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1bzc95/chronic_dry_skin/)  
I've been able to mitigate the appearance of the dryness.  
[Then a couple weeks ago I posted about getting your thyroid checked if you have chronic dry skin.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1c9j7o/brief_update_chronic_dry_skin/)
 
My results came back.    

No amount of product is going to fix my chronic dry skin. [I've been diagnosed with Hashimoto's Disease, an auto-immune disorder where the body attacks the thyroid.](http://www.endocrine.niddk.nih.gov/pubs/hashimoto/)
(*this link gives the run-down, not everything that goes with it, like how it causes you to be hypoT and then hyperT on a thyroxine dump AND IT'S SO MUCH FUN, YOU GUYS.*)

One of the symptoms of both hyper and hypo thyroidism is dry skin. Horrible, terrible, persistent dry skin (*and dry lips, dry eyes, I somehow dodged the dry hair and nails bullet)*. As I bounce between hyper and hypo states, my skin takes a double beating.

I've never presented as a classic thyroid patient because my situation is not a typical situation so I wasn't given routine bloodwork (*grr*) but I do have extensive family history which drove me to the Internets.

It wasn't until I was browsing (*NOT Dr. Googling, do not do that, you'll drive yourself nuts*) various symptoms of both hyper and hypoT that I realized maybe my dry skin was more than just dry skin.

**Your skin is your largest organ. Pay attention to it. Chances are, it's going to start communicating that something is wrong long before everything else does.**

If you've done all you can, if you're treating your skin right and it's still not improving, if the negative state persists: **GO TO THE DOCTOR.** Dig through your family history and then go. Go to the doctor and get bloodwork done. (*you should be doing this anyway, btw. An ounce of prevention...)*

**PATIENT TO PATIENT ADVOCACY PART:**

If you're afraid you won't be taken seriously because sometimes going in and saying ""I think I have this"" results in doctors being biased against self-diagnosis, this is what I did.

1. I went to the NIH website on both hyperT and hypoT  
2. I printed out lists for both symptoms.
3. I circled my symptoms and how they impact me.
4. I then wrote down a list of all my other diagnoses *(which can all fall under an auto-immune disease).*
5. I went in armed with my family history.
6. I said I'm very concerned, very worried. Something isn't right, this is my list of symptoms, I feel like I'm fighting my own body.

My doctor immediately agreed with me and ordered the tests my research said I needed. 

While there are some very good patient advocacy sites, I chose the NIH because it's a nice, respected resource and you want to be as calm and collected as you can. There are also some patient advocacy sites that are a little too homeopathy leaning for me and I didn't want that anywhere near my paperwork and plea for help.

*[snip: I can no longer link back to the sites, I've learned about their business practices and do not feel comfortable linking them]*



Again, I am not telling you to rush on over to webmed and Dr. Google yourself into an anxiety attack.

**I'm sharing my experience with you in order to help other people who may be in my position be armed with information so that they may advocate for themselves and to pay attention to your skin. It tells you lots of things about your health.**

I worked at TBS 2010-2011 as a Keyholder/Sales Associate, and at Uniprix from 2008-2009 as a Costmetician.  It seems long ago but I'm still really into skincare and makeup, and I remember a substantial part about both of my jobs.

I was well trained at the Body Shop in makeup and their skin care lines especially. I still use a lot of their products today. 

While I worked at the pharmacy, which is a Uniprix in Quebec (like a Shoppers but different owners), I was trained specifically in Cover FX, Nuxe, Orlane, and Biotherm (as in, representatives from those companies came to our store/we went to a head office for them and were trained). Other skin care brands that I sold were: La Roche-Posay, Avene, Lierac, Lise Watier, Roc, Bioderma, Dermaglow, Vichy, Fusion Beauty, Marcelle, Talika, Neostrata. 

We also had makeup by Pupa, as well as anything Covergirl/Maybelline/Revlon etc etc.

For reference, I don't have any formal training as a makeup artist. I'm a student in University.

At night I spread about a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil over my face to remove my makeup, and then clean out my pores with manuka honey again.  

From what I've read, olive oil matches the ph level of facial skin, and helps dissolve the oil in pores without drying out the skin.  Manuka honey contains antibacterial properties which help clean gunk out of the pores.

I'm sure many of you on this subreddit have heard of the oil cleansing method and the honey method, and I just wanted to cast my vote because after 15 years of acne this combination is the ONLY thing that has worked for my skin.

1370986407.0,32,self.SkincareAddiction,1g5g5a,Low-pH Solubility/Ionization of Zinc Oxide in Sunscreen,gyroscopic,35,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1g5g5a/lowph_solubilityionization_of_zinc_oxide_in/,"After the recent discussion in the “skincare no-no” thread, there seems to be some understandable confusion about zinc oxide’s solubility in an acidic environment. I did a little research to clarify this because the topic started to focus on specific ingredients rather than the pH interaction. Also, we should look into what exactly “zinc ionization” actually is.

First, let’s look at the problem of zinc solubility. Ionization sounds like a scary word and it sounds like something you don’t want happening on your skin, especially because it sounds an awful lot like “oxidation” and we know that’s bad. However, zinc ions are actually good for you, and zinc is a great antioxidant on its own:

&gt;Topical zinc, in the form of divalent zinc ions, has been reported to provide antioxidant photoprotection for skin. Two antioxidant mechanisms have been proposed for zinc: zinc ions may replace redox active molecules, such as iron and copper, at critical sites in cell membranes and proteins; alternatively, zinc ions may induce the synthesis of metallothionein, sulfhydryl-rich proteins that protect against free radicals. No matter how they work, topical zinc ions may provide an important and helpful antioxidant defense for skin. ([Source]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12358835))

&gt;Zinc ion facilitates biochemical reactions that mediate the **growth and remodeling of tissue.** […] Zinc is a ubiquitous micronutrient whose activity is so crucial to bodily function that it has been called a master hormone… Zinc ion (Zn2+) forms ligands, from common substances such as sulfur from cysteine, nitrogen from histidine, and oxygen from glutamate, aspartate, and water. Zn2 does not readily oxidize or reduce, and easily undergoes ligand exchange reactions. […] **Another function of zinc not commonly appreciated is its antioxidant activity.** Two known mechanisms for this activity are zinc’s ability to protect sulfhydryl groups and **inhibit the metal ion-induced formation of reactive oxygen species, which are chronically toxic. The antioxidant effects of zinc have been observed in many experimental systems, including human skin fibroblasts that were stressed with either hydrogen peroxide, ultraviolet-A light, or ultraviolet-B light.** Zinc also **decreased the cytotoxicity of these stressors to skin cells**, and increased the viability of unstressed cells. ([Source]( http://www.dermasciences.com/products/advanced-wound-care/dermagran/clinical-data-and-scientific-articles/age-related-differences-in-topical-zinc/))

Both of these studies emphasize the benefits of zinc *ions*, so even if your sunscreen undergoes some ionization, it’s not harming your skin. So why are we concerned about the reaction at all? Because physical SPF ingredients require a particle size large enough to reflect UV rays, and ionized zinc will be too small to perform this task. While zinc ions are a good antioxidant, it’s best to keep our SPF at full strength. Do remember that zinc ions *are not harmful* and you shouldn’t be overly worried about a bit of ionization provided your SPF is still doing its job.

So, now that we feel more comfortable with this chemical reaction, let’s look at zinc’s solubility and what we should consider the pH boundaries. The most stable pH for zinc is 7, and your skin’s pH is probably around 4.5-5.5. Warning, conjecture ahead: since baby skin is slightly more alkaline, it makes sense that zinc is commonly recommended as a baby sunscreen and is probably quite stable on their skin. Anyway, if zinc oxide couldn’t withstand normal skin’s 4.5-5.5 pH environment it would be worthless as an SPF and never would have gained a reputation as a stable and effective sunscreen in the first place. Let’s look at the [zinc ion’s prevalence across a range of pH values]( http://george-eby-research.com/gif/hand1_f1.gif) in a handy chart someone else made and I cannot take credit for. We’re looking at the Zn2+ ion here, which you’ll notice takes a big swing upward around pH 3.5 and lower, but is relatively consistent in the 3.5-6.5 range. Unless your skin is around 3.5 or lower at the moment in which you apply the zinc oxide SPF, you’re not really getting much more ionization than your plain, neutralized skin’s pH.

Now, what could you possibly do to your skin to make it lower than 3.5 pH when you put sunscreen on? The only common low pH things you might be doing in the morning are a vitamin C serum or BHA. If you are using AHA in the morning, you might want to switch it to the evening because of the photosensitizing effect anyway.

Vitamin C serums are generally most effective below 3.5, and you can find some good serum pH discussions [here]( http://www.essentialdayspa.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=33288) and [here]( http://www.skincaretalk.com/t/7335/what-ph-should-the-vitamin-c-serum-be). However, most serums aren’t much lower than 3.0 to avoid irritation and vitamin C’s penetration seems to be effective at any pH under 3.5 so there isn’t much reason for manufacturers to increase the irritation potential for no additional benefit. Remember, the serum + zinc oxide interaction is an effect of the *pH*, not the *vitamin C.* The vitamin C is simply the vehicle through which the low pH is caused, and the ingredient itself isn't important.

Chemical exfoliators are really only effective under 4.0, and at-home peels are closer to 1.9-2.0. A daily AHA *might* be as low as 2.5 (but you aren’t using these during the daytime before sunscreen, right?) and an effective BHA is likely to be around 3.0-3.5. [Paula’s Choice BHA](http://www.paulaschoice.com/shop/skin-care-categories/aha-and-bha-exfoliants/_/Skin-Perfecting-Two-Percent-BHA-Lotion-Exfoliant/) is between 3.2-3.6. Anything much lower would be quite harsh for daily use.

What are you noticing here? The vitamin C serum and the BHA, your two primary daytime low pH products, are just the tiniest bit under the zinc oxide ionization range. Your skin can generally self-neutralize to the normal pH of 4.5-5.5 within about half an hour unless you’ve done something more seriously acidic like a peel. The low pH of a product like a serum or BHA will also be somewhat buffered or neutralized by a higher pH ingredient such as an HA serum or oil. Since I assume you are using a moisturizer of some sort after your actives and giving a bit of time for this stuff to soak in, your skin is quite likely to be around 4.0 at least by the time you’re applying your SPF. Read more great info about skin and product pH and wait times [here]( http://www.essentialdayspa.com/forum/viewthread.php?tid=18360).

So, the main points to remember:

1) Zinc ions are not bad for you and in fact have some nice benefits!

2) The pH of your skin needs to be under 3.5 at the time of SPF application to ionize a substantial amount of zinc oxide.

3) Most low pH products are still quite close to the ionization plateau pH range.

4) If you apply moisturizer and/or leave a few minutes of waiting time, the pH should be self-neutralized anyway.

5) Most sunscreens do not rely on zinc oxide alone for SPF and the other ingredients don’t appear to be affected by pH.

6) Antioxidants are good to use during the day and help mop up some of the inevitable UV damage that will occur even with SPF. Keep using them!

1362797730.0,33,self.SkincareAddiction,19ya1r,PSA: The Environmental Working Group (EWG) is not a reliable source for information about ingredient safety,ieatbugs,42,9,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/19ya1r/psa_the_environmental_working_group_ewg_is_not_a/,"**UPDATE: READ THIS GREAT POST: http://personalcaretruth.com/2010/05/skin-deep-scratching-below-the-surface/ **

The EWG's 'Skin Deep' database is cited quite often as a source for information about ingredient safety. However, what consumers often don't know is how biased and problematic their recommendations are, due to a poor interpretation of data and also bias. They are sort of like the PETA of sunscreens.

Their status as a non profit has been challenged due to the amount of political ties that they have:

http://www.undueinfluence.com/ewg_complaint.htm

http://www.forbes.com/sites/henrymiller/2011/09/28/cleaning-up-the-ewgs-dirty-dozen/

"" a study published in April in the Journal of Toxicology by Dr. Carl Winter and Josh Katz of UC-Davis showed that 90% of the cases “exposed” in EWG’s 2010 list involved levels of pesticides 1,000 times lower than the chronic reference dose (the level of daily exposure likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime of chronic exposure). Winter and Katz concluded, “The potential consumer risks from exposure to the most frequently detected pesticides on the ‘Dirty Dozen’ list of foods are negligible and cast doubts as to how consumers avoiding conventional forms of such produce items are improving their health status.”""

http://www.realclearscience.com/2012/06/22/food_safety_science_vs_green_agenda_247623.html


Some additional info from Gingerrama on MUA, whose points I agree with wholeheartedly:

* Some of their raw data is useful; but it's unreliable--I always double-check ingredient lists posted there, and on a rough straw poll that works out as 50% are inaccurate compared to the actual product IRL: usually cos EWG info is out of date.

* Information is frequently misread, misinterpreted, and misrepresented. Worse: the (mis)reader's (mis)interpretation plus additional value judgements are presented as being on the same level as factual data--rather than analysis/synthesis/other extra stuff. (This would include a confusion of ""data"" with ""information"" and vice versa.)

* Gross misuse and abuse of the terms ""toxic"" and ""chemical.""

* Rhetorical bullying of readers to instil trust. Worse: not trust through facts + persuasion, but a demand for belief. (That whole ""if you're not with us you're against us"" kind of rhetoric.)

* All the above leading to fear-mongering, distrust of other information sources, and the active pursuit and celebration of scientific ignorance as a virtue.

* Prejudice: nationalist (weak coverage of non-American brands). Against big business--and big labs. For small business: which may be ethically and politically laudable but that's irrelevant to product performance and safety).

Over the past month or two my face has developed these weird bumps around it.  They aren't getting worse, but they aren't getting better either. I'm a bit baffled as I have always had great skin (never had acne as a teen, etc). The bumps don't itch, but I absolutely am freaking out about how they look.

I've been using Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant and Shiseido white lucent cleansing foam for about a year now with no problems. I tried uzing Aztec Healing Clay (3 applications) which made my bumps a bit more red.  I know the container says that the first couple uses will make it worse before it gets better, but I'm very hesitant about continuing use since I've always had sensitive skin.  I've since bought the Origins Charcoal mask and used it for the first time last night, and haven't really seen any results yet.

Has anyone else had this problem?  I haven't been applying anything new to my face to trigger this.  The only possible thing is I used to drink TONS more water and sweat a lot from hitting the gym.  I haven't been to the gym in a while and my water intake is now moderate.  Oh, and I have been taking Women's multivitamins about 2 months ago, not sure if that would have anything to do with it. I should add I haven't taken my vitamins in a couple of days.

Any advice would be appreciated!! This is driving me nuts :(

I'm 24, and I have been battling acne for over a decade, covering it up with makeup, experiencing more breakouts, more makeup... etc. I finally ditched the skin makeup and after 3 weeks, I stopped breaking out so much. (I later switched to an Asian BB cream and only use it on my eyes/under my nose, and this seems to not cause breakouts.)

I had lots of redness leftover and fading acne under my skin. For a week, I added Coconut Milk to my protein shake every morning. I was literally in awe of how great my skin looked, redness gone, pores seemed less noticeable (I have sebaceous filaments), mega hydrated, and it literally looked like I was wearing makeup without actually wearing makeup.

After a week, I stopped the Coconut Milk routine, and my face eventually went back to dry/dull/redness in some areas/and just bleh. A month later, I started drinking Coconut Milk again (the only thing I changed in my diet/routine), and my face is back to wow.

I thought I would share my findings, and maybe get a discussion going. Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this?

I recently turned 28 and am very lucky to not have any wrinkles yet.  A friend from high school who is the same age as me recently visited, and I was shocked at how much older than me she looked.  That's when I realized that I am aging very well, and I want to keep it that way!  I am looking for advice on sunscreen.  I read the faq and did some key word searches within this subreddit but I""m still a bit confused.

Here is my current skin routine, if it helps.  I wash my face in the morning and at night with Spectro Jel (very similar to Cetaphil).  Then I moisturize with organic, extra virgin coconut oil.   If I get a blemish I use Spectro Jel's spot remover cream.  As far as I know, I have average skin - not to dry, not too oily.  My skin is fair and pale and burns pretty easily.

I am looking for a sunscreen for my face and neck that:
1. won't make my skin oily or dry.  2.  will protect against both UVA and UVB (I want to prevent skin cancer AND aging), 3.  does well under makeup. 4. whatever else that all of you experts may think is important.

Bonus points if the sunscreen doesn't do that thing where it makes your face look white in pictures, and if it has a makeup primer built into it as well.

Also: I am looking for a sunscreen to use on the rest of my body that does not have much of a smell and isn't greasy.

Other general questions:  what do I do if my facial sunscreen doesnt have makeup primer in it?  Is it better to just look for one that does well under makeup?  Moisturizer, then primer, then sunscreen seems like a lot of layers to put on yoru skin.

How do I know if my sunscreen interacts with my makeup?  Apparently, avobenzone and octinoxate interact with each other - are those things only in sunscreen or also in makeup?

Also, sometimes I get a bit of acne on my chest and back after working out - what is a good way to remedy this?

What's a good way to wash the makeup off my eyes without pulling and rubbing at them so much? 

I work in an office:  How often should I apply facial sunscreen per day?  How do I know if my sunglasses protect my eyes properly?  

Are there any other supplements I should take for my skin?

What is the best way to treat a popped blemish?

My skin no longer regularly breaks out, but whenever I do, I compulsively touch the irritated spots (they tend to be deep down and itchy).  I had a small blemish that really was sore towards the end of last week that I extracted last night because it got progressively worse as I idly touched/scratched at it.  I figured it'd be best to extract, so I did so using a lancet and treated it afterwards with neosporin.

I was reading online recently that alternative methods to treating a popped blemish are:
-aloe vera
-hydrogen peroxide
-warm salt water
...which seem to me to do different things.

Aloe vera and Neosporin heal the skin, while Hydrogen Peroxide and salt water encourage healing by drying up the skin and removing bacteria.

Which methods have worked for you?

I'm actually getting a lot better at not touching spots, but I was stressed out and wanted to try to remove it before a big interview this upcoming weekend.  Bah.

I've never tried to directly fix this problem. I honestly don't care too much about having acne scars, but they are still red and depending on my condition will inflame. Worst than this, sometimes (on the scars near my eyebrows on my forehead) there will be a few red bumps that appear, they don't seem to be pimples exactly. 

So my questions:

I want to start a regimen to stick to. Since I am a guy, is there something I should be doing differently? Do all the FAQ's on the side still apply to men as well as women?


And I will probably find this out soon enough, but what exactly can I do to stop getting pimples. How can I take care of my oily skin without breaking out. And last but not least, how do I get rid of all my blemishes, the red spots, the little random zit-like bumps that I get, the discolored acne spot from two semesters ago? Eventually I'd like to (probably through laser treatment), take care of my deep pitted scars, and the scars on my cheeks.

My original routine consisted of using multiple scrubs daily along with a Neutrogena Wave at night, after my twice-daily St. Ives apricot scrub and Clean &amp; Clear Deep Exfoliation Scrub routine (Yikes, I know!) Amoung those products, I also used multiple Therapy Systems products, and I would put rubbing alcohol on any zits I had using a Q-Tip! Today, as per the advice and recommenations I've heard in this sub, I use CeraVe hydrating cleanser. That's it! I use Neutrogena Pore Refining Cleanser and a St. Ives Exfoliating Pad on any breakouts I may have, and I use sunflower or castor oil when my skin is dry. Other than that, I've learned keeping it basic really does do wonders for your skin.

My Mom was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer last year and had to undergo a bilateral total mastectomy w/ underarm lymph node removal followed by fairly aggressive chemotherapy. Since then she seems to be in the clear (yay!) but she has developed fairly pronounced bags under her eyes and a redness to her upper cheeks that she is unhappy about. Overall, her skin tone is still great and she has almost no noticeable wrinkles even at the age of 58 but she does complain about wrinkles which **I** can't see. Before the chemo people thought she was in her early 40's.

Since it's almost Mother's Day here in the US I wanted to surprise her with a ""Skin Care"" basket and was wondering what you guys would suggest to put in it to help her with her ""problem"" areas. Her skin is normal to dry and very very sensitive now as a result from the chemo.

Here is a picture of her with one of her wigs from when she was still in treatment: [Click for picture!](http://i.imgur.com/RtPonaa.jpg)

I was thinking of giving her:

1. [La Roche-Posay Redermic C Anti-Aging Fill-in Care for Norm/Combination Skin,1.35-Ounce](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038COKQ2/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=A2IFYO67NXY9T6) - This I would have her use as a day-time moisturizer under her makeup.

1. [St. Ives Exfoliating Pads](http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=391636&amp;catid=182914&amp;aid=338666&amp;aparam=goobase_filler&amp;device=c&amp;network=g&amp;matchtype=) - A light and gentle AHA exfoliator that I think would work on her sensitive skin for night-time use after cleansing.

1. Cleanser: Not too sure about this. I want to give her something luxurious. Was thinking the [Boscia Soothing Cleansing Cream](http://www.sephora.com/soothing-cleansing-cream-P61203?skuId=1227875) would be nice.

1. Night Time Moisturizer: I'm stuck! Thinking straight [Argan Oil from GoW](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/3777591.htm). 

1. Eye-cream for the puffiness: NO IDEA! 

My Mom is a former hippie so a huge skincare routine is going to be a big turn-off for her. The best I can do is a cleanser/AHA pads/moisturizer/eye cream. **I really want to concentrate on the eye cream as the bags under her eyes are what make her the most self-conscious so suggestion for that would be the most helpful**. The redness I can handle as it's a by-product of the chemo and I have rosacea so I think I'm going to plop my secret weapon of Korean BB Cream in her package ;)

Any help?

1366335036.0,28,self.SkincareAddiction,1cndus,[UPDATE] I had my laser hair removal consultations and asked lots of skin questions!,spunky-omelette,32,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1cndus/update_i_had_my_laser_hair_removal_consultations/,"I promised an update, so I'll put this together now while it's still fresh in my mind.

I went to two places for consultations today.  Both places used CynoSure lasers, and both places gave me forms to fill out looking for medical details (something I was looking out for).

The first place was owned and run by one woman who was a technician with 20+ years experience.  The second place had a team of estheticians and the owner a 40-year practicing doctor.

Lots of points people brought up here were so helpful!  One thing in particular I was concerned about was hyperpigmentation--with the summer up ahead, I'm concerned if it might have an effect on laser hair removal.  I'm very pale, but I also rarely go into the sun, and when I do I slather on zinc oxide sunscreen.  Both clinics told me that so long as I am very diligent about sunscreen (the second clinic said physical blockers are the way to go), I should not have any problems with sun and the treatment.

I was also told by both clinics that since my PCOS is under control (I am actively treating it with the pill and it's actually in *awesome* shape now that my diet and exercise routine are in order), I should have good results.  Neither place made any lofty claims about ""absolute"" hair removal and emphasized that it's about reduction, not wiping off every single hair.  They also mentioned that many clients with PCOS come in for touchups (the second clinic has in writing that you can come back whenever you want for a $30-$50 touchup depending on the area's size, forever).  

Also, because my hair is dark and my skin is light, I would also most likely have very good results.  The other details, such as prep (shaving before treatment and gently exfoliating a while afterwards, etc) were all brought up.  I felt so prepared!  Even the scar I have on my arm was acknowledged, and I was told that the lasers should have no effect on it.

The first clinic quoted me a lower price for full arms (she initially told me $200/session on the phone, then when I came in she said I missed a special for $150/session that just ended, and she'd let me have it).  They did not put a price tag on touchups, just that they're ""discounted.""  The second clinic had a full breakdown of all the prices ($225/session or $1125 for six sessions) and clearly defined touchup prices.

I think if I do go with this, I am leaning towards the second clinic.  The staff has excellent credentials, their lasers were newer, they had more training and their practice was obviously doing very well.  They were very clear and upfront with their prices and processes.  I also liked that they had registered estheticians as part of their team as well.

I know this isn't the kind of stuff we post about here too much, but I really want to make sure I make a good decision for my skin! I'm strongly considering pursuing this.

I have PCOS and subsequently hirsutism, which makes life as a ghostly-pale-with-dark-Irish-hair girl frustrating.  I have dark, fluffy hair all along my arms, more than many guys I've met and was nicknamed ""Gorilla"" growing up.  It totally crushed me, etc, etc, here's my sob story, whatever.

Now that I'm older and have a ""grown up"" job, even though I am paying off student loans, the idea of laser hair removal for my arms has been this shining dream off in the distance I've wanted for a long time, and I'd like to pursue it.  I've bleached the hair on my arms in the past (which was an awful, awful decision)--but for that one week where everything seemed invisible I was so confident and happy, even though it was really bad for the skin on my arms.

Anyways, I want to make sure I'm prepared and able to ask the right questions.  I don't want to do anything that could wreak havoc on my arms and the skin!!  I know we focus a lot on facial skin, but the rest of your body is important too.

After reading many a review online and here about HA serums I decided that I needed to try one. This, the Aquamoist, GOW, Estee Lauder and Shisedo Eudermine lotions all came out as the top choices. But I was in [my local Asian grocery emporium](http://www.uwajimaya.com/) the other day and they had a great selection of skin care, they carried both the Aquamoist and the Hado Labo. Since the Aquamoist has vitamin C and I already have a VitC serum I decided to get the Hado Labo. 

Price: Midrange, $20 for the 170mL bottle. 

Packaging; Nothing fancy. Just a plastic squeeze bottle with a flip cap.

Texture: Feels like lube. Lol, seriously though, it's thin and *really* slippery. No fragrance which is a huge plus for me. 

Application: It spreads really easily. A few drops is really all you need to cover your face/neck/chest. This bottle is going to last a really long time. 

EDIT:

This is sold as a ""lotion"" but I definitely put a moisturizer on top of it. I don't think that it would work well alone. Me thinks the Japanese have a different definition of the word lotion than English speakers. Or maybe that's just the best translation. But definitely use this WITH a moisturizer. This + CeraVe cream = heaven. 

I've been using it for about a week and I absolutely adore the results. It doesn't sting my sensitive skin at all. My skin is supple, plump and firm looking. I *finally* don't have any more flaking or peeling (from retin-a).  Even my acne is looking better. I've gone 2 days without any new eruptions which is huge for me. I feel like this is really soothing and hydrating and that my skin breaks out due to dryness and dehydration. If you have sensitive, dehydrated, acne-prone skin then I definitely recommend this product. 

A+ would buy again.

It's listed as $12.90 on their website.

**Ingredients:** Distilled water, Peppermint Hydrosol, Aloe Juice, Witch Hazel Hydrosol, Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, Cactus Extract, Calendula Extract, Sodium PCA, Hyaluronic Acid.

I chose this product for an AHA wipe because it contains a blend of glycolic and lactic acid, with a pH in the ""useful"" range (they also offer wipes with a pH of 1.9..yikes!), and a minimum of other additives.  I was hesitant about the peppermint hydrosol, aloe juice, cactus extract and candelula extract, but it didn't seem to cause me any trouble (nor does it smell pepperminty).  

**Packaging and product description:**  The product comes in a wide-mouth, dark blue plastic jar with a black screw-on lid.  There are cotton rounds within that are saturated in the liquid, which is watery - there's a fair bit of excess liquid sloshing around in the bottom, so that's good!  The smell is a little funny - kind of pungent?, but I think it's the witch hazel.  It dissipates within a minute or two.  

**Application experience:**  Upon application, I don't feel anything, but after a few minutes I experience a tingling/warming sensation that subsides after a couple of minutes (I believe that's the self-neutralization of the acid).  I tend to apply moisturizer if the tingle gets too annoying, which stops it.

**Application frequency:** I find that it works best to apply this every other night.  I tried using it every night but it was too much - the ""tingling"" got more uncomfortable every evening, so I cut back.

**Results:** I have found that this product works really nicely for my skin to remove dullness and even up my skintone.  I am fairly pale and had only minor differences in skin tone (slightly darker where the skin is thicker, like around the mouth, and hyperpigmentation from healed acne).  I don't have very much acne at all, but I do have sebaceous filaments on my nose and chin, and forehead pores, that I aim to minimize.  This has definitely helped make my skin more uniform in tone and look ""fresher""; it has (combined with my SA wipes) made my pores and SF appear smaller and less obvious.  My skin texture is also smoother to the touch.  I think the best test is that I actually look nice under fluorescent lighting in the industrial bathrooms at work now!

1372894509.0,27,self.SkincareAddiction,1hlmwh,So... just a friendly piece of information that I think may help many of you with constant dry and peeling lips!!!,angryspring,31,4,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1hlmwh/so_just_a_friendly_piece_of_information_that_i/,"I actually saw a post like a few days ago and commented in it. It was a user who had constantly peeling lips. I was surprised, because I had the same problem (although mine was worse than what was described) and I noticed other users had similar problems too!! 

For those of you with constantly dry and peeling lips, you may have a form of **chellitis.** If your lips burn, itch, and are constantly peeling, that is not just being chapped. Your lips are most likely actually inflamed. I've noticed two common types of chellitis- exfoliative chellitis and angular chellitis. (I only have information on these two and not the other forms!) Exfoliative is when your lips constantly peel-- and I mean really consistently. Angular chellitis is the same deal, except it only affects the corners of the mouth and not the whole lip area. I had... both.

See, my lips were a little on the dry side but they weren't terrible. That all changed when ~~the fire nation attacked~~ I tried this one lipstick and well, I guess I had a pretty bad allergic reaction to it because my lips were not cute... They were peeling every fucking hour- the new skin that would come develop would peel right off. They burned. They itched. It was not only painful but so fucking embarrassing. I go to school-- and if I didn't apply something, they would begin to crack and peel. I would smile and feel my lips split. It was awful. 

Here's the thing- while I notice many people recommend vaseline in this sub, it may actually not be good for people with chellitis. Here's why- vaseline doesn't moisturize. It forms a pretty thick barrier over the skin. If your lips aren't moisturized at all, and you're forming a barrier over them, that can actually prevent them from getting moisture. In some cases it can actually wick away moisture. I think vaseline is okay to use when you have normal lips, maybe even lips on the slight drier side. It's okay for chapped lips but I don't think it's very good for chellitis.

I would apply vaseline religiously but while it provided temporary relief, it didn't do shit for me in the long run. I would be soothed for an hour and then THE PEELING... 

I switched to aquaphor- which still has petreoleum, but less. And it uses lanolin; it was a pretty big improvement, but my lips were still pretty fucking thirsty. They stopped peeling mostly but the tightness didn't go away. I started using a sulfate free toothpaste; that improved them a little more... but still, they weren't back to being what they used to be.

I did a lot of research and I read that many others with chellitis hadn't benefited from vaseline either! So it wasn't just me. Many people said that the vaseline had actually worsened their condition over time, and when they made a complete switch to petroleum free products, it worked extremely well. So that's why I did. I recently got some pure lanolin (a heavy duty moisturizer) and I got this red eos lip balm. Both were completely petroleum free. I also switched to a sulfate free toothpaste. 

OMG. My lips don't feel tight anymore. They are doing so much better you guys; they don't peel at all, they can go like half a day without any touchups (and this is even when the lipbalm and lanolin have worn off after eating and drinking). I think I might be able to start wearing lipstick again!!!

So please try this :) I'm not saying vaseline is bad, but for those with chellitis, or extremely cracked and peeling lips, give this a go, okay?

Oh and you don't have to necessarily have to use a red eos lipbalm but I highly recommend the lanolin. Well I recommend both, but if you know a different, vaseline free lipbalm, use it! Also understand that there are plenty of rich moisturizers that don't have petroleum. This definitely worked for me though.

**tl;dr vaseline can/may be bad for those with exfoliative/angular chellitis which is constantly dry and peeling lips. If you have this problem, use a sulfate free toothpaste and stop using vaseline or products with vaseline completely. I reccommend pure lanolin and a petroleum free lipbalm edit: chellitis can also be caused by yeast in the mouth. So while this routine may help you, it will not solve the problem like it did for me!**

It's a face and body cleanser, not actually a cold cream texture,  it's a milky colored liquid (less thick than Cerave Hydrating, same color).  

I've yet to test the pH, but I think it's prob in the 4.5-5 range (as with their other products). 

It *DOES* contain a fragrance, so keep it away from your face if you're sensitive to fragrance. The scent is strong, which surprised me, but it's very very pleasant.  I swear it smells like something you'd use on a baby, like crisp but powdery and fresh?  Clean laundry maybe?


It foams up a bit, nothing significant.  Leaves a nice fresh scent on the body that lingers.  It doesn't leave my face feeling tight and dry, but rather quite clean.    


For around $22, you get a pretty big bottle, and 1.5 pumps is good for my whole body (I'm 5'1).  I need less than half a pump for my face and neck. 


Overall, stuff is great, I highly recommend it as a body wash for those who don't mind a fragrance. I rec it for  face-wash if you don't mind strongly scented products.

1365893863.0,28,self.SkincareAddiction,1camee,First impressions: Elta MD UV Clear SPF 46 Sunscreen,niccig,31,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1camee/first_impressions_elta_md_uv_clear_spf_46/,"By request, here's my 'first impressions' review of EltaMD Clear :-) I ordered it from Amazon on Monday, it arrived on Tuesday afternoon (though UPS delivered it to my next door neighbors, grrr) and I've been wearing it daily since then.

First off some facts:

Available from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Eltamd-Clear-SPF-48-Gram-1-7/dp/B002MSN3QQ) for $20.20 and Prime-eligible. 

Active ingredients: Zinc Oxide (9.0%), Octinoxate (7.5%)

Inactive ingredients: Purified Water, Cyclomethicone, Niacinamide, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer, Polyisobutene, PEG-7 Trimethylolpropane Coconut Ether, Sodium Hyaluronate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lactic Acid, Oleth-3 Phosphate, Phenoxyethanol, Butylene Glycol, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Triethoxycaprylylsilane

I've heard good things about this and haven't found a facial sunscreen that I liked much yet, so I decided to give it a try. 

First off, I sort of expected it to actually be clear, which in retrospect is sort of silly I guess. It most definitely comes out of the bottle white. One pump is not quite 1/4tsp - around 1 &amp; 1/3 pumps is, if you're actually measuring (I did). As always, it seems like a *lot* of sunscreen. Aside from that, the packaging is really nice. It has an airless pump, the bottle is nice and compact, and the lid snaps on tightly.

The texture is sort of like a light moisturizer. It definitely is white when you first put it on, and it takes pretty thorough rubbing in to get to the 'clear' claim. However, since it isn't super thick, rubbing it in until it clears out isn't uncomfortable at all. Once it's all rubbed in, it doesn't feel greasy or dry; just feels like skin. It does leave a tiny bit of shine at first, which seems to go away after a few minutes. One thing worth noting - one day (Thursday, maybe?) I didn't really spend enough time rubbing it in, and it balled up a bit/looked white in places when I went to put on my makeup. Just fyi.

As far as makeup goes, it doesn't seem to affect mine at all. I used my regular moisturizer (FAB Ultra Repair Cream), primer (Hourglass Veil), and a couple different foundations (Clinique Even Better Makeup and Kevyn Aucoin SSE). As far as I can tell, the wear time on everything was normal, and it didn't make my skin any oilier or drier than usual. Wearing it without makeup is sort of a non-event (as it should be) - there's really no indication that it's there once it's rubbed in well. 

I generally don't have very sensitive skin, but fortunately (from a scientific testing standpoint) when I first used this, my nose and upper lip were incredibly raw due to a massive sinus infection and constantly blowing my nose. Even CeraVe Hydrating and my FAB cream were burning a little, which they usually don't. The sunscreen, however, didn't sting even a tiny bit. Based on that, I'd be pretty comfortable recommending it for sensitive-skinned folks, as long as you don't have known problems with chemical sunscreens. I haven't noticed any increased pore clogginess or anything like that either, though of course I'll update if that changes. 

I haven't had a chance yet to give it a full test as far as actual sun protection. I did walk to lunch a couple of days (around 30 min round trip in the sun each time) and didn't notice any change in my nose freckles, which is usually how I gauge these things. I'm hoping tomorrow I'll be able to go for a run if I'm feeling better, in which case I'll wear it and give an update as far as protection and sweat performance.

Another thing that I liked about this particular sunscreen is that it contains niacinamide, which is helpful in fading hyperpigmentation. It's third on the list of inactive ingredients (the Amazon description says it's 5%), and most of the studies I came across regarding niacinamide used 4-5% concentrations. That makes me feel at least sort of confident that it might be somewhat effective; in any case, I'll take whatever help I can get in that arena, since I have type III skin and acne really did a number on it. If it's not effective, then at least it's a good product otherwise, and still worth the price.

Overall, so far I'm liking it a lot and will continue using it as long as my skin doesn't take any bizarre turns for the worse. 

**Edit to update:**

I tried this out on a long run to test its sun-protecting abilities - after all, that's the most important part, right? I applied 20 minutes before I left, and was out in full sun for just over 90 minutes. Please note that this sunscreen doesn't claim to be water resistent or sweatproof - in fact, the usage instructions even say to use a waterproof sunscreen if you'll be sweating or swimming. But I thought running would make a good test for it anyway.

Even though I was sweating like a lunatic, it didn't sting or run into my eyes. When I got back home, it didn't look white or greasy or gross (well, not more gross than I would have looked anyway). I didn't reapply while I was out, and I didn't get any tan lines around my sunglasses. I *did* get a slight tan line along my shirt in a spot that I missed (used Coppertone Sport for my body, btw), so I'm pretty confident in EltaMD's sun protection.",,False,self,t5_2tbbg,1366582160.0,,,True,t3_1camee,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1camee/first_impressions_elta_md_uv_clear_spf_46/,
1365705685.0,26,self.SkincareAddiction,1c5grz,Review of many self tanners I've used and some application tips.,yvva,35,9,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1c5grz/review_of_many_self_tanners_ive_used_and_some/,"*Please note this is from my personal experience with these products. YMMV*

I have a [Fitzpatrick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzpatrick_scale) Skin Type III. I'm warm toned and half Lebanese.  I have a natural tan at about a MAC NC40 and without being in the sun I'm around a MAC NC23-25.

Many self tanners give me hives, so I address which gave them in this review.  I have some kind of sensitivity to something that is in most tanners, not sure if it is the tanning ingredient itself, since not all tanners do this.


All of the following I mention will stain sheets, unless otherwise mentioned, so either use dark sheets, hang out in sweatpants all day, or use sheets you don't care about. 


*Application tips*

For the best application of mousses I highly recommend using a mitt. Makes a massive difference. The mitt is also good for after you spray the aerosol cans on the body to blend into skin better. I like st tropez, xen tan, and sun labs, but they each provide something unique. 


*For getting hands and feet*:

I find that using the leftover on the mitt gently rubbed on the hands and feet works out really well.  (I'll apply a dab of lotion at the end to the tops of my feet if I didn't use a mousse/aerosol spray. 


Or for hands only,  after I've done everything else (including feet) and I soaped my hands, I'll take a teeny bit of one of the lotions I have and apply a bit to the backs of hands and rub the backs together to blend.

*Pre-tanning tips*: 


1. Exfoliate in the shower using something non-oil based and shave legs ( if applicable).

2. Do *not* apply lotions or anything oil based after you get out of the shower.  I learned the ""no lotion"" thing from a girl who ran one of my favorite spray tanning places--after I listened to her advice, I never had a streaky spray tan.   I instead would use Mystic Tan's pre-tanning gel--it helps to neutralize any self tanning smell and sinks right into skin.  The bottle lasts a LONG time, you don't need much to cover the body.



**TANNER REVIEWS**

**Fake Bake, Original lotion**: Gave me slight hives, nothing bad. Need to wear latex gloves. Somewhat easy to streak so not good for a first timer. Strong tanning smell once the fragrance wears off. Gives an intense color, definitely leaning more towards the orangey side, so I wouldn't recommend this if you are very fair. Better to use if you already have darker coloring or a tan.


**Xen Tan, Luxe Line**: By far the BEST smelling. Like cookies and cake. Pretty similar to the color St. Tropez products give, definitely on the warmer side, but not orangey like Fake Bake. Need to wear latex gloves for these as well or have Boraxo handy ( Found this gets the tanner off hands like a gem. SO uses it to clean his hands from work) 

The **Luxe dark lotion** is very very thick with a weird green tinge ( like St. Tropez as well). Tends to be a bit streaky around knees and elbows. I find the Dark lotion is best for face, neck, torso, butt. On the legs It's a PITA to blend because it's not especially emollient, but I've mixed with a bit of moisturizer to help spread it and it never affected the color.

The *Weekly Dark Luxe lotion* and the *mousse* ( can't remember if it's a weekly mousse) are great. I'll lump them together. They give the same color. Buildable for sure and the lotion is quite moisturizing. I sometimes mix a teeny bit of the Dark regular lotion with the weekly lotion to adjust the texture.


**St. Tropez**: Pefumey scent, kind of sickening but it doesn't last too long. Stronger tanner scent than xen tan after the perfume wears off, but not as bad as fake bake. It's a warm toned color, leaning golden. More golden than Xen Tan by a TEENIE bit but not remotely like fake bake.

The *Original Lotion* is top notch. It delivers a strong initial color but much of it washes off in the shower. I found this to be basically foolproof in terms of any streaking. If you use it every night for a few days you end up looking like you spent the week in the sun. It gives me the same color I would if I were at the beach. Easily mixes with regular lotion.

The *aerosol can* I like because it's easy to do the back and face and I don't need to touch it. The *mousse* is good for legs and arms when used with a mitt because it takes no time at all to apply. I decided to stop using the Everyday because it takes too long to deliver color and the color is definitely more yellow.


**Sun labs, Aerosol**: Love this, good smell, barely any tanner smell when the scent disappears. I use this for my face &amp; arms ( mostly), torso, and back. This is a very different color, unlike the others. It's red based, so you end up reddish bronze vs orange bronze, if that makes sense. This will streak pretty easily if you don't blend it immediately. Again, the mitt is awesome. You need to tanner proof everything around you when you use this because it goes everywhere. I generally do it in the bathroom and line everything with old towels. 




**Other**:  I've quickly test patched and broke out in hives so I can't make any comments about the color: BareMinerals &amp; TooFaced


**Drug Store brands** These won't do anything to sheets from my experience  


1. *Jergens*   Leaves a strong self tan smell, slightly orange based, gave me slight hives. The lotions don't really sink in so they can easily be sweat off from my experience.

2. *Banana Boat*: The one with the clicking dial. I found this kind of a pain to apply, the initial scent was OK, I found this veryyyy easy to streak and I'm a self tan vet. I also think it was quite orange tinted, even for me.

3. *Loreal Sublime, gel*: This may be the worst stuff I have ever used. I don't know if it was only the gel kind, but it pretty much turned me into a neon orange oompa loompa. I got minor hives from it on my legs, but nothing significant. There was a small self tanner smell after the fragrance disappeared. 

4. *Olay everyday lotion*: This was decent, not too orange, better than the Jergens. Initial smell is like bananas, it leaves a bit of a shimmer too. It sweats off easily like the Jergens did, and I got minor hives on the backs of my thighs. I wouldn't use this if you have pale skin or if you're cool toned. You'll likely end up tinted an odd color. It gives a nice boost if you already have some color to your skin.  To note: This is my review from when it first came out a few years ago so I don't know if they've changed the formula.


5. *Netrogena Build a Tan*: I actually used this for awhile before I switched to the higher end brands. It has light citrus scent, nothing too orange but definitely warm toned, it does have the self tanner smell once the fragrance fades.  It really is a true tan building product. I don't recall getting hives from this. I think out of the drugstore options I've tried, I'd say this was one of the better ones.

My face started to get worse during a camping trip over the 4th of July weekend, I just thought it was because my pores were getting really clogged from all the dirt and debris, despite still washing my face and showering at least once a day. However it continued to stay like that, and then I found this subreddit. I began the Beginner's Skincare Routine on the 9th. Currently I wash my face with the Cerave foaming cleanser when I wake up, either in the shower or sink, wait a little while, apply the Stridex red box pads, wait for it to dry, and then apply the Cerave moisturizer in a tub. I work out every day, so usually after I come home from working out, I will shower and wash my face, and once I get out and my face dries, I apply moisturizer. I was prescribed Differin about a year or so ago and I have been using that since, and have continued using it, I normally apply it right before I go to bed, so usually a few hours after cleansing and moisturizing after I workout. Since camping I have been waking up every morning with whiteheads all over my common breakout areas. The number and size of them has slowly been decreasing since starting this regimen, but I'm not sure if there is anything else I can or should do. I really hate waking up every morning to all these whiteheads and my face just looking like a mess.

I have been lurking on this subreddit for quite some time and y'all convinced me to buy the Aztec healing clay. (I follow the directions and use it with ACV).

I'm in the middle of a horrible breakout (from who knows what, probably hormones and stress) and decided to bust out the clay and give it a shot. 

I used it a couple of times last week and kept it on for like 20 minutes. I know some people say it can be too harsh, but it didn't seem to cause any dryness or redness for me. It actually seems to help with the slight (weird) itchiness I'm having and my skin seems soft after.

My question is, what type of results should I be seeing exactly? I know this is supposed to suck out all the gunk basically, but will that cause new pimples? or does that just apply to pimples that have already formed? Should this cause my acne to come to a head quicker? or become less red? or flatten out a bit? or all of the above? 

I remember someone said they put it on twice in a row and the first time it brings the gunk more towards the surface, and then the second time it basically dries the pimples up. Is that normal?

I know results will be different for everyone, but I guess I'm just trying to figure out if it's working how it should be.  Thanks!",,False,self,t5_2tbbg,False,,,True,t3_1illqa,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1illqa/results_from_aztec_healing_clay/,

* Iwostin Sensitia Hypoallergenic Cleansing Gel
* Iwostin Hydratia Physiological cream with ceramides
* Iwostin Solecrin Waterproof protective emulsion SPF 30
* Stridex pads in the evening after Cleansing gel, but before the physiological cream

Iwostin is a Polish brand of dermatological skincare products that is like a slightly cheaper version of Avene.

I think I was not only purging from starting Stridex, but my previous moisturizers were making me break out. Right now I have NO NEW pimples. 3 days of a new routine with new products and I no longer have any new pimples forming. Now i just need to survive the slight hyperpigmentation from the ones I had. But seriously, the moment I switched to new products, my skin stopped forming new pimples and withing three days healed all of the ones I had.

The clogged pores I was worried in my previous post are almost gone. My skin doesn't look at oily. The Hydratia cream is made specially for dehydrated skin and it was amazing for me. My skin has no problem with making oil to keep in moisture, it was the having moisture in the first place that my skin had an issue with. The cream is simply amazing, it's not oily at all, if soaks in super fast and leaves skin velvetty and matte. I can't feel anything at all on my skin once I apply the cream. I tried adding ridiculous amounts of it one evening to see just how much can my skin absorb. I had to throw in the towel because it seemed no matter how much I was putting one, everything would get absorbed.

I really wanted to thank the SCA subreddit. Despite thinking I already knew more than enough about skincare, you proved to be a very valuable resource in attaining better skin health.

And other newbie questions on my routine and a bunch of products.,kittydorkdork,35,6,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1fgika/why_are_hot_showersbaths_so_bad_and_other_newbie/,"One of the very few pleasures I have in life are hot showers and baths. Tonight I found some info through the sidebar saying they need to be avoided. I think I also saw some mentions of it in a thread or two around here. But... WHY IS IT BAD and should I REALLY stop doing it? :(

So on to other questions, but first some background: I just turned 32 and I'm just getting into makeup and taking care of my skin. I think I have fairly normalish skin. Rarely have I ever had a pimple. I have redness on and around my nose but it doesn't seem to come with any weird texture or anything, it's just red. I never actually wash my face because every time I do it rivals the nastiest of oil spills. Birds should keep away from me, that's how nasty and suffocating it feels. Since I've gotten into makeup I've been scrubbing it off in the shower/bath with [these](http://www.amazon.com/Kushies-Pack-Wash-Cloth-White/dp/B000BUTC8U/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=12DQVAB1VK6F0&amp;coliid=IB2HXCQKG6QEF), with no soap, and that seems to work fine. So I guess that's my skin background for ya.

And a note on financial stuff: I recently started making my own money for the first time in YEARS so I'm spoiling myself with some of this, or the idea of some of this. Yes I can make my own lip scrub, but I wanted to treat myself.

**For Face, usually night time, after bath/shower**: I use a smidge of Jojoba oil. Should I mix in [argan](http://www.amazon.com/Argan-Oil-100-Pure-oz/dp/B007KNAA2S/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=12DQVAB1VK6F0&amp;coliid=I10VOSUANVBUV2) or [coconut](http://www.amazon.com/Kelapo-Extra-Virgin-Coconut-15-Ounce/dp/B005VRNBA8/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=12DQVAB1VK6F0&amp;coliid=I35GHEV9368Z76) as well or would it not matter?

For lips: [This lip balm](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JJ2DO6/ref=oh_details_o01_s01_i01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) all the time. [This lip scrub](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KZ6710/ref=oh_details_o01_s02_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) every other day or so. I'm beyond exctatic with this combo. My lips were peeling and uncomfortable until the very day I started using these. If I miss out on using them for too long, they try to start peeling again. MIRACLES, people! Miracles are happenin' all over my lips!

Usually just for hands and feet a couple times a week: I had a [sample bottle of this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OYJ9AO/ref=oh_details_o03_s01_i01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) years ago and it was awesome and I cherished the shit out of it. Bought a big bottle of it and it's not quite as good as I remember it but it's not bad. Thoughts?

[If it counts at all, I use this for body soap](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00120U56G/ref=oh_details_o03_s01_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1).

So uh. That's my routine so far. I'm looking to expand it because I'm enjoying this so damn much. I wish I had started earlier in life!

**More makeupy related but still important here?**: I've used [this primer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ME1GUC/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) a few times (I admittedly didn't scrutinize the ingredients but it's supposed to be all organic and shit which is no excuse) and I've been using [Skin79 BB cream](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005Z6K2T8/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) instead of foundation and I LOVE IT. Also I like to think it's good for sunscreen purposes as well? I'm open to suggestions on a different primer. 


**Now for some stuff I want to get or am thinking about getting** (keeping in mind I'm still in Spoil Myself mode):

[The infamous CeraVe cleanser for sure](http://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Hydrating-Cleanser-12-Ounce/dp/B000YJ2SKM/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=12DQVAB1VK6F0&amp;coliid=I2IZO6Q6XJWNYK) once a day to remove makeup or just get my skin clean before bed. I'm not interested in the moisterizer since I have my jojoba oil. That's fine right? 

[Maybe a toner, used only as needed?](http://www.amazon.com/Fresh-Organic-Cucumber-Toner-6oz/dp/B0035H9AEC/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=12DQVAB1VK6F0&amp;coliid=I227HNRGKF72XR) I know toners are unneeded and I linked a way overpriced one here. Because cucumbers. I read you guys saying toner is only really needed with oily problems. If I start properly cleaning my face and it gets oily like it always does, I want to see if a toner will help. I'm open to being convinced that I still don't need it... but... cucumbers :(

[For maybe a once or twice weekly exfoliation, this makes me drool a little just thinking about it](http://www.amazon.com/Organic-Oxygen-Antioxidants-Vitamin-Superberries/dp/B004MJIL92/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=12DQVAB1VK6F0&amp;coliid=I33NV530I2TG94) I'm open to cheaper alternatives if they excite me. I do have expensive tastes but I swear I can do cheap as well haha.

[For Sunscreen, someone on /r/MakeupAddiction recommended this for under my BB Cream.](http://www.amazon.com/Neutrogena-Ultra-Sheer-Dry-Touch-Sunscreen/dp/B000EPA4GQ/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=12DQVAB1VK6F0&amp;coliid=I3HGVJCBH2193P). I found a nice looking Asian tinted sunscreen earlier but lost the link. :(

[Speaking of BB cream, I was thinking of this](http://www.amazon.com/SKIN79-Pink-Protect-Beblesh-Pact/dp/B0082X6COU/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=12DQVAB1VK6F0&amp;coliid=I29TO8YQ3LY3GN) if I'm going nekkid faced, with just sunscreen, or as a setting powder for my BB cream. This is also something I can be dissuaded on buying, but I do really want to try a setting powder. This is probably more of an issue for /r/MakeupAddiction.

[Lastly, I've been considering this for weekly exfoliating](http://www.amazon.com/Olay-Pro-X-Advanced-Cleansing-System/dp/B0043OYFKU/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=12DQVAB1VK6F0&amp;coliid=IDV4E4L18HL0). If I don't get that overpriced shit I linked above, I'd consider getting this instead. Or neither one. I keep hearing how these things aren't really needed... so yeah. *shrug* I'm just afraid there's *something else* I've been missing out on my entire life, you know?

One other question I have that I tried getting answers about on /r/MakeupAddiction is... my eyelids are really wrinkly. I've seen thousands of girl's eyelids online and they all look tight as a god damn drum. I'm guessing that all these years of rubbing my eyes (my one other pleasure in life) is to blame. Not sure, only became aware of it when I started getting into makeup because I never really looked at my face before. I wouldn't worry about it but it makes applying eye makeup an absolute bitch. Any advice there?

OK SHUTTING UP NOW. Thank you for reading, or any advice, etc. &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3

Japan has a new-ish PA rating, so I wanted to check out sunscreens with the new rating system.

I bought 2 new Japanese sunscreens looking to replace my Shiseido urban environment.  I was finding that the urban environment is a bit too mattifying for my preference.  ( Though not to the extreme of LRP's Anthelios). 


Anyhow, this is a fairly new release:  I saw ""gel"" and ""luminizing"", and saw good reviews from the Anessa line so I figured it would be a good option!


I bought this off [ichibankao](http://www.ichibankao.com/Pages/default.aspx) and went for the smaller size, 25g.   The downside is it's pretty expensive considering how much you get:  25g for $20.   I would have gone for the 60g size, however I wasn't sure if I'd like it. 


Moving along......The texture really like a light lotion/gel. It leaves no white cast and rubs in immediately.  It has a very faint almost citrus scent---much much less than the Urban Environment.


I don't think those with oily skin issues would prefer this sort of texture since it has no mattifying properties, but for those who are normal-dry, you'd love it. 


It left my skin feeling very very soft all day. Dare I say, even hydrated? It was not matte but not shiny or greasy.


I only used it for incidental sun exposure--walking to coffee, to get lunch, from the train to my office, etc---so I can't really comment how well it would hold up if I were to be hanging out outside for longer periods of time.


I'm also not sure about any luminizing effect aka did I look like edward cullen while I was outside in the sun.  I don't think it leaves any sparkle or shimmer, as I didn't notice any on my hands, and I do touch my face a lot.


Overall, I think this kind of sunscreen texture is 100% what I've been looking for, and I'm looking forward to re-buy.

1. Add to card

2. Scroll to the bottom of the cart page

3. Put coupon code **woot071213** in the box on the left side of the screen

4. Cart price should now be $90

NOT a refurb item and shipping is free! They DO, however, charge sales tax.

It comes with a clamshell travel case, cleanser, and wireless charger. The Mia and Mia2 are totally waterproof.

Sephora sells the Mia2 for [$150](http://www.sephora.com/mia2-skin-cleansing-system-P296898), and the Mia for [$120](http://www.sephora.com/mia-skin-cleansing-system-P285163) - so this is $30 cheaper than even the Mia (which doesn't have the built-in timer.)

I have a Mia2 and I adore it - the secret is to not be too overzealous with it! Once or twice a week is the most you should use it.

There are only Drogerie Markt and Lilly stores available. Most of the products there are way too expensive, and I have a very limited budget (at this point I can only afford 10eu to spend on cosmetics).

My whole routine is washing my face once or twice a day with ordinary glycerine soap (the kind you buy at a pharmacy), an attempt of OCM (30% castor oil 70% sunflower oil) and an occasional clay mask (milk and green clay).

I don't wear makeup. I exfoliate with one of those washing gloves. I'm not quite sure what a washcloth is and how is it different from an ordinary towel... for OCM I use an ordinary towel, and I don't understand how you people manage do remove oil from your face without all of the oil ending up in the towel (and thus having to wash the towel immediately).

I still have mild acne and lots of blackheads, and my skin constantly gets very oily in some parts and very dry in other parts. 

I don't know anything about cosmetics and skin care (I don't know the difference in between a toner, cleanser, moisturiser etc)...

I [posted here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1dwk86/going_to_dermatologist_in_2_days_what_should_i/) about one month ago (and you can see the ""before"" pic there). My face currently looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/iejJFeH.jpeg) (which looks much worse compared to the ""before"" pic, but my skin was actually worse at the time compared to that one, so basically my acne areas are just less raised and more red).

So, I had my dermatologist appointment, and she has me doing the following:

* Taking Doxycycline Hyclate 100 MG 2x a day
* Morning: Acanya (Clindamycin Phosphate and BP Gel 1.2%/2.5%)
* Night: Tretinoin gel microsphere, 1.04%

Other than this, I haven't really changed my routine (except I don't really exfoliate with the Up&amp;Up Exfoliating face wash w/ SA or use the spot treatment anymore).

First off, doesn't it seem strange that the dermatologist has me using Retin-A AND something with BP in it? Isn't that a big no-no? Also, I know you're supposed to wait 20 min after washing your face before putting it on, and I really try to do that, but I don't always get to wait more than 5ish minutes.

So here is how these new prescriptions work into my routine:

**Morning:**

* Wash with CeraVe for oily skin (my skin is very oily)

* Scrub face with Sephora exfoliating mitt (since my skin is so incredibly flaky in the morning)

* Apply Acanya

* Moisturize with CeraVe AM

* Antibiotic after breakfast

**Night:**

* Antibiotic afer dinner

* Remove all makeup with makeup removing wipes

* Wash with CeraVe for oily skin (in shower)

* Apply Tretinoin gel (I really try to wait 20 min before doing this, but I can't always, and it's sometimes 5 min after showering)

* CeraVe PM moisturizer OR the Cerave in the tub

Now, as you can see in the pic above, my skin looks awful. It's so red and doesn't look much better. I suppose the only improvement is that most of the acne is no longer raised bumps since it's been exfoliated away, but it's still there. I'm also getting a lot of new acne bumps along my chin (it's mostly the right side! the left side isn't nearly as bad!), and I really don't think I rest my chin on my hand or anything. Also, maybe I just have to keep using Tretinoin longer, but it really doesn't seem like my clogged pores are going away. 

I'm forced to scrub the flakes off my skin in the morning, and then I try to moisturize like crazy. It's mostly the lower half of my face (especially around my chin and jaw), with the exception of some to the outer sides of my eyes, even though I don't really put it that close to my eyes. Still, mid-day, my skin starts flaking again and it's super embarrassing. At this point I'm usually at work and can't wait to get home (where sometimes I do nothing and other times I take my makeup off, wash my face, and scrub some more). By night, it's the same deal all over again.

I'm going on a trip to NYC in the beginning of July to see a friend I haven't seen in a little while... I have my brother's graduation party at the end of this month.... I can't possibly imagine lasting the whole day, with so many people seeing me and so many pictures being taken. The thought makes me want to crawl inside a hole and hope no one sees my face again. I hate my skin so incredibly much and it seems like nothing helps it, only makes it worse.

If anyone has anymore help for me it would be appreciated so much! Thanks!

**Edit**: I should also add that I'm going to the dermatologist again next Thursday (2 Thursdays from now). She said that if I don't see improvement, she'd put me on some hormonal prescription (something about blocking testosterone and oil glands?

Holy skin care heaven, Batman! I'm so hooked to this place. I used part of my birthday money to buy a stash of samples with the 20% off spring coupon they ran. I tried my Salicylic/Mandelic Peel first, then my Mandelic, and finally last weekend I did my 12.5% TCA peel. 



The difference between what a TCA did for me versus the rest was night and day. While I definitely felt like the others exfoliated and helped with sebaceous filaments and fine lines, they did nothing in comparison to the TCA. Granted, the TCA was intense and by intense I mean I kind of danced/wiggled/made goofy noises waiting for the time to run out so I could neutralize it. I had a lot of frosting, I had a few intense brown spots where it really ate up my skin, and I would compare the amount of peeling I've done to a pretty bad sunburn. 



Overall, it was worth it. I was never miserable. I was uncomfortable taking my son to the park the day after the peel because I had to put sunscreen on and it burned a bit, but other than that, it was cake. It felt no different than waiting out a sunburn (and it wasn't nearly as uncomfortable as one, really). 



If anyone is interested in pictures, I'd be glad to post some. I've had a sun spot for almost a decade that the TCA ate through and faded by about 50%, some other sun damage that faded, and overall I can tell that my skin is brighter, tighter, and my skin tone is way more even.

Now, this isn't exactly a scientific experiment, but my skin has somewhat improved. The tone is more even and I haven't gotten any inflamed acne.

Not necessarily ""Go out and buy this"" but stuff you might have around your house all ready etc...


- When cleansing your face make sure to splash water onto your face (after you're done massaging cleanser/ oil) and let gravity do its thing. It pulls dirt away from your face instead of smearing it in.  I heard about this from Erno Lazlo and it just makes sense.


-After cleansing your face, splash it with cold water a couple times to close your pores and keep the dirt out. I've had more noticeable pores near my nose recently and cold water now makes them invisible again! 


-If you have a healing blemish that you've picked, use triple antibiotic ointment in the morning and at night to speed the healing process and reduce scarring. 


-Facial massage helps circulate blood. It can depuff eyes and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. I've been doing this for a couple weeks and it has really helped with my stubborn forehead wrinkles, and my eyes are WAY less puffy in the morning.

I have had large cystic pimples that seem to pop up at random times. I have slightly oily skin and don't really ever get acne. The pimples can get as large as a dime and be active for weeks at a time. They finally go away which leaves me with scars and the pockets seem to go under my skin only to resurface months later.

My current routine is the following:

* AM: Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser (Mario Badescue Glycolic Foaming Cleanser every other day instead of Cetaphil), Every Man Jack Face Lotion SPF 15 w/ jojoba oil added.
* PM: Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser, Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion w/ jojoba oil added.

Had gone to the dermatologist but stopped going as they had me on Doryx and two different benzoyle peroxide creams. Made my face ultra dry and rough. They also wouldn't do cortisone shots on the cystic pimples as they said they can make dimples in your skin if they miss the pocket.

I have extremely sensitive acne-prone skin that easily turns red at any use of benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid.  St. Ives scrub free pads (and all other pads like it) cause painful warm to the touch breakouts for me and argan oil caused a bunch of whiteheads (I'm so very sad about both of these products!).

*Current Routine*

AM: MUAC green tea pomegranate wash followed by Cerave in the tub on cheeks/chin (dryer acne areas with rough spots etc.) and Sebamed on forehead and nose

PM: remove makeup with DHC followed by Cerave foaming cleanser, then RoC sensitive skin night retinol treatment (only thing I've found that helps my breakouts) followed by Cerave in the tub all over.  Sometimes I spot treat with MB drying cream or benzoyl peroxide if I'm prepared for redness the next day (basically when I get frustrated and end up overdoing it)


I've already decided on the Tea Tree Oil Cleanser because I've heard good things about it and also the Tumeric Mask (I know I can make it, I'm just not that proactive and will probably never get around to trying tumeric otherwise).

My indecision lies between the following three products:

-[Manuka Honey Hyaluronic Acid Serum](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/7436406/7793258.htm): includes manuka honey, hyaluronic acid and manuka tea tree oil

-[Pre-emptive Strike Serum](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/7398817/9703757.htm): includes olive leaf extract, black garlic fermentation, coffee fruit extract and resveratrol

-[Simply Tea Tree Blemish Serum](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/7398817/8109929.htm): includes honeysuckle, manuka honey, neem leaf, seabuckthorn, tea tree oil, glycerin and hyaluronic acid


The Manuka Honey and Tea Tree Blemish serum jump out at me because they both have hyaluronic acid and my breakouts normally get pretty dry, no matter how much Cerave I put on them.  The Blemish serum also has a lot of ingredients I've heard great things about on this sub (specifically the neem leaf).  I have the Pre-emptive strike serum listed because everyone raves about it and the coffee extract is supposed to help reduce redness, but I'm worried it may be drying since it doesn't have hyaluronic acid.  I'm only interested in trying two of these because I only want to rotate these in the morning before my moisturizer (I'm open to more usage suggestions though...)

Blue light therapy has been clinically and scientifically proven for the treatment and prevention of mild to moderate inflammatory acne. The device is a triple threat, employing not just blue LED light to kill acne bacteria but also a sonic vibration which supposedly stimulates microcirculation to reduce swelling and inflammation while added heat agitates skin, enabling pores to open, thereby allowing the blue light to reach more bacteria.


**I'm skeptical! I need science!!!** - ""[Clinical efficacy of self-applied blue light therapy for mild to moderate acne.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2923954/)""

---

I gave it a try and see if it is too good to be true. It's pretty easy to use. Just cleanse your skin and lightly place over blemish until vibration stops and repeat 2 - 3 times a day. Whatever you do, do not turn it on while the blue light directs to your eyes.... :X

**Here's [my Before and After photos](http://imgur.com/a/6Z8W2).** 

Just in case if the captions in imgur is not readable. ""Before using Tanda Zap. A freaking zit on my neck (All thanks to Aunt Flo) and there was a small red bump above the zit and a tiny blackhead right next to it. 

24 hours later! The small one deflated and tiny blackhead mysteriously disappeared. Unfortunately, the big zit stays the same but good news, there is no pain or it didn't get bigger. Maybe two or three more days, it will be gone?""

**Will I repurchase again?** If Costco stops selling it, maybe not. I don't know if it's worth to buy it for $50. The only con about it is that the device won't last forever. It will stop working after 1000 uses. Tanda does have the bigger one, Clear+ that has a recharging stand and will last up to 6000 uses but that's 200 dollars. ;(

But, there is something to think about it... My dermatologist offers blue LED therapy for 100 dollars per treatment.

My wedding is at the end of July of this year. I have some issues with bacne (not severe, I would say light), however besides the pimples I get here and there, the bigger issue is the brown spots I have left on my back. 

Right now I am using benzamycin gel to help treat the acne but I really need to get rid of these ugly marks on my back. I have been reading through other posts and it seems that a chemical peel may be a good idea. 

I was wondering if anyone could recommend specific products. I have seen some of you mention the peels from MUAC and visited their website but I am not sure I understand what peel I should start with ('TCA peels' - whatever that means - seems to be like a good one that will produce fast results, however there are many different concentrations and I'm lost on what is too strong/too weak).

If it matters, I have light to light-medium skin tone, the skin on my back is mostly dry, in general I don't have sensitive skin, and I have never used a peel. Also, I am in Canada if that makes a difference at all.

My idea is that it would basically be an app version of [cosdna.com](http://www.cosdna.com/), where a user could scan the barcode of a product while shopping and receive an analysis of the ingredients. The features I'm planning to include are:

* The user could search for a product by either scanning a barcode or typing the product name into a search box.
* The user will receive a rating of the product based on how many irritants or comedogenics are included in the ingredient list. The rating could either be something like ""excellent, good, okay, bad"" or something like the smiley/frownie faces that cosdna uses.
* The user can tap on each individual ingredient to find out what it does (emulsifier, moisturizer, preservative, etc.) and how irritating/comedogenic it is.
* The user can save a list of ingredients that they know their skin reacts badly to. If the product they scan includes one of these ingredients, they'll receive a warning.
* The user can save products to a wishlist/shopping list to reference/buy later.

The idea is that it would be helpful tool to use while shopping, especially for those who are new to the world of skincare ingredients or who don't want to have to memorize what each ingredient does.

Part of the project requires me to interview members of my target audience (skincare addicts), so I'm hoping you all will help me out by answering a few questions:

* How old are you? (Do not have to answer, if you don't want to)
* What's your gender? (Do not have to answer, if you don't want to)
* Do you own/use a smart phone?
* How comfortable do you feel analyzing skincare ingredients?
* Do you have a good understanding of skincare ingredients and what they do?
* Do you prefer to purchase skincare products online or in store? Why/why not?
* Do you research products before buying? 
* If yes, what kind of research do you do? (for example, read reviews, look at the ingredient list, price comparison, etc.)
* Would you use the proposed app? Why/why not?
* What features interest you most? Why?
* What features seem unnecessary? Why?
* Ideally what other features would you want to be included? (for example, some kind of community/review system, recommendations based on skin type, etc.)
* Is there anything else you think it would be useful for me to know?

2. We know that you can't 'tighten' a pore because it has no muscle. If you want to reduce their appearance, exfoliants are best for that!
3. I'm not aware of what could make your face 'unprepared' to absorb ingredients other than rubbing an occlusive all over it. So, as long as you aren't covering your face in vaseline as part of your cleansing process, I think you're okay.


Here's the rest of the article if anyone is interested:
 
So who needs it? ""Only people with extremely oily skin,""says Ranella Hirsch, M.D., vice president of the American Society of Cosmetic Dermatology and Aesthetic Surgery. And that’s only if you’re not already controlling oil in another way, like with a salicylic acid–based cleanser or an oil-absorbing lotion. (Incidentally, “there’s no truth to the theory that toners prep the skin or help other products penetrate better,” says David E. Bank, M.D., director of the Center for Dermatology, Cosmetic and Laser Surgery, in Mount Kisco, New York.)
 
Who can skip it: Women with normal, dry, or sensitive complexions―that is, almost everyone. Toners often overdry these types of skin, triggering the sebaceous glands to pump out more oil in an effort to prevent dehydration. The result: rebound greasiness and more breakouts.

Although acids reverse sun damage, it also makes the skin more sensitive to the sun. So you risk more sun damage and discolourations.

The only exception here would be mandeleic acid, which can also be used in the summer.

In short:

* Apply acids in the evening
* Use them only in the cold part of the year, not in the summer
* Don't tan (whether outdoors or in a solarium)
* Use sunscreen, but make sure it is [photostable](http://blog.pharmacymix.com/photostable-sunscreens-is-your-sunscreen-doing-its-job), and that you are patting on enough of it to actually work (rubbing on a teeny bit doesn't give you the protection advertised on the bottle. If I remember right then you should apply 5ml or one teaspoon to the face. This is much more than most women apply).

There's jack in their ingredients that look like it should make a difference at all, which is why, I'm convinced it's just unicorn magic that makes them work for me.


I have hereditary middle eastern dark circles, which aside from hitting up a derm, I'm not going to make them go away. My line of defense is getting sleep and concealer.  



I came across [these](http://web1.sasa.com/SasaWeb/eng/product/viewProductDetail.jspa;T7_JSESSIONID=855049E2B09B248166B64C944327B133?itemno=104120602004&amp;cm_mmc=google500006) Beautymate nano eye masks awhile ago--maybe 3-4 years ago?  Was shocked because they seemed to work.  I did a test the next day and just used one on one eye, and yup, made the area brighter compared to the other side.


As I mentioned above, there's nothing in the ingredients that stand out to me for immediate results. They do have niacinamide, but that's not going to give immediate results, that takes time. There's a ton of parabens too, so if you don't like parabens, stay away. 



 [here's](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_225231272.html) the ingredients from cosdna. 


Overall though, I like these things, A LOT. They come soaked with an excessive amount of white goo, which I've reused for a couple days.  I use the sheets on a clean face, pop them back in the bag, keep the bag closed with a bobby pin, and pop in the fridge.  Or i might dip a cotton ball in the goo. 


I got them from sasa, if you're in canada ( somewhere) I think there's an actual sasa store you can go to?

The black bottle to the left towards the back is Ojon Tawaka Shampoo. It photobombed me..As did that blue bottle of aloe with lidocaine. 




*For reference* I'm 28, moderate lines in my forehead and between my brows ( i LOVE the sun and am quite expressive...this is a bad combo for wrinkles!), easily dried/dehydrated--my skin sucks up moisture like the dickens, I rarely get blemishes and don't have particularly sensitive skin, though I do have a few ingredients I avoid.  





Mostly from L to R: 


**Green Tubby**   is whipped shea butter + small amounts of argan, coconut, jojoba, and sweet almond oil**


* On top of the green tubby L to R:*    


 * Chanel Hydramax ( a splurge product)
 *  sample of Algenist Concentrated Serum
 * MUAC Vitamin C serum
 * Sample of Mario Badescu glycolic acid toner



**Natural Aqua Gel: The Cure**  I JUST got this before I posted the pic.


**Embryolisse 24 hour cream** Just got this, it's ok, not worth the price.



**Cerave SA**


**U-Lactin** ( I use it on my face and body)


**Cerave tub**


**Coconut Oil**  Got this from whole foods WAY overpriced


**Hyaluronic acid** The green bottle. I mix this with a few drops of water before applying so it will be effective.



**Squalane Oil** ( in front of the Cerave Tub) 


**By Terry Rose Toner** The pink bottle.  It smells nice, I got it for cheap in a blogsale



**June Jacobs Papaya Enzyme Mask** My #2 splurge product. It can be wiped off or washed off or left on for intense hydration. It smells DIVINE and this jar lasts for ages. It comes with a little scoop too.



**St Ives Exfoliating Pads**



**Alpha Hydrox 14% Glycolic Acid Wipes**



**Clinique Moisture Surge Intense** This is a gel/creme hybrid that is pretty nice. But downside is it smells HORRIBLE.



**Sample of MUAC's Pumpkin Mask** 5% Glycolic acid. I need to get the full size.



**Johnson &amp; Johnson baby oil with cocoa butter**  I don't recommend you acne prone folks to use this on your face. I use on my face and body after my moisturizer.



**Argan Oil+Jojoba Oil** In the big green bottle.



**Sweet Almond Oil with Vitamin E**



**MUAC's Honey and Oat Cleanser** It's really drying. I won't repurchase but will use up. 



**CVS brand baby oil** Got this bottle to test out mineral oil on blackheads on my boyfriend. Now I use it to take off my makeup.


**MUAC Green-Tea Pomegranate Cleanser**  Black pump in the back right.  This is amazing. Only other cleanser aside from Clinique's that doesn't strip my skin.  The BF refuses to buy anything else. We have 3 backups.


**Clinique Extra Mild Liquid Facial Soap**  SO great for dry skin. If I have a sunburn or do a chemical peel though I use the MUAC green tea


**Shiseido White Lucent Sunscreen**  White bottle in the front


**Walgreens brand Petroleum Jelly**  I actually prefer the texture of the brand Vaseline. So I won't repurchase this.






**Items not pictured**


* MUAC: 55% Lactic acid peel, 30% glycolic acid peel, 18% TCA peel, 15% TCA peel, 15% salicylic acid peel, 2  mini bottles of their pH balancing toner ( witch hazel/lactic acid)


* Clarisonic Hydro Cleanser ( it came free with my clarisonic a few years back) 


* Cerave Hydrating Cleanser-- it's in the mail


* Alpha Hydrox Oil free 10% glycolic acid gel


* Queen Helene Mint Julep Mask


* Persagel 10


* Bobbi Brown Extra Repair Moisturizing Balm


* Random assortment of Beautymate sheet masks


* Murad Pomegranate face lotion ( the SPF in this is totally unstable due to clear packaging and how old it is, but I love the scent and the texture is light and nice) 


* LUSH Buche de Noel face scrub/wash


* Retino-A .025% and .05%  ( these aren't US rx products, they're overseas. Haven't been able to be diligent with use, but I will prob repurchase soon from inhousepharmacy because they're expiring soon) 





I think I covered everything I didn't picture. Will update if I remember anything. Feel free to ask questions about products, etc!

Overall I think pearl powder is pretty good. The biggest benefit I found was that it whitens your skin **a lot**. There's a noticeable difference, my skin really lightened after one mask. Furthermore it evens out the skin tone. I was really tanned, but not around my eyes due to glasses. After one mask it evened out the colour of skin. Finally, I think the powder did something for my pimple scars. I think it healed it a bit and it isn't as visible.

Biggest limit is that it dries out your skin...but if you're like me, my skin gets progressively oily throughout the day...it isn't a big of a deal. ;)

She also insists that moisturizer is for people with dry skin.  I've tried her to get out of the habit of over-drying her skin because I believe she's feeling oily because she's stripping her face of moisture and that's probably causing the pores to look bigger.

I've been doing searches and reading old threads, but have just ended up with so many options I don't know what to go with!

I currently use Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch, which makes my cheeks and eyelids sting a bit (driest parts of my face), and it feels kind of greasy on my skin  and I always feel like it doesn't stay matte (usually making my nose and chin shine, and collecting around the creases of my nose - oooohhh, so annoying!).

**What I want from my sunscreen:**

Obviously, I want it to be mattifying on my skin. I want a physical sunscreen (maaayybe physical + chemical if it's amazing). I don't think I'm too worried about a white sheen, because I'm usually putting on makeup over the top anyway. Unless the white sheen can come through the makeup and give ghost face in pictures? … Because then I definitely want to avoid it.

**Brands I can actually get:**

Living in Australia, I can't get all of the sunscreens I've read about in actual shops. However with a combination of ebay, amazon, sasa &amp; iherb, I seem to be able to get most of them. The only problem is I can't try them out beforehand, so this is where I need your advice!

* Avene Very High Protection SPF30+ (in store)
* La Roche Posay Anthelios XL Fluid Extreme SPF 50+ (in store)
* Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46 (online)
* Shiseido Urban Environment UV Protection Cream Plus SPF 50 (or any other shiseido product - online)
* Desert Essence Age Reversal Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 (online - which is [this](http://www.iherb.com/Desert-Essence-Organics-Daily-Sun-Protection-Age-Reversal-Mineral-Sunscreen-SPF-30-3-fl-oz-88-7-ml/10439), slightly different from [this](https://www.desertessence.com/store/mineral-sunscreen) one, but they don't ship internationally)

But Eminence is super pricey, and after all the comments on GoW, I thought I'd give them a whirl. I'm in mid 20s, combo-oily skin, with no sensitivity, but lots of hyperpigmentation, and  hormonal acne. I've used these products for about 2 weeks now, so all comments are for initial impressions. 


Here's what I ordered, with comments so far


**Simply Clean Tea Tree Cleanser:** Love this. Gentle and little bit goes a long way. I like that my skin looks brighter afterwards, and feels balanced. My oiliness has decreased tremendously since I started using GoW, and I suspect this product is the reason. Will buy again!

**Pumpkin/Papaya Enzyme Mask/Cleanser** Seems good, nothing special. I've been spoiled by Eminence masks though, which were phenomenal, so I'm biased here. 

**Hydrating/Soothing Mask for Sensitive/Rosacea Skin** I like this one more than the Pumpkin mask. I ordered it for my SO, who has bad eczema, and this mask burned on him. I had wanted to get the Turmeric mask, but it was on backorder. Sigh, next time. 

**Natural Salicylic Acid BHA 2%** and **PreEmptive Strike Serum** I like to use these two together, loving them so far. The real test will be if they can stave off hormonal breakouts...will have to update once that time of the month hits.

**Majik C Serum** love this, it makes my skin brighter. I sometimes mix this with a few drops of Ole Henriksen Enlighten Me serum. the only issue is that it's a bit drying, so I make sure I use moisturizer immediately afterwards.

**AHA Tonic Gel 10% pH 1.9** Tingles, a little redness afterwards, but still makes my skin feel smoother and brighter. I use this sparingly. I've used peels before, so I'm still trying to see if its worth sticking to the GoW brand for this type of product. 

**Chill-Out Cucumber Hydrosol Serum** I like to mix this with HA. I used to get really oily skin because (late realization), my moisturizers were too heavy and serums applied with too heavy a hand. Using this light moisturizer, all I need is a bit of sunscreen/treatment cream, and my skin is much less oily hours later. My SO approves!!!

**Chock Full O Vitamins Serum** Haven't actually opened this, but I am realllly excited to try it out. 

**GoAway Circles Eye Serum** Ordered this on a whim, but I'm currently trying out Clinique Dark Circles corrector. Will try this product next. 

I also hit up my local health foods store and got

**Aztec Secret Clay Mask** and **Eden's Apple Cider Vinegar w/Mother**  Holy moly, people weren't kidding when they said this was fantastic. My face feels super bright after using this! I'm such a sucker for masks, and recently have become obsessed with Ren Glyco Lactic Peel and Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta peels (wallet is anorexic at this point). After using Aztec Clay+ ACV, my skin glows just like it does after the Ren mask, but for a fraction of the price. Loooove this mask, so much that I made my SO and my dad try it too. 

**Thayer's Rose Petal Witch Hazel (without Alcohol)** Love the scent, love this as toner between GoW products. 

**Dr. Bronners Organic Pure Castile Liquid Soad Hemp Almond** Going to try this soon, have heard great reviews.

1357574975.0,25,self.SkincareAddiction,164hq9,Acne information: Beyond the Basics Patient Information from UptoDate,yvva,28,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/164hq9/acne_information_beyond_the_basics_patient/,"ACNE OVERVIEW — Acne is a skin condition in which the pores become blocked, causing pimples to develop. Acne is the most common skin disorder in North America, affecting an estimated 85 percent of adolescents.

Effective acne treatments are available to treat existing pimples and prevent new ones from developing. In addition, cosmetic treatments can help to reduce scarring and changes in skin color caused by acne.

**HOW DOES ACNE DEVELOP?**

 There are four basic steps involved in the development of an acne lesion.

Hair follicles become blocked with an overabundance of normal skin cells (figure 1). These cells combine with sebum (an oily substance that lubricates the hair and skin), creating a plug in the follicle.

The glands that produce sebum, known as sebaceous glands, enlarge during adolescence and sebum production increases (figure 2). 

Numerous sebaceous glands are found on the face, neck, chest, upper back, and upper arms.


The increase in sebum production allows for the overgrowth of bacteria that normally lives on the skin.

Bacterial overgrowth causes local inflammation, which causes rupture of the follicle (figure 3). This can lead to the formation of a red or tender pimple.


**ACNE CAUSES**


Hormonal changes — Hormonal changes during adolescence cause the sebaceous glands to become enlarged and sebum production increases. In most people with acne, hormone levels are normal, but the sebaceous glands are highly sensitive to the hormones.



Less often, women's hormone levels are affected by an underlying medical problem known as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). (See ""Patient information: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (Beyond the Basics)"".)


Acne tends to resolve between ages 30 to 40, although it can persist into or develop for the first time during adulthood. Post-adolescent acne predominantly affects women, in contrast to adolescent acne, which predominantly affects men. Acne can flare before a woman's menstrual period, especially in women older than 30 years.


External factors — Oil-based cosmetics may contribute to the development of acne. Oils and greases in hair products can also worsen skin lesions. Water-based or ""non-comedogenic"" products are less likely to worsen acne.


People with acne often use soaps and astringents. While these treatments remove sebum from the skin surface, they do not decrease sebum production; frequent or aggressive scrubbing with these agents can actually worsen acne.


Diet — The role of diet in acne is controversial. Some studies have found weak associations between cow's milk and an increased risk of acne, perhaps because of hormones that occur naturally in milk. However, there is no strong evidence that milk, high-fat foods or chocolate increase the risk of acne.


Stress — Psychological stress can probably worsen acne. In several studies of students, acne severity appeared to worsen during times of increased stress [1].



**ACNE TREATMENT** 

 There is no single best treatment for acne, and combinations of treatments are sometimes recommended. Since acne lesions take at least eight weeks to mature, you should use a treatment for a minimum of two to three months before deciding if the treatment is effective. (See ""Treatment of acne vulgaris"".)


Acne skin care — Skin care is an important aspect of acne treatment.


Skin hygiene — Wash your face no more than twice daily using a gentle non-soap facial skin cleanser (eg, Cetaphil®, Oil of Olay® bar or foaming face wash, or Dove® bar) and warm (not hot) water. Some providers recommend avoiding use of a washcloth or loofah, and instead using the hands to wash the face. Vigorous washing or scrubbing can worsen acne and damage the skin's surface.


Do not pick or squeeze pimples because this may worsen acne and cause skin swelling and scarring. It can also cause lesions to become infected.


Moisturizers — Use of a moisturizer minimizes dryness and skin peeling, which are common side effects of some acne treatments. Moisturizers that are labeled as ""non-comedogenic"" are less likely to block skin pores.


Sun protection — Some acne treatments increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight (eg, retinoids, doxycycline). To minimize skin damage from the sun, avoid excessive sun exposure and use a sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher before sun exposure. (See ""Patient information: Sunburn prevention (Beyond the Basics)"".)


Can I treat my own acne? — If you have mild acne, you can try to treat yourself with non-prescription products initially. Non-prescription acne treatments may include salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, alpha hydroxy acids, or tea tree oil, all of which are available in non- prescription strengths. A combination of these treatments may be more effective than using one single product alone. (See ""Light-based, adjunctive, and other therapies for acne vulgaris"".)


If you do not improve after three months of using non-prescription products or you have moderate or severe acne, consult a healthcare provider for advice on the most effective treatments.


Noninflammatory acne — Noninflammatory acne causes whiteheads or blackheads without redness or skin swelling (picture 1).


Retinoids — Topical retinoid medications are often recommended for noninflammatory acne. Examples of these medications include tretinoin (Retin-A®, Avita®, Atralin®), adapalene (Differin®) and tazarotene (Tazorac®).


Retinoids are usually applied once per day, although people who develop skin irritation can reduce this to every other day or less, then increase as tolerated over time. Most people become more tolerant of retinoids over time.


Most retinoids are available in a gel or cream. People with oily skin may prefer gels because they have a drying effect, while people with dry skin may prefer a cream.


Retinoids can cause skin irritation. While using topical retinoids, you should apply a sunscreen with SPF 15 or greater before sun exposure.


Other acne products — People who cannot tolerate retinoids may try other topical medications, such as salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or azelaic acid (Azelex®, Finacea®). All of these treatments can be helpful in reducing noninflammatory acne, and azelaic acid may reduce acne-related darkening of skin.


Mild to moderate inflammatory acne — Mild to moderate acne with some inflammation (picture 2) is usually treated with topical retinoids (see 'Retinoids' above), topical antibiotics, or benzoyl peroxide.


A combination of two medications, usually benzoyl peroxide with a topical antibiotic or retinoid (eg, tretinoin), is more effective than treatment with one agent alone.


Benzoyl peroxide — Benzoyl peroxide is usually applied twice per day. It may be combined with a topical retinoid, in which case the benzoyl peroxide is applied in the morning and the retinoid is applied at night. Benzoyl peroxide can irritate the skin, sometimes causing redness and skin flaking, and it can bleach clothing, towels, bedding, and hair.


Topical antibiotics — Topical antibiotics (creams or liquids) control the growth of acne bacteria and reduce inflammation. Topical antibiotics include erythromycin, clindamycin, sulfacetamide, and dapsone.



Moderate to severe inflammatory acne — For people with moderate to severe inflammatory acne (picture 3), oral antibiotics or an oral retinoid known as isotretinoin (Amnesteem®, Clavaris®, Sotret®) may be recommended. Topical medication may be used in combination with oral treatments.


Women often benefit from hormonal treatment with a birth control pill (see 'Hormone therapy' below).


Oral antibiotics — Oral antibiotics work to slow the growth of acne-producing bacteria. However, oral antibiotics can have bothersome side effects, including vaginal yeast infections in women and stomach upset.


Doxycycline and minocycline are the most commonly prescribed oral antibiotics for acne. They cannot be used during pregnancy or in children less than 9 years of age.



Oral isotretinoin — Oral isotretinoin (Amnesteem™, Claravis™, Sotret®) is a potent retinoid medication that is extremely effective in the treatment of severe acne. It cures or significantly improves acne in the majority of patients. Oral isotretinoin is effective in treating the most disfiguring types of acne. (See ""Oral isotretinoin therapy for acne vulgaris"".) Isotretinoin used to be sold as Accutane®, but that brand name is no longer available


Oral isotretinoin is usually taken in pill form once or twice daily with food for 20 weeks, then stopped. In some cases, acne can initially worsen before it improves. To reduce the risk for this initial flare of acne, isotretinoin is sometimes given at a lower dose for the first month of treatment. After treatment is stopped, improvement can continue for up to five months.



Side effects and risks — Despite its positive effects, oral isotretinoin can have serious side effects and should be used with caution. Taking isotretinoin during pregnancy can cause miscarriage and life-threatening malformations in the baby. For these reasons, there are strict rules in the United States for healthcare providers, pharmacists, and patients regarding the use and prescription of oral isotretinoin. Prescriptions of isotretinoin are regulated by the iPLEDGE program (www.ipledgeprogram.com), which requires the following:


All women must have two negative pregnancy tests before receiving a prescription, and then they must have monthly pregnancy tests throughout the course of treatment.


Women who could become pregnant must fill their prescription within seven days of receiving it; after this time, a new prescription must be written.


Any woman who is or might become sexually active with a male partner must use two forms of birth control for at least one month before starting therapy and continue until one month after stopping isotretinoin.


Women who cannot become pregnant and men must also participate in iPLEDGE, but do not require pregnancy testing or use of birth control.


Information about oral isotretinoin can be found at the United States Food and Drug Administration web site, (www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/ucm085227.htm).


A variety of non-pregnancy related side effects may occur during isotretinoin therapy:

Dryness or peeling of skin, soreness and cracking of the lips, itching, muscle pain, nosebleeds, difficulty wearing contact lenses, and sensitivity to the sun may occur during treatment.


There is concern about the relationship between isotretinoin and depression and suicidal behavior. While there is not enough evidence to conclude that it causes depression or suicidal behavior, patients taking isotretinoin should report any sadness, depression, or anxiety to their healthcare provider.


Isotretinoin can cause increases in blood levels of triglycerides (fatty substances related to cholesterol), liver damage, pancreatitis, and changes in the blood counts. It is unclear whether isotretinoin treatment increases the risk for inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.

While many of these side effects can be managed without stopping the drug, others can be dangerous and require that you immediately stop taking it. Stay in touch with your doctor, and follow instructions for getting regular blood tests to monitor cholesterol, triglycerides, liver function, and blood counts.


Hormone therapy — The hormone estrogen can help to offset the effect of androgens (hormones responsible for acne development). Estrogen treatment in the form of a birth control pill is sometimes recommended for women with moderate or severe acne. (See ""Patient information: Hormonal methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)"".)


Not all oral contraceptives should be used for the treatment of acne; some can actually worsen acne. Certain types of intrauterine devices (IUDs) and some injectable forms of birth control also may worsen acne. Discuss the best options with your healthcare provider. (See ""Hormonal therapy for women with acne vulgaris"".)


Other medications are available to reduce the effects of androgens in women, including spironolactone. Rarely, spironolactone can cause high blood levels of potassium. In addition, spironolactone can cause birth defects.


The benefits of birth control pills and other hormonal medications may not be noticeable until three to six months after treatment is started.



Acne and pregnancy — Many acne treatments are not safe for use during pregnancy. Women who are pregnant or intending to become pregnant should consider stopping all acne treatments before becoming pregnant. If acne therapy becomes necessary, discuss the options with your healthcare provider.

2 week ago I got an 8mm Punch biopsy ( no stitches) on my arm.  The site had FINALLY started to fill in over the past few days, so I removed the bandage and was just moisturizing the area.




Due to the adhesives from the bandages and frequent cleansing, the area around the wound has been brutally dry and itchy.



While at work, I casually scratched my arm, but I clawed right over the wound.   Now I'm back to square 1, and it's as deep as it was when it was first done.

I've seen a huge reduction in breakouts and in blemishes at all which is down to recently starting a skin-friendly pill, it being sunny (always helps, don't know why) and having seen a beautician who recommended some Dermalogica products for me. My skin looks and feels great, but I still have a ton of really annoying blackheads and I can't seem to get rid of them!

As well as having a healthy balanced diet and doing plenty of exercise this has been my routine for the past few months:

**Morning**

* Dermalogica pre-cleanse - rinse
* Dermalogica skin prep scrub (every other day) - rinse
* Dermalogica daily microexfoliant - rinse
* Dermalogica special cleansing gel - rinse
* Simple facial wipes
* Dermalogica skin smoothing cream (aka moisturiser) + spf50 sunscreen
   
**Evening**

* Dermalogica pre-cleanse - rinse
* Dermalogica special cleansing gel - rinse
* Simple facial wipes
* Dermalogica skin smoothing cream (moisturiser)

During really hot days I use another facial wipe if my skin feels a little oily, then put some moisturiser on as the wipes can dry my skin out.

I'm really happy with the results so far but I still have these blackheads, how do I get rid of them? Do pore strips help or are they the devil incarnate?

* Stridex pads  
* daily topical Clindamycin (dabber, can be worn under makeup)

**EDIT** Just found some nice brief stuff from uptodate!!

&gt; **Alpha hydroxy acids** — The most commonly used alpha hydroxy acids are glycolic acid and lactic acid. Alpha hydroxy acids are weak organic acids that cause desquamation and diminish corneocyte cohesion, thereby normalizing follicular keratinization [11]. These agents may also promote dispersing of basal layer melanin, which can help to improve post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.

&gt; Alpha hydroxy acids in low concentrations and buffered alpha hydroxy acids in higher concentrations are available as over the counter washes, lotions, creams, and at-home peel systems. High concentrations with more free acid are used in the office to perform superficial chemical peels.

&gt; **Salicylic acid** — Salicylic acid (0.5 to 2%) is a beta hydroxy acid available in a number of non-prescription gels, lotions, solutions, cleansers, pads, and masks. It is a desquamating agent, and its lipophilic properties enable it to penetrate the pilosebaceous follicle, producing a comedolytic effect [1]. Topical salicylic acid also possesses mild anti-inflammatory properties.

Recently I switched my moisturizer/sunscreen. After doing so, I have begun to get these little bumps, which never turn into whiteheads but just sit on my face.

Is this just an adjustment period, or is this going to continue to get progressively worse...? Should I not put so much stock into what beautypedia says? I'm just not sure...

I am also not entirely sure if this is caused by the sunscreen, or by a combination of my hormones. I just recently finally got myself off of proactiv after a long battle. Perhaps I always had these little clogged pores lurking inside of me and the BP kept them hidden.

Eek, I hope I'm not a bother posting sooo many questions.

Ok, about sunscreen applications. Most say to apply 15-30 mins before going out. They also usually say to try and reapply every 2 hours. Here's my questions:

Should you aim to apply as close to going out as possible? Meaning, if I applied my sunscreen and was then delayed in going outside by say, an hour, would I have to reapply it in an hour after going out? Or is it actual sun exposure that starts the 2-hour timer counting down?

Additionally, is there anything bad about applying an initial layer of sunscreen when you're already sun-exposed? Sometimes I forget to apply sunscreen to my arms 'til I'm in the car. I know the initial 15 mins are pretty much forfeit, but will it hurt my eventual SPF protection or the chemicals themselves if they're exposed to the sun before those 15 minutes have elapsed?

Some background info: my skin changes with the seasons; super dry in winter (need to use a really heavy duty moisturizer); normal/combination in spring and fall, and more oily/combination in summer. Hormonal breakouts on my chin and nose-area. My skin is pretty tolerant of whatever kind of cleaners and moisturizers I use; I've never had a breakout because of something I put on my skin.

While there's a bunch of things I'd like to change about my facial skin, my biggest concern is my scars - including that little blue spot just to the left of my eyebrow. I'm considering trying chemical peels, but I've never done them before and am worried about ruining my skin!

I've lived with these scars for 10 years and I'm sick of them! Help?

I have heard that witch hazel can be an excellent toner/astringent. I realize that I'm supposed to use the witch hazel labelled as hydrosol/distillate (basically, alcohol free). But I have some questions about how to use the product specifically. 

*Toner:  
When using it as a toner, do I need to dilute it? 
Also, I've heard that it has amazing abilities to close pores, but will that make the products I put on afterwards (moisturizers, etc.) less effective because my pores are closed?

*Makeup setting spray: 
I've heard of witch hazel being used as a makeup setting spray, but how is it made? Also, for the setting spray do I still use witch hazel that is labelled as hydrosol/distillate, or do I use the witch hazel with alcohol in it?


The current toner I have is Eucerin, and I basically use it to get off the last bit of my face cleanser (OCM + Lush's Dark Angels). 

Some basic info: East Indian skin, combo/oily, no major zits (thanks OCM!), and fading hyperpigmentation. I'm in my mid-20s, so I also use some general anti-aging products, and religiously wear sunscreen.

I don't have dry skin anywhere else on my body (like how you can have chapped lips and a non-dry face), I'm healthy in every other way, I've had a recent full STI checkup with 100% negative results and no new sexual partners since then.

I wash around my lady parts (not in) with vaguely soapy hands but mostly water.

*Problem statement*: Certain products ""ball up"" on the skin after other products are applied over them.

*Educated guess*: Many products contain thickening or gelation agents.  Common thickening/gelation agents include [hydroxyethylcellulose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyethyl_cellulose), [polyvinyl alcohol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvinyl_alcohol), and [xantham gum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanthan_gum).  These products are water-soluble, which means they aren't going to be too happy being around oils.  When cosmetics products are applied to the skin, these agents will remain as a residue on the skin.  By mechanically rubbing the skin, they are rubbed off; by using an oil, they want to ball up to minimize the contact between their oleophobic surface and the oil.

*Minor support*: In the aforementioned thread, a second person reported the phenomenon occuring with Paula's Choice BHA gel + oil moisturizing afterward.  I use a BHA serum of BHA + propylene glycol (no gelation agents) and do not experience said issue when moisturizing with oil.

*Gather further support* If anyone else has this experience, please mention what product combinations you use!  I'm curious!

**EDIT:** Ah hah! It does seem like the common thread is that there is a gel product (or at least a thickened serum) being used before/after another oil-based substance.

From the text: 

&gt; However, the exact aetiology of scalp psoriasis is unknown, and the condition is complex, resembling or coexisting with the skin disorder seborrhoeic dermatitis. Histologically, the two conditions can be indistinguishable, although seborrhoeic dermatitis is generally characterized by erythematosquamous lesions preferentially localized on the scalp, face and trunk, whereas the hallmark of scalp psoriasis is regression of the sebaceous glands and penetration of lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leucocytes into the epidermis.1,16 In addition, both scalp disorders have been associated with Malassezia yeast infection. 

The authors indicated that some clinicians refer to the mixed condition as ""seborrhiasis"" which I found clever. 

In addition, the authors mention that psoriasis can develop from SD due to a [Koebner response](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koebner_phenomenon) to the yeast.

A few months ago I discovered /r/SkincareAddiction and started the Beginner's Skincare Routine (CeraVe foaming, Stridex in the red box, CeraVe in the tub and mineral oil to remove make-up), hoping it would help my sensitive and blemish-prone skin. But alas, I saw little to no improvement. It seemed like I was getting more bumps! I was in denial and wanted so badly for this to work, it seemed to have helped so many on SCA! I thought maybe my skin needed more time, I tried too much too fast and needed to even out. After two months I had to throw in the towel. 


I started switching products out, one-by-one. I switched from Stridex (BHA) to Nip + Fab Glycolic Fix (AHA), then CeraVe Foaming Cleanser to Spectro Jel. I liked that so much I tried a Spectro Hydracare moisturizer for dry skin in place of CeraVe in the tub. I also tried their 2.5% BP lotion for break-out areas. I switched plain mineral oil for Ponds Cold Cream (fragrance here has not bothered me...yet) to remove my makeup. Ta-dah! Results! Redness started to fade, skin texture started to smooth out and break outs started to clear. 


I learned my lesson, what works for some won't necessarily work for me. The Beginner's Routine was helpful, but the products weren't my miracle workers and I had to try things out myself. 


You have helped me so much SCA! I have some questions for you! I know Spectro brand isn't readily available everywhere but has any one else had much experience with their products? Is there a weekly treatment/mask I should try to continue to help my skin's texture? I have tried Aztec Secret with ACV and it seems to be too drying/harsh for me. Should I give CeraVe products another chance? I still have so much product left and I suspect Stridex was the major contributing factor in my lack of success, maybe CeraVe without it would be ok?


* TL;DR: Tried Beginner's Skincare Routine for 2 months, it didn't work out. Started replacing products one-by-one and found my routine but my skin is still a work in progress.

OCM has been incredible for my skin, I get eczema above my lips that has been tamer than ever with this method of washing, I don't think I will EVER turn back. However, in the last few weeks (4-6) my skin has gradually been having some impurities pop up that miraculously cleared up quickly after I began oil cleansing, and some I haven't had before. About 2 weeks ago I noticed by pores were HUGE, and sebaceous filaments were spreading all over my nose (i usually have some on the tip) and now are on my chin, and my forehead.

I've been using the Cerave Foaming Cleanser, Purity by Philosophy as a makeup remover, and Cerave lotion in the tub as recommended as well, but had noticed my skin getting more textured since I had no exfoliation.

I had been afraid (like many comments I've seen) to put something like an acid on my face.  My skin is very sensitive; I will break out, dry out, or gush oil at the drop of a hat.  I've struggled with acne since I hit puberty at 13, and only now with this gentler regime am I finally seeing clear skin.

The pads are very small and thin but 1 definitely does the trick.  They smell fairly pleasant due to the apricot, lemon, and orange extracts in the mix.  As soon as I finished swiping my face with the pad my skin tingled pleasantly for a few minutes.  I would recommend only using these at night because they do leave a slight residue that is a little tacky.

Even after 1 use, I woke up in the morning, touched my chin where I had a TON of little bumps, and it much smoother.  I am excited to see how my skin is after a week of use.

I've recently given her Cerave Cream and Avene Skin Recovery Cream to try out, and both were a fail. The Cerave immediately, and after a couple days with the Avene.

One face lotion does not give her a bad reaction: DHC Extra Nighttime Moisture.  She also can use Giorgio Armani LSF and LRP Anthelios spf60 fluid.

At first I thought maybe it's only 'cones, but that she can do 'canes, however that doesn't seem like the case.  Below are the ingredients.

It's a tricky because people do differ in their triggers but I think it would at least be good to read!

My current routine :
Was face once every evening with Simple Gentle Facial Cleanser
Moisturise with lots of E45

Dietary changes :
More water!
Cut out food with high acid content (no fruit except mangoes and apple), no tomatoes, no spinach, butternut squash, no meat (fish occasionally).  Really found dropping the spinach and tomatoes helped!  I try not to drink at all.

Supplements :
Zinc, vit C and Lysine.

General things that help :
Relaxation and mindfullness have actually probably made the biggest impacts.  Have pretty bad anxiety and my skin flares in direct relation to it.  Also, staying out of the sun - I haven't been able to find a sunscreen that doesn't break me out so I just wear hats and try to stay in the shade.

I really hope this post can help someone",unimportanttaco,42,19,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1cijgw/after_8_years_this_is_what_finally_cured_my_acne/,"Before I begin, I want to warn everyone and say that this is not a cheap cure. Less expensive than Accutane (I assume), but still not cheap. I wish I had better news than that!
Also, I am not a dermatologist. I do not understand why this product works so well, because I do not believe that was the intention of the product. But I'm not complaining!
My story:
I have had stubborn acne since middle school. Lots of angry red bumps that hurt. I also had a lot of little dots covering my forehead that NEVER went away, no matter what. I was also really bad about picking at them. I caked on the makeup until I got into high school, where I began to take better care of my skin. In middle school I wiped my face with Clinique toner before bed/before school. I was too lazy to do more than that, even though my parents tried to help me. In high school, I learned how to better apply makeup to hide the acne (and acne scars) but even trying a real face washing regimen, my skin didn't change. I was so frustrated. I felt embarrassed when I had to look people in the eye and I would only allow friends to face certain sides of me in order to hide the worst acne spots. I hated natural light because I showed how much makeup I had on. I hated swimming with friends because the makeup would wash off. And I refused to let my boyfriend (now husband) to look at me when I woke up in the morning because he would see my face without makeup. I wore a full face of makeup almost 24/7 which in turn made my pores clog worse. It was a cycle.
Finally, out of high school, I began to work in a makeup and fragrance department store much like Macy's. I became friends with my coworkers, and because of my working environment, I was able to get honest advice from friends on particular products ranging from makeup, to skincare, to perfume. I also had access to free samples. I began using a product called Stri-Vectins Get Even Brightening Serum.I took home a couple samples to give it a shot because the bottle price was about $80 for 1.7 oz and waaay too expensive to take a chance on. I bought the product intending to use it to lighten my acne scars. Also, after seeing phenomenal results from customers I had sold them to, I bought a Clarisonic (employee discount gave me half price off of $120).  My skin has never felt so smooth before. It literally got everything out of my pores. After about a week of the Clarisonic, I used my first sample of the Stri-Vectin serum. It is intended to brighten age spots and dark marks but i noticed that only days after using it my skin had no more angry bumps on it. It seemed to take the redness away and I already saw improvement in my scars. The bumps I had left were less swollen and less common in a matter of weeks (like, 2). I had never felt so excited and confident. It seriously changed the outlook I had on myself. But the samples ran out and the bumps came back. I caved and bought a bottle, but I didn't regret it. I worked perfectly. And it kinda smells like oranges. And I believed my happiness and comfort was worth it. I went through two bottles of the stri vectin stuff in about 5 months. I was very careful to use every drop and use as less as possible. It was the first time in my entire life I was acne free. 
My husband got transferred and money got tight because we were budgeting. Once my stri vectin ran out I didn't buy anymore because I didn't want to spend the money. My acne came back fast. I believe stress had something to do with it too. I put off buying it, put off buying, put off buying it... until I just couldn't stand it anymore. But I happened to be walking through Costco and I saw that they were selling 2 oz of the formula for only $45 dollars. I was SO excited. This was a couple weeks ago, and I am once again acne free. I am finally unashamed of my skin. And I will NEVER stop using this product.
If anyone has an idea of why this product worked so well, please tell me, cause I have no idea. 
My current skin-care routine is to use my clarisonic twice a day, one in the morning and one at night with some garnier cleanser, I use primer under my makeup to prevent some foundation from getting in my pores. I use Clinique moisturizing lotion in the morning and I use Garnier Dark Spot Corrector moisturizer at night, after my stri vectin. I am also on birth control, and I know that is helping a lot too.
SO:
Clarisonic: One-time $120, brush head replacements $25
Stri-Vectin: $45
Clinique: $30ish?
Garnier: $20

I've never had the ""OMG I'm getting old and looking it"" panic until recently. I'm approaching 30 and want to start taking better care of my skin aside from using SPF. I err on the combination oily/dry side of things (dry cheeks and chin, oil T-zone), still break out in relation to my cycle (gah), and have noticed that I'm looking a bit wrinkly and the smooth youth-ness of my face is disappearing (cry).

I only wear concealer as needed for breakouts and a light drug store powder to decrease shininess. I wash with Origin's Checks and Balances at night (that stuff lasts FOREVER) and moisturize with coconut oil after my morning shower.

What products are worth considering? Are there any decent drug store purchases to be made? I suppose I'm looking to exfoliate, moisturize--and if at all possible and not just a scam--firm up and decrease wrinkles.

I know NOTHING about skin care and don't want to go to Origins and spend hundreds of dollars on products that are all talk with no delivery. I have liked what I've used from there though.

I've read through the applicable guides in the FAQ and searched the history in this subreddit and I'm still left feeling dumb with no answers. Direct product recommendations would be very appreciated.

I have never really had ""bad"" skin but it has always had its problems that I didn't really know how to deal with. Random break outs, dry/splotchy patches, always super red out of the shower, and the worst offender: milia on the orbitals and below my eyes spreading out to my cheeks.  

My skincare regime was pretty much failing me- I'd wash my face with St Ives Apricot scrub every time I showered (about 2-3 times a week) and then use Cetaphil lotion when I got out. I had spot benzoyl peroxide cream that I would occasionally use but never regularly.  I never did anything at night- I'd just go to bed with my makeup on. After discovering this sub and with the new year coming up, I decided to invest in products and really try to turn around my skin, especially the milia! 

I found some Aveeno ""Naturals"" face wash at my house so I started using that nightly &amp; when I shower, and I got some witch hazel to use as a toner. I'm still using the Cetaphil face lotion, but alternate that every day with moisturizer with AHA in it. I bought some Aztec Indian Clay &amp; use it weekly (WHICH I LOVE!). I purchased makeup removing wipes and now am doing that every night I am ""too lazy"" to actually wash with the face wash. 

Maybe I am jumping the gun here but I noticed today (after about 1 week of this treatment) that my milia on one side of my face is disappearing!! This thrills me because I have honestly had them as long as I can remember (I used Ponds Cold Cream as a makeup remover for about 10 years- now switched to a liquid eye makeup remover) and have never seemed to be able to get rid of them.

EDIT: Nolan, K. and Marmur, E. (2012), Moisturizers: Reality and the skin benefits. Dermatologic Therapy, 25: 229–233.           Here is a quote I read earlier about the efficacy of petroleum jellies   ""There are four main classes of moisturizers: occlusives, humectants, emollients, and rejuvenators.

Occlusives
Occlusives work by forming a hydrophobic layer on the surface of the skin providing an exogenous barrier to water loss. Because they prevent evaporation from the skin, they can be particularly effective when applied to already dampened skin. Occlusives are the most common type of moisturizers used in formulations [1].

Although occlusives are not the most appealing of ingredients to consumers, due in part to their greasy feel, petrolatum, the prototypic occlusive, it is actually the most effective moisturizer and reduces transepidermal water loss by 99% [7]. Petrolatum is the most commonly used active agent in skin care products, after water [1]. Occlusives are well tolerated among individuals and are often used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. A recent study [8] found that an over-the-counter (OTC) petroleum-based skin moisturizer (Aquaphor Healing Ointment, Beiersdorf, Wilton, CT) was as clinically effective in treating mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis as a more expensive ceramide containing prescription barrier cream. Petrolatum also can help restore the stratum corneum barrier by penetrating into its upper layers and initiating the production of intercellular lipids, including free sterols, sphingolipids, and free fatty acids [9]. Petrolatum is also able to reduce the appearance of fine lines caused by dehydration. Although principally an occlusive, petrolatum can also act as an emollient (discussed in more detail later) and fills the spaces between desquamating corneocytes making the skin smooth and soft.""

I've had moderate acne since the end of high school and I'm more than a little tired of looking like a pimply teenager now that I'm 24. Also, I have just gotten my seasonal job back and it requires me to wear a lot of grease paint, special effects makeup and to sweat a lot and this naturally causes me to breakout more. 

Here are some of my concerns. I have oily skin with moderate acne and it seemed like jojoba oil would be the best carrier oil, so maybe after trying it for a few days I'm wrong about that. I knew that I would probably breakout starting this new cleansing method, but I didn't expect it to look like I use a slice of double pepperoni to wash my face in the morning (seriously, this is the worst acne I've had since high school. The breakouts are large, painful and all over my face) and that no matter how I much I try to get the oil off, it just builds up more during the day. My biggest concern yet is regarding the sebum plugs. Everything I have read about OCM swears that in the first five minutes of using OCM for the first time those sebum plugs should start coming out. Well, it's been five days and not a single one has come out and that makes me think that this probably isn't for me.

So, is this clearly a lost cause? Should I try to tough it out? Or if the sebum plugs aren't coming out is it clear this isn't working? Any answers or suggestions are appreciated.

Pretty bad - some of the wounds would actually send me into shock when I tried to clean them. Even though what I did was self-destructive, I was always *exceedingly* meticulous about cleaning them and caring for the wounds. The worst of the damage was done to my thighs; I did some to my wrists, but I didn't really want people to know and question me about it. 

I haven't cut in a long time - probably somewhere around 10+ years. I know that the scars will probably never go away, and even if they do, it won't happen on their own or by something I do or apply - I'll have to either get laser treatment or grafts (like I said, they're bad). 

However, I was looking at them today, and they're *different*. Where they're usually somewhat puffy, some of them (especially the larger ones) have dimples around the edges??? Here's [some pictures](http://imgur.com/a/c7k4M). They ""dimples"" are darker than the scars and my skin - more of a purple/red-ish color - and significantly more 'sunken' than either of them, as well. 

Can anyone tell me what's going on here? Is this normal for scars so old? I haven't been doing anything different - I did allow them to burn slightly a few years ago, thinking the sun might help fade them since they were old, haven't been stark-white for ages (I guess they're picking up melanin finally), and I've heard that UV light can help ""spread"" melanin for those who don't have it in certain areas of their body. I know it was stupid, but it only happened once, the burn wasn't bad (just a little red on my thighs - didn't hurt at all), and I've learned my lesson. This couldn't be sun damage so long after the fact when my legs haven't been exposed to sun since (literally - they haven't seen the light of day since then), right???

I found this subreddit a few weeks ago and I am overwhelmed with how much info is here! It's all good stuff, just a lot of it. Anyway, if you all would be so kind, I'd like some help on what order in which to use my stuff and when I should use them (I didn't even know that AM/PM routines were a thing until I found skincareaddiction).  

Skin type: It feels kind of waxy. I get some acne, but it has started to fade in the past year (I started birth control, so I guess it helped). I'm also a little blotchy which looks funny since I'm pale. I look kind of like a pepperoni pizza.

Stuff I have:

Dickinson's Original Witch Hazel (have been usuing for a few weeks)
Studio35Beauty Oil-Free Moisturizing Lotion (I have a sneaking suspicion that this makes me break out so I wanna get something else)
Origins Super Spot Remover Acne Treatment Gel (just ordered so I haven't actually used it yet)
Africare 100% Mineral Oil (just ordered so I haven't used this one yet either)
(Skincareaddiction has taught me that I need a sunscreen so I promise I'll get one soon - suggestions on which one?).

And some questions...:

In what order should I apply these? And at what time of day?

I read here that mineral oil in good for unclogging pores/blackheads and also good for removing makeup. I don't wear any during the week, but I wear a TON of stage makeup every other weekend (pale face, heavy eyeliner, dark eye shadow, ect) and I usually use makeup remover towelettes which hurt my face when I rub too hard. Would mineral oil be enough to get all that makeup off? Should I use the oil and my normal towelettes? 

I also need a new moisturizer because mine feels slimy on my face and I think it's making me break out. This sub seems to like CeraVe, but what's the difference between CeraVe cream and CeraVe lotion? Is one for day and the other for night?

I'm a 19 y/o male who has dealt with with acne since I was 13. I'm almost done with my second round of accutane! The first time I came out of it with completely clear and balanced skin, however my acne decided to come back pretty severely about year ago, so I decided to go on one more time to get rid of it for good. Luckily, it's doing it's job again, my acne has been reduced quite a lot once more. However, this time I'm facing a different problem. Even before I started accutane the skin on my face below my eyes was abnormally prone to being red, the odd thing is it does not affect my forehead or anything below my chin and jawline. Here's a picture, sorry it's not the best quality.  http://imgur.com/d6eQum0 Anyway, I thought accutane might do something about this...it hasn't. 
So, is there any product I can use to revive the balance and color in my skin and make the rest of my face look like my forehead? I've never encountered anyone that it only affects part of their face like this. It just baffles me.

Edit: It may be important to note that I've never gotten acne on my forehead either...
Edit 2: Hey guys, thanks for all your help today! I just have one more question. If I were to apply the raw honey mask and utilize the ""Beginner's Skincare Routine,"" would the combination of all of those products only cause to irritate my skin more and not help the redness?

My face has always been clear until last year, I started to get one or two pimples at a time and a couple blackheads, it wasn't a big deal and when summer approached my skin cleared up. But ever since the start of this past school year I seem to be getting more and more acne, even now that it's summer it doesn't appear to be clearing up.

I've tried everything and none of it works, numerous basic face washes (different scrubs/exfoliants/deep cleanser). I've tried neutrogena's skin ID, I've tried fragrance/perfume free acne cleansers,I've tried baking soda, I've tried tea tree oil, I've tried an aloe Vera gel and olive leaf extract facial mask, I've even went to a dermatologist and got antibiotics (which didn't help at all then made me break out worse when I stopped taking them) and a topical gel (tretinoin).

I've tried changing my diet, at first I thought the very simple ""don't eat greasy food"" method would work. After more research I learned that it was sugary, not greasy food that makes you break out, so I cut back on sugary food (which had very little affect because I already had a pretty healthy diet due to participating in athletics). After that didn't work I thought maybe I was breaking out due to taking creatine even though I've been taking it for three years now.

The only thing that seems to help a very small amount is laying out in the sun and I can't do that very much because, you know, cancer and stuff.
I try not to pop my pimples and wash my face twice a day but yet I still look like this

I smeared on some Ponds to remove my makeup the other day (after realizing I wasn't doing enough to remove it at night), and after wiping it off, I noticed a visible improvement in my skin's texture. As an experiment, I stopped using my regular cleanser and for the past couple of days have been using it AM and PM, and my skin looks really hydrated and luminous. 

So I'm wondering, cold cream being a cleanser, should I be following it up with another cleanser? At night I use the cold cream, followed by Stridex sensitive skin pads and St. Ives exfoliation pads, followed by a night cream (right now I really like the Korres wild rose cream). In the morning, I use cold cream, followed by a Made from Earth rosehip syrum, followed by Dermadoctor Calm, Cool, and Corrected moisturizer (and sunscreen, of course!). I haven't experienced any breakouts (in fact, one very stubborn, pesky clogged pore on my cheek has JUST gone away), but I've read that some people break out with Pond's new formulation of the cold cream, and wasn't sure if it was better to double cleanse when using it.

I've been active in this community for several months now and I've learned so much from all of you wonderful members so I'm pretty excited to be able to take a more active role in it. 

A little about me:

* First up I'm a biology and public health major so I'm a scientist first and a sucker for a peer reviewed journal article. Anything that I recommend or use has the benefit of clinical research behind it.

* I also work in a research lab in an unrelated field. Neurobiology hearing stuff, if your're curious about glial cells let me know. 

* My interest in skincare started young. I've had near lifelong acne issues and have tried just about every prescription and OTC drug and treatment available from Proactiv to Accutane. AMA

* Currently using the beginner's routine for acne-prone skin with a mineral oil pre-cleanse (you guys blew my little mind with the mineral oil/vaseline bit, I never thought I'd be putting that stuff on my face willingly) and Tazorac 0.1%.

* I'm super fair skinned and a sucker for sun protection. Sunscreen is great but I'm also a big proponent of sunglasses, hats and UPF clothing. Especially because I love to vacation at central lattitudes and high altitudes. If my ginger butt can spend [three 8 hour days in the Anza Borrego](http://i.imgur.com/Ezv2o6n.jpg) with nary a tint of pink then I'm pretty confident that sun damage is almost entirely avoidable. 

* I'd post before/after pictures but 1. I don't really have before pictures and 2. My skin is a work in progress. But [here is my bare face](http://i.imgur.com/p9dxXm7.jpg) Again, that's Costa Rica trip day 5, no sunburn, it is possible.

The product is listed [here](http://www.avibon.com/Homeoplasmine-40g-with-Free-Shipping-Tracking-0048728.htm9).  The ingredients given on the page are:

Calendula officinalis, Phytolacca officinalis, Bryonia, Benzoin, Boric acid, and Vaselinum album.

Candelula officinalis:  [marigold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendula_officinalis).  

Phytolacca officinalis: Googling did not show this appearing as an actual species, but the [Phytolacca genus is basically pokeweed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytolacca). 

Byronia: [Flowering plant in the cucumber family](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryonia).

Benzoin: [extract from a tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzoin); source of benzoic acid; preservative, antifungal).

Boric acid: pH adjuster, mild detergent and antiseptic.

**Vaselinum album**: [Petroleum jelly](https://www.google.com/search?q=vaselinum+album&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;channel=fs).

I've been putting BP on it, but that hasn't been doing much, no change in redness or puffiness.


Last night I found an unopened bottle of TTO, and I figured I'd try it out. 


  I also had some Neem oil, which I hear amazing things about in terms or irritation/acne/ etc.


I dabbed a bit of Neem on the spot--insert chicken ramen noodle smell here---and mixed a teenie bit of TTO with some sweet almond, and dabbed that on the area.


I woke up this morning and the spot definitely has significantly flattened and the redness is definitely decreased.



I'm certainly pleased with the results!!! At the rate that the redness/puffiness decreased overnight, this thing should be gone by morning!",,False,self,t5_2tbbg,False,,,True,t3_19rx7p,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/19rx7p/so_this_is_what_the_neem_oiltea_tree_oil_fuss_is/,

She has used it twice now and is thrilled. The redness was soothed and the blemishes started shrinking the first evening she used it, and after using it last night, the breakouts are diminished to almost invisible without make up (except the areas of broken skin that will need to heal.) It really just shrinks it down and soothes the inflammation, without drying her skin or causing irritation. It's almost too good to be true and I'm sort of waiting to see what the down side is. She's going to try using it as a spot treatment overnight.

We'll get her a less drying cleanser and a moisturizer, but if her skin keeps responding to the mask, I don't know that she needs more acne-specific care. I was sort of sold on the acne.com regimen because I could easily understand it and it was affordable, so I still have that info as well as the whole thread if the mask doesn't keep working for her.

Also, she says she wishes she'd known about this mask when her school did zombie day for Halloween. It sort of freaks out her younger brother. So it's a complete win for her.

So I guess what I came here to say is thank you, thank you, THANK YOU. You guys don't know how much this has all meant to me.

I have recently started wearing makeup and sunscreen so I figured I would add an actual cleanser and moisturizer. Up until not I have only used OCM. No sunscreen.

I just started using Cerave cleanser and and cream. The cream contains dimethocone but the cleanser does not have a sulfate. I know with hair I need a sulfate to remove it. It does contain Behentrimonium Methosulfate which is not a real sulfate.

Another question, any recommendations on drugstore moisturizers and sunscreen that does not contain dimethocone? Are there even any? I have searched nearly every moisturizer bottle on the shelves and they all seem to have it. I have been using the cream for 3 days now and woke up with several pimples now. I switched to the OCM because of occasional breakouts. I am thinking perhaps it was the dimethocone that caused problems before.

I don't have oily skin like I thought: I have really dry, sensitive skin that was oily because I was over-washing. I don't have clogged pores because I didn't exfoliate enough: I have them because I over-exfoliated. It's been pretty enlightening and I've switched to using the oil cleansing method to address my issues.

Here's my question: the clogged pores seem to be clearing up, but they're doing so by ""coming to the surface,"" so to speak. They turn into full-blown red, deep, gross breakouts that take weeks to clear up, but when they DO clear up the pores aren't clogged any more. They're all on my jawline and cheeks; my nose, chin, and forehead are all clear. Is that normal? If so, what can I do to speed up the process of healing? If not, what am I doing wrong?

Here's my current routine:

A.M. -- rinse face with lukewarm water, moisturize with St. Ives Timeless Skin Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer

P.M. -- OCM using regular baby oil, rinse with warm water, moisturize with the same moisturizer

Once a week or every-other week I use a Dead Sea mud mask (I don't remember the brand and am at work so I can't look it up!). I've not used this for the last three weeks 'cause I'm trying to stop drying out my face.

I've recently started using tea tree oil topically on breakouts. I've only done it twice and those breakouts are still around, so I can't say much about this.

Any ideas, thoughts, or tips? I'm getting really frustrated with how bad my skin is.",,False,self,t5_2tbbg,False,,,True,t3_1eg692,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1eg692/is_this_normal_ocm_question/,

I need your help! When I was a teenager, I never had many issues with acne. I struggled with dryness of my skin, a problem I continue to struggle with. I am 22 now, and over the past year or so I have developed problems with acne, mostly in my chin area. I have heard many people attribute this to stress, but even in times when my life is not very stressful (such as right now) I continue to have this problem. I got a Clarisonic for Christmas this year, and use it once every two or three days to cleanse my skin at night. As a teen, I usually only washed my face in the morning, and never removed my makeup before bed (bad I know) but since my problems have gotten worse, I have gotten a lot better at making sure to remove my makeup and cleanse before bed. I have problems with dryness all over my face, including the areas where there is acne, which makes trying to cover it up very frustrating as concealers tend to make the flakiness even more visible. Since the winter, I have been using Kiehl's products in the attempt to add moisture to my face, and while they worked well at the beginning, the dryness does not seem to have subsided. I also have periods where the skin around my eyes gets dry and flaky. At this point, I am really just at a loss. I do not know what to do about my skin! I went to see a dermatologist in January, who prescribed me Differin topical treatment at 0.1% for my acne issues, particularly for my chin, but I have not seen any tangible results. My main goal is to get rid of the chin acne, but I suspect that would be tied into my dryness problem. I have read about oil cleansing methods, and am a lurker on here, but I haven't really seen anyone post with my particular problems, so I thought I would make a post and ask your advice. What am I doing wrong? What suggestions do you guys have for my issues? I apologize for the wall of text :S

**Me/my skin:** 22, female; dry skin, particularly around eyes and acne, acne on my chin and t-zone, with occasional large painful zits on my cheekbones and around my hairline. The acne on my chin tends to be either small, skin coloured bumps, or large red zits/whiteheads. Small issues with redness. Sensitive skin to the point where I cannot use makeup wipes to take off my makeup (dries out my skin, tends to burn when I put moisturizer on).

**Products/regimen I use:** 
**at night**, I take off my eye makeup with water and a washcloth, I cleanse with Kiehl's ""Ultra Face Cleanser"", tone with Kiehl's ""Ultra Facial Toner"", moisturize with Kiehl's ""Ultra Facial Moisturizer"", and I put Kiehl's ""Creamy Eye Treatment"" around my eye area; I use my Clarisonic every 2-3 nights, and alternate with Differin topical treatment at 0.1% every 2-3 nights. 
**In the morning**, I splash my face with water, and use the same toner and moisturizer before applying my makeup.

I'm not looking for tailored recommendations for me--I'm interested in knowing what products **you** personally have arrived at based on your own criteria (whatever those may be) and research.

I'll go first. I'm still experimenting: 

I love [Elta MD UV Clear SPF 46](http://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=129120/Elta_MD_UV_Clear_SPF_46/0/Sunscreen) for the following reasons:

* feels very light and dries clear
* high SPF
* zinc oxide for partial physical protection
* mild--doesn't break me out or sting if it gets in my eyes
* niacinamide for skincare benefits

I'm still experimenting with others because: 

* apparently the PPD isn't great. 
* It would be nice if I could find an all-physical alternative because I often don't remember to apply 30 mins before going out in the sun, but I'm not sure I can have both that and high UVA protection. 
* It's a little expensive (but I'm willing to buy it at that price point). 
* the packaging is kind of annoying; hard to tell how much is left until you just suddenly run out.

I just ran out of this and am now trying [Shiseido Hada Senka Mineral UV Gel](http://web1.sasa.com/SasaWeb/eng/product/viewProductDetail.jspa?itemno=105938212001), which is PA+++ rated, another physical/chemical combo, and looks/feels great on the skin so far, but comes in such a tiny bottle and is slightly annoying to source (I bought it from Sasa, but they're now out of stock--I know I can get it on eBay or Amazon, but it's sort of annoying to have to look around). I will have to see how I like it once I've used it a while longer.

Skin type: combination but fairly well-behaved/non-sensitive, some freckles/hyperpigmentation that I want to protect myself from, but I'm NC30 and don't burn too easily. I hate sticky/greasy sunscreen or white streaks on my face--my mom used to always give me tubes of the Clinique stuff, but it always made me feel so pasty and streaky.

Wanted to share.,sie_liebt,26,4,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1d3ewq/finally_found_my_holy_grail_cleanser_for_oily/,"I ordered the SKin79 O2 BB Cleanser. It finally came in about 3 days ago. In the past three days of using it, I've already noticed drastic results. 

I'm normally *very* oily. I deal with large, clogged pores and lots of sebaceous filaments. Over the years I've tried innumerable cleansers and creams and treatments (some great, some terrible for my skin).  

This cleanser is pretty interesting and kind of fun to use. It comes out as a gel that you massage onto your dry face. For two minutes, while you leave it alone, it bubbles and foams by itself. It's pretty ticklish and entertaining. After 2 minutes, you massage it back down into your face, rinse with lukewarm water, and pat dry. 

I was a little skeptical that it would really cleanse off my makeup, but it actually does an amazing job. My skin feels clean and tight (but not in a bad way). In the past few days, I've noticed a remarkable reduction in oil production (I only have to blot once around midday and I *could* get away with skipping that and embracing the ""healthy glow"" if I wasn't so obsessed with a matte appearance) and my pores appear to be tightening back up, shrinking if you will. I've had no new irritations or breakouts and the ones that were healing appear to be healing a little faster than normal. I use it morning and night and for the first time in my life, when I wake up, my skin isn't oily. I'm all around astounded and I really just needed a place to gush (none of my guy friends really care all that much about the goos I put on my face). 

Have any of you tried this or any other Asian cleansers? How did it/they work out for you? Anything anyone knows that I should be worried about using this product (I'm always waiting for something awful to ruin the good things lol)?

I know a lot of people cry out against Lavender Oil because they heard it was cytotoxic (I was one of them until I started *reading* about the issue). I'm pretty certain the scare has to do with a misinterpretation of research. Lavender Oil was found to be cytotoxic *in vitro* to endothelium cells (lining the interior of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels) and fibroblasts. A 2005 study states: ""although it was recently reported that lavender oil, and its major constituent linalyl acetate, are toxic to human skin cells in vitro, contact dermatitis to lavender oil appears to occur at only a very low frequency. The relevance of this in vitro toxicity to dermatological application of Lavandula oils remains unclear."" And in 2007 a team of European researchers testing photosensitivity in relation to lavender oil and sandalwood oil found: ""Lavender oil and sandalwood oil did not induce photohaemolysis in our test system. However, a few reports on photosensitivity reactions due to these substances have been published, e.g. one patient with persistent light reaction and a positive photo-patch test to sandalwood oil."" So, please, spare me the diatribes about how ""terrible"" Lavender Oil is. I used to give them. And I was as misinformed as anyone else.

I'd used plenty of drugstore AHA/BHA stuff, but never seen much of a difference. Years later, I started working at a cosmetics counter that sold high end peels and finally tried a stronger one. Oh. My. God.


Angles sang. The skies opened. Jesus wept. 


Suddenly, my pores were clear, my skin was more even, and all my fine lines seemed to melt away. I'd never seen my skin look that great! So far, I've used: Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Daily Peel, Algenist Triple Action Micropolish and Peel, Peter Thomas Roth Unwrinkle Peel Pads, Peter Thomas Roth Pumpkin Enzyme Peel, and Ole Henriksen Micro Mini Peel. I've been happy with all of them, but I'm itching to try something a little stronger. I really had no idea you could do those at home on your own until I saw a post here one day. In my head, anything stronger was going to make me look like Samantha from Sex in the City at Carrie's book party. 



So brass tacks, what have you guys and gals tried and been really happy with? I want something stronger than the above products, but I also don't want my face peeling for a week and looking all Strange Invaders, either. 


Suggestions?



*EDIT: Thanks for the help, you guys! I really appreciate it. I've been reading and watching a lot of videos. I contacted a few of my esthetician friends, too, and that's been helpful. At this point, I'm just trying to decide between 8-12.5% TCA. Definitely going with MUAC.*

1364064474.0,19,self.SkincareAddiction,1avdmh,Review of Bioderma Photoderm MAX Sun Milk SPF 50+ UVA 38,canadaiscool,21,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1avdmh/review_of_bioderma_photoderm_max_sun_milk_spf_50/,"Link to product: http://www.bioderma.com/en/nc/the-products/what-s-new/product/characteristics/220.html

Here is the ingredients list on CosDNA: http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_8e3781393.html

After testing my old standby Aveeno 30 SPF sunscreen (on that sunscreen filter site I can't find a link for) and seeing how low the UVA protection was, I bought this because I saw it on [Skinacea's sunscreen recomendations](http://www.skinacea.com/products/sunscreens.html#.UQ2cBaU8CSo). It's not sold where I live (US) so I ordered it from tubotica for about 30 dollars for 100 ml. (Related note: if anyone's been wary of ordering from there, I found their service excellent and this sunscreen seems legit and it doesn't expire until 2015)

So far I've used it about 5 times a week for the past two weeks and I think it would work for any skin type, especially oily or acne prone individuals. I wish it were more moisturizing though. It may be a little drying, as it has alcohol in it, so if you have really dry skin you may want to use the [Cream instead of Milk.](http://www.bioderma.com/en/nc/the-products/what-s-new/product/action/215.html)

The protection is excellent. I feel super protected. It's super sunny nearly every day where I live and I have very fair, sensitive skin that gets pink after 10 minutes in direct sun. With this sunscreen, even hours after I applied it, I don't get any pinkness. It seems to really stick to my skin but I'd still definitely reapply it every couple hours if I went outside more often. (I am only using it for incidental sun exposure like walking to my car.) It's marketed as water resistant as well, though I can't confirm that since I haven't gone swimming or anything in it (yet). 

It's a runny, liquidy fluid so it comes really quickly out of the bottle. I found the texture weird at first, it's sort of like rubbing a more watery Elmer's glue on my face. It smells a little like glue too. It ""soaks in"" really quickly and once it's in, it leaves a slight rubbery/sticky  feel to the skin. The box says it has a ""velvety effect"" but I didn't experience anything like that. It doesn't make my skin look oily after application but it does give off a sheen. It's not that bad though. I tend to use a pretty decent amount of sunscreen so if you only use a little, you might not experience all the sheen and rubberyness.

I haven't have any adverse reactions. It doesn't make me break out or look oily, and I am somewhat acne prone and a little oily in my T-zone. That alone makes this product great for me.

I haven't had any adverse reactions mixing it with other products.

I would definitely re-buy. My only gripe is that I wish it were moisturizing so i didn't have to wear a seperate moisturizer and sunscreen at once.

Let me know if you have any questions about it.

Back when I was a young lass in high school, I always got cystic like acne spots on my bum.  My mom and I always just thought it could be from cheerleading and dance: being in sweaty clothes for too long, that could be contributing.  I never noticed that it would get a bit worse around shark week.


This was the **only** area I'd break out, so I was never too concerned, maybe a bit embarrassed due to scarring come the summertime. 


Fast forward to a couple months ago... I had to start my birth control pack a week late, so my hormones were all off.  And what happened?  I broke out like I was in highschool again.  I never noticed the correlation that when I had started my BC this breakout issue was completely resolved.


I asked around--people who work in derm, my gyno, my derm--- and apparently, the bum breakout can also be attributed to hormones. Who knew?   I thought it was really just the jawline/chin.   



I hope this might help some ladies out there who suffer/suffered with an issue like this.  Talk to your gyno and/or your derm, because you may be able to do something about it!

So with that in mind, here's [mine](http://i.imgur.com/WoYiV.jpg?1). Descriptions are in the order that I use them (different order than picture, sorry).

For context, I have quite bad acne, which is why so much of my stuff is prescription. I have combination skin, and right now the dry areas are reallly dry due to a combo of winter and Retin-A

* Clindamycin 1% topical lotion - antibacterial lotion prescribed by my dermatologist. I don't use any cleansers in the morning, just use this after rinsing my face with water. I don't find it to be drying, but as far as I can tell it doesn't really do.... anything.

* CeraVe AM Moisturizer - I use a small amount of this just for the SPF. In the summer it's great for moisturizing without making me shiny, but now that it's winter it's not quite enough to do the job.

* First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream - my most favoritest moisturizer ever. I've been using it for a few weeks now, and my skin has completely stopped flaking. I use just enough to cover my face with a thin layer over the CeraVe.

* DDF Non-drying Gentle Cleanser - I was looking for a sulfate-free cleanser because Cetaphil was really stripping my skin, and found this at TJ Maxx for $10 or so. It had good reviews so I picked it up (btw, I love smartphones. Reading reviews at the store has saved me so much money). As promised, it removes my makeup, cleanses my skin and doesn't dry me out. I'm not sure it's amazing enough to pay retail price for it, but it works alright.

* Clenia Foaming Wash - prescription face wash. A couple times a week I use this instead of the DDF; it's a little too drying to use every day. I'm not really sure why they call it a 'foaming' wash, because I've gone through almost the whole bottle and never once seen a bit of foam.

* Retin-A Micro .04% - oh man. This stuff. Prescription. I stopped using it for about a month back in August, because I was preparing to go on Accutane. I decided against the Accutane (was having some other medical issues and my primary care didn't want me starting new medications unless I reeeeally had to), and started back up in... mid-September, maybe? It's been pretty much standard operating procedure. For a couple weeks my skin was pretty dry, then it broke out horribly for 3-4 weeks. For about the last month my skin has been slooooowly healing up from that, but it still looks pretty bad. For a while there cold weather/Retin-A was completely wrecking my skin (it was peeling off in dime-sized chunks), but now I finally have the right combo of cleanser/moisturizer to keep the dryness in check, at least. I started out using Retin-A as directed (2 pumps every night), which was awful, so I backed it down to one pump every other night, mixed with moisturizer. At this point I'm up to 1 pump every night.

* After the Retin-A absorbs I apply the FAB moisturizer pretty liberally.

* Equate Cleansing Mask - this is supposedly a good dupe of the Proactive Clay Mask, which I haven't used - never got into Proactive since I'm allergic to benzoyl peroxide. I use this as a spot treatment, since sulfur is the only thing that really seems to reduce the size/duration of my existing breakouts. It's a little bit drying, but not unreasonably so.

* Clarisonic Mia - I use this a couple times a week with the DDF cleanser and the sensitive brush head. I started out using it every night, which was way too much.

While I was there I told her that, since going off the pill, the acne on my chin/jawline area has been absolutely insane. To combat the issue, I've been using Stridex in the red box and 2.5% benzoyl peroxide gel (I've also been cleansing and moisturizing with Cerave products, if you're curious). I chose these products largely because I see people rave about them all the time on here, and from what I've read, 2.5% benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be just as effective as the 10% stuff while being gentler on the skin. 

Anyway, I was really surprised by what my doctor had to say about this. She said that she actually just returned from a big dermatology conference where she learned a lot about acne treatments in particular. Apparently, 10% benzoyl peroxide treatment is not only more effective than 2.5%, but it's **the only strength that's really effective at all for acne treatment**. 

That surprised me a lot, since it's completely contrary to everything I've been reading on the subject recently. She then went on to surprise me even more by telling me that **salicylic acid has been shown to be almost completely ineffective as an acne treatment**.

Granted, my facial regimen hasn't eliminated my acne by any means, and I do get crazy flare-ups from time to time, but I like to think that it helps a *little*, at least. She also prescribed me some Retin-A gel and a new form of birth control to try, so hopefully those things will help with the acne situation somewhat. 

Anyway, I'm curious, what do you all think about this?

Edit: I have no idea what conference she went to or what exactly was said there; all I know is what she told me. ",,False,self,t5_2tbbg,1374939625.0,,,True,t3_1j4l9o,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1j4l9o/just_want_to_share_what_my_doctor_told_me_today/,

&gt; The gold standard for hyperpigmentation therapy in the United States remains hydroquinone. This substance predated formation of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and many formulations currently on the market have never been studied for safety and efficacy. These formulations include those that contain 2% hydroquinone, the maximum concentration allowed in OTC drugs, and some of the generic 4% hydroquinone formulations, only available by prescription. Other proprietary hydroquinone-containing drugs that have undergone FDA scrutiny through the investigational new drug pathway have well-established safety and efficacy validated through carefully controlled large-scale vehicle-controlled clinical trials. Many new hydroquinone formulations have appeared in the last 2 years in physician-dispensed lines, but these products have not undergone clinical study. It is this plethora of hydroquinone-containing creams for sale in many different markets that has caused health concerns.

&gt; There are several important health issues that need to be considered before determining the safety of hydroquinone. For many years, it has been known that hydroquinone can cause ochronosis (3). Whether this is a result of the effect of hydroquinone alone or other substances present in the formulation or higher concentrations of hydroquinone is unknown. Additional concern arose when oral hydroquinone was reported to cause cancer in rodents fed with large amounts of the substance, yet human carcinogenicity has not been established (4). Although oral consumption probably is not related to topical application, hydroquinone remains controversial because it may be toxic to melanocytes.

&gt; Hydroquinone, a phenolic compound chemically known as 1,4 dihydroxybenzene, functions by inhibiting the enzymatic oxidation of tyrosine and phenol oxidases. It covalently binds to histidine or interacts with copper at the active site of tyrosinase. It also inhibits RNA and DNA synthesis and may alter melanosome formation, thus selectively damaging melanocytes. These activities suppress the melanocyte metabolic processes inducing gradual decrease of melanin pigment production (5). Issues regarding the topical toxicity of hydroquinone arise because it is a strong oxidant rapidly converted to the melanocyte toxic products, p-benzoquinone and hydroxybenzoquinone. These byproducts may cause depigmentation.

&gt; Hydroquinone is very difficult to formulate in a stable preparation. It is a highly reactive oxidant that rapidly combines with oxygen. Typically, hydroquinone skin-lightening creams are a creamy color that changes to a darker yellow or brown as oxidation occurs. As the discoloration progresses, the activity of the hydroquinone decreases. Products with any off-color change should be immediately discarded.

&gt; Prescription hydroquinone formulations have tried to increase the skin-lightening potency of formulations by adding penetration enhancers such as glycolic acid or tretinoin as a supplemental pigment-lightening agent. Other prescription formulations have added microsponges to create time delivery of hydroquinone to the skin, whereas others have placed the hydroquinone in a special one-way airtight dispenser. Some formulations have added sunscreen ingredients to the hydroquinone to prevent UV-induced pigment darkening.

&gt; The future of hydroquinone in the United States is still uncertain as of this writing. Apparently, some of the controversy arose when the FDA asked the industry to perform some collaborative self-funded studies on the safety of hydroquinone and submit a written report detailing the findings. The report was not submitted as requested, and the FDA acted by stating that it would withdraw all OTC 2% hydroquinone preparations and prescription formulations that were not studied as investigational new drugs once currently manufactured supplies are depleted. Whether this ruling will be enforced and how it will be enforced is unknown. More details regarding the future of hydroquinone in the United States should be forthcoming shortly.

&gt; The potential withdrawal of hydroquinone from some of the US markets and its removal from European and Japanese markets has spurred interest in developing pigment-lightening alternatives. The remainder of this discussion will focus on other pigment-lightening ingredients and their relative efficacy and safety as compared to hydroquinone.

So after reading the FAQ and being appalled that I have used St. Ives Apricot Scrub for years (whoops), I've got CeraVe foaming cleanser, CeraVe (in the tub!) moisturizer, and Stridex (red box!) sitting in my online shopping cart. I've been reading about sunscreens and I think I definitely need a mattifying one because I get oily during the day. I read that LaRoche Posay Anthelios sunscreen is a good mattifying screen...however, I'm wondering if there is a difference between the lotion vs.the fluid? I am acne-prone with combination skin, with my t-zone being particularly oily by mid-day.

Secondly, I haven't quite found an answer to this - do I apply any makeup (i.e., foundation) after I put on that sunscreen? I currently have a BB cream that I've been using (need to buy something else, actually, because I think the shade is off, though - suggestions?), but I also occasionally use Covergirl's Clean foundation for extra coverage. Would I be able to use these products after a sunscreen?

Finally, what would a good starting routine look like when I get all my new face goodies? My skin isn't particularly sensitive...so would I cleanse+moisturize+sunscreen+foundation in the morning, and then cleanse+use the Stridex+moisturize at night to start off?

**Evening**

* After shower, wash face with hydrating cleanser.  Apply Paula's Choice 2% BHA exfoliant with a cotton PAD (I find the pads distribute the product more evenly and easily, vs. a cotton ball.)

**PART 1**

Hi everyone.

Last I bought skin products, I was dumbfounded by how small the packages were! I mean, they were really small for the price!

With that being said, enlighten me on the following:

I have Combo Skin. Dry on some places, oily on others. I'll be buying the Begginer's Skincare Routine products and I was wondering (given that they are all measured in Oz., or ounces):

- How big is CeraVe in the tub? 
- How big is CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser?
- What's the best sunscreen I can get that is big in size and great in quality? (I use Piz Buin, but it is very small in terms of size)


**PART 2**

I'm going to buy these products based on the rave reviews they've gotten around here. They seem to have a great quality/price relationship compared to other products on the market. 

However, I currently follow a dermatologists routine (which isn't getting me the results I want) so help me construct a routine with the products I'll be buying:

Mornings:

I use a cleanser and I apply a moisturizing sunscreen by Synchrorose.

Nights:

I do Oil Cleansing. I put Olive Oil, massage, use the wet, warm washcloth to pat my face and let the remnants of oil sit on the face. I don't rinse the face after patting it with the washcloth (which I think I am doing wrong!). 

After Oil Cleansing, I apply, on alternate nights, Synchrorose Fast (meant to get rid of red marks) or Metroderme, each on top of the skin with the remnants of oil. **Again, don't know if this is recommended, enlighten me please!**.

On Saturdays I apply 8% Glycolic Acid and that's my routine for the week.

What I am trying to insert now is the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser and the CeraVe Cream on the tub. 

Morning:

- Cerave Hydrating Cleanser
- (**Do I moisturize here?**)
- Sunscreen of your recommendation.

Night:

- Oil Cleansing with Olive Oil. 
- Stridex
- Synchrorose Fast/Metroderme in alternate nights/Glycolic Acid on Saturdays.

Is this confusing/wrong? That's why I need you, the experts, to help me, the noob!

I was hoping that people who use the OCM could post their combos here so other people who are new to the OCM could see what people are using. I know another combo a lot of people like is castor oil:grapeseed oil (1:3) or the traditional castor oil:sunflower seed oil (1:4). The traditional OCM uses castor oil as the cleansing oil and another oil as the carrier oil but many people (myself included) prefer to mix lighter oils.

Help!,halpalp,21,2,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1brfen/turned_30_and_my_skin_has_gone_to_shit_help/,"My skin was never flawless, but now it's completely freaking out.  I've been traveling a lot and don't have a dermatologist in this city.  Hoping for some insights from reddit!

**Skin type/history.**   So, growing up, my skin was on the oily side.  Acne (mostly superficial, though occasionally I would get a cystic pimple or two around my period) was a problem for me, though the derm said it was not severe enough to Rx accutane.  I never had issues with dry skin, though I live on the East Coast of the US where the air is never arid.   Much moreso than acne, I suffered from blackheads through my teens/twenties.  Retin A helped with that.  Up until this year, I would have described my skin as ""slightly oily"" but otherwise okay.  I would get by using cetaphil cleanser and not much else.  

To the extent it's relevant, I'm an American caucasian woman (medium-blond hair, blue eyes) of mixed English/French and Eastern European descent.  When I was young and vacationed often (at least twice/year), I had the kind of skin that tanned easily or sometimes burned and turned tan a day later.  Now, I rarely vacation, work often, and am hardly ever outdoors.  This is great for reducing UV exposure, but my skin has become extremely pale and on vacation it burns and peels before even beginning to tan.  I generally buy the lightest shade of any brand of makeup.  That's not my complaint; it's just some background info.  

**Recent developments.**  I haven't moved apartments or climates or made any other drastic lifestyle changes, but suddenly I have skin problems I've never encountered before.  To begin with, my nose is red constantly and I have pimply bumps on it that are unlike any pimples I've dealt with before -- they aren't the kind you can ever squeeze or pop.  My mom has rosacea, mostly on her nose, and I think I might be seeing early signs of the same.  These symptoms have also started to spread to my cheeks, in the t-zone area near the bridge of my nose.  While acne previously coincided with oily skin, my skin also feels extremely dry now -- I don't even use cetaphil (or any cleanser) anymore, because my skin is already so dried out.  

In the morning, I've started to apply [this moisturizer](http://www.clinique.com/product/1574/5223/3_step/Step_3_Moisturize/Dramatically-Different-Moisturizing-Lotion/index.tmpl), which I randomly had laying around my apartment, and it helps with the dryness but the acne-type symptoms persist.  

A friend who did an atkins-type diet reported that cutting carbs had helped her skin, so I've also tried that. For the past four months, I've basically live on egg whites and tuna steaks.  I'm nice and skinny now, but my face still looks like I do meth.  (For the record, I do not). 

I do make sure to drink plenty of water.  I also take a standard multivitamin (albeit iron-free), an algeae DHA supplement, and vitamin E softgel capsules.  

I abandoned Retin A long ago, and in retrospect am glad since my skin has enough issues with redness and flakiness as-is.  So at the moment, I'm not using any products except the clinique moisturizer.  **Are there products or lifestyle adjustments you'd recommend?**  I'm not looking to spend money gratuitously, but price is not an issue.  

Thanks in advance to anyone who replies.  I am in dire need of advice!

Anyone else have a bad experience with it? I am disappoint. I have dry sensitive skin and it appears as though both the foaming AND hydrating wash AND the moisturizing tubby do not work for me. They seem to do the opposite effect: dry out my skin more, and the tubby almost seemed like it clogged my pores! (Seemed that way i know its probably unlikely since it's popular around here--I think it was probably just overly dry making it appear that way.) 

Even using vaseline or Aquaphor over it didn't help much.

I tested all the products very slowly. The one with the strongest bad effect was the moisturizer, the washes were a bit more subtle in showing they weren't going to work out. Combining both was even worse. (That's how I figured out it felt and looked like they were actually drying my skin out.)

Hopefully you're all excited and rearing to go with testing out the Aztec Healing Clay Mask.

Here are the guidelines:

- Please post a picture of your skin **before** starting anything. We'll have a thread each week during the process, where people can add on additional images (optional), and a thread at the very end of the month where people will post an ""after"" image. 

- It's really critical that you take the image(s) with the same lighting, and same level of other products on your skin at the same time. That will help us in being able to compare the before/after effects of the mask.

- These weekly threads are meant for discussing the product, e.g.: Is it working? Any bad reactions? Skin glowing after taking it off? Tips on how to make better use of it... Pictures, etc.

**General guideline on how to use this product, so that our testing is as scientific as possible**

1. Use it twice a week. Decide on 2 days at the start, and stick them as much as you can. 

2. If possible, please don't add in any other things to your skincare routine besides this for this month.

3. Combine equal parts of Aztec Healing Clay with Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV). If you really don't want to use ACV, then combining it with water is fine as long as you are aware that the mix will come out chunkier. Stir until you get a smooth paste. Add in more until you get a nice consistency.

4. Apply to your face as necessary (*More details from users would be great!*). Let it dry for 10 minutes (delicate skin), or 15 minutes (normal skin).

5. Remove by washing with warm water.

Share as much (or as little) as you are comfortable with. The more the better :)

That should be everything! Please leave comments, questions and most importantly, your before picture below!",,False,self,t5_2tbbg,1358285076.0,,,True,t3_16mkm3,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/16mkm3/group_testing_week_1_low_end_discussion_thread/,moderator

If you're not already familiar with it, please check out the [Materials Safety Data Sheet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_safety_data_sheet) (MSDS) for each product or chemical that you work with (if one exists).  

The MSDS is the standard form for workers to know about the chemicals they are working with.  It contains information about physical properties (such as melting point, flash point, etc) and additional information such as toxicities, health effects, proper storage, reactivity with other substances, and proper protective equipment to wear, such as gloves and eye protection.  While most ingredients in skincare are not dangerous, pure forms of actives can certainly be bad for the skin.  (You wouldn't want to apply 50% benzoyl peroxide to your face, for example!)

Your retailer should have MSDSs available for viewing.  You can also find them online - the easiest way is to Google the substance+MSDS.  For example, [here](http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9924890) is an MSDS for shea butter from one source.  It can be seen that shea butter is pretty mild stuff.  [Here](http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9923063) is an MSDS for pure benzoyl peroxide - it's obvious it's quite dangerous and recommends using lab coat, impervious gloves, dust respirator, etc, for working with it in pure form.  

MSDSs can also be found for the substance in diluted form that list its properties in that form (for example, 3% hydrogen peroxide versus 30% hydrogen peroxide).  If you're buying something to work with that is not in pure form, then look for the MSDS that corresponds to what you're actually buying.

I lurk around here sometimes and figured it's finally time to come out of the closet.

I'm 20 years old, and I have normal-to-dry skin. I've been dealing with moderate acne for about 3 years or so, and have tried a lot of things to get rid of it but it's never gone TOTALLY away. My dad was one of the guinea pigs when they first tested Accutane, but it's never been that bad for me. I have a few clustered, sore pimples on my forehead and a few on my cheeks as well. I also have a lot of blackheads. Like a LOT. 

Which brings me to my real problem- I fell compelled to pop my pimples/blackheads whenever I see a mirror. It got really bad last year and I still do it pretty frequently. I know how horrible and dirty it is but I just can't get away- I want my face to be totally clean and unclogged. I feel hopeless sometimes and like I just want to stick a vacuum on my face and get out all the gunk once and for all. 

This picking and touching makes my skin really dry, so I've tried to cater my routine to it:
AM

    *X-Out Face Wash
    *Avalon Organics Eye Cream with Vitamin C
    *Avalon Organics Serum with Vitamin C
    *Simple SPF 15 moisturizer
    *Missha SPF 42 BB cream

PM

    *Simple Oil Balancing Wipes
    *Neutrogena Visibly Bright Cleanser
    *Garnier Dry Skin Rescue Gel Cream
    *(occasional) Benzoyl Peroxide spot treatment

I also do the Aztec/ACV mask every once in a while, but I hate the smell so it's infrequent. I guess I'd just like some advice on how to stop touching my face and maybe some help with my skincare regimen. Everyone here seems so knowledgable and helpful, so I figured here was the right place to go.

I'm relatively new to this subreddit (couple weeks) and I've learned quite a bit so far. Unfortunately I seem to have a hard time figuring out what is going on with my skin.

For a long time (probably 5+ years) I used Proactiv. I never really had acne or breakouts when I was a teenager. My mom used Proactiv so I started using it when I ran out of the face wash my aunt had gotten me (no idea what it was, some shop in the mall that she took me to). My skin was kinda dry sometimes I guess but I never really thought anything of it. I just washed my face once, sometimes twice, a day with Proactiv and left it at that, except for picking/popping/generally agitating my skin because I didn't know it was wrong.

After I turned 18 I battled with pretty bad anxiety and started getting mild breakouts. Mostly blackheads, the occasional cystic(?) acne around my nose usually. Never really did much about it until last year when I went to the dermatologist about something unrelated and she recommended CeraVe for it. After a bit I started using the CeraVe around my nose and under my eyes before putting on my makeup for work.

Later last year, around the holidays, my friend got a job at Lush Cosmetics so of course I had to try some of their stuff out. I put up the Proactiv and tried their Angels on Bare Skin. It was fine for the first week or two and then suddenly itchy redness and breakouts. I got rid of that and tried to use Proactiv again and I got what seemed like sunburn on my cheeks afterward. I thought I'd try something else from Lush. I tried Aquamarina, which seemed to make my skin too dry. Then I tried 9 to 5 and Ultrabland. They didn't cause irritation or dryness so I continued using those for a few weeks.

I went to the dermatologist this year for a full body check (I have lots of moles and freckles) and the only things she suggested were 2% salicylic acid wash and a Clarisonic unit. Can't really afford the Clarisonic at the moment so when I went to get the 2% salicylic acid wash I was afraid that it would be too harsh (based on the Proactiv ""sunburn"") and just got a 0.5% astringent, which I used after cleansing with Ultrabland. It didn't irritate so I ended up getting St Ives Apricot Scrub (blemish control or whatever). I used that for a bit with no issues. Then I read on the sub not to use St Ives Apricot Scrubs, and looked it up elsewhere and found the same sort of things (over-exfoliating, mostly). I read the Beginner's Skincare Routine and ordered some CeraVe Foaming Cleanser and St Ives No-Scrub Exfoliating Pads and have been using those for the past week or so.

So now I have [all kinds of washes and other junk](http://imgur.com/a/ZHy5i) and I have no idea what to do with all of it, what's good and what's bad, what I should and shouldn't be using, what combinations are good, when to use what, etc.

That's my history (sorry it was so long!) and now here are my questions:

* The CeraVe Foaming Cleanser doesn't have salicylic acid, and that's what my dermatologist recommended. Is that okay? Should I get something else?
* How do I use the St Ives Exfoliating Pads properly? Do I just swipe them over my face real quick or do I sort of..massage my face with the thing or what? Super thin layer or get as much as I can on my face? Do I rinse after or just leave it?
* Should I be using any other things I have or just the CeraVe cleanser, St Ives pads, and CeraVe tub twice a day?
* I am still finding blackheads and I have had a cystic(?) acne thing just under my nostril for weeks now that hasn't gone away (although it did get smaller...after I messed with it because I have a hard time not doing so) and I think I have milia, which also aren't going away.
* Should I try to get the Clarisonic unit or is that just frivolous?
* I have no idea what I'm doing please help? ):

**Preface** - This product was purchased by me in a desperate attempt to make something of my dry/30 year old/stressed out skin. After trying mechanical exfolation with Lush - Angels on Bare Skin I decided that it was just too drying for me so onto chemical exfoliation I go.

**Zee Product** - 

**[From Boots](http://www.boots.com/en/Nip-Fab-Glycolic-Fix-Exfoliating-Facial-Pads-60s_1285979/)**

**[From Nip+Fab's Site](http://www.nipandfab.com/shop/best_sellers/glycolic_fix/49)**

**Claims** - Unveil younger-looking skin with our innovative Glycolic Fix. 60 radiance-boosting pads, soaked in exfoliating glycolic acid retexture + resurface skin whilst witch hazel helps to tone. This moisturising formula with hyaluronic acid + soothing blue daisy helps to reveal brighter + smoother looking skin.

With a hydrating formula, glycolic fix contains;

glycolic acid retextures + resurfaces

hyaluronic acid moisturises + refreshes

blue daisy  soothes + calms

**Ingredients** - [Here](http://i.imgur.com/DQM82Fo)

**How I use it** - Just as it says on the tin. Wipe pad across face, neck + décolleté. Apply to cleansed skin once or twice a day. I currently use them once, at night, after cleansing.

**My Thoughts** - First Impression - The tub they come in looks nice. Quite posh without being dowdy. The lid is a little ill fitting though so make sure you screw it on properly or all that glycolic goodness will dry up, much like my aging skin! :p Opening the tub I find the smell appeals to me, sort of citrusy, but not overpowering in any way. It smells clean and fresh.

Apparently these are 6% Glycolic Acid concentration so a little bit higher than some of the other solutions available. The pads are nicely saturated and although they may seem small they do cover a lot of ground. The pads feel lovely and cool on your skin and unless you already have sore areas they don't sting. They may tingle a little but it's not a bad sensation. Please remember that some products may sting when applying after using these.

I expected my skin to feel tight afterwards but these seem fairly hydrating so people with oily skin may not need a moisturiser after use. Also bear in mind that if you have any broken skin on your face that it will sting. The only fault I would say with these pads is that on my skin they seem to leave a slightly sticky feeling. It's nothing that makes my skin uncomfortable or really irritates me, but if you're going to be using them in a morning you may find that you'll need to leave it a while before applying any make-up products.

I've been using these a week so far. I do like the way they feel when using them and I do feel my skin is smoother and a lot of the flaking I had between my eyebrows is gone. Another plus is that some of the blocked pores I had on my upper cheeks have diminished and overall my pores don't look as noticeable. I will update this post before I finish the tub with my final thoughts and whether I'll repurchase.

**Pros:** *Feels lovely on skin *Easy to apply *Nicely saturated so enough product to cover what you need *£12.95 pricepoint is a nice bonus. *Smells lovely.

**Cons:** *Slight sticky feeling (could just be my skin!) *Lid of the tub can be a pain!

My skin was incredible. Glowing, smooth, perfect.

A few days later, I felt a little bit dry, so I added CeraVe into my routine. All was well for the next 3-4 days, until I ran out of my cleanser - and picked up some CeraVe foaming. I did another peel after washing with the last of my LRP (it had been about a week since the last peel?) and all was well - until that night, I washed with the CeraVe. 

Now I'm dry, red, itchy, and breaking out. My neck looks like a dragon. My complexion is dull and flaky, with big red scaly spots. I switched immediately back to the LRP cleanser, using nothing but the LRP and CeraVe cream  ... which was burning and seemingly making it worse.

I stopped using the CeraVe, and switched to aquaphor. It calmed the irritation down a bit, but after 15-20 minutes it starts to feel like there are bugs under the skin on my neck (I swear, no meth involved!)

I'm currently washing with the LRP ONLY in the morning, applying Embryolisse 5 or 6 times a day, and wiping my face down with Bioderma at night (the bioderma seems to help a lot.) 

I'm still itchy, dry, and scaly, and I'm breaking out now. It's been about a week. Any suggestions? I'd really like this nightmare to end so I can get back to ENJOYING MY PRETTYFUL SKIN!

I finally decided to get myself a skincare routine using the sidebar link. Sans skincare routine, I had oily, zit-prone areas along my eyebrows and around my nose, but dry, flaky cheeks and around the mouth.

I started out with Cerave in the tub and it made my skin feel heavenly so that was a good one.

A week after, I added Cerave's foaming cleanser and we're back to the patchy results: now there's a bonus zit on my cheek (a previously dry area!), there are still flakes around my mouth and now there are added flakes on my nose.

What do you guys recommend I do? Should I be treating my skin with two cleansers, the hydrating cleanser for the dry parts and the foaming cleanser for the oily parts? Or is there an HG of cleansers that will treat my skin evenly?

Hopefully I can resolve this and then start working on the zits that are still hanging out. Stridex in the box for that, right?

Nothing seems to ever clear it out.,,26,8,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1cisiz/my_nose_has_gunk_247_nothing_seems_to_ever_clear/,"I'm a five-six year moderate to severe acne sufferer. Skin doesn't seem dry, but I do get oily in the T-zone time to time. I've used many skincare products over the past several years for periods of at least three months at least to see if something works or not. The frustrating part about everything that I've done to try to combat acne is that there really doesn't seem to be anything that worsens or alleviates my acne. I can't think of any products or regimens that I've done or used that has affected my condition.

One thing that IS consistent is that I always have gunk on my nose. I currently am doing OCM, and I've been sticking to it because as I said before, I've tried nearly everything and I would much rather use something that is more natural and have acne, than to use more harsh chemical filled products that have the same result. Every morning and night, after I rub it out with the friendly oils, my nose just has all sorts of inhabitants. There are enlarged pores, blackheads, whiteheads, some pustules, and they remain even after some soft rubbing using my oils. I usually have a zit in the morning or zit at night around the crevices of my nostrils. I also seem to have areas that are inflamed (a pimple's early stage) every other day or so. I exfoliate with an AHA lotion every other day, but as I stated before I don't see much of a difference between not using it and using it.

I know that pores don't shrink or enlarge, but I'd really like to know what exactly will it take to at least see some cleaner pores after I wash. I can understand that throughout the day, my pores get clogged by dirt and oil. But the fact that cleaning my nose either with a gentle cleanser, BP, SA, exfoliants, or oils still results with the gunk remaining even as I wash it makes me wonder...will I live with these guys in there forever?

I know my post is all over the place. But there has to be someone out there that's had the same issue. I just feel like my skin has this barrier that does not respond to any products. I've tried so many through the past six years, you would think I'd find one product that worked or did SOMETHING beneficial.

I also want to preface this by saying, please don't guide me to the sidebar or Acne.org or change your pillowcase, exfoliate more/less because trust me I've done it all. I've lurked around and about acne for years. The absolute ONLY thing that has actually given me some type of results is just incorporating more vegetables into my life. It's made it smoother, but I doubt stuffing more vegetables into my face will solve the issues about the skin on my nose.

But I'm really confused about what type of oil I should use going forward. I've always considered my skin oily, but was recently informed by a girl at the MAC that my skin was dry (she also said that I should exfoliate with baking soda, so I'd take that with a grain of salt). Which kind of makes sense. I had a doctor tell me I had seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp. So I've always kind of figured my skin was dehydrated so it was pumping out extra oil/sebum/gross stuff to compensate. 


Right now I'm using Maracuja Oil (aka Passionfruit Oil) from Tarte because I got a free deluxe sample from Ulta when I bought some eye shadow. I want to maybe order some oils from Garden of Wisdom. What do I use as my base? Olive Oil? Mineral Oil? What can I mix with it? Should I continue with the Passionfruit Oil? How much? I read 80% base + 20% whatever. Is it arbitrary?

I have dealt with large pores my entire adult life (both my mother and father have them, I thought it was normal). However, recently they've gotten so gross looking that I have to wear a decent amount of cover-up so they don't show through. The dark, black pores are also migrating to my chin and the middle between my eyebrows. 

I was told by the Bare Minerals woman that they are ""deeply set blackheads."" I didn't buy her fancy skincare product (although I did get the make-up half of it, that stuff is FUN). I picked up some mineral oil today to try the OCM, and I have a lot of Clinique that I could use if I should.

The redness isn't actually that noticeable in person/indoor lighting (makeup covers it).

Hi everyone, I've been reading this sub forever trying to fix my own skin... ready to ask for help! Sorry for the throwaway, but I'm pretty self-conscious about my skin, hope that's ok. Below are the details, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

**Background:** 30 years old, Chinese, live in Toronto (extreme heat, then extreme cold in the winter), fairly sensitive skin all my life – dry for the most part, kind of oily T-zone. Acne was never really a problem until 2–3 years ago when I started breaking out a lot. Saw a naturopath and removed certain foods from my diet, did a candida yeast diet which definitely helped everything. Basically completely acne-free for the last year (no medications or creams were used).

**Diet / Lifestyle:** I try to eat really clean, basically gluten-free vegan (lost of veg/fruits, no dairy, no eggs, no honey b/c of food intolerance) but I'll have whole wheat, fish/chicken maybe once a week, and maybe a little processed meat like prosciutto bi-weekly. Exercise level is high. Been trying to drink about 4–5L of water a day. Using SLS-free toothpastes/shampoos.

**THE PROBLEM:** Check out the gallery of my cheeks here: http://imgur.com/a/hkNBT A dermatologist I saw 3 years ago (when my skin/acne was at its worst) said it could be rosacea (I *am* very red after exercising) causing the redness and clogged pores, but the clogged pores seem to be clearing with a change in moisturizer and water intake. My bumpy skin seems to be much better when I wake up than at the end of the day... could this mean it's diet related? Note how the redness kind of stops abruptly by my jawbone... I wish I could have THAT skin on my cheeks! In addition to the red dots and clogged pores, my skin seems duller than it was in my 20s.

Day-to-day, my skin feels tight, kind of burny, which I'm sure isn't normal. (My cheeks used to be ITCHY all the time, but again, changing my diet helped fix that).

**OLD skincare regiment:** wash my face with plain warm water at night only, exfoliate with coconut oil + baking soda bi-weekly (YIKES I KNOW... you guys helped me stop that pretty quickly), moisturize my face at night only with [Eucerin Calming creme](http://www.eucerinus.com/products/calm/eucerin-skin-calming-daily-moisturizing-creme.html) – pretty sure this was suffocating my face and causing the clogged pores (it IS a body lotion afterall). The change in cream alone last week helped clear up maybe 70% of my clogged pores on my cheeks. I would use Tea Tree Oil as a spot treatment.

**Current regiment:** wash my face with plain warm water at night only, moisturize with [Kiss my Face Ultra Hydrating Moisturizer](http://www.kissmyface.com/product/item/74), which I picked up randomly at the health food store, but seems to be minimizing my clogged pores a lot, in addition to making my skin feel softer.

I know this isn't enough. What are your thoughts and recommendations?

I want to try the oil cleansing method (thinking maybe 10% castor oil to 90% sunflower oil?) but I am concerned that the whole process might make me breakout again (when I have been enjoying clear skin for months). I am getting married in October and don't want to mess with my face too much (the make-up artist can definitely take care of any redness I am currently experiencing).

[Rose Hip Seed Oil](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/catalog/item/3987807/4064857.htm) - 1 oz / $5.65

[Rosemary EO](http://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-q-r/rosemary-ct-verbenone-france-organic.html) - 1/4 oz / $10

TOTAL: $76.55

With these ingredients, you can make at least five bottles of Quintessential serum for only $76. Essential oils will last you almost forever. Each serum probably has less than 20 drops of essential oils altogether. Noted: 1/8 oz essential oil equals 80 drops. 76.55 dollars divide into 5 bottles equal 15.13 dollars each. Which do you prefer to spend it on $175 or make yourself for $15. Why is it worth 175 dollars? It is because of branding, marketing and packaging. It actually has nothing to do with ingredients.

As for Epi-Peel, this will be your homework, please go to [Garden of Wisdom - raw ingredients](http://www.gardenofwisdom.com/rawingredients.html) and [Eden Botanicals - essential oils](http://www.edenbotanicals.com/products/essential-oils-pure-therapeutic-grade/essential-oils-a-b.html).

Read on for descriptions of Milia vs Visible Oil Glands,yvva,23,4,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/160vn0/bumps_under_your_eye_are_not_necessarily_milia/,"Milia tends to be the common assumption when people talk about issues having under eye bumps, but more often than not, they're just visible oil glands.


This common assumption is very similar to those assuming their sebaceous filaments are blackheads.  



The defining features of milia are they are *white* and *raised*. They are little pearl like, hard balls of keratin that build up under skin. They are also movable.  You can literally feel the hard lump by touch. Heavy creams are the usual suspect. Or if blood lipids are high, you can get milia deposits as well.


A google image search will be the most useful.



Visible oil glands are skin colored and look like chicken skin. Often they appear in a streak sort of under the eye, the yare slightly raised, and all grouped together. 


Hope this helps!

(37 dollars though...)Anyways some people have been wondering what it is like so heres my review!

(Sorry no pictures, i did it last night at like 1 am after my shower :P)
My skin is a mixture between oily and combination. Mostly really oily on my T-zone area and I have breakouts sporadically all over my face. Sensitivity wise i would say 6-7/10 (10 being most sensitive). After my shower, I washed my face using a charcoal foaming cleanser and foaming net from Daiso at 1.50 each. Pat dry (make sure your face completely dry or else Cure wont work as well)

Then I used **CURE**. 1-2 pumps was all i needed from the bottle. Its VERY watery (probably coz its 90% hydrogen water :3) and a foggy/clearish color. Best part is that there is NO SMELL. None of that alcoholy or fruity smell you get with other products. Left it on my face for about 30 seconds and then started rubbing in circles all over my face. After about 30-45 seconds of rubbing, little white flakes and balls started coming off. It is the weirdest sensation ever! No burning sensation whatsoever and no irritation. They just kept coming off all over the place! Most of the skin came off on my cheeks and  it looks sorta like your face is peeling after a sunburn. BUT IT WORKS! After you wash it off it your face feels super clean and not dry at all! My skin still felt hydrated and healthy. 

Afterwards I used a Q10 Coenzyme toner (also from daiso) and then used a hyaluronic acid cream. TODAY- my skin FEELS SO SOFT. OMFG. I feel that CURE really opened up my pores and removed all the dead skin to let the products work to their full potential. Its only been one day but im hooked! New favorite product by far!

TL;DR/Rating: 9.5/10 (0.5 off because it says to use it twice a week, but i want to use it everyday now XD). Works great. Everything i expected and more. I think you guys will love it!

I know some others also just got Cure and i would LOVE to hear your reviews!!!

**EDIT: WAH. The price on amazon went up from 37 to 43 USD WTF.

A couple things to really avoid. ,yvva,26,8,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/13ke7j/following_up_with_the_cleansers_threadface_scrubs/,"I just wanted to post something super super quick on this because it's something worth noting!!

St. Ives Scrub or any other scrub using crushed shells as abrasives:  


AVOID these.  The scrubbing bits are made of crushed walnut shells. This causes micro-tearing in the skin and over time you will be an unhappy camper. I'm SURE some of you are reading this and shaking your head because you've used it for years and see no damage, but please trust me, the damage you're doing will catch up eventually. The shells basically slicing up your skin and therefore leaving you prone to infection and sensitivity.  



Philosophy microdelivery exfoliating wash or any others with very minute particles:


Try to steer clear of these. While they don't cause as egregious damage as the shell based scrubs, the particles could potentially get lodged in pores, causing clogs. And we really don't want that happening!!!



What to look for, very brief:

Ideally something that contains synthetic exfoliating beads. This will ensure a gentle exfoliation, no damage, no potential pore clogging. 

Alternatively, mixing some sugar and honey would be very effective (and delicious) .

Oil Cleansing Method: where did I go wrong?,Squidhugs,20,4,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/13atqh/help_oil_cleansing_method_where_did_i_go_wrong/,"About a month ago I tried the oil cleansing method for the first time. I used 30% castor oil, 70% jojoba, with a few drops of ylang ylang and Vitamin E oil as well. After the first ""breaking in"" week I LOVED it. My previously oily, acne-prone skin cleared right up and became soft and clean feeling. My face was glowing. This lasted for about two weeks, and now my face feels dried out all the time, and I'm starting to break out again. 

Over the past week I've been experimenting with my oils trying to see what happened. I've tried less castor oil, no castor oil at all, only jojoba, only olive oil, jojoba/olive oil mix...etc. Nothing seems to work. Now every time I do my oil cleansing routine, as soon as my face dries after the steaming/wiping, my skin feels like it has a dry layer on it. Moisturizing helps a little, but seems to make me break out more. 


Has this happened to anyone else? I have only been doing the oil cleansing once a day, at night. I feel desperate to figure out where I went wrong, those two weeks where the OCM worked was the best my skin has ever been, and I want it back!


EDIT: Thank you everyone for the advice! Thanks to you guys, I figured out what the problem was. The steaming was drying my face out. I did my OCM routine tonight, using lukewarm water to wipe off the oil, and it made a huge difference. I think it'll take a few days for my skin to fully recover, but I can definitely tell that it's working like it used to again.

I use Urban Decay's Naked Skin for foundation and I use Mac's Prep and prime for primer. I've been using the Naked Skin for a while now, so I'm pretty sure that's not one of the problems, but I'm not sure.


I have [Closed Comedones or Milia acne](http://www.acnetaxonomy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/white-head-300x157.jpg) (They're just skin colored) pretty much everywhere (especially on my chin and forhead) with occasional blackheads and occasional [Papules and Pustules](http://www.acnetaxonomy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/papules-and-pustule.jpg). 


I've been looking into some sort of Benzoyl Peroxide treatment, but I'm not sure which I should get.

I really need any help I can get. I'm so frustrated and depressed about all of this and piling more makeup on my face is not going to make it any better obviously. You can see these stupid little bumps through it anyway. :( My boyfriend is fed up, and so am I.

EDIT: I should also note that I'm a 25 year old Female. Thanks! Also, forgot two things to my skincare.

My skin is so oily that I go through 4 of those oil absorbing sheets a day. I didn't ever go through with Accutane, because the long term side effects scared me, and the antibiotics were already working pretty well. But they were expensive and losing effectiveness!

So I went on Amazon, and I started using [Pan Acid (Pantothenic Acid) 1000mg Timed Release](http://www.amazon.com/Acid-Pantothenic-1000mg-Timed-Release/dp/B000NZDN2Y) and [Zinc tablets](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KI6Z7O/). 

I have to take about 3 Pan acid pills a day, but my pores are smaller, and my skin honestly seems to glow, moreso than it does after a peel. The Zinc tablets can cause an upset stomach if not taken with a meal. 

On the plus side, I literally never have to worry about acne again. I know how some of you feel where it's like you look in the mirror and see another breakout and are exhausted. It feels like there's no end to the acne, and you never want to have to deal with another giant cyst again, and I honestly thought Id have to just live with it for the rest of my life.


BUT now for the first time, its like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders, and the memory of looking in the mirror in disgust and hopelessness is gone.

For reducing the scars that were left over, I've had to use multiple salicylic, glycolic, and TCA peels though, as well as MSM (sulfur) cream and AHA/BHA creams.

I don't know the long term effects of taking the Pan acid/sulfur combo, but I do know not having anxiety and low self esteem bc of acne is amazing.

I'm a 26F with what over time I have discovered is slightly dry, sensitive, acne prone skin. When I started getting my first pimples, my parents put me on Proactiv. My face looked great but after years of bleaching towels and having horrible breakouts if I missed even a night of the routine, I realized something wasn't right. Long story short, BP ruined my face for a while as I tried to use more natural, forgiving products. I went through months of weaning myself off the stuff. 

Right now I am looking primarily for a night moisturizer or cream to put on my face before bed. I have been using my daily moisturizer for this, but something just doesn't seem right about putting on SPF before climbing into the sheets. I would prefer a natural product, like an oil or aloe vera or something like that... maybe someone knows what would work well with my current setup?

Here is my current regimen 

Morning:  

Aubrey Organics Vegecol cream cleanser  
Thayers Witch Hazel Toner    
Tea Tree oil applied directly to pimples     
MAC mineralize water eye cream (sometimes, was gifted to me and I'm not sure if it's really even helping).   
Olay All Day Moisturizer SPF 15       
(I also wear some light coverage makeup with SPF)  
 

Night:   
   
Wash off makeup with Sweet Almond Oil   
Cleanse face with 100% Raw Manuka Honey (Active 16+)   
Thayers Witch Hazel   
Tea Tree Oil on any blemishes.   


From time to time I also apply the Proactiv Step 3 cream as I am STILL weaning myself off of this wretched skin addiction.    

I would like to add more moisturizing and skin-loving natural ingredients to my regimen, but there are so many to choose from my head is spinning. I especially want to add a night time moisturizer, as I already stated! Is there any other information I may be able to provide? :)

Zits in other places not uncommon, but never on my cheeks. My acne has been getting worse as I have been getting older. I'm 20 years old.

I'll admit it, I didn't do my research on this one thoroughly enough. I ditched my Clean N Clear Morning Burst face wash and moisturizer and bought CeraVe face wash and CeraVe in the jar to use. It's been about a week washing and moisturizing twice a day. I used to just wash my face and moisturize in the morning. I've had to stop using the CeraVe moisturizer because it just sits on top of my skin feeling oily and sticky. In the past 2 days I have gotten 1 small zit and 1 large one that randomly came up today on my nose. I very rarely get zits on my nose. However, my cheeks are very smooth and soft. With just using the cleanser and not the moisturizer, my skin does not get overly oily. But, the oiliness of my skin depends on the weather too.

I bought the CeraVe because I heard good things about it on this sub, but I didn't pay close enough attention because it's apparently for ""dry to normal"" skin. I have oily skin. I thought my skin may have just been dehydrated and over-producing oil to compensate, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

**TL;DR:**

My questions:

1. Is there a 'cleansing/detox period' or 'adjustment period' when switching face products before seeing better results?
2. If not, then what is a good acne cleanser I can add to my new routine to control frequent hormonal breakouts on my chin? (the zits are whiteheads that pop). I'm in the UK and don't have access to all American brands but I'm welcome to any and all suggestions! :)
