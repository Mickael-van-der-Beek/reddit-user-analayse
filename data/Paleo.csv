As a noob to the paleo lifestyle, I realized I was going to need to become a pro at cooking veggies, so I went to him and asked what his secret was - the man converted me from hating brussel sprouts with the fire of a thousand suns to loving them more than anything. Expecting something complex, I was happily surprised at how simple it was. Warning: requires cooking with white wine

So here it is. Step one: warm up your pan over medium-medium high heat with some fat and garlic in it. 

Step two: put in your veggies and sautée until there is some color on one side

Step three: pour some white wine in the pan until the bottom is covered well. Put a lid on to cover it, and turn the heat down to a medium/medium low. Keep this ""steaming"" for about five or so minutes, or until the veggies are tender. 

Step four: Remove the lid, season it up with a bit of salt and whatever other seasonings you want. Then, the secret: add a drop of balsamic or white balsamic vinegar. 

Stir it up, and enjoy! So far I have done it with kale, brussel sprouts, asparagus, bell peppers, and mushrooms and all have been divine. 

EDIT: I don't use the liquid that's left over. He likes to reduce it to a sauce though.

You might not be pleased with the change, depending on how you feel about rice bran oil (I need to learn more about it). 

**My note to them:**

&gt;Hello,
 
&gt;I love Chipotle and have eaten at Chipotle restaurants many, many times. However, I really dislike the use of soybean oil in your food. I would love to enjoy your steak, but I stick with the carnitas due to the soybean oil.
&gt; 
Soybean oil is considered to be unhealthy by many, especially considering the high amounts of omega-6 fats that it contains.
 
&gt;I know that Chipotle has a huge following in the ""paleo"" community, which is a style of eating based on whole foods like grass-fed beef, and eliminating harmful processed foods and some grains (esp. those that contain gluten). However, it's well-known that only the pork at Chipotle is paleo-friendly. 

&gt;Chipotle would generate a ton of good-will from health-conscious folks by elimanating the soy oil and putting steak back on the menu for people like me. 

&gt;Best!
 
&gt;Mike


**Their reply:**

Michael,
 
I'm happy to report that we are on the same page! We are actually working on replacing our soybean oil with non-GMO sunflower oil to fry our taco shells and chips in the following areas and locations:
 
Stores in Washington 

Stores in Oregon 

Stores in California 

Stores in Nevada 

Stores in Phoenix 

Stores in Texas 

Stores in Arkansas 

Stores in Louisiana 

Stores in Alabama 

Stores in Georgia 

Stores in Tennessee 

Stores in North Carolina 

Stores in South Carolina 

Stores in Virginia 

Stores in Washington DC 

Stores in Virginia Beach 

Stores in Maryland 

Stores in Philadelphia 

Stores in Delaware 

Stores in Massachusetts 

Stores in Connecticut 

Stores in Rhode Island 

Stores in New Hampshire

 
As of 12/19/11
All Florida restaurants, except for the Tallahassee locations
 
As of 9/25/11:
Stores in Denver 

Stores in Utah 

Stores in Colorado Springs 

Stores in NYLI 

Stores in NYC 

Stores in New Jersey
 
As well as our Wilton, Henrietta, Lathamroute, CliftonPark and Univofroch locations.
 
We are also making the transition to non-GMO rice bran oil. As of August 24th 2012, the western half of the U.S. began using the rice bran oil in our pinto beans, black beans and adobo marinade. It is important to note that soybean oil is still used in our grills so while our chicken, steak and barbacoa is marinated in the adobo marinade containing rice-bran oil, they may still come into contact with the soy used on our grill. 

We plan to completely replace our soybean oil with our sunflower and rice bran oils. I would recommend asking your local Chipotle to see where they are in this transition as this is an ongoing process. In the meantime, it may be helpful if you knew which offerings could still contain soybean oil before this transition is fully accomplished. The following items are made with soybean oil or contain it from the grill:
 
Chips

Crispy corn taco shells

Rice

Fajita vegetables

Black beans

Pinto beans

Carnitas

Chicken

Steak

Barbacoa

Chipotle honey vinaigrette

Large and Small Flour Tortillas
 
The following items are NOT made with soybean oil, although they could possibly come in contact with foods that are. I recommend you carefully consider your dining choices on this as well.
 
Mild tomato salsa

 Medium corn-poblano salsa

 Green chile tomatillo salsa

 Red chile tomatillo salsa

 Guacamole

 Cheese

 Sour cream

 Lettuce
 
I hope this information proves helpful Michael. Have a lovely day!
 
Sincerely,

Perhaps more so. I've spent $420,000 in education just to be taught the WRONG thing. I've been trained to think of obese people as lazy, gluttonous liars. I've been brainwashed into thinking statins are wonder drugs. 

This was fine until I became obese and couldn't lose the weight by exercise or diet restriction. Something was OBVIOUSLY wrong. I was an athlete for crying out loud. My own MD tried to put me on statins. My Triglycerides were over 300 and my HDL was under 40. I was 35. 

It isn't that MD's don't get the biochemistry. Trust me, if there is one thing we get it's biochemistry. Hell, my degree was in analytic biochemistry. 

I've been trained to be some semblance of a respectable authority on peoples health. I'm (or was ) a liar made legitimate by virtue of a degree. I should have listened to my mother when all she served was meat, organ meat, veggies, and a little rice. 

Rest assured. ALL MD's are not fools who are unwilling to step back and reassess. The evidence is building and the tide is beginning to turn. I fear that until the NIH begins to fund research in the area of grain elimination and higher fat eating habits the general public will still think that fat is bad. 

FYI I just realized this about 1 month ago when I was researching diets incorporating (whatever the cereal which compares itself with an egg is). I was directed to this sub-reddit by google and someone ranting about the evils of grains and etc. So I looked up paleo and read Sisson and Cordain. Then I read ""Wheat Belly"". I was still wrestling with the amount of fat in the diet. Then I got a hold of Taubes which blew my mind. Then I watched the video about fructose and HFCS. 

My fiancee is pissed at me because she loves her sweets. The other MD's I work worth are leery of me although they have commented about my ""wasting away to nothing."" I've lost 30 lbs in month on grass fed beef and buffalo, fish, nuts, eggs, pork belly, and veggies. 

So thank you for vociferously expounding on the evils of whole grains. Thank you for not shutting up and listening to nay-sayers and experts. 

EDIT 1: I am not saying that appropriate drugs do not have their place or that they cannot be beneficial. I'm saying that preventing disease is much preferable to treating disease.

**Enthusiastic Paleo N00b:  Hi everyone! I've recently started eating according to the paleo lifestyle, and I feel great. Various symptoms have disappeared or at least decreased in their severity, and I have all kinds of energy now. Here's an example of a meal I ate this week. It was delicious.

PaleoWizard: Is that grass-fed beef? If not, you're getting the wrong Omicron-Beta-Nine acids.

I_grok_all: No way, PaleoWizard, you have the wrong kind of acid. Also, grass-fed isn't enough. A true paleo dinner would contain only grass-fed Montana-bred meat.

F_all_yall:  Come on, guys, don't you see the problem here? Those leeks look like they had molecules that were once in a soybean. That's just not acceptable.

Paleo_4_strife: I don't see what the fuss is. I only eat raw mammoth meat and wild cabbage.

PaleoWizard: Enthusiastic Paleo N00b, you're not really eating a paleo meal there. That's Keto and you're doing it all wrong.

All other users: We agree. This person can't possibly be paleo.**

What this comes down to is a choice between two major strategies in paleo eating: optimization and satisficing. Optimization, as I describe it here, is the strategy wherein the user does not stop working and trying to improve until the most optimal or absolute best solution is found. Optimization makes sense in some situations, where the problem space is small and the number of possible solutions is relatively low. As the problem space increases, along with the number of parameters and possible outcomes, optimization becomes increasingly difficult and time-consuming. If faced with the problem of monetary resources, a person who chooses optimization will never, ever stop trying to make his or her pile of money larger.

Herb Simon, a nobel-prize winning economist, wrote about satisficing as the alternative to optimization. In a satisficing strategy, people generally reach a threshold and then stop striving to gain more. Faced with the problem of money, most people are satisficers rather than optimizers.

My issue with paleo is that its culture is one of optimization. Yes, there are satisficers -- people who decide that they have achieved good enough health and stick to a set of principles that led them to that point.  The culture of the paleo movement, though, seems to reward the sort of person who measures out their quantities of food with a scale and measuring cup, constantly trying to titrate their health, aiming for some place of perfection. This approach is, to me, a horror, but I recognize that optimizers don't typically do this because of compulsion but rather because they enjoy it! I get that. I do the same sort of thing with hobbies of mine, though not to that degree.  

I understand, optimizers, that for you, this fine chemistry of your body is an enjoyable pursuit, something that you find rewarding in and of itself. When you choose to project that finely-honed optimization on others in the community, though -- others who want merely to join in the joy of finally learning what makes their bodies feel good -- you create hostile exclusion and ostracization. Perhaps not to a severe extent -- we aren't Mean Girls -- but the effect is chilling nonetheless. When someone enthusiastically says ""Hey, I quit eating gluten, and my headaches went away!"" and you say ""Heh, until you quit rice, corn, potatoes, and soy, you're really not healthy,"" what you've done is two things. First, you minimized the importance of their discovery. We all know how harmful gluten is, and one more person on board with not eating it is progress, however small. Second, though, you set yourself apart from them, making them feel like outsiders in what should be an inclusive an welcoming movement of better health and wellbeing. 

Why do some optimizers (I should emphasize that there are preachy optimizers just as there are preachy satisficers) tear down the well-meaning paleo n00bs?  I don't know. One hypothesis is that the veterans really feel a responsibility to teach the rookies about True Paleo (whatever that means) as early as possible, so as to save them the time of discovering the right way to approach paleo.  Ostensibly, this may be true, but I find it considerably more likely that it's a smug superiority, not unlike that of hybrid car owners and judgmental Christians.

This is my gripe with the paleo community (particularly this subreddit) at large. In general, it's a helpful crew of like-minded individuals, ready to offer advice to specific questions or support to initiates. Sometimes, though, it turns into a prick-waving contest of who is the Most Paleo and who is merely Using the Buzzword.",,False,self,t5_2qzzs,False,,,True,t3_10arf4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/10arf4/more_paleo_than_thou_my_gripe_with_the_paleo/,

Lost 10 lbs, looks like I lost more because I haven't experienced bloating. Lots of energy. Better digestion and little to no GI weirdness. Glowing skin. Etc etc.

Last night I went to a movie and decided to have some popcorn, seriously my favorite salty snack of all time. It was my ""dinner,"" so I shared a bag. It wasn't just a handful.

I spent the last 45 minutes of the movie holding in painful gas. (I was in the center of the theater and couldn't really get up and go).

When the movie ended, I ran to the restroom and let out the longest continuous fart of my life. It was comically loud and long, like my whole intestine had been filled with gas.

I rode home feeling like it wasn't over, felt more urgency and then once home [had terrible loose stool that smelled exactly like popcorn](/tmi).

My gut is still unhappy with me today. I look and feel super bloated. Ugh. I fed my gut flora tons of undigestible starch and it blew the fuck up. What a mistake.

I learned my lesson. In this instance I treated Paleo less like a lifestyle I live for the benefits and more like a diet I can cheat on without experiencing any real harm.

I obviously learned that my body will not allow me to make poor food choices without the consequence of great discomfort.

 * I had to spend a fortune getting the waist in all my suit pants taken in.
 * I have an unused bottle of Acne facewash in my shower.  It's taking up so much space in my shower caddy and I haven't had to use it for months.
 * On that same note, I bought some expensive concealer at MAC last winter.  It's just sitting in my medicine cabinet unused.
 * All my friends are jealous because I eat meat (the good part of this food thing humans do) 3 times a day and don't get fat.  I'm losing friends from this nonsense.
 * It's summer and I wear a suit to work every day.  Now that my circulation is back to normal, I'm uncomfortably warm sitting in my office chair 8 hours a day.
 * I spend less time on the toilet now, so I haven't made as much progress in Angry Birds as I used to.
 * I don't know how it's happening, but the weights at my gym have started getting lighter.  They must be deteriorating or something.  It didn't start until June, so it's gotta be related to this diet.

1375373921.0,197,self.Paleo,1ji2vw,What I learned about food and my body in a month of paleo,Alexander2011,226,29,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/1ji2vw/what_i_learned_about_food_and_my_body_in_a_month/,"I just finished my first month of paleo eating -- I complied strictly -- and I learned a lot about food and my body. While I understand that everyone's different and thus my discoveries might not apply to everyone, some of them might help some of you, so I thought I'd share. Here's what I learned:

1. I don't need grains to live happily, obviously. But I can't do six workouts per week on VLC. After three weeks, I was feeling sluggish most of the day -- I didn't have the energy to work or exercise. I added in a little fruit (maybe a banana and some berries) and like magic my energy returned. Carbs, I found, aren't evil -- when I have a little bit of fruit sugar with meals (even while totally eliminating other sugars), I have higher energy, better workouts, and actually *less* trouble losing fat.

2. Processed food is really unhealthy. It doesn't make me feel well.

3. Healthy fats might be healthy, but they're also delicious. Their calories still count, and because they're calorie-dense, they add up quickly. Half a pound of almond butter is really, really easy for me to eat, and though it's paleo-friendly, it's still 1600 calories.

4. I'm a good cook, and I've gotten better over the past month. But not every meal needs to take an hour to create. Delicious, healthy food doesn't have to be complex -- and it's really easy to procrastinate by cooking because it's fun and healthy.

5. ""Full"" is the feeling past ""sated,"" which most nearly means ""not hungry."" It's *really* hard for me to become ""full"" -- i.e., to eat *past* the feeling no longer being hungry -- without grains. But eating to eliminate hunger (instead of to be stuffed) makes me happier and keeps my energy up through the day.

6. Life is better with lots of hard workouts, *way* more water than seems right, and plenty of sleep.

7. This one's crucial: food exists to serve me, not the other way around. About three weeks in, I started feeling like a slave to my food -- many (or perhaps most) of my thoughts revolved around what I'd eat at the next meal, how I'd cook dinner, how many calories I had left, and how I could create paleo-compliant versions of non-paleo foods. That, I realized, is the exact opposite of the liberation I expected, so decided to simplify. The paleo plan is designed to make us happy and healthy, not to constrict or smother us. Especially in the world of r/paleo -- which, don't get me wrong, I love and visit frequently -- it's *very* easy to get trapped in a paleo fishbowl. That's probably, I think, a structural feature of diet- and health-related rule systems, especially because I -- and I predict many of the others willing to eat and exercise carefully and precisely for a month are probably the same way -- am rather compulsive.

I know that was a long wall of text, and I'm merely trying to be helpful. I ran into a few problems during the last month, and I hope what I've found can help some of you.",,False,self,t5_2qzzs,False,,,True,t3_1ji2vw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/1ji2vw/what_i_learned_about_food_and_my_body_in_a_month/,

So, I've been having thyroid issues for the past four or five years. I was experiencing every single symptom of hypothyroidism, yet all of my bloodwork was coming back normal consistently. I was clinically depressed, 20 pounds overweight (about 165 at 5'6""), felt sluggish all the time, having symptoms of IBS, ridiculously heavy periods, joint pain all the time, and my hair was even falling out. 

I worked out three days a week and had a calorie deficit each day but nothing ever changed. 

This spring my family doctor noticed my thyroid being really enlarged (like twice the size of a normal thyroid) and sent me back to my endocrinologist. Bloodwork still coming back normal, but my thyroid was ginormous. After an ultrasound I found out that in addition to having a huge motherfucking thyroid, I had a tumor chilling out on top of it. Had a biopsy, it wasn't cancer but it went largely unexplained and my doc basically sent me away with a shrug after more normal bloodwork like ""Well that's weird"". 

Anyway, started working out more frequently, pretty much every day of the week, eating super healthy (or so I thought), took some vitamin supplements, and I did drop two or three pounds, but it was really frustrating because I thought I was doing everything right for around 5 months and still seeing almost zero results. Then I found this subreddit. 

Started strictly eating Paleo almost two months ago. All my symptoms have stopped. **Every. Single. Symptom.** I don't understand the science. All I know is that I feel awesome, more happy and emotionally stable than I can remember being EVER, hair has stopped falling out, and I've dropped about 13 pounds in that frame of time eating the same amount of calories I had been eating before (and still counting! am feeling so ambitious in my progressing fitness I preregistered for a Tough Mudder in April to keep myself motivated). The tumor is now half it's previous size, and my thyroid is the size of a normal human being's thyroid instead of a trolls. 

IT IS MAGIC. 

This diet combined with a fairly strict workout regimen has been absurdly beneficial for me. Not only is my health vastly improved, but I can see my muscles. I CAN DO BIG GIRL PUSHUPS AND NOT JUST ON MY KNEES ANYMORE AND I DID MY FIRST PULL UP TODAY (okay that's less Paleo related but I'm excited about it). 

Do you guys know if thyroid issues can be tied to a gluten sensitivity? I haven't been able to find very much information on it in my admittedly limited research. I'm just so happy about this change in my life. I thought I was screwed for life with all these shitty symptoms and nothing to help me since they couldn't figure out what was wrong. Now I just...I just feel awesome.

She acted like it was the **devil's diet** and that I was stupid for even thinking about it.  I broke up with her, (if you can imagine, for worse reasons than talking smack about Paleo) and the next day, decided there was no better time to start a 30 day Paleo challenge!  
Although I'm not overweight, there were plenty of other reasons for me to give this lifestyle a try. 

*I had no energy.

*I was a slave to caffeine.

*I got headaches and shakes without sugar and carbs.

*I had to eat AT LEAST every 3 hours or I felt lightheaded.

*I used terrible pre-workout drinks just to get through my lifts and runs.

*I had dermographism, [the skin writing disease](http://www.google.com/search?q=dermographism&amp;hl=en&amp;rls=com.microsoft:en-us:IE-SearchBox&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EcbQT87_Gofi2gXgs5SgDA&amp;ved=0CGsQsAQ&amp;biw=1191&amp;bih=558) which is an autoimmune disease.  Paleo is an anti-inflammatory diet.

*My best friend's girlfriend has rheumatoid arthritis and is only 21 years old.  Since it is an autoimmune disease, if it helped mine, maybe it would help hers as well.

*My father has dietary woes, and I wanted to be able to recommend food choices that would work for him.

*I feel very strongly about the government not taxing fatty foods, especially bacon, and I wanted to prove it to myself and others that fatty foods are actually good for you!

Thanks to multiple books, blogs, podcasts and of course reddit, I've stuck to the lifestyle and feel great.  Best of all, my DERMOGRAPHISM IS GONE!!! I used to be constantly drugged up on allergy medication. For 24/7, over 10 years, I didn't miss a single day.  I'm currently one week without allergy meds, and that alone feels unbelievable! 
To all of those who are on the fence of trying this lifestyle, go for it, and don't cheat. Stick with the low-carb flu if you get it, it gets better.  Kick the sugar habit, including the fake sugar, and the cravings do go away.

Thank you all for the support!

**TL;DR** Dermographism is gone, energy levels are up, and going Paleo is the ultimate revenge for a brainwashed dietitian ex-girlfriend!

Once there, I chop up a mess of veggies with nothing but a wild stare, kill a small animal, and cook it all up over a fire I built on the stove top.

We even eat our meals paleo style. There were no metal eating utensils back then. We use our hands or a crudely carved spoon made from a moose antler. 

Then it's down to the basement gym where I just start lifting the weight bench and weights over my head. Repeatedly. Then I kick the shit out of the full length punching bag. 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!', then I yank it off the chain, throw it through a window and impale it with a homemade spear. 'DIE HIPPIE SCUM!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAA!'

And what a year, especially for my husband!  I had no weight to lose but he's lost about 70lbs.  One day he has to let me post a before/after!  

There's gonna be a few TMI tags from here on in so be warned hahaha!

My son was 10 months when we started and one of the things that made me think about changing our way of eating was for him.  After eating bread, he would always [have slick diarrhea the next day, and it gave him rashes.  Yuck!](/tmi)  I never gave him any of that baby cereal because I already felt that it was silly to fill a kid on bland food when there was so much else to offer.  He was already past purees at that point so it was just a matter of not ""getting lazy"" and offering a piece of bread to tide him over (I was also making all his baby food from scratch, no Gerber crap).  He was also still mostly breastfed at a year, only eating about one big meal of solids a day (plus an occasional snack), so I was already trying to make sure those counted but cutting out the gluten/dairy really helped things for him.  He almost immediately stopped getting diaper rash!  We were using cloth at the time too (but have since switched to disposables...  Yeah I know bring out the pitchforks.)  These days the only time he gets an upset tummy is after visiting with the grandparents where they just think we're doing the diet for fun and don't respect our wishes.  I know that a bite of cookie or whatever wont kill him but the other day I had to flat out give shit to my MIL because she gave him chicken fingers and fries and guess what happened to the poor kid.

Another thing I've noticed is that a lot of parents of toddlers will complain of everything being mysteriously sticky.  Not with him.  It's grease.  If it's a messy fruit like banana it doesn't really get sticky.  It kind of hardens up and you just scrape it off haha.  No, he gets nice rich greasy stuff and I've found that baby wipes are also great for cleaning grease off hard surfaces and hands!  Better than paper/cotton towel.  PS:  pretreat grease stains with dish soap.  Works like a charm.

He also LOVES food.  All sorts of food.  He doesn't eat much in a sitting but I'm so lucky to have the least picky baby I've ever met.  Even pre-paleo I didn't shy from spicing his food so I'm glad I didn't start out with a kid used to bland food.  But he eats almost anything except greens.  Yesterday we had mushroom and onion omelettes and he was picking out the onion to eat on their own!  He also knows so many words for different fruits/vegetables that when we go grocery shopping, at 22 months, he amazes the staff and fellow shoppers with being able to point out things like ""brocolli,"" ""carrot,"" ""tomato"" etc.  This makes me so proud not only for him but for us because there are some kids twice his age that still don't know their vegetables because they are never given any.

For myself, after the initial carb-flu wore off, I noticed a huge increase in natural energy.  To the point where I felt ""high"" simply because I had never known what it was like to not feel sluggish and shitty.  I've recently decided to ditch the caffeine too and to no ill effect.  In fact, I find I have more patience now for my son's toddler antics, I don't snap at him as easily.

I had [chronic constipation](/tmi) pretty well my entire adult life, starting from when I was about 13. [This caused terrible anal fissures and like someone with Crohn's, I would almost pass out on the toilet from the effort of trying to simply take a shit.  It was so, so painful.](/tmi)  I first started realizing it might be diet related when I was pregnant.  I had cut out canned foods and of course cut down on fast food a great deal.  I was eating much more fruit and drinking water.  I was actually much more regular when I was pregnant which is the complete opposite of what you hear from pregnant women hahaha!

So for me, this past year has been heaven on my poor gutty-wuts.  I don't ever want to go back to the way we ate before.  I don't know how I suffered through so many years.  But it is COMPLETELY GONE.

My husband is doing great.  He looks and feels so much better about himself.  I've even seen him take his shirt off outside this summer!  He says ""well I've still got some to lose"" but I'm SO proud of him for what he's accomplished.  I think the reason he's plateaued is because we're still eating a fair bit of potato.  I don't know if he's going to try very low-carb but he might.  But once we can afford better option we're cutting out potato for sure.

Speaking of affordability:  Nothing quite makes you as aware of portion sizes as when you're broke!  Also, it makes you really think of how to really stretch a dollar in the best possible way nutritionally.  Yeah, ramen is really cheap, but will it fill you?  Not a chance.  We do hope to get a freezer soon so this fall I hope to get some local pork.  (We love pork around here.)  There's also a local bison farm, and an elk farm, as well as beef/pig/lamb so I'm eager to start shopping in larger quantities than just a pound or so here and there.  We also know lots of hunters (and my husband wants to hunt this fall) and have had to turn down meat because we don't have the space.  Not once we get a freezer!  Soon, it will be ours.

Another thing I've noticed is how vastly your view of what food is changes.  Now I get repulsed looking at pizza when before it made me drool.  For a while I missed baked goods but not only does GF baking suck, but I suck at GF baking.  I find that it's better to just indulge in a cheat for the real deal rather than try to attempt and get disappointed, therefor making you crave the real thing even more.  Lately it's been that way with icecream.  When it gets really hot or I just really want a treat, I get one of those 118ml Haagen Dazs icecreams with the spoon inside.  The strawberry kind is my favourite because the ingredient list is so small and yeah, it's a mega sugar rush, but it's such a small serving.  If I were to buy a tub there'd be NO WAY I'd be able to only have that much and be done (I have 0 willpower if it's in front of me/I have easy access.)

Yes we have slipped occasionally.  But we've never quite ""fallen off the wagon"" and I'm very proud of that.  It's been quite a year of learning and for my son, growing, and for my husband, shrinking, and it's been great.  I wish our families understood what we're doing but we remember the days when we didn't think of food as fuel and not just gut-filler and we forgive them.  I'm so glad to have stumbled upon this subreddit when I did.  Actually, it was from hitting ""random"".  I read a little and it just instantly clicked.  I remember actually saying outloud ""THIS MAKES SO MUCH SENSE.""  Been paleo ever since.

I know this will probably be down voted to oblivion, but I'm hoping we can have a mature discussion based on facts and evidence.

I have been following this paleo thing for a while, and I have noticed a disturbing trend. From what I can gather, many people who consider themselves proponents of this diet are under the impression that diets high in saturated fats are in fact healthy. Every other recipe or picture on this subreddit highlights bacon or coconut oil or red meat. People seem to think that the science out there regarding the adverse effects of saturated fats is incorrect, and I can't quite figure out why. The attitudes I have seen towards well-crafted scientific evidence concern me; it reminds me strongly of the creationist attitude toward scientific work.

Can we please discuss this problem? 

For instance, a large meta-analysis (considered to be the best, most reliable type of scientific study for these kinds of problems) [published in 2010 by Mozaffarian](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2843598), an epidemiologist at Harvard, showed very clearly that diets low in saturated fats were strongly associated with a decreased risk of coronary artery disease, one of the most prevalent and debilitating disorders in the modern world. There are literally hundreds of other studies showing the same thing. What does the paleo community think about this? If you think it's wrong or that you are somehow doing something that makes you immune to such adverse effects, what makes you so sure?

I DO NOT want to start a flame war. I would love to have a serious, measured, calm discussion of this issue. To be honest, I am worried about you guys and gals. As a medical student, I see people suffering from the metabolic and vascular complications of poor dietary choices every day. Many of these diseases are silent for decades, and by the time they raise their heads the smoking gun is often devastating. 

I want to be able to give my future patients advice about their dietary choices that is simple and based in evidence. I think there are a lot of great things about paleo, especially the removal of simple and processed carbohydrates from the diet. I am just worried that some of the other parts of paleo are based in dogma that could be dangerous in the long run.

Prove to me that the paleo community is mature and willing to examine itself critically. Your long-term success depends on it!

Many of us in the paleo community will pooh-pooh research that seems to discount the benefits (or that emphasizes the risks) of a paleo diet/lifestyle.

At the same time, though, pro-paleo research quite often gets a pass, and crappy science is ignored, since we agree with its results.

I don't know about you all, but I'm of the opinion that this is bad for us as a whole. It contributes to a hive mentality that keeps us from questioning the things we read and weakens any credibility we may have. 

I don't want to simply delete this sort of post, as I feel like they can provide valuable conversation, but I also want people to be wary of jumping onto bandwagons based on bad science.

To try and help with this, I'd like to ask you all to keep an eye out for crappy science (either pro-paleo or anti-paleo) being posted here. If you see something that sounds fishy, post a comment as to WHY it sounds fishy (""I disagree with this"" does not make something bad science), and hit the ""report"" button so we can check it out. 

I (and maybe other mods) will be keeping an eye out for these reports and sticking a ""quasi-science"" flair (see the GMO post on the front page) onto anything questionable to help remind people to try and vet things you're planning on using as a basis for your health and well-being. :)

Thanks for your help!

1338312911.0,136,self.Paleo,uam23,So you wanna eat paleo,kittydavis,157,21,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/uam23/so_you_wanna_eat_paleo/,"There’s been a lot of posts asking how to eat paleo on a budget. As a student and the only one eating paleo in a 3-person household, I’ve figured out some tricks that have helped maintain my budget while still reaping the benefits of a paleo diet. I hope what I’ve written here helps someone. Maybe some of the stuff I’ve written here is inaccurate, but this comes from personal experience and listening to my body and what it wants.

* Meat:

Most of my grocery money is spent on meat. Meat is what’s going to keep you full. Veggies, although filling initially, won’t keep you as satiated as meat does. 

**Ground**: Ground meat is extremely cheap and versatile. Ground beef has a prominent spot in my diet. I love it because it keeps me full for a long time and it can be used to cook a variety of dishes – I never get bored eating the stuff. If you’re going to be eating a lot of grain-fed ground meat, purchase the lean variety.

**Whole chicken**: Whole chickens are inexpensive and just one bird provides you with multiple meals. The bones and small bits of meat that remain from the chicken can then be used to make a soup or stock.

* Awful offal

I know most people still have nightmares about being force-fed liver and onions as a child, but liver really is deserving of a second chance. Liver, heart, tongue and brain are dense with nutrients and will do your body good.  

* Fat

I love butter’s fatty goodness and coconut oil is a luxury I am sometimes guilty of buying. However, both can be quite pricy. Saving your bacon grease or [rendering](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/how-to-render-beef-tallow/#axzz1wHEmhKLh) your own tallow or lard (purchased from a farmer or butcher) are great ways to save some money in the cooking fat department. Avocados are also a significant part of my diet.   

* Vegetables:

I save money by buying frozen veggies. Yes, there isn’t much variety in frozen veggies, but they’re cheap and just as healthy. When I do have some money to play with, I splurge and buy luxuries like sweet potatoes and asparagus. Another trick to help you save some cash is to buy veggies that are in [season](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7YDpfoXlxqc/TyYUaLCTa0I/AAAAAAAAAyY/PMw7gRTiW5c/s1600/seasonality-of-fruits-and-vegetables.bmp).  

* Tips and tricks:

1. Eggs are your friends. They’re cheap, full of nutrients, satiating and yummy, too! 
2. Keep an eye out for sales.
3. Plan your meals ahead of doing groceries. Walking around the store with your head cut off, trying to invent meals for the weak off the top of your head is no easy feat and sometimes you end up buying stuff you never use. Buy only what you know you’ll consume to minimize waste.
4. Fast intermittently. Yeah, sometimes I just seem to be super low on cash and don’t eat at certain “meal times”. [Intermittent fasting](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/how-to-intermittent-fasting/) is beneficial and saves you cash!  

I'm in quite a rush and typed this up quickly. If you guys have any other tips, lemme know!

Recently I started adding 1-2 teaspoons of sodium to my diet. Holy crap, I feel like a squirrell on speed.

I totally underestimated the importance of proper salt intake, espacially when you're on a LC diet. LC = moar salt!!!

When you walk in the store there are signs everywhere promoting this healthy, local source of meat. Corn is the bottom of the barrel when it comes to cattle feed and I'm worried that a chain of this size, and the OCFB are going to start a trend with other large grocery chains.

It’s been a while since someone has had some reasonable arguments against paleo.   At least you did your homework and thought critically about this.

&gt;So from what I understand, the paleo diet is about eating like the Paleolithic man and that it's supposed to be beneficial to your health.

Yeah, the basic idea is that people in the Paleolithic era lived very healthy lives, and didn't suffer from stuff like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, etc.  All of the ""new world diseases"".  The idea is that if you eat roughly the same foods as they ate, and are about as active, you stand a good chance of also being healthy.  People usually stick with this diet because they see some reduction or elimination of symptoms of modern day diseases like IBS, Chron’s, arthritis and other joint pain, seasonal allergies, acid reflux, autoimmune diseases like MS, etc.  This could be due to a shift from a really shitty diet to one of whole foods, but regardless of the reason it seems to work.

&gt;First of all, meat seems to be a big part of paleo. What evidence is there that Paleolithic man ate a whole lot of meat? Have you ever hunted? It's difficult, even with modern weapons. For most wild predators these days, a kill is somewhat rare, and especially for omnivorous humans without speed or strength or claws, it would seem even more so. The more likely scenario is that they would make an occasional large kill and feast on meat for a couple days before it spoiled, and go back to roots, nuts, berries, etc. for quite a while after that. Probably the bulk of the meat they did eat was insects and rodents, but I don't see mice as a big part of the paleo diet.

Humans seem to have a neat ability to track animals using the best weapon we have, our big brains.  Louis Liebenberg, who went to live with and study modern day hunter-gatherers in Africa writes: 

&gt;“When tracking an animal, one attempts to think like an animal in order to predict where it is going,” Louis says. “Looking at its tracks, one visualizes the motion of the animal and feels that motion in one’s own body. You go into a trancelike state, the concentration is so intense. It’s actually quite dangerous, because you become numb to your own body and can keep pushing yourself until you collapse.” [...] “When you track, you’re creating causal connections in your mind, because you didn’t actually see what the animal did,” Louis realized. “That’s the essence of physics.” With speculative hunting, early human hunters had gone beyond connecting the dots; they were now connecting dots that existed only in their minds.

So to answer the ""difficult to hunt"" portion of it, it appears as though humans, when raised to hunt, are quite good at it, perhaps even adapted towards it much like lions and wolves are.

Regarding the ""how much meat did they really eat"" that really depends on location.  The actual diets of Paleolithic man varied greatly based on location.  We honestly don't know what people back in the Paleolithic era ate.  Aside from some DNA sampling and bone testing, we really don't know much.  We know they ate meat from bone testing.  Based on the information we have today, here is what we know:

http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/71/3/682.full

Specifically this graph

which shows that *all* studied hunter-gatherer societies (229) ate more than 16% of calories from hunted and fished food.  73% of which ate more than 50% of their calories from hunted and fished foods.  An important note, this does NOT include gathered foods, which would include vegetables, fruits, nuts, but also insects, reptiles, and small mammals that could be gathered instead of hunted.  So I think based on this data, that it is safe to say that meat was an important part of the hunter-gatherer diet.

As for rodents and insects not being part of the diet, I really think that's a good thing to talk about, and something that should probably be included into the diet.  One of the criticisms I see about the paleo diet, even from people who advocate it, is the low calcium content in the diet by excluding dairy.  Perhaps these societies got their calcium from eating insects, or perhaps because they were eating significant amounts of vitamin K2, A (retinol not carotenes) and absorbing D, their calcium needs were less than what they are today with many of those being less or absent from current diets.  The Tarahumara in Mexico don’t consume any dairy but get their calcium by making their tortillas on rocks which contain a lot of calcium.  I wonder if they switched to using pots and pans instead of rocks if they would become calcium deficient.

&gt;Grains seem to be a big no-no, and again, I think it's probably likely that early man ate quite a bit of seeds and grains. [...] Hell, even looking at the teeth of lots of early skulls, they're worn down quite a bit to suggest lots of grinding type chewing. Likely seeds and grains.

Paleolithic man certainly ate grains, but it doesn't appear as though it was a major part of their calories, at least from the data we have available today.  The tooth wear could come from many different things, but one theory is that Paleolithic peoples would add sand or dirt to foods to help aid in the grinding process (mortar and pestle), and those bits would accelerate tooth wear.  Unwashed roots may also be a source.  We do know that once we moved from a hunter-gatherer life style to an agricultural life style, our life spans decreased, we got shorter, our bones became weaker, and we got more cavities.  I think this transition is particularly interesting because peoples back in those times had similar problems (no modern medicine, good exercise, death from traumas, feat/famine, etc) so the likely hood that diet played a role in those changes is high.  It is possible that some of those changes were selection biases based on new life styles.  Getting shorter may be because of a malnourished diet (heavy grains, less meat, less veggies, micronutrients suffer) or because being tall wasn't nearly as important since hunting wasn't as important as it was before.  Life spans going down could have been due to living close together and getting sick more often, but could have also been due to a reduction in micronutrient dense foods.

&gt;Third, early man was not known for his longevity. [...] They ate all they could get their hands on to survive, and if you went back in time and provided them with all the refined, processed food in the world, I'm sure they'd eat it up.

Common causes of death for hunter-gatherer peoples were due to trauma (broken legs) and illness such as pneumonia or other infections.  The average age of 35 is somewhat misleading since much of the deaths were children.  Like wild animals, the % chance of living past 2 years old is very low.  This drives the average age way down.  I actually haven't researched this topic very much, but one book I did read on the !kung said that only 10% of the population were over 60 years old, but life expectancy if you can make it to 15 was 55 years old.  I would love to see the age data on those 226 HG societies that were studied, and I wonder if anyone has put that together.  Back to the wild animal analogy, if you take wild animals and move them into captivity like a zoo, you are removing many of the causes of death.  Infection, trauma, starvation pretty much disappear, but if the animals aren't fed something very close to their natural diet, in most cases they develop other diseases and complications.  However, if kept in captivity, and fed something that resembles their natural diet, they generally live disease free for 2-3x their life span in the wild and die of natural causes.  I assume the same will/would happen for humans.

As for giving them processed foods, of course they would eat it, and they do.  It doesn't mean it's going to be healthy for them.  Weston A Price (a dentist) traveled to many parts of the world and observed traditional societies (some hunter-gatherer but mostly pastoral and agriculturalists) eating their native diets.  They were very healthy, with fully developed skulls and straight, cavity free teeth.  The societies didn't suffer from modern diseases UNTIL processed white flour and sugar were added to the diets.  Their teeth became crooked, full of cavities, and rates of heart disease, cancer, etc went up.  This was back in the 30's so it was well before monster energy drinks, honey buns, and lucky charms.  They simply replaced their micronutrient rich diets with empty calories from refined and processed grains and sugars.  That’s one of the reasons we have to fortify most of our breads, even the whole grain ones.  With nearly everything else remaining the same, it only took 10-20 years of adopting a diet higher in processed foods, they died of the same diseases we do today.

I think what all of this tells us is that adopting a diet consisting of whole foods and learning from healthy populations we may be healthier than our processed junk eating brothers and sisters.  Personally I think some grains can be part of a healthy diet, but shouldn't make up the majority of the calories and should be properly prepared.  If making bread, grains should be soaked/fermented, stone ground, and yeast risen.  If using wheat it should be the type that healthy populations eat (einkorn style).  If other grains like oatmeal, they should be also soaked/fermented into a porridge like dish.  While I don't consume grains, I find it difficult to argue against the low/moderate consumption of properly prepared heritage breed grains in the context of a healthy diet for those not suffering from gluten sensitivities.",,False,self,t5_2qzzs,False,,,True,t3_17p8o9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/17p8o9/on_the_skeptical_questions_about_the_paleo_diet/,

http://imgur.com/ul85Y

This was me in November I was 192ish.
http://imgur.com/3ORus


Im pretty pic shy. The pic of me on the bike was right 'before' weight lifting and primal. It was taken in October at around 195ish. I'll take another pic this evening. 

I know I have some cheats. I'm basically paleo - but with dairy. I've really got no problems with dairy. I did eliminate it for 30 and I was miserable - glad to have it back with no ill effects. 

So, here is my 'complete' story.

In June 2010, I was 340lbs. I'm 5 ft 11in and I had a 56 inch waist.

I was going up a flight of stairs, and literally almost fell out.

I decided right there to change.

I bought a bike from the LBS and started riding. I eliminated cokes and sweet tea and cut way back. No paleo yet. So from June 2010 to October 2011, I lost 140lbs dieting (calories in/out) and cardio (biking).

I hit a wall at around 200lbs. I want to be 170 - so I wasn't happy. I found the Daily Apple and order Sisson's book Primal Blueprint 21 days.

This was in October. I did the 30 day challenge sans dairy - and quickly readded dairy - but other than that no wheat, legumes, seed oils, or rice since. 

I've dropped to right at 180lbs now. At the same time, I started lifiting weights (something I've never done at the age of 37).  I was super weak and started with the 5x5 program.

I started with the bar and in these 3 months I've progessed to:

Squats (deep full) - 5x5 - 200lbs
Deads 5x5 200lbs
Reverse rows 140 lbs
Bench press 150 lbs
Push Press 90lbs

When I stared I could not do a single chin up / pull up / or dip.

Now I can do 10 unassisted chin ups / 3 unassisted pullups / and 15 unassisted bodyweight dips.

I also do 100 pushups and 100 air squats on 'off days' lifting, and I still ride my bike 40-50 miles total on weekends (this is my 'play') - I enjoy biking immensely.

I walk my 2 miles to and from work every day, and that is my slow movement.

Per calipers in October, I was 17% bodyfat.

Per calipers today, I was 11.9% bodyfat.

If anyone is on the fence about this, I've had great experiences. 

My pressure is down from around 130/75 in October to 105/60 average now. Also, my resting heart rate has fallen from 60ish to low 50ish.

I feel so blind for thinking that Vegetarianism was the healthiest way to live my life. 

long story short - I've been eating meat for a few weeks now and about to go full paleo. yesterday was my first 'true' paleo day without any bread, and I feel SO much better already. I have ENERGY. I think the turning point was a literal 'food coma' I had after sharing half of a pizza hut dinner box with my boyfriend a few weeks ago.. that much bread is terrible. :(

This morning, we butchered our first [home-bred mulefoot hog](http://imgur.com/Hctir), a seven-month-old boar.

Anyone visiting the house would assume that they had stepped into a horror movie, with alarming-looking body parts scattered everywhere.

[Head in the sink...](http://imgur.com/l6vys)

[Dismembered limbs...](http://imgur.com/1hFcp)

Organs on the counter... 

So, yes, this is how I spent my day. I had sliced pig liver thrown on the griddle for sixty seconds for lunch. 

*Jesus. Tap-dancing. Christ.* 

It was the best liver I've ever tasted.

There's a [de-boned pig head](http://imgur.com/Qw22W), complete with the snout, rolled around the tongue and roasting on a bed of shallots and onions in the oven.

And yet, I feel the need to rant. Why? Because I paid a meat locker to butcher this little guy for us. (If I can't lift it without machinery, I don't butcher it. The biggest critter I'll do is a goat.)

My regular processor had to retire over the winter due to failing health. I've never used this place before. They came out and did on-farm butchering, which is great-- they did a very workmanlike job with that part, which is *a big deal* in my book. Piggie was minding his own business in familiar surroundings one moment, and the next moment-- pop!-- he was dead from a .22 slug to the brain.

I asked if they needed anything, and they said no... I should just call the office and let the people there know how we wanted the meat divided. So I left them to it, and when I came back a bit later, half of my beautiful (and expensive to feed) pig was in the waste bin with the guts and the poop.

This was my face: 

**D:**

So I silently freaked out for about five seconds; then got control of myself and politely asked if we could salvage all of the edible organs and other odds and ends, after apologizing for not specifying up front that I wanted everything from this pig but the oink.

They were not willing to process the head, so I had to do it myself.

*They didn't know what trotters were.* Apparently, no one had ever asked to keep them before. So... I had to process those myself, as well.

One of the guys rummaged around in the gut bucket and retrieved the liver and heart. I think the kidneys and oysters are MIA. The skin wasn't salvageable-- the hair had poop all over it from being in with the intestines. I've just this moment realized that I didn't specify anything about the lard, so I have no idea if I'll see any of that. Or the bones, come to think of it.

Am I really that out of step?

Do other people seriously feed a hog for between five months and a year (which is DAMNED expensive), only to discard everything except a few paltry muscle cuts? I not only find that incomprehensible; I find it *offensive*.

I mean... that animal just gave its *life* so that my family could eat it. And I'm just supposed to let half of it go to the landfill? WTF?

Turns out my blood sugar was only slightly elevated, but due to my family history of diabetes, she wanted to talk to me about how to make changes to stop from becoming diabetic, get my cholesterol down, and counteract my anemia. She told me to cut out carbs, use butter, olive or coconut oil, and eat lots of meat and vegetables. I asked, wearily, if she meant like the Paleo diet...and she said YES! That's the best diet for you to both lose weight and get the blood sugar and cholesterol under control. I was worried for nothing, and now even more sure that the choice to eat Paleo and get my fat ass moving are**the** changes that are going to change my life and health. Thanks to everyone who gave me tips and inspiration. I am now twice as committed to get healthy.

- There is nothing wrong with having more meat 

- Meat and veg is the best kind of dinner anyway why clog it up with carbs

- Fruit is natures candy (shout to Marge Simpson for that)

- If you just put some thought into it this is the most satisfying diet

- In 2 months ive gone from 230 to 212 without feeling like ive been on a diet at all (This loss could of been greater but im back in the gym now and putting muscles weight back on :) )

- BBQ everything if you can (you loose nutrients but it tastes amazing)

- Garlic improves EVERYTHING 

- Bacon. Nothing needs to be said about this.

- Most important; my depression is so reduced I'm fucking amazed... I would've never guess a diet could make your mood that much better! I noticed my mood got better by upping my fat intake, and so I upped it a bit through the months.

- More energy, more awake, more alert, less tired! This is pretty intersting, because I just realized when writing this, that my memeory has also gotten better (altough I'm just 21). I used to forget everything before, like sometimes I would put my keys some place and forget where I put them a second after. Anything similar like that hasn't happened once on this diet.

- Now the naps I sometimes take in the middle of the day are pleasant, where as before I usually woke up from my powernaps with headaches, dehydrated and all that. Now I feel rested and happy when I wake up. 

- I have rosacea, and this diet has made it much better. And, my skin was dry and flaky before, especially on my nose- and eyebrow-area. Not anymore though. :)

- Can go much longer without feeling the need to eat, which is awesome.

- This is kinda stupid, and kinda nice too; My ears... they are REALLY clean... wtf? I used to have shitloads of earwax and it wasn't long ago before i started the diet that my ears got clogged because of it. Now when I clean my ears I usually notice there isn't anything there to clean. Feels good man! I also wonder why this is... we need an ear-specialist to answer this!

Also, I have some questions:

How much of my calories should come from fat and how much from proteins? I'm especially interested in how much fat I can eat at maximum (if there really is a limit as long as you don't eat so much you get fat?).

And also, I'm doing strength training, and this diet seems to work nice along with that: enough protein, easy to get enough calories, and in my case pretty low carb (around 40g a day). My question is, would I benefit from eating more carbs? And in that case, what are the best paleo carb sources?",,False,self,t5_2qzzs,1354116032.0,,,True,t3_13xp5g,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/13xp5g/depression_almost_gone_and_so_is_the_earwax/,

I'm 6'2"" and was normally hovering around 240lbs, she was the heaviest she has ever been (for fear of retribution I won't say her weight here). We tried the Atkins route, we have tried calorie counting, vegetarian, etc... none of these were easy on us since we also have two children that seem to always talk us into Pizza, Pasta and all the other stuff we should be eating. 

I've been reading about Paleo for the last month (July), everything clicked with me, it all made a lot of sense. So I kept trying to talk my wife into giving it a shot. She would do the standard claims of why it wouldn't work and that it would be difficult for us to do with the kids and all of the other excuses she could find.

At the end of July she finally gave up the excuses and we both agreed to give it a shot for the entire month of August. 

Here it is August 13th, I'm down to 229lbs (as of yesterday morning) and my cronic back issues (herniated disk about 6 years ago) has calmed down a lot. She has almost lost 10lbs as well and has more energy than she knows what to do with. This weekend she made the statement ""I love eating knowing that I won't feel horrible when I'm done"" and I completely agree with her!

I measure 1.74m (5.7ft). I'm a man. Went down to 75kg (165lbs). I'm really proud of that, and I'm still loosing weight. I want to reach ~72kg (158lbs), and keep loosing fat, but start gaining muscles.

In these 8 weeks, I cooked for myself for 5 weeks (I was on a business trip for 3 weeks in the US… that was very hard).

Well, that's great. But the awesome thing is that I now take the time to cook. And I'm really enjoying that. I can spend hours in the kitchen :)

Here are a couple of things I'm cooking these days. Please bare in mind that I'm a beginner. I am never sure which piece of meat I'm cooking. Feel free to comment and tell me if I break any Paleo rule, or if there are any way to improve these recipes. Oh, and you won't see any eggs because I just don't like eggs.

(when oil is mentioned, I mean olive oil)

1) Beef + Asparagus:

(takes 15 minutes to prepare)

- [photo 1](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulrouget/7760662268/in/photostream)
- [photo 2](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulrouget/7760670650/in/photostream)
- in a plate, put the green asparagus, add some oil, pepper and garlic (no salt)
- in the over for &lt; 10 minutes (200°c)
- in the meantime, cook you piece of beef (I like it rare)
- take the asparagus out, cut in pieces, add some sea salt (or olives cut in pieces)

2) Slow roasted Tomatoes (this seriously delicious):

(takes 3 minutes to prepare, needs to be cooked for hours).

Perfect for salads. You can save that for weeks (in oil).

- [photo 1](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulrouget/7748808166/in/set-72157630991756204)
- [photo 2](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulrouget/7748796054/in/set-72157630991756204)
- cut 3 or 4 tomatoes in small slices
- add unpeeled segments of garlic
- oil, sea salt, pepper
- in the over for 1 or 2 hours (less then 100°c)
- take it out. ""press"" the garlic to remove the skin

3) Stew beef + mushrooms

- [photo 1](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulrouget/7748800188/in/set-72157630991756204)
- [photo 2](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulrouget/7748792654/in/set-72157630991756204)
- Cook quickly the beef in a pan to give it some color (add some fat)
- add onions, melt the onions
- put everything in a dish, add mushrooms, and put it in the oven for… as long as you want (several hours)
- the beef will melt in your mouth :)

4) Mint beef:

- [photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulrouget/7748843778/in/set-72157630991756204)
- cook your steak
- while it's resting, cut mint leaves in pieces
- cut your steak in slices, add mint, some lemon juice, (add nuts if you want), spinach

5) Peach pork:

- [photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulrouget/7748857048/in/set-72157630991756204)
- cut a piece of pork in pieces
- cut some peaches in pieces
- cook the pork and some onions in a pan
- when the onions are melted, add the peaches
- cook more
- when done, add some mint

6) Pork stuffed with zucchinis, garlic and bacon:

- [photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulrouget/7748838382/in/set-72157630991756204)
- open a pork tenderloin (cut one centimeter inside, and then slowly cut toward the side of the meat)
- once open, put some garlic, cover with bacon, add slices of zucchinis
- wrap with aluminum foil
- in the oven (~200c), for an hour

7) Broccoli, mushroom, pork:

- [photo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/paulrouget/7748816298/in/set-72157630991756204)
- In a pan, cook your pork
- take the pork out, use the remaining fat to cook to mushrooms
- mix cut pork and mushrooms in a pan, add the broccoli, cook for a couple of minutes

8) Vegetable mix for a whole week:

So I use that as my ""lazy-food"", when I don't want to cook.
I put all these vegetables in a casserole, cook them slowly for ~90minutes,
add some mushrooms, and save that in the fridge. If I'm lazy and don't want
to cook (for lunch usually), I just eat that (I usually add some meat):

- cut everything
- cook everything
- eat everything (add some fresh coriander)

I just wanted to thank everyone for their contributions to this subreddit. In the past year, I've gone from nearly 200 pounds as a 5'3"" woman to 135 pounds. The first 40-ish pounds were done through calorie counting, and moderately low carb (almost always staying under 100g carbs, usually closer to 50g a day). I eventually hit a plateau, and decided to switch to keto. I lost a couple pounds, but I found the intense carb restriction to be not awesome. I love carrots, spaghetti squash, cucumbers...pretty much EVERY veggie under the sun, but I found my self looking at baby carrots when I was hungry and going ""5g carbs per serving? PASS"", and then go for something like cheese. While I feel fine eating cheese and dairy (though, I haven't had milk in a year. I much prefer coconut/almond milk), it's so calorie dense, and I found that as a small-ish woman, keto was very hard for me to actually lose weight on because of all the high calorie foods, the limits on fruits and veggies and the focus on meats and fats. 

I love me some meat, and I consume mostly protein and could never be a vegetarian, but I found my self completely unsatisfied on keto despite all the fat i was eating, which is not what is supposed to happen. If I ate more fat/calories, even with carbs under 20g, I gained weight.

So, not only did I find my self missing fruits and veggies (god forbid I went over 30g carbs a day on keto), but I also missed healthy things like honey, maple syrup, and sweet potatoes. I missed going to the local farms here in upstate NY, and buying honey on the comb, or their fresh veggies and wonderful fruits. I know veggies are allowed on keto, but I'd eat so little every day because of the high carb content of some, that most of it would go bad. I understand that keto is wonderful and is such an awesome lifestyle for many people, but ultimately keto is not for me. 80/20 paleo seems much better for ME, because it actually seems a lot LESS restrictive, and something that I can stick to forever!

It's easy for me to cut out wheat/breads, beans, and sugar, because I've already been doing that for over a year. I probably won't cut out greek yogurt/cheese, or peanut butter as I've never felt any ill affects from them (I cut them out for a while, and added them back in, and felt the same)

Anyway, I look forward to being apart of this subreddit, and I feel the paleo lifestyle is going to be a very positive thing in my life. ",,False,self,t5_2qzzs,False,,,True,t3_16tkh3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/16tkh3/went_from_moderately_low_carb_to_keto_to_here/,

And that's the cost of it all. 

Whenever I see 'Almond' this or that I already fear for my wallet. When I'm going on this subreddit I'm mostly looking for 'normal' meal substitutes. But when I can financially only eat it 4 days a week instead of 7 days a week the 'normal' way I can't call it a substitute yet :(

Went to the store and couldn't find a damn pair that fit. I finally ended up buying the largest size that I've ever had to buy, and I went home, ashamed and holding back the tears.

It was around that time that my husband and I decided to go paleo. We both noticed the changes right away, especially him. My changes were more gradual, but have been consistent.

I realized that the pair of jeans that I bought back in November ended up in the back of the drawer because they were too big on me, and then I started noticing all of my old clothes fit me the way they used to...and then they were way too big.

So today, I finally went out and bought myself a new pair of jeans and I'm still in shock that I fit in the same size that I wore in HIGH SCHOOL. I'm 30. I haven't worn this size for 12 years. I had honestly lost hope LONG ago that I'd ever fit into pants this size again, especially after having kids.

As time has gone on, and I've learned more about the science, read Taubes and Eades and Wolf, surfed a lot of leading blogs, read some of the ""studies"" advocating high-carb diets, and other, better studies, proving them wrong... I've been getting progressively more angry.  

I feel like I've been lied to my whole life.  I'm 30 years old, and I've always been an active person, but I've also always been overweight.  I have religiously followed whole-grain, low-fat diets, and never lost weight.  I mocked the Atkins people (c'mon, *of course* you need carbs), tracked my calories, and bought everything I could find, ""fat free"", yet I remained anything but.

The more facts I uncover, the angrier I get.  I've been to nutritionists and doctors, and never learned about how insulin causes fat storage, or how cholesterol itself doesn't cause heart disease, or that eating fat doesn't make you fat.  Instead, I learn about how the USDA had an assistant secretary fishing for a scientist that would sign off on a carb-heavy food pyramid, and how the McGovern commission recommended all Americans reduce saturated fat, because McGovern was on a low-fat diet, and decided to ignore the advice of the scientists on the commission, and how Ancel Keys cherry-picked his way to the cover of Time magazine.

Is anyone else angry at how the American people have essentially been engineered to be overweight, and to believe that it's because of their own moral failings, and not because the recommendations of the government were *making them fatter*?!?  I mean, I'm already a libertarian, but this whole food fiasco has made me surer than ever that government is not an entity to be trusted.

- Sex: Male
- Age: 33
- Height: 6'0""
- Weight: 175 lbs. 
- Body fat %: ~15%

I started eating a paleo diet on December 26th, 2011.  In late February, I had a cholesterol test.  HDL was a bit low - 38.  LDL was a bit high - 140.  At that time, the doc recommended a low-cholesterol diet.  However, the whole reason I had the tests performed was so I could see exactly how paleo eating affected my lipid levels.  A low cholesterol diet it is not!

So, for the past 6 months, I've concentrated on eating lots and lots of Omega 3s.  LOTS of leafy greens and fresh veggies.  Only grass-fed/pastured meat and eggs.  Wild-caught fish at least once weekly.  1.5g EHA/DHA via fish oil daily.  Standard stuff.

Today was my 6 month followup.  Here's how it came out:

- Total Cholesterol: 207
- Triglycerides: 64  (this was over 200 3 years ago!)
- HDL: 52 
- Cholesterol/HDL: 4.0
- LDL (Friedewald formula): 142
- LDL/HDL: 2.7
- VLDL: 13

If I calculate my LDL using the Iranian formula, it's only 122.  Holy shit.  I've never seen my lipids this good, even when I was a young adult!

The doc said normally he would be concerned about the LDL and recommend starting medication, but in light of my HDL and associated ratios, he said medication would provide no benefits and only do harm.  Yes, I can keep eating bacon and eggs for breakfast every day.

Thank you, paleo, for allowing me to eat delicious foods that make me healthy.

The nurse also said I was one of their success stories at the gym and asked me to write a testimonial and get a picture with my trainer to use on their website and in their newsletter.

To date: there have been many changes! I lost 73lbs, I began course work to become a personal trainer, I got a part time job doing front desk work at a gym, I will be shadowing some trainers at my gym while I am studying for my CPT exam, and I COMPLETED WARRIOR DASH!

Hello!

I am working on a Paleo/dietary restrictions app idea and wanted to get some initial feedback. My idea essentially is a restaurant meal planner based on dietary restrictions.

Here's a sample userflow:

1. You are Paleo and have dairy/soy restrictions. You want to go out to eat tonight with some friends in San Francisco, and more specifically, want to try out a new Indian restaurant. But before you go to the restaurant, you must first find out if they serve food that meet your dietary needs.

2. You enter in the app your location (San Francisco), your desired type of cuisine (Indian food) and your dietary restrictions (Paleo and dairy/soy restrictions).

3. The app crunches your criteria and brings up a list of Indian restaurants in San Francisco that serve menu items that are Paleo and adhere to dairy/soy restrictions.

4. You scroll through the list of restaurants and tap on the one you want to browse.

5. The app then shows you the exact menu items in that Indian restaurant that are Paleo and dairy/soy free. 

6. Now you know the restaurant can serve your dietary needs and what exactly to order before you even get there.

I am on Paleo and this is a problem I often struggle with whenever I go out to eat with friends. Since it is a lifestyle choice (and not a medical need like peanut allergies), I often compromise my Paleo diet so not to make eating out a hassle for my friends. Sure, I use Yelp, but there's often not as much information on Yelp pages for me to discern if something is Paleo or has other dietary restrictions.

So my question to all of you is:

1. **Would you use the app above, if it existed? If so, are there things you would add to it or take away? Any wishlist items?**

(Just to clarify -- this would ideally cover criteria of vegetarian/vegan/Paleo/gluten free as well as food allergies, so it's not just simply Paleo)

2. **What are your typical habits or ways of finding out if a restaurant is Paleo friendly or not? Yelp? Word of mouth? Online communities?**

3. **What other problems are you facing when eating out? What kind of things would you love to see that would solve those problems?**

If you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, I would absolutely love the chance to briefly chat with you via phone/email/in person and get direct feedback. I am interested in rolling out a private beta later this year.

Thanks in advance for reading and any feedback you can provide :)",,False,self,t5_2qzzs,1374225587.0,,,True,t3_1iijq2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/1iijq2/question_how_do_you_eat_out_with_friends_and/,
