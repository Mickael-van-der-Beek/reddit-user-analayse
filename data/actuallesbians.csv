I correct them and have discussions with them about it and how it would be like me saying ""That's so Hawaiian"" or ""That's so Micronesian"" every time I thought something was dumb, stupid etc. (SN: There is a lot of racism here and your ethnicity is a huge deal in the islands). 
It didn't really sink in for one kid who one day went off on another kid calling him gay, among other things. 
I had enough and sent him to the office to talk to our wonderful AP hoping she could make a point. 
He came back later and I didn't really want to confront him at all but thought it would only be meaningful if he had a follow-up.
I sat down next to him on the front steps of a classroom and asked him if he understood why you can't use slurs or generalized references like that of any kind.
We had a good talk about how it might affect the kids that ARE gay in the school. 

He turned his head to me and said, ""Wait miss, are you gay?""
And I said yes. He paused, thoughtfully, and then said, ""Wait, so you like girls?""
- ""yes...""
""But, wait miss, do you like girls because you want to be a boy? Do you want to be a boy? I have a friend like that.""
I said no and he goes...""Ok...well, I'm pretty cool with you getting married. You're cool, Miss""

A week later, I saw/overheard him correcting a student who said, ""That's so freaking gay!!!"" by saying, ""If you were gay or if someone went around saying that's so *insert student name* then you would be upset and that's just not very nice, regardless of what you think about people being gay in the first place. We should all just be nice and laughing at people isn't.""

There is however, the possibility of things going seriously wrong. The moderation team has just been made aware of one such situation where things almost turned bad (we won't go into details). We would however like to use this as an opportunity to point out the dangers of meeting people that you met online in real life.

First of all we want you to realize that we (the moderators) have no control over who has access to this subreddit. We try to create a space that is as safe as possible towards queer women. But reddit simply isn't the place and doesn't have the tools to create a TRULY safe space. There is no way for us to keep people with bad intentions of this subreddit

As such we would like to remind you that such people are possibly lurking around this subreddit. And ask that you take the neccesary precautions for your own safety. We certainly don't want to discourage you from finding a partner on AL, but please, be safe!

We'd like to conclude with a few pieces of advice on staying safe.

1. Meet in public. We can't stress this enough!
2. Let friends/family know that you are meeting this person. Let them know where you are. Agree to call this person after an agreed upon time. So that if you don't call, they know something is wrong!
3. Get in a video conversation (skype for example) with the person. At least this way you know the person isn't deceiving you about how they look. People can still trick you even after this, but its just another precaution. 
4. Get the persons facebook or other social media. It's easy to make fake profiles, but it's not easy to fake the amount of friends most people have. Sure, some people refuse to use social media or just don't have that many friends. But be cautious if the other person is hesitant to give out the social media or has very few friends/comments on their page. 

**Anyone else have any advice? Feel free to share them in the comments, I'll add them if they are good**

As a result of the Supreme Court's decision Wednesday to strike down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act, same-sex couples married in states that allow it are now entitled to federal benefits afforded to heterosexual couples. A separate ruling from the Supreme Court -- a rejection of an appeal on Proposition 8, which bans same-sex marriage in California -- paves the way for same-sex marriages to resume in that state.

She's been struggling this year with boys at school and her mixed feelings about them.  All the while, she and her best friend have been getting closer and closer.  She's been on restriction from privileges because of grades, but I decided to give her a reprieve this weekend.  We were going out rock climbing on Sunday with some friends and I told her she could invite her friend over Saturday evening to spend the night and go with us on Sunday.  Watching the interaction between the two of them, the look in my daughters eyes when she watched her friend, the level of affection they share, it was very obvious to me that they were much more than just friends, and just so adorable together.  We had a discussion after dropping her friend off Sunday evening, and she acknowledged that they were developing into a couple.  

Today, I took her to get a haircut, and she took a picture of what she wanted, a very short pixie cut, like her friend.  This evening, I was joking with her that her friends at school are definitely going to be making lesbian jokes now that she's rocking her new style.  She said they've all been saying that she and her friend were a couple anyways, so let them.  I asked her, ""So, you're gay"", and she sad, ""I'm gay.""  It was a very cool moment, and I'm just so happy for her.  She's coming to terms with who she really is and it's just so wonderful to see how much it has boosted her confidence.  She told me she's attracted mostly to other girls and she thinks her friends will all be just fine with it.  I just had a feeling she needed a little push, to make this breakthrough, and for once I truly feel like I did the right thing by my child.

We hadn't spoken to her for the past few days, but last night my daughter called and said she wanted to come home for the weekend.

Throwaway account due to the somewhat delicate nature of this post, but I just had to share. I'm 25, and up until this past July I was in *very* long term relationship with a guy. He was the only person who I'd ever been with. I've always questioned my sexuality (and gone back and forth- straight-gay-bi-straight-potentially asexual), but I'd resigned myself to being with this one man my whole life. I think part of why I stayed with him for so long is that I thought I had a very low sex drive and was afraid no one else would want me. 

Anyway, so we break up for unrelated reasons, I decide to give women a try, get an OK Cupid account and after a few false starts I meet this girl. This awesome girl. Aaaaaannnnd we did It. And It is **AWESOME.** 

Holy shit you guys, I never imagined it could be this way. I hardly recognize myself when I'm with her. I thought it would be awkward, or that I would be bad at it, or that I'd chicken out. But no. It's the most natural thing in the world. I'm learning all kinds of new things about myself. Like apparently I'm a ""top."" When I was with my ex I was always so passive, and getting him off was like a chore. Not so with this girl. I could spend all day doing nothing but making her cum. It's fabulous. It's great to realize that I don't have a low sex drive and there was nothing wrong with me- I'm just super, super gay. 

So yeah. I just had to tell someone. I don't want to talk about anything else these days, but this isn't exactly appropriate conversation for most people I know IRL. Thanks to all you awesome ladies who gave me advice in my several neurotic posts here from my main account.

It's our own private [Godwin's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law).  I totally realize that by posting this I may very well be precipitating yet another such discussion and for that I apologize, but I can't help but feel that this is a conversation about *real things* and not just opinions.  I'd like to try to elevate those conversations by establishing a baseline of facts.  
  
Let's start with some basics:  
============================================
  
__Things which **are not** transphobic:__  
  
* Not being interested in, or not dating, a specific woman *who happens to be trans*.  
* Not being interested in, or not dating, a specific woman *who does not currently have the genitalia you prefer*.  
* Not being interested in, or not dating, a specific woman *who just doesn't catch your eye*.  
  
__Things which **are** transphobic:__  
  
* Not being interested in, or not dating, a specific woman *because she is trans*.  
  
Trans women are women.  They are often indistinguishable from cis women.  They can't get pregnant, but neither can almost 10% of cis women, and fortunately in a lesbian couple there's usually a womb to spare.  (With enough forethought you might not need a sperm donor!)  Saying you're ""not attracted to trans women"" as a blanket statement cannot have a basis in empirical reality, but purely in prejudice.  It's not like not being attracted to redheads or blondes or butches, it's like not being attracted to immigrants, children of blue-collar workers or survivors of cancer.  ""Trans"" is, for the numerical majority of trans women, a history which says nothing about the person.  
  
  
Other common fallacies:  
============================================
  
* I've never been attracted to a trans woman, therefore trans women aren't attractive to me.  
  
Besides the obvious selection bias, the idea that ""Trans women look like X"" is where this statement goes horribly awry.  Trans women look like [this](http://janetmock.com/photos/), and [this](http://www.rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Jenna-Talackova-via-ModelMayhem.jpg) and thousands of other beautiful women who just don't advertise their history.  
  
If you are attracted to women, you are attracted to (some) trans women.  
  
  
* Ewwww, penis!  
  
You aren't into penii.  I get it, and for what it's worth neither am I.  To be fair, many trans women who carry that particular anatomical burden are not big fans of it either, so you have that in common at least.  But *many trans women don't*, and many of those who do won't for long.  Be careful about using this biased sample to rule out all trans women.  
  
Also, would you rule someone out because she had six toes?  Whenever I hear a straight man ask how sex works in the absence of a penis, I feel sorry for his girlfriends/wife, because he clearly doesn't understand how sexytimes work; when I hear a lesbian rule out trans women because of the presence of a hidden penis I feel sorry for her partner, because how superficial is that?  
  
It's valid to be not into penii.  this is, possibly, the *only* context in which anyone is allowed to care about a trans woman's genitalia.  But say as much and don't assert that all trans women == penis.  Those who aren't packing a strapless get a little annoyed by the assertion.  
  
  
* Transphobia == evil/mean/bad/poopy.  
  
Transphobia is, in the strictest sense, an ""irrational fear or dislike of transgender people"".  ""Fear"" and ""dislike"" are subjective terms and not something you have active control over.  There's no ill-intent implied here.  It is not an insult to be called transphobic, any more than it is an insult to be called trans.  
  
I'm a bit androphobic.  I accept and own that, and am trying to get over it by making male friends, challenging my own emotional responses and working through trauma.  It's not something I can control, but it doesn't give me the right to say ""all men are evil/rapists"".  
  
In the context of attraction: if you realize you dislike or are not attracted to trans women as a rule, trumping the holistic person, it should inspire you to do a little soul searching to understand why this is so.  If you can't get over it, you should recognize that it is *your* problem and not anyone else's.  If you are fortunate enough to have a trans person in your social circle, perhaps you could even try to overcome it. 
  
  
* Trans women are all *X*.  
  
Trans women are all trans.  Lesbians are all women who are attracted to women.  This is a tautological definition, but there is no other universal quality.  The moment you say (or imply) any other commonality, you're doing it wrong.   
  
  
  
Finally, please remember:  
------------------------------------------
  
The trans women who come in here and start these conversations are often on the most angsty leg of a very tumultuous journey.  Try not to add to their fears with pedantic or broad statements about their future courtships.  If you're 100% sure that you would never date a trans/black/Jewish/butch/immigrant woman, this may be a time to keep that to yourself.  
  
When you speak up to specifically exclude trans women from your romantic prospects *in a context defined by courtship* (ie: LGBT spaces), you are implicitly othering them in that community.  It's hard to explain why that is so, but it's impossible to ignore.  
  
I now live in the Boston area, after four years in NYC, and there are only a few contexts in which I'm proactively stealth (as opposed to incidentally stealth, which has become the norm).  The lesbian community is one, and these conversations are why.  I get a little sad about that sometimes.",,False,,t5_2rch0,1372642771.0,,,True,t3_15ha8u,http://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/15ha8u/on_dating_trans_women_and_transphobia/,

I thoroughly enjoyed this. I'm going to post what would be an edit here, as I cannot post one elsewhere. Several people asked why the photography and who took it.

If anyone needs a photographer at a great rate - let me know! Outside of this, I never expected any story related to me to make such news in such a wonderful community.

(please upvote for visibility),Freya-Freed,452,48,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/y47rl/al_is_looking_for_a_third_moderator_please_upvote/,"Al is still growing! Good news, except it also requires more moderation. killercacti and I can actually handle the current levels of moderation, but we decided its best to be prepared, especially if we both decide to go on a holiday again at roughly the same time!

So we're looking for a third moderator to help us out here at AL. We set up some criteria that we are looking for in a candidate. If you think you are suited to be a moderator at AL, please reply to this post with a comment describing why you think you would make a good moderator.

We're looking for people who are:

* Laid back and can stay calm even when dealing with offensive/insulting posts. 

* Able to distinguish ignorance from trolling. At AL we prefer educating people where possible. We don't think it gets us anywhere shouting at ignorant people and we'd much rather educate them on why their comments/posts/beliefs are offensive/ignorant.

* Educated on trans and bi issues 

* Can work in a team and pick up the existing moderation policies to act consistently with the other moderators

* Well versed in the English language and able to type coherently.

* Is willing to put in the time and effort to help make AL a great community

* Is a woman who likes women (be that lesbian, bi, pan or some other sexual orientation). As much as we try to be inclusive, we like our moderators to be able to relate to the bulk of our subscribers!

* Having a history of participation in this subreddit and previous moderation experience is a plus

Your duties as a moderator consist of: Approving submissions caught in the spam filter, deleting spam, deleting comments or submissions that are against our rules, updating the sticky posts on top, and every now and then leaving a moderator-like comment. 

If you think you are the right person for the job, please take your time to reply to this post. It will take us a while to make a list of all the candidates and come to a decision and we will make a new post when we have reached an agreement!",,False,,t5_2rch0,False,,,True,t3_y47rl,http://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/y47rl/al_is_looking_for_a_third_moderator_please_upvote/,moderator

http://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/uft2f/update_i_am_the_al_who_will_be_proposing_soon/

So I asked my girl on June 13th to marry me and she said YES! here are some pics on how I did it. It was a slight production that she describes as ""a fairytale"". I wanted to thank each and every one of you ALs who said such kind and inspiring words. Find your best friend, love them, and life will fill in around it. Feel free to ask any questions or anything else. :)

She was blindfolded and taken to an undisclosed location. This is what she saw when she took her blindfold off. During this I had our song playing in the background.

Thats me standing at the end with sparklers. 
Then she got to me and I handed her one.

I drop down and my friends light off like 100 fireworks! This is the moment I wanted captured during all the planning.

After she finally dried her tears and realized what happened she said yes. (took her like 20min to say yes through all the tears)
We are so happy together :)

Edit: WoW! I go to work and come home to top post plus 50 comments! Thank you ladies so much for all the congratulations, it means so much to feel supported! I did not pull all that off alone, it took some help from some awesome friends. I'm glad we can inspire y'all to want such a beautiful moment. YOU WILL FIND IT! I promis :). Thanks again. I can't wait to show this to my lady!!

I see how frustrated you are, and your eyes are darting back and forth as you're going through calculations in your head, and I'm biting my tongue so. hard. because I know that you're having trouble and don't want to frustrate you more or distract you.

I want to tell you how perfect you are to me. Your gorgeous hair, your stunning eyes, the cute little line in your nose, your terrific lips.... and that's not even an eighth of the wonderful things that I love about you. That's only a fraction of your outer beauty.
I can't even begin to tell you about your inner beauty. Partly because you've heard it all before, partly because I cannot put it into words. Your personality, your sense of humour, your intelligence, your passion, your unconditional support. I am so crazy lucky to have you in my life, and even luckier to be able to call you mine.

I am so in love with you. I don't ever want you to think that I'm not. I don't ever want you to think that I'm sick of you, no longer attracted to you, et al. I don't ever want you to worry about ""fucking this up"", because you'd have to do a hell of a lot (and you haven't done anything yet to make me consider it.)

I love seeing my ankh around your neck. I gave it to you because I want you to carry a part of me with you everywhere you go. I'm sorry if that freaks you out.

I can't wait to fall asleep by you every single night, and wake up to your stellar smile every single morning. I can't wait to leave with you every summer. I can't wait to call you my fiancee, and then my wife.

You're my best friend. You always will be. I am honoured to be able to call you anything more than that. You brighten my life more than anything.

I can't wait to hug and squeeze you and see that gorgeous smile again when you're done with that silly time-consuming final.

I love you.

Lemme esplain: my cousin recently came out to our hyper-religious and conservative family, and much to their discomfort. This was about a year ago. 

Since then, I have been desperate for any measure of support from the LGBT community.. because the non-acceptance of mine and my cousin's family is enough to make one puke. I love my cousin deeply.. we're like brother and sister.. and seeing her excommunicated from our families is pretty tough. 

But you guys rock. I love seeing the positivity of this subreddit peppered into my reddit-feed. My cousin and her gf can't really post onto facebook..

My cousin doesn't reddit often, but I shoot her and her gf links to some of the posts on /r/actuallesbians, because you peeps post some really supportive stuff. She's 100000% happier since coming out, and maybe she'll come around to saying so herself. 

So thanks. I've kinda adopted /r/actuallesbians as a place where I can celebrate love, in all it's forms.

I was very hurt by a lot of the comments I read in /r/actuallesbians. I don't mean this to be a self-centered post, as I think I am speaking for a lot of bisexual/pansexual girls.

I am currently seeking a girlfriend, and I'm on Okcupid, and I am rejected by women a lot on the basis of my sexuality. It's frustrating, because I didn't choose to be bi anymore than they chose to be gay. I've been on there for maybe a month, and sometimes I vent on /r/bisexual, but they already know all about this.

It is /r/actuallesbians which has the tendency to upset me. Today on here I read about lesbians feeling ""rage"" towards girls who can ""blend in"" and about how ""being bisexual is perfectly acceptable, but I, personally, wouldn't date them"" as though you are an exception! I would say the majority of lesbians don't want to date us. I know this subreddit caters towards women who have no romantic or sexual interest in men, but your sidebar welcomes us :(.

I don't like coming on here and reading justifications for ignoring bi women. Seriously. The fact that you don't like us is enough. If someone wrote, ""I don't date fat women. Their jiggle disgusts me and I feel rage that they haven't felt forced to control portions like I have. But there is nothing wrong with being fat...Just my preference,"" they would get soooo downvoted!

Bisexuals sometimes feel we have no safe space, no community. We're misunderstood by straights and gays. I would just like to see it not rubbed in here.",,False,,t5_2rch0,False,,,True,t3_1hgtd9,http://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1hgtd9/can_we_talk_about_lesbians_dating_bis/,

Straight married guy here.  I really like lurking around this subreddit as I love to hear your stories of acceptance, try to empathize with some of your hardships, and perhaps show some support when I can.

I wanted to share a neat story that just happened with my 7 year old.

Andrew and I were watching TV when this Expedia commercial came on....

(watch this commercial first if you haven't seen it already, then read on)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=SP1F13DA942F400D82&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;v=ThzdsnXeE28

We have never really said anything to him about same sex marriage, or gays at all.  The topic has just never come up for whatever reason.

He was wondering what the commercial was about.  So I rewound, and we watched the entire thing.

I only asked him ""tell me what you think"".

He said ""It's different"".

""What's different?""

""Two girls are getting married and kissing"".

""Yeah, it's different, but do you think that this is wrong?""

""No.""

""Has anyone ever told you about men liking men, or women liking women.  Anyone in school?  Anyone at all?""

He seemed puzzled by this.

""No no one has talked to me about this.  Is it wrong? Why would it be wrong?""

How proud I was to hear this reaction!  I made sure not to set him up for anything but a pure answer without any inkling of how I felt about this, or about how some of society feels about this.  I wanted his true reaction...the reaction of someone who has not been stigmatized at all in any negative or positive way.

We then spoke about how of course, it's not wrong.  The same that we don't treat anyone different due to skin color, religion, weight, etc. that this is also no reason to treat anyone different.

Then we had a good conversation about how proud I am with him for coming to that realization all on his own and for thinking critically about it.  We talked about how my good friend Dan likes men, but he's not allowed get married.  This made no sense at all to him.  I was actually very shocked at how abnormal he felt this was, that Dan can't get married.  I explained to him how Mom and I have health benefits, tax benefits, and other benefits because we are married, but Dan does not and cannot until we pass laws saying that men can marry men and women can marry women.  He was even more puzzled.  Much more puzzled than what I had expected, even though he has never heard anything negative or positive regarding marriage equality and gays in general.

But the word ""gay"" or ""lesbian"" never came up.  I'm confident that he still has no idea what either of these words mean, and why does it matter?  

We then talked about how as long as two people love each other, nothing else really matters.  They deserve to have the same rights as all others do.   

I can't tell you how proud this makes me, and also how it makes me realize that a pure and unaffected view of gay equality is truly one of equality.  

Growing up in the 70's and 80's, I learned that gay was wrong, and abnormal.  I grew to learn different, of course, but it's just so refreshing to hear the opinion of someone growing up in our modern times adopting a view completely independent of any outside influence, and his reaction was amazingly in favor of equality....to the point that he was even puzzled why on earth no one else would share this view.  Had I been asked the same question when I was 7, I'm not sure that I would reacted the same way, so we've come a long way!

I was nearly in tears with joy.  I'm a proud Dad!

Just wanted to share my wonderful experience with this nice group!

I just got my license this past week, and on Saturday I felt like driving to Malibu to check it out because I'd never been before. I invited my friend along and off we went.

We drove out, with no specific destination in mind. While on the road we decided to stop at a random beach and walk around. It was pretty secluded, the kind where you have to go down a jagged path and down stairs etc. There were a few people but it wasn't busy at all.

We walked and stopped to sit on a rock. And then I looked up and spotted a couple walking. I said to my friend 'aww cute, lesbians!' and then I froze.

Ellen and Portia. ELLEN AND PORTIA!!

We debated going up to them. I was too shy, so my friend did, and went up and said hello, then I came over. They were so nice and sweet! Shook our hands and they were more than happy to take some photos. We did it quickly so not to create a scene. Afterwards we sat there in disbelief. I don't think anything other than 'dude' and 'OMG' left our mouths for a good 20 minutes :P It was so random!

It went a lot better than I expected. He said that he basically knew already, but it was a relief to finally be told, and that he wasn't going to kick me out or anything, and that we'll basically just continue on as we are, but without sex.

Not only did she keep my friend (and me) company for most of the day in that hospital room, but the following day, she went back to my place while I sat with my friend, and cooked a whole bunch of meals to freeze and take to my friend's house for after she gets out of the hospital.

You might know or want to watch ""Sommersturm"" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Storm)... he also spoke the German voice for TJ from the series Recess.
There weren't too many people at the show and we stood at a little table really close to the stage.

One of the songs they played was about breaking up. I turned to my date telling her not to listen to the lyrics and kissed her, we ended up kissing during the hole song... 

Well, after the song he smiled and said ""I won't look at anyone now but I saw two people kissing during the song and that's kind of the best thing that can happen during a song like this."" He then wanted to tune his guitar and when he didn't manage first he just said ""Sorry, I am still distracted by that cute moment I just witnessed""... 

So I basically got caught kissing this beautiful girl by TJ. ;)

What kind of activities should I get her into? How often does she require exercise? I noticed she does this thing my friends call ""soccer"" should I encourage her to continue this or it's it considered bad behavior?

She appears to enjoy lego. But I'm not sure if this it's good for her teeth. I tried encouraging her to go after the dunkeroos instead, but hasn't taken too much interest in them despite having rainbow sprinkles. What else should I try feeding her?

I was an awkward teen who had no idea what to do with myself.  I had zero confidence, had no idea how to make friends, and was incredibly uncomfortable as the only twelve year old with C-cup breasts when all I wanted to do was run around like the boys and climb trees.  Seeing you, having you there, was SO IMPORTANT FOR ME.

This is part of why I try to be visible now.  All the baby queers, even if they don't identify with me explicitly (like gay boys, or femme girls) still need to see me, and people who look like me.  We are the role models.

So thank you, random woman whose name I don't remember.  Thank you for taking the ridicule all those little assholes threw your way, not knowing if you were a boy or a girl, probably calling you a dyke, probably saying you wanted to be a man (nothing wrong with that, but you know how hatefully this can be meant).  Thank you for taking it.  The few of us who needed strength later to come out got it from people like you.

We've been seeing a lot of self pics here lately along the lines of ""here's me"" or ""check out this new hat I got"". Some people have complained, esepcially since there are already more apropriate subreddits for such pictures. Such as dykesgonemild for SFW pictures of yourself. So far the policy has been to allow self pictures regardless, but to inform users to please post in a more apropriate subreddit next time. Now I've also heard from people who don't mind the self pictures. I got a few negative responses when I told people to post in DGM. I also want these people to be heard, even though I might not agree with them. 

So what do you think AL? Should we keep our current policy? Should we start deleting self picture threads? Or should we allow self pictures to be posted here without pointing them to DGM?

I'm going to make a comment in this post for every option. Please upvote which option you support (no downvotes, I won't count them). Also if you want you can post a comment under your prefered option with a motivation for your choice.

I'm going to bring this issue up with killercacti as stated in a previous post. The results of this vote are no guarentee for our final decision. But we value your input AL. Without you it would just be some moderators, not a community.

I just wanted to let you know the story behind the gifts that (Z) gave you today. Yesterday, as we were driving home from school, (Z) told me that he wanted to make something for each of you. He came up with this idea totally on his own, unprompted by me. As soon as we got home, he got started. He spent the entire afternoon working diligently on the gifts, wrapping them with care and minimal assistance from me, and creating cards to accompany them. He must have worked on this project for two hours straight, without taking breaks or losing interest, something which very rarely happens at our house! I wanted to tell you all of this because this is the very first time that (Z), as a child with Asperger's, has done something like this, and I believe it is a true testament to how much the two of you mean to him. He was so excited to show his appreciation to the two of you and make you feel happy with something that he created, and I think it was a real ""breakthrough"" for him. :)

My heart swelled and I made him a thank you card with Batman giving him a thumbs up because that's one of his more consistent obsessions. He is such a sweet kid along with the rest of my students. I love them all.

More and more frequently I've been seeing posts on this subreddit that use the word 'retarded' in a derogatory way. Tell me, how is that any different than saying 'that's so gay'? We all know what it feels like to be judged for who we are. Queer, homo, fag, dyke - when people use these terms in degrading ways, it hurts. We cannot perpetuate the hate. Using words like 'retarded' as demeaning slurs is simply unacceptable. Let's clean up our language and spread the message that everyone is beautiful, just as they are.

Think before you speak, and embrace the world around you.

Lots of love,

Well, I found out today that she is very interested in a friend from school, they both like each other, find each other attractive, but are afraid to just ask each other on a date or to go steady.  

I just wanted update those of you who were so kind and posted last time.  

On a side note, if you remember, I was concerned about my daughter's grandparents on her mothers side since they are fundamental christians.  Well, the grandfather, just pretends that she is not a lesbian, or he says ""she is just going through a phase.""  Sadly, I knew it would happen like this with them.  Her mother and I make sure that we support her no matter what.  I even offered to drive her and her ""girlfriend"" to the movies one of these weekends.

She didn't really feel very good, and has to work all day today. Being the loving partner I am, I was taking care of her and allowing her to be a little whiney (she didn't feel good, after all), handing her water, driving across town to pick up a ridiculous amount of asian food for dinner, feeding her dessert. It was all just a little silly, a little sweet, a little romantic. We were watching Glee and browsing the internet together, bantering back and forth when she said ""we should get married."" 

Now, she knows I want to marry her, so I didn't really think it was too funny if she was joking. ""Don't play,"" I said. ""I'm not!""

""No? Ok. This is for real then."" She grinned and hid her face while I was talking, as if she couldn't decide to freak out, be really excited, cry, or laugh. ""Will you marry me?"" She was trying really hard not to grin from ear to ear, as she nodded. I asked again, just because I wanted to be sure. ""Yes,"" she said. ""Yes, I'll marry you.""

I got the ring out of my dresser and held it up to her. I had secretly taken an old ring of hers and sized the new one to match. It's just a tad big still, but she hasn't taken it off since last night.

We've been together for nearly a year, and I've attached links (I think!) to Imgur with a very recent picture of she and I on one of our date nights (she's on the left, I'm on the right, facing the picture), and a picture of the ring on her hand. We're very happy. Love is love!

If you are curious about trans* issues and want some questions answered, feel free to ask our members in a respectful manner, or head over to one of the many transgender related subreddits (you can find links to plenty of them in our [FAQ](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/actuallesbians#Othersubredditslinksofinterest)).  I have no doubt in my mind that plenty of our members would be happy to educate and spread understanding and tolerance among the LGBT world.  

It is not your place to tell **anyone** they are not a real woman or a real man (or neither, or anything in between).  


Seriously guys, remember our number one rule:  ""Be respectful and civil, treat others how you'd like to be treated.""  If what you're about to type sounds like it would hurt if it was directed as you, step away from the computer.  There has been an influx of transphobic comments lately, and I don't want AL to be the kind of place that allows hate speech of any kind.

I, ahhitsme, finally made my girlfriend orgasm for the first time the other night. Why is this a big deal you ask? Well, I haven't had much experience with girls other than making out and the occasional roaming of my hands down south. I've never fully explored a woman's body until her but I still felt less of a lesbian because I was still unsure of what to do. We've been together for a couple of months now and I was never able to make her orgasm. I always stopped in the middle of what I was doing because I thought it wasn't going anywhere. But the other night was different. She spent a few days with me before school started back and I promised myself I would **not** let her leave without me making her orgasm. 





I woke her up to sex in the middle of the night and of course she obliged. I promised myself that if it took me forever to make her cum then so be it because I did not want to give up. I ripped her underwear off and went to town with just my mouth and fingers alone. Never have I ever had anyone call out my name. Never have I ever had anyone put their hands on top of my head moaning at me to not stop. And of course never have I ever made a girl cum before.... until now. 







Feeling her body shake as she was cumming is something that I have never experienced before and something I *will* definitely experience again. I felt like I was on top of a mountain.

We work in different buildings now, but we use office communicator (it's like MSN messenger) to chat during the lulls. I have ""claimed"" him as my work husband a couple of years ago. He is married with a kid on the way and we have no contact outside of work.

I have been telling him about this date that I'm going to go on and he has been very encouraging. He said not to wear heels that are too high 'cos that's what his wife did when she was dating and she kept falling down. He said that I had a beautiful smile and dimples and a wonderful personality, and to stop being self-conscious. All this advice he gave was with him thinking that I was going out with a guy, whereas I kept playing the pronoun game.

So Gregg is from Zimbabwe, where lgbt people are [actively persecuted against](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Zimbabwe). He also carries a bible around with him and quotes from it often. And he seems to have conservative politics. I didn't think about how he'd react. My conversation with him went as such (it's verbatim, copied from communicator):

Me: My brother is 25 and has never had a girlfriend.

Gregg: hmmm suspicious...

Me: he's got high standards.

Gregg: hope not gay or your bloodline's in trouble.

Me: Greggy, what if I told you

Gregg: lol

Me: and you promise not to tell anyone...
      That my date is not with a guy...

[long silence and pause for about 5 minutes, got me really worried]

Gregg: so its not a guy! It doesn't matter, love you anyway...

So yeah there's my story. The pause was because he got a call and had to take it. We chatted about my parents and whether they know and so forth.

I'm 29 years old and it took over a decade for everything to come together.  I came out to my parents at the age of 17 and they promptly shamed me right back into the closet.  I was able to be out in college but feared entering an actual relationship due to my parents negative feelings about homosexuality.  I opted for one night stands and short flings.  I fell in love my junior year and when we were still together at the end of my senior year I attempted once again to come out to my parents because I wanted them to meet the woman I was in love with.  My father basically disowned me and while it tore my mother apart she didn't stand by me either.  Confused and alone I took a job that allowed me to move out of the country, which ruined my relationship.  I moved around to different countries for work and eventually landed in San Franciso.  

While there and bored at work I would frequent a lesbian entertainment website and make small talk with gay ladies around the world.  I ended up randomly talking to a girl who lived in my homestate.  What started as jokes about the people and the area we had grown grew into us talking about everything for hours on end day after day.  With 2200 miles between us we never imagined it would move past friendship.  

I came home to visit friends from college and made a point to go meet the person I had been talking to for months.  There was an instant connection that could not be ignored.  I went back to California and after several more months and much apprehension of moving back and living close to my parents and all the painful memories I took a leap.  I found a job and an apartment and started dating the person who I now consider the love of my life (2 years together).  

I was able to reach out to my parents and after one very tearful night they opened their arms and hearts to me once again.  My father apologized for everything and held me in his arms and sang the song he used to sing to me as a child.  ""If I had to choose just one day, to last my whole life through, darling it would be when you smiled at me, that one day, that may, that summer"" (lyrics changed because I was born in may).  For the first time in over a decade I was able to bring the woman I love home to meet my parents and while it was a nervous moment for everyone involved, everything was wonderful.  

So I sit here, writing this and crying happy tears.  I'm glad I took a chance on a girl I met online and I'm glad I never gave up the hope that my parents would accept me for who I am.  It may have taken a long time but I am truely happy.

I thought ""Last year sucked for all sorts of reasons, but this year...this year I'm kickin' ass.""  Her dad passed away in November of 2011.  They were really close, and even though I didn't meet him until after he was diagnosed with cancer, he's still one of the best people I've ever known.  He even gave me his guitar before he died.  It's been too hard to play it, especially in front of my girlfriend, but keeping it out of sight and out of mind worked to my advantage.  I took the strings that were on it (the last strings that he played) and made a [kokopelli](http://imgur.com/uGzgT) out of them.  He was into southwest, Native American art and that's the tattoo she and her whole family (including her mother!) got after he died.  Okay, so that's sad as shit, but it's also a good idea!  I thought I had Christmas in the [gift] bag.

But that one-upping bitch [proposed](http://imgur.com/UiJZE) to me.  She waited until Christmas eve when all of my family was together, got down on one knee, pulled out a Gollum bobble-head that was holding a ring, and asked me to marry her.  Spoiler alert: I said yes.  Because I love her.  Then she whipped out a ring box, inside which was a ring matching the one she had just given me.  So I got to propose to her, although mine was a little more impromptu (I believe I said something like ""Do you promise to unfairly trick me into doing shit like this for the rest of our lives?""  I'm romantic and junk.).  Oh yeah, she said yes too :)  Turns out she used the diamonds from a truly hideous ring she inherited from her father's side of the family.  I can't give much of a fuck about jewelry, but dear God.  The answer would've been a magic eight ball-esque ""Try again later"" if she had asked with that ring.

I love that we're nerds, that we have matching rings, that we both used something of her father's in an effort to make the other cry for Christmas, and that we are getting GAY MARRIED, Y'ALL.

Generalizing and stereotyping are methods we use every day to protect ourselves. (Some Christians hate the gays? FEAR ALL CHRISTIANS TIL PROVEN ALLY.) So I go to school on a semi-conservative campus and I fucked up my rooming situation, so I got some random roommates, who were all sorority girls that had been living together the year before. Whenever I have to go into these new situations, I get extremely stressed out about the inevitable coming out. All I knew of my roommates were that they were all long-haired, blonde sorority girls. (I call their look the ""Sorority Army of Clones"" look.) Anywhosles, I wasn't sure of what to think of them. I kept telling myself to keep an open mind, but there was this huge fear nagging at me that they would turn out to be total bitches and make my life a living hell for being queer. 

I hadn't seen much of them til about 2 AM, and so I went and said, ""hi, can we have a roommate powwow sometime and work out roommate stuff?"" And they said, ""sure, but we're still waiting on M. She's moving in tomorrow,"" and invited me in to hang out. They were joking about flirting with the pizza delivery guys and one of them said that I'd be flirting too in no time. I figured, hey, good of a segue as any, and quickly slipped in a quiet ""I'm gay."" And, without missing a beat, they said, ""that's fine, there's a girl that delivers too."" I told them how relieved I was that they were cool with that, and they told me that they were super cool with that and that they'd set me up. (yay.) We shot the shit and ate pizza.

For realsies. But all these ""there are no women"" posts aggravate the shit out of me. For one thing, if there truly were NO available women, I wouldn't have to read so much effing whining from you dumplings. 

Really, the truth is that if you're not dating or finding acceptable people to date, look at YOURSELF. Do you like yourself? Do you like yourself so much that other people find you grody? Are you approachable? Are you leaving your effing house? Are you acting like a grade-a creeper? Are you taking care of your shit -- mind, body and spirit? Are you lazy and boring? Do you have the ovaries to ask someone out and risk rejection? Are you attractive? Are you a good friend, a reliable person, a compassionate human being?

I speak from experience here. I have never been a player, and I'm not even an eighth hot enough to be on those L Word shows. (Thank god for that, actually. Those bitches have capital-P Problems.) I have, however, dated enough women and have gained the following insight in my hoary, aged state: No one wants to date a trainwreck. We're all a little screwy, sure, but If you're waiting for a mythical femme (bc apparently that is all anyone wants now) in shining armor to ride to your effed-up rescue on her unicorn of undying devotion, you are going to be one sad, lonely lesbian.

Get a job. Get a bike. Get hobbies. Get educated. Get to a new town. Get involved. Get active. Get confidence. Pretty soon, you'll get a ladyfriend -- not your straight BFF, perhaps, but a woman who wants YOU and who wants to DO YOU because you're attractive and cool and interesting and you have your shit together. 

IF straight girls are your singular interest, then you're going to have to work doubly hard at all of this and stop visibly pining away. You want to date straight ladies -- hey, it has its charms -- you must be rock-solid in the self-esteem department. Having relationships with straight girls is also A LOT of extra work. You have to hand-hold through their feelings and confusion and whatnot, while maintaining your own awesomeness. And you must accept that the odds are like 10-1 that they'll dump you for some dashing broturd if they get bored for 30 seconds. That's what you sign up for when you date straight girls, so be prepared, my little dyke scouts. 

Anyway, I want y'all to be happy, truly I do. We all have our lows, our desperate gasps from the void. I get that. But, there are LOTS of ladies in the world, some of whom are just waiting around for someone like your very best self to tickle their fancy and to possibly tickle some other things too. Stop whining, start getting your shit together and go get 'em, raptors.

So I have been kinda majorly crushing on this girl for a little while now, and it's the first time I've ever felt anything, really, for anyone. It's so weird. But I figured I should try to make things happen.
And they are.
We've been talking a lot when we see each other, and today I thought I would pull out every ounce of courage I have and give her my number. Probably not a big deal for most people, but I have some real social anxiety.
So I'm just about to give her my number when *she gives me hers*. I didn't ask or anything. And now we've been texting for hours and asdfghjkl life is happening. I haven't said anything overly offensive yet and she thinks I'm funny and somebody pinch me.
No idea if anything will come of this, but I'm ecstatic.

Anyway, being one of the few people in my high school who doesn't own a car, I have to take the bus home everyday. Today while I was reading on my phone, a little girl who looked to be about 8 hopped into the seat with me and we had this conversation.
Girl: ""Hi. I'm Alexis. I like your phone. Also you look like a nice person and have cool hair. :)""
Me: ""Aww, thank you! :) It's nice to meet you Alexis.""
Alexis: ""Do you like boys or girls? A couple of kids at the back of the bus said that you like girls.""
Me: ""Oh, um, yeah, I DO like girls.""
Alexis: *gigantic grin* ""Cool! That's nothing to be ashamed of! But you have to be careful because a lot of people around here don't like people who love like that.""
Me: *smiling like a goof* ""Don't worry, I won't let those people get me down. And I promise to be careful. :)""

Just want to rant.",dustthebunnies,178,33,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/11ryff/i_got_called_a_faggot_at_my_soccer_game_last/,"So I play college soccer, and we had a game last night against a pretty nasty team. There was this girl in the midfield (I play center mid) who was being horribly obnoxious from the get-go. Name calling, cheap fouls, etc. Finally, about midway through the first half, I had the ball and she tackled me *hard* and sent me flying. When I got up, she came up to me and goes:

""You're so gay. I know you're gay. You're a faggot."" and then *spit on me*.

After she said that, she turned around. So I kicked her ankles out (Yeah yeah, I know. I shouldn't have resorted to violence. But fuck, I was so mad). My coach and everyone on the sidelines was pretty pissed at me for losing my head, but the ref decided not to card me (honestly, I should've been carded) since the other girl had been beating on me the whole game.

So about ten minutes later, the ball goes out for a throw-in and took forever to retrieve. This girl is standing by me and another one of my teammates. This whole time, the girl is talking all sorts of nasty shit to my teammate, and this is the conversation that follows (the nasty girl was #13 on her team):

me: Just ignore her. This girl's a bigot and a homophobe.
#13: Wow! That's pretty judgmental!
me: Uh, you called me a faggot.
#13: I did not! When did I say that?
me: 'You're so gay. I know you're gay. You're a faggot.'
#13: Well you don't have to be so judgmental. It's an expression.
me: I am gay, and you know you meant it to be offensive.
#13: I didn't mean it like that. It's just an expression.
me: Just like ""nigger"" is an expression?
#13: Yeah, just like that!

And then she ran away to some other part of the field like a fucking coward.

Then the teammate that had been talking to her before that conversation came off the field. While she was off, she told the bench everything that happened, and what that girl had said to me. Up till this point, I had only told about five people on the team about my sexuality (though honestly it's pretty obvious by looking at me) and planned on telling more as it came up in conversation. I'm a freshman, so it's my first year playing with this team.

Luckily, after the game everyone was understanding, and I didn't even get in trouble with my coach for committing such a cheap and blatant foul. An hour or so after the game I get [this text](http://imgur.com/P9BBA) from one of the seniors on the team and then [this text](http://imgur.com/kgtga) from the girl that had told the bench.

So it all worked out better than expected in a way. It's not really how I wanted to tell everyone, but at least it's out there. On the other hand, that girl's words and actions are still kind of burning with me. This is the first time I've ever experienced that kind of hatefulness from a stranger.

**TL;DR girl calls me faggot, I call her out. The whole team finds out I'm gay. Turns out fine. Still pissed about that dumb bitch from the other team, though.**

Just wanted to rant. If you have any related stories of people being homophobic fucks, feel free to post 'em!

I've been friends with my best friend (I'll call her Ash) since 6th grade. When they moved to middle-of-nowhere Southeast Mississippi, I was the first kid to walk up to her and her twin sister and introduce myself. She is a great friend, and even though we are really different from each other we've never fought. When I came out last year she was the only person, besides my dad, to stand by me through it all. Most of my other friends and family came back and apologized, or tolerate it, but she never left. That was a big deal to me. 

Anyway, this past Saturday night we went to our town Christmas parade with a bunch of other people. Ash's sister and our other friends broke off from our group pretty fast. Her boyfriend ran off with his ""Bromances"" (as she calls them) shortly after that. So we were standing on the corner of Main Street when I spotted my little cousins. 

Side-story: I have over 20 first cousins and, since I'm the second oldest, I'm very close to all of them. When I came out one of my aunts didn't want me to babysit anymore and called me to tell me this. She said even though I was the best babysitter they'd ever had, even though her 4 kids adore me and I work for next to nothing, she couldn't have me babysit until I decided that I wasn't really gay and repented. She said that she still loved me but that her kids were too impressionable and young to be exposed to the sin of homosexuality (as if I'd ever talk to 5 year olds about my sexuality). 

So I hadn't seen my cousins or aunt since June, except for a little while at Thanksgiving. I was super excited when I saw them across the road. I told Ash and we waited for a break in the floats so we could run across to say hi. While we waited she said, ""Isn't this the aunt that banned you from babysitting?"" I said, ""Yeah, why?""

No answer. But she had an odd look on her face. 

We ran across and I got four giant bear hugs from four adorable little kids. The oldest, the one I'm closest to, kept saying, ""Stay here and catch candy with me! I want to stand by you! I missed you! Why don't you come babysit me anymore?"" All while clinging to me. It kinda broke my heart. My aunt was friendly but looked a little coldly at Ash. She asked ""Who is this? Your...friend?""
 I said, ""Yep"". And Ash, oddly, put her arm around me...overly ""friendly"". 

Then she told my aunt, with a sharp look, ""Yeah, Kate means a lot to me. More than 'family' means to most people."" 

I was shocked. 

After a few minutes, we said goodbye and waited for another break to cross the road again. As we started to jog across she caught up and *held my hand*. 

In front of tons of people I know, who know my family, kids from school. It's what small town scandal dreams are made of. 

I turned so red that I could barely keep walking. She just casually led me into the Chinese restaurant, in plain sight, sat us down in front of the window, together, and ordered us two cokes. 

She's threated to do this before when people were being rude or staring st us, but never did. She'll always lean over right when I'm starting to feel upset and exposed and say, ""You know, I'm not above holding your hand. Give them a damn reason to stare, homophobic assholes.""

I almost cried. The fact that she was willing to put her reputation on the line, possibly ruin her senior year in a small gossipy southern town, all because she wanted to make a point to my aunt, to support me. 

Anyway, the rest of the night was great. 

I'm pretty lucky to have her as a best friend.

Mom: so, are you seeing anyone?  
Me: (trying not to give it away) uhhh...kinda sorta.  
Mom: that's a yes, spill!  
Me: I can't.   
Mom: is it a girl?  
Me: yes.  
Mom: that's great. When do I get to meet her? Tell me about her! Where did you meet?  




I told my mom all about her. She said she would love me no matter what and was glad I told them.  I asked her if she knew, and about the text earlier this week. She swears she didn't know and just thought she was being funny. When I asked her why she jumped straight to asking me if it was a girl she said I must forget she knows me better than anyone else in the world and could tell by the look on my face.  




Probably the cutest thing she said though was ""I'm going to have to get up to speed on everything going on with the gay marriage debate.  It didn't really matter to me a week ago but now it does!""
