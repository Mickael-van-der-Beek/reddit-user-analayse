This past week I've been playing through it again on a whim, and its the first time in a long time I've done so..

And as I've progressed through each 'Your Sanctuary' Location and read the dialogue where Ness envisions bits and pieces of himself as a child I realize that I, too, am now and doing much the same. With every note recorded to complete the final melody I too am brought back to a time long ago. And upon hearing the song on the sound stone fully I too feel united with all versions of myself.

Friend: Question... Is there a spell called PSI boobs in earthbound... Or is my Rom hacked. Because I just got it, and I highly doubt a Nintendo game would have a spell called PSI boobs...

I just want to spill my newfound love, and I know that you guys will appreciate a new lover to the series. I just recently got Earthbound on an SNES emulator (planning on buying the system and the game soon, though) because some of my favorite LPers have played this game (Chugga and NCS) and I have always used Ness as my Super Smash Brothers character. Mastered Ness at that game and the whole mood that he gave off in that game just made me fall in love with him.
Anyways, I just now got to Threed and... Wow. This game just completely fits up my alley. All of the humor and the extreme Americanization of the RPG genre is amazing, not to mention the fact that I constantly want to explore and talk to everyone. The characters are so bright and wonderful and the music is phenomenal. It just fits like no other game I've played before, and I absolutely love it. If there's anything you guys recommend such and tips and hints to fully enjoying the game, please let me know, but if anything I just wanted to say how much I love this game and I hope that sometime soon I can be a part of this community a bit more :) thanks for bearing with my rant, and now I'm off to fight some zombies!",,False,self,t5_2rkbz,False,,,True,t3_rztmk,http://www.reddit.com/r/earthbound/comments/rztmk/a_new_adventurer_here_brand_new_to_the_series_and/,

____________________________________________________________________________



I took it as an examination and dismantlement of Cain and Abel, put back together under Eastern principles--both metaphorically and literally: Lucas and Claus are the polarized sons of a shepherd, and the town undergoes a massive shift from a naturalistic collectivist society with no crime to total assimilation into a gradually more and more pervasive culture built on the concept of ownership, consumerism and ""more""--at the expense of the control, deformation, and perversion of the Earth. The common metaphorical interpretation of Cain and Abel is that it is an account of the advent of agriculturalism, which brought progress at the expense of the assimilation of the preexisting hunter-gatherer culture and could only be sustained by the murder/destruction of Nature and  their fellow men. The Qur'an and the Torah elaborate in-text that these actions marked ""the invention of the tradition of murder.""

Some supporting details: 

* There had never been a crime before Hinawa's murder, which was directly caused by the advent of a new culture that sustained itself at the expense of Nature, the Earth, and the gradual assimilation of the culture that preceded it. The townsfolk didn't seem to understand Hinawa's death, or know how to react--it's possible Hinawa was the first death they had experienced post-forgetting.

* The Mark of Cain was likely something those of the Kenite (Cainite) tribe shared in common--this could have been red hair, like Claus. Even though that admittedly seems like a stretch, Claus nevertheless became clearly marked by the culture that corrupted him, as the masked man.

* The Forest Sanctuary depicts two dragons in a yin-yang sort of formation; one white, one black (important for later) 


* Cain is said to be fathered by the serpent (also important for later)

* The only houses struck/destroyed by lightning are the houses of people who are shepherds/livestock farmers (Alec, Lighter, Flint), nomads (Reggie), and those who are otherwise living off the land in a self-sustainable fashion (Nippolyte, the old man at the top of the graveyard, uses land at Oshoe Castle to grow food). 

* The price the townsfolk must pay to be part of the new culture is to ""go work in the field"" by aiding in mining the Earth of its materials at the Clayman Factory, not that they had much choice.

* **One of the Mr. Saturns directly asks if you've heard of The Homestead Act**, a much-abused agricultural law that encouraged unsustainable farming practices and led to overcrowding and over-farming, until the Earth literally started to crumble away--causing the 1930s Dust Bowl and forcing a massive migration away from the affected areas.


After Yokuba/Fassad's introductory ""Don't you want to be happy??"" speech to the townspeople, Reggie's response is ""to want happiness is to destroy it""--which feels like the running Eastern sentiment (unhappiness, desire) throughout the whole game, given its subtle reprise near the end in New Pork City, where Reggie tells you that Lucas doesn't look happy.

The Dust Bowl happened because everybody wanted something more than they had, as is mirrored in Mother 3, which you appear to be fighting against for very almost the entire game. With the familiarity of the Cain/Abel, good twin/evil twin trope, Itoi sets the player up to perceive the game's events with a binary sense of morality: Lucas/other party members are Good; Porky/Pigmasks/Masked Man are Evil. This sort of morality is argued to be false at the end of the game.

Itoi changed the ending of the game at the last minute, because he felt the original ending was too depressing. Given everything else, and the nature of the removed (but still accessible) final boss, I believe the original ending likely made Itoi's point much more bluntly. I believe that the removed boss was fought after Lucas inadvertently killed Claus, and the game ended when the Earth opened up--the movable ""THE END?"" screen was not part of the original ending and left things totally ambiguous. 

Most people in the game wanted something, if only wanting ""more"" rather than something specific: Flint wanted his family back; Claus wanted revenge; Porky wanted his childhood; and Lucas wanted his mom. The combination of these desires (and others) created a scenario wherein Lucas was sort of forced into the role of the good, righteous half of a Good/Evil binary with Claus. But that's not what he wanted, and it didn't make him happy (according to Reggie). When Claus used Lucas to kill himself, that binary shattered. I believe the removed final boss is Lucas' psychological battle with himself after realizing that Claus was not Cain, he was just a victim. 

The text regarding Cain and Abel in the Qur'an says: ""We ordained for the nation of Israel that if anyone killed a person not in retaliation of murder, and/or to spread mischief in the land - it would be as if he slew the whole people: and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people.""

The only time Claus ever tried to set out to kill something (of his own free will) other than himself, he did it specifically in retaliation for a murder. Lucas didn't kill Claus, the events and actions that led Lucas to be in that exact position and moment killed Claus. With Porky neutralized in his impenetrable metal womb and Claus dead, Lucas never resolves his revenge and runs out of people to blame. I believe Lucas' removed final battle (the initial phase of which is against ""rope snake,"" **the serpent**) was against himself and served to showcase the self-destructive nature of always looking for someone to blame (which is an American stereotype) and the danger in constantly looking for Evil around you for the sake of fulfilling the other half of a morality schema that is incompatible with the real world--that's how brothers actually end up dead.

Lucas' removed final battle was likely a crisis of morality: Lucas did not kill Claus, but the way it happened was ambiguous enough for Lucas to seriously question his responsibility in Claus' death and what it meant if he held any blame. Lucas bears no responsibility, he is also a victim. Similar to what's said in the Qur'an text, Lucas was constantly reminded that a Good person must be the one to wake up the dragon in order to save everyone, if the dragon is awaken by an Evil person, the world will be destroyed. Lucas is handed a situation where that can't be applied. If Lucas was in some way responsible for the death of his brother, would that mean Lucas had been playing the role of Cain, the Black half of the black-and-white morality that he was forced into? No, it's ambiguous. It's a gray area, but there are no gray areas in binary morality. Lucas doesn't know which side he falls under when he pulls the final needle, and the player never knows either--because binary morality is totally incompatible with Lucas' position at the end of the game, as it is within our everyday lives. The ending is ambiguous, because there isn't one. There is no evil for Lucas to vanquish. Even though Porky is mostly to blame, he's just a really messed up kid trying to hold onto what he lost. Everyone is a victim in one way or another.

The message of the game seems to be that the concept of good vs. evil is dehumanizing, false, and promotes alienation. It's an over-simplification--life is a complicated mess of gray areas, and most of the time morality is just a matter of circumstance. 

From the wikipedia entry regarding yin-yang:

&gt;Yin and yang are not opposing forces, but complementary forces ... that interact to form a greater whole, as part of a dynamic system. Everything has both yin and yang aspects as light could not be understood if darkness didn't exist, and shadow cannot exist without light. ... There is a perception (especially in the West) that yin and yang correspond to evil and good. ... **Good/bad distinctions and other dichotomous moral judgments are perceptual and not real, yin-yang is an indivisible whole**


Sometimes a collection of desires will cause bad things happen in ways where there's either nobody or everybody to blame, and any attempts at searching for a mark of Evil amongst those foreign to you and amongst yourselves in order to appropriate your desire for retaliation will likely only harm or alienate you from your brothers. Most of the time there is no Evil to rally up against, and vengeance does not bring happiness. Happiness comes from temperance, alignment with nature, and brotherhood. The pursuit of desire will bring the opposite of these things: irrationality, greed, and alienation.


That's all I have, for now. I think there's a strong, cohesive statement I haven't figured out, in regards to American history and culture specifically: given the presence of slavery, the reference to the homestead act, and Charles Bronson--as opposed to your run-of-the-mill jab at american consumerism. 

I don't understand the significance behind Hinawa and Flint both being named after guns, or most of the other characters' names. I do know that Bateau refers to the boats used by American fur traders, which makes immediate sense given that it's a point where economy was built at the expense of nature. 

What's the deal with Negative Man and the mystery metal monkey? I'd say it was to do with overcoming negativity (or nihilism?), except the fight is completely optional and comes off as more of a mercy killing than anything that could be considered ""overcoming.""

For those unfamiliar with them, they're a rap duo that specializes in old video game music.  Probably most famous for [their epic Mega Man 2 song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6L9bUouDr8), [the Zelda II: Adventure of Link song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plQihaRQBfI), and [Final Fantasy 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc32Znoj8dk)

HOWEVER!  They also did an Earthbound EP!  And if you haven't heard it, it is *KILLER*.

Here you go:

* [Part One](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPiT5knJgdc)
* [Part Two](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K141DoYM9Ac)

* [Part Eight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZgkokDSuVE)

Part 8 is my favorite cover of Pokey Means Business.

Anyway, if I remember correctly, they had originally planned on doing a full album, but they broke up over a girl or something and never finished the project.

My parents bought it for me the year it was released and it made me a very happy youngster.. I have no need for it now. It's in fine shape with an intact label, and I'll throw a dust cover on it before shipping.

I realize I could put it up on Ebay for some dough, but I don't care about that. I'm hoping whoever I send it to actually appreciates the gift, so I want to propose this:

Write a reply in this thread about why you think I should mail it to you. I'll pay postage. Essays should be 300 words or less - I'll be checking word count. The right candidate is one who will appreciate having the original cart, and not one who might just sell it for money. I loved this game and won't forget the joy and lessons it brought me. I hope to send it to someone who is just as passionate about it as I am! I'll give it a week or so before I make my choice. And don't send me a goddamn private message begging me to pick you, that's a technical foul.

EDIT: Sorry, but I'm only shipping to folks within the US of A. And I'll get a verification photo up soon

EDIT 2: I realize this is gonna be a tough choice. I'll 'close' the thread at 11;59 pm on Friday the 1st of February. You all have been quite nice and I appreciate being surrounded by people who feel the same way I do about Earthbound! I still have to upload a verification photo, I'll try to do that tonight. Thanks for participating folks

EDIT 3: Here are two pics: http://imgur.com/a/7EOcr

EDIT 4: Thanks for all the little articles, I do enjoy reading them. It brings me back to my prime of video game playing! I just don't have time for video games anymore, and don't consider myself a collector or enthusiast. I don't think the game's monetary value is worth anything to me, but if I can bring one person a lot of surprise and joy by giving it away, I'd prefer that. It's going to be hard to choose one of you, but I'm going to do it Saturday or Sunday. Thank you all for replying

EDIT 5: I realize I should have started the thread like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SH8wDkqA_50

And I think there would have been a bit more drama to the giveaway.. but I hate drama! There's too much of it in life. Anyway, thanks to everyone who participated. I had a blast reading your articles. I made my choice and I expect my cartridge will be on its way to a happier home! Please, folks, with all the crazy people in the world today, strive to be kind to one another. Go out of your way to do something unexpected, even if its as small as randomly complimenting a stranger. Prove to others that there is more value in goodness.

Okay everybody, I'm announcing it.  On Saturday, March 30th, I will be streaming a single-sitting playthrough of Earthbound, my absolute favorite all-time RPG, from start to finish.  Not for charity or internet notoriety, but for the love of the game.  This is an endeavor I have long wished to undertake, and I'm ready to take the plunge.  I'll have the microphone on and will be discussing the game as I go, hopefully with the many fans that we have here on Reddit.

Now, for the surprise...  Upon the completion of the run, I hope I can make one lucky redditor a very happy EB fan indeed.  I wish I could say more, but for now, I must keep it vague.

And obviously, spoilers.)

**Foreshadowing Earthbound's Dark Finale (A Reflection)**

I recently started re-playing Earthbound/Mother 2 again (as I usually do every few years or so). Every time I play, I get some major revelation/epiphany on something previously I missed out on, and this time around, I really came to realize just how dark the game really is, right from the get-go.

Of course, we all know how glaringly and unmistakably dark the game is from the Sea of Eden all the way through the battle with Giygas. But on subsequent replays, I picked up on a lot of foreshadowing - the sudden change in tone and mood when you reach Stonehenge, the Pyramid, Moonside... etc. 

And on this replay, I realized that it subtly starts right from the beginning! 

**A few things immediately struck out at me:**

-When you first reach the meteorite, your dog lets out a loud, long howl (""Awoooooof!!"") and flees. Anyone who's owned a dog knows that when they react, howl and cower like that, something is **NOT RIGHT**.

-Buzz Buzz's warning is particularly ominous: ""Giygas, the universal cosmic destroyer, has sent all to the *horror of eternal darkness*."" (The same insane, swirling darkness you fight at the end. Picture the *entire universe* like that!)

-Buzz Buzz's line ""even animals are becoming violent due to Giygas' influence over the evil in their minds"" is also terrifying and unnerving to me, as an animal lover.

-I never realized just how creepy the music is as you're taking Pokey to the meteorite. It's also the same music whenever you're in a cave leading to a Your Sanctuary location; it's basically signaling to you that you're on Giygas' turf (I've read interviews with Itoi that confirm this is intentional). It's unsettling, like when you get that small, but persistent suspicion that something is off/not right.

-Pokey himself throws up some **major** red flags from the very beginning. For starters:

* He's two-faced: he first compliments Ness' mom, then snickers right in her face.

* He's spiteful: If you initially refuse to help him look for Picky, he threatens you with verbal abuse.

* He's irresponsible: Instead of owning up to losing Picky, he deflects blame to the cops.

* He's a coward: When battling spiteful crows, he uses Ness as a shield, plays dead and even apologizes to the enemies. He also immediately rules himself out as one of the 4 heroes Buzz Buzz mentioned.

* He's self-centered: Pokey has to be the first to see the meteorite, and tells Ness to basically screw off. He then pounds on Ness' door in the middle of the night and demands his help.

* This horrible personality, of course, is the primordial soup from which a truly sociopathic persona will eventually grow from.

He reminds me a lot of Eric Cartman (South Park): they're both fat, bratty, cowardly, immature and incredibly insecure, and compensate by seeking power (and lots of it). Both characters evolve from whiny little brats into conniving, evil and merciless figures. Looking back, I almost feel I should've known Pokey would end up on Giygas' right hand! Try reading Pokey's lines in Cartman's voice (or any bratty kid or bully from your childhood) and tell me if it was just as mind-blowing for you as it was for me!

-*And this is just from the opening scenes*. The darkness obviously pops up again and again as you progress in the game, but I'm really impressed with how much the beginning really sets the tone for it.

-I also found that the bright neon palette and quirky enemies didn't distract me from these subtly dark nuances. If anything, the contrast made the underlying creepiness much more unsettling and harder to ignore. It's really quite masterful on Itoi's part.

And this is why I keep playing Earthbound. There so much packed in there that I'd never pick up by only playing once or twice. And such staying power, too. 17 years after I first encountered him, and I still occasionally have nightmares about Giygas. Hollywood wishes it could create narrative this visceral and lasting.

Anyway, just one fan's theories here. What do you guys think?

**TL;DR** - Earthbound sets a dark tone from the very beginning and it persists, in some form or another, until the very end. And that is why it's awesome.

Each game is excellent and even touching (Mother 3 especially). Anyone who likes RPGs should have at least Earthbound under their belt.

1374039554.0,25,self.earthbound,1igvry,How-to: CD Quality Earthbound Soundtrack For Free,LonelyCannibal,29,4,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/earthbound/comments/1igvry/howto_cd_quality_earthbound_soundtrack_for_free/,"I notice a lot of posts getting upvoted that are just youtube versions of the music in this game, so I thought I would write this up to show you guys a better way of doing things.

Would you believe me if I told you that the entire Earthbound sountrack, in the highest possible fidelity, fits in an 895 KB file? While it seems incredible, it makes sense when you consider the Earthbound ROM itself is not much larger.

Wouldn't it be nice if you could download just the music data from Earthbound, and wouldn't it be nice if your audio player could decode it? That's the plan. The music data from SNES games are called SPC files. Here's what to do:

1. Set up SPC playback. If you use WinAmp (or a player that is compatible with WinAmp plugins), install [SNESamp](http://www.alpha-ii.com/Download/Main.html#SNESAmp). I prefer to use foobar2000; [a foobar2000 component that plays SNES music and also many other console formats can be found here](http://www.foobar2000.org/components/view/foo_gep).

2. [Get the Earthbound SPC archive](http://www.snesmusic.org/v2/profile.php?profile=set&amp;selected=783).
This will have a .rsn extension. This is nothing but a .rar file renamed for file association convenience. I prefer to open them in an archive manager and extract them, since I like my music collection to be ""one file; one song"" whenever possible.

3. Open the .spc files in the player you have configured. Enjoy much higher sound quality than that provided by compressed YouTube flash video. Also enjoy listening to the [entire EarthBound soundtrack](http://i.imgur.com/jO8ngDc.png) without waiting for a third party to upload it.

Bonus: You can also obtain soundtracks to practically every other SNES game in the same way [here](http://snesmusic.org/v2/select.php?view=sets&amp;char=A&amp;limit=0).",,False,self,t5_2rkbz,False,,,True,t3_1igvry,http://www.reddit.com/r/earthbound/comments/1igvry/howto_cd_quality_earthbound_soundtrack_for_free/,

First of all, I did move around with the word ""END?"" and talk to everyone and get the credits. Everyone says they're fine, so does that mean that big black thing rising from the island was the dragon to saaaave the world? (That's my assumption.)

Are the happy boxes TVs or what the player makes of them? I think they were the things that washed minds, along with the room with the people in the green tubes.

So, Claus died? Cause... He was in the credits? (Kidding.)

Throughout this game, I cried twice for the first time in probably 5 or 6 years. Not kidding. One at the beginning and end.

And will the fan-Mother 4 continue from Mother 3 or something or will it be like Mother 3, where it doesn't really relate to the other games?

Combine that with the limited inventory you can carry and the rather difficult battles you're forced to fight right from the get go, I am having a tough go at it. I think I've died five or six times now, but I continue to keep playing. I've tried grinding but eventually I reached a point where the enemies started running away from me instead of toward me like they did initially. I guess that's a sign that I am too strong for them and need to move on. Maybe the game will get slightly easier once I can fill out my party (or maybe not), but for right now, this game is very challenging. Still, I am loving the game.

&gt;NAGATA: Mr. Iwata. If you were in a position where you HAD to give an answer and someone asked you if a MOTHER 4 would ever be released, what would you say?
&gt;
&gt;IWATA: If someone asked me that right now?
&gt;
&gt;ITOI: Like if you were at a presentation meeting or something.
&gt;
&gt;IWATA: ……
&gt;
&gt;NAGATA: ……
&gt;
&gt;IWATA: …… I don’t believe there will be any new MOTHER games made using the same production system as before.
&gt;
&gt;NAGATA: I see.
&gt;
&gt;ITOI: Mr. Iwata’s words just now say it all.
&gt;
&gt;IWATA: Yes.
&gt;
&gt;ITOI: Well put. Like I said before, I’ve started to grow fond of people who like the MOTHER games, but to put that in a cooler way, I might say, **“The very lives you’re living now are MOTHER 4.""** I really feel that way. **“Today we had lots of ridiculous thoughts, today we felt sadness, today we laughed a lot.”** That’s what I had set out to do within the world of those games.
&gt;
&gt;How’s that? Is that enough for your article?
&gt;
&gt;NAGATA: Yes, it’s more than enough. Could you give some closing words?

Review.,bonedaddy03,29,11,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/earthbound/comments/zcdzs/just_finished_earthbound_for_the_first_time_review/,"So I just finished Earthbound last night.  Overall, the experience was pretty solid.  The best part of the game was its personality.  Whereas Final Fantasy and its kin take everything so seriously, Earthbound never lets you forget that things are just a silly game.  In particular, I really enjoyed the first time you try a cup of tea and you're taken to an LSD acid trip where the gods recount your journey thus far.  It happens twice in the game so far as I can tell, and both times were appreciated changes in the game's pacing.  Also, random changes in the gameplay and graphics were fun.  For example, toward the end of the game you fall into a dinosaur world and your characters are just a few pixels instead of the detailed sprites.  It was cute, served the purpose of making the dinosaurs look enormous, and was pretty funny.  In the end when you have your soul uploaded into a robot was an unexpected surprise.  The little robots were awesome and felt like an appropriate finale.

It wasn't without its fault.  First and foremost, saving the game takes entirely too long.  It was unappreciated to have to have a full blown conversation with your dad every single time you want to save the game.  Just a quick YES/NO would have been sufficient.  Also, the menu system was a pain in the ass.  Moving items around, equipping and unequipping, and personnel management was poorly handled.  You have to click on way too many sub-menus to get the correct character to hold an item, go to the separate EQUIP screen, and then make sure that the character has enough room in his inventory.  Relatedly, there needs to be more explanation of what items do before you buy them.  How am I supposed to know that DX Water refills PP? 

In all, the game holds up well.  I suspect that our children will view it akin to The Neverending Story, in that it's a fun adventure game for someone who is of that generation, but likely won't grab the imaginations of people for years to come.  Earthbound was a solid investment of my time and energy.

I'd also like to point out that I randomly happened to pick up Poo's weapon, the Sword of Kings on my first playthrough of the game.  Apparently that weapon has a 1/128 drop rate from a very rare enemy.  There are stories out there of guys who grind for days and never see the weapon.

[Download here](http://thepeanutbuttergenocide.bandcamp.com/)

I use analog samples straight from the game cartridge and run them through an MPC. There's bits of EB all throughout to name a few: 


* 
All 'house kicks' are sampled from Pokey's theme

* 
The mechanic drone behind #3 is an altered sample from Magicant
* 
 Some cymbal crashes and snares are actually altered from PSI Freeze
* 
The end of track #5 is loosely based on the boss battle theme. 
* Track 12 is inspired by the Sea of Eden/Dark side of Magicant
* 
The synth melody in #2 is detuned samples of the Skyrunner noise

I really hope you guys dig it. I realize it sounds quite far off from what you hear in the game so you probably wouldn't notice unless you knew beforehand. All the same, no one else knows this about the album and I just had to share with people who might appreciate the novelty :)

EDIT: Just wanted to thank everyone for the positive feedback! I'm keeping it free for a little while longer, but if you can afford the $10, I'd greatly appreciate the support. You can [order a CD copy from the official homepage here.](http://www.peanutbuttergenocide.com/store/)

This should not be a problem because I play RPGs and retro games all the time. 

Should I play Earthbound for SNES first instead of the NES version? I find myself getting confused because of how the games were localized (how ""Earthbound Zero"" is Mother and how ""Earthbound"" is Mother 2). 
I've read that Earthbound for SNES is the best game for starters, and that Earthbound Zero is more for fans who are familiar with the series.
Or should I play the translated version of the game?

Also, if I emulate Earthbound for SNES, do I have to worry about the anti-piracy features of the game? I know I could make a copy of my save file when faced against the final boss if I needed to.

Any advice would be appreciated! :)

For those of you wondering, the game I beat was actually Mother 1 (using the official prototype translation that never made it to America).

I got interested in Earthbound/Mother when I heard about Giygas in Earthbound. This put me into research mode of the game and the other 2 in the series. 2 years later last month, I was interested enough to actually start playing... starting with Mother 3. I played a bit of Mother 3, then I just stopped playing it for no reason in particular. 4 days ago, I then decided to just try out Earthbound, but was cut off from being able to play it due to me having to babysit. So I brought my shitty laptop to do something while babysitting, and so I thought, ""maybe I'll just try Mother 1 now."" So here I am, a day after starting Mother 1. I beat it like, 10 minutes ago, and I loved it.

Can't wait to get back into Earthbound and then eventually Mother 3. I just wanted to vent this out, so thanks for reading!

Quick Edit: Just another little statement. The only complaint I could really give this game are just those painful times when a few of the NPCs would give me Colds.",,False,self,t5_2rkbz,1372933969.0,,,True,t3_1hmksh,http://www.reddit.com/r/earthbound/comments/1hmksh/finally_beat_a_mother_game_for_once_in_my_life/,

So you're almost at the end of the journey. You're in a strange world, dehumanized with your best friends, searching to destroy the evil that has threatened everything you love. Everyone is counting on the four of you to save the world. Through love, hate, darkness, caverns, sludge and slime, through shyness and fire, through magic and moonlight; you have reached your destination. Up ahead perched between cliffs of endless white is the last passage you will ever take.

You and your friends enter the darkness, compelled and confused by the fleshy floors and sideways steps. You follow it further, until you approach the two truest forms of evil: the traitor and his master.

This is it. It's time to end the last chapter in this book. Destruction will bow to the victor of this battle, and all the hope that has ever been depends on you. You've gathered your closest friends and brought them here, so that together you could defeat this nightmare's nightmare: Giygas.

You face your enemies and prepare for battle. This must end, it has to end now. This formless being has tormented you and now it is your turn to deal the damage. Oh, how ready you are to deal. Ness has perfected his favorite PSI, and Paula is right behind him. Jeff has come prepared, and Poo had trained vigorously for this moment. Giygas cannot survive the power that the four of you have summoned through your journey. It is time to show him full force, bring out all the stops, and end his miserable existence.

It begins. Shouts echo against the darkness. The light of psychic powers illuminates your faces as rockets fly and brilliant stars rain down for destruction. No one could survive this. But in almost an instant, you begin to see with a rare clarity... one that only comes before death. With a flash, the power that you've learned and relied on comes rushing back towards you. A vibrant shield bursts around evil and bellows as it returns that which you have sent. One by one, you see your own attacks striking the friends you've grown to love, your powers washed furiously against whats left of their existence. In the shadow of the end of all things, when hope lied solely on your shoulders, you watched helplessly as your friends died in front of you. You watched for that short eternity, up until your life rolled ceaselessly beneath you, and your face met the ground where your friends did before.

However, Earthbound is the only game that everyone rants about that I haven't played. I have seen so many reviews and retrospectives on the series that I have recently become stoked about playing it. But with all the other games on my plate I haven't gotten around to it. So I need some convincing + advice. I have this game for GBA in Japanese. I have played Mother/Earthbound zero for a few hours and just couldn't get into it. 

1.Do I need to play through Mother/Earthbound Zero 1 before Mother 2/Earthbound? Since I own a copy I don't plan on buying a new one, but I am not against playing it on the PC through emulator.  

2. How long is this going to take to romp through? Should I look at guides through things like Starmen.net ect?

3. Is there something wrong with the GBA ports? 

4. Though most people wont be able to answer this, should I play the game in Japanese? I think my Japanese is up to par, but I admit sometimes it is frustrating to play a game in Japanese especially if it is older (and doesn't use enough Kanji). Is the dialog fast? Or will it be more of a pain? I prefer to play games in Japanese when I can just for study ect. But I want to experience this game.

Thanks in advance guys. I really want to join in the furious fandom that is Earthbound! I feel that I am missing out.

But the one thing I do know is that /r/earthbound is an amazing community, so I wanted to share something with you.

A few months ago I had an idea. I thought ""What if the story of Earthbound (Mother 2) could be deeper?"" I mean, I love what there is already, but it's left us with so much room for more. It's because of this we see such great fan art, or music covers so consistently. So I've decided to do my own cover, in novel form.

This isn't as easy as it sounds. In fact, it doesn't even sound easy. When you have such an appreciation for something, you want to make sure not to mess it up for yourself or the fans. Every single word and detail matter, and when it comes together it has to meet everyone's idea of how things would have been. I'm rambling now, but what I'm trying to say is that I need your help!

I've written the first chapter, Rude Awakening (the titles come from the soundtrack). I used the opinions of a few other EB fans to make sure it was consistent. It's very difficult to reenact this game without just transcribing it. I want to add story and relations... I want to make the characters come alive, and I want to do it right.

Please help... There are things to be considered when writing, such as:

* Should Ness talk? If so, how much?    
* How much of the original character dialogue should be retained?    
* What parts are most important, and what parts can be skipped? (this is crucial to the development of the story: picking out what parts should make the biggest impact)    
* How do *you* envision certain characters?    
* How funny should the story be?    
* What do you want most out of an EB book?

The list goes on forever, and I'm asking everyone here to be a part of this. It's for you anyway, so I just want to make sure it's done right.

I have a sample here via Google Docs for the first chapter. If you'd like another way to read, just ask.

I need to share this with people who will understand. Also this **JUST** happened.

I just spent about two hours grinding for a Sword of Kings. It was the worst luck I have ever had while doing it. I finally got one, and I was overjoyed and relieved. All of my hard work had paid off, and now Poo was doing 200 damage per hit! Eager to reach the Starman Deluxe, I skipped over the exit mouse room and gave up an opportunity to save my game at Dr. Andonut's lab. While in the flashing room, I ran from a battle with an octobot and nuclear robot ('cause it's just a pain) and guess what happened?

Yup. My emulator crashed. I wasn't even mad at first, I just stared: disbelieving, crushed. 5 seconds later, RAAAAAAGGGGEEEEEE!!!!!!

From now on I'm saving my game immediately after getting the SoK.

**TL;DR** spent two hours grinding for the SoK only to have my emulator crash.

Where: www.twitch.tv/bwtadpole

Okay /r/Earthbound, we need to have a talk...  Since my last full-game playthrough, I found my EB cartridge.  And much to my chagrin, [my April Fools Day post](http://www.reddit.com/r/earthbound/comments/1bf2k2/nintendo_mother_2_us_rerelease_on_vc3ds_a_work_in/) ended up coming true, and Earthbound was announced for release on Virtual Console.  I hooked up my old SNES (not before dropping the console onto its corner on concrete, with more than a few expletives being yelled) and tested out the cartridge to make sure it still works and held a save.  While playing through the first few minutes of the game, SNES controller in hand, sitting on the floor, and watching the graphics on an old tube TV, I couldn't help but to feel a little nostalgic of playing this wonderful game.  It almost felt like I had booted it up for the first time.  

And there's no reason why anyone who loves this game shouldn't be able to experience that.

So here's the deal...  **If you'd like to participate in the giveaway, please post a two-digit number in your comment, anything from 00-99.**  On 5/4/13, I will be doing another single-sitting, full-game playthrough of Earthbound on the Twitch channel listed above.  At the end of the game, right before I fight Giygas, I'm going to add up the total experience gained by all of my party members.  Whichever number comes closest to the last two digits of the total experience gained will be the winner and will receive a copy of Earthbound free of charge, just give me your address and it's shipped.

**I respectfully ask that if you already own the game, or if you don't plan on playing the game should you win (e.g. if you want to sell it), please do not participate in the giveaway.  I am looking to spread the joy of playing this game in its original form, not to enrich somebody.  But by all means, do feel free to enjoy the live stream! :D**

I just really wanted to show the EarthBound community my appreciation. A few years back (More than a few now, I guess more like 5 or 6) I was going through a rough patch in life in an abusive/controlling relationship with my ex-girlfriend, parents who didn’t like or appreciate me, and friends who suddenly turned abusive and decided not to be around me anymore. I was literally at a point a point of my life where everything had gone wrong and I felt as though nothing could go worse.

This community however pretty much saved me. I became friends with people quickly through Starmen.net's radiopsi, the dynastynet IRC channel, and continuum. The interaction with them was the only spot of light in an otherwise bad time. Bad times happened, and I lost my ability to come online for a long period of time and I honestly haven’t heard from anyone of them in a long time, but I'll never forget what this community has done for me.

Because of all of this, I went out and got a tattoo of the starman symbol on my chest. It’s something that means a lot to me, not necessarily because of the game (though I still do love it), but because of the friends that I made because of it way back then that helped me through such tough times.

I just wanted to thank everyone in this community, especially those of you who might remember me or who had been a part of that point in my life. Thanks everyone for making my life a little bit better.",,False,self,t5_2rkbz,1359954422.0,,,True,t3_17uja1,http://www.reddit.com/r/earthbound/comments/17uja1/i_needed_to_show_my_appreciation_for_the/,

Mother / Earthbound 0: Giegue, an alien raised by the abducted grandparents of Ninten (protagonist) is sent to destroy the Earth in an act of vengeance because George, Ninten's grandfather, stole the secrets of PSI in an attempt to escape back to Earth. Ninten learns it ain't all good in the neighborhood one day when a psychic disturbance begins taking over inanimate objects in his house and attacking him. He finds his GP's journal explaining everything and sets out to kill or stop Giegue any way possible. Along the way he makes several friends who aid him and ultimately the kids are able to convince the alien to flee using the memory of Ninten's grandmother. Sounds stupid but if you play the game a lot more is revealed about their relationship and how deep it all is.

Mother 2 / Earthbound: Its been 10 years and Giegue has been exiled from it's own people due to his weakness. In an attempt to regain its honor he builds a machine that not only makes him a thousand times more powerful (remember, the first kids couldn't do shit to him) but also shatters his sanity. Now, the new hero Ness, meets a warrior from the future who tells him just how bad things are, and tell him that he needs to recruit 2 boys and a girl, and they need to get all the melodies from sacred area. Pokey recurres throughout the game, at first as a sort of side/exposition character but becomes a big antagonist. Eventually they gangs all together and they have the melodies. When played, the melodies force Ness into his subconscious to defeat his own demons and blocks. When he awakens, Ness is shit-ton stronger. However when they travel to the past to fight the now god-like and completely incoherent Giygas (Giegue's new name, that he goes by through the entire game) and also somewhat insane Pokey, they find that they're completely outmatched. That is, until they get help from a very unexpected someone and Pokey escapes into a portal. Anyway, after they get back to their they all go home, and everything is at peace. Until Ness gets a letter from Pokey saying that he'll be back for vengeance

Mother 3: But that vengeance never comes, because Pokey learned the hard way that when you abuse time travel, time tends to find ways to block you out. (this game has the most story, so it's going to have the longest explanation, bare with me) Pokey can't return to his home time or any time for that matter. Instead he finds one little portal that he escapes into and finds an island, and all the time spent in the time vortex has rapidly aged his body.. This island turns out to not be on Earth, or any planet from his own universe at all. But one on a small rock stuck in between realities, floating in the space between spaces. But he wasn't the only one to find their way here. The Earth at some point in the future had gone to shit. There was no hope for the planet or humanity. So what was left of the world packed up and set out into the vast expanse of time and space to find a new home. They found the nowhere islands. They decided, that as a precaution, the survivors would have their memories replaced as though they had lived peacefully and happily on the island all their lives, except for one individual trusted with guarding the secret and the machine that held the memories. One day, Lucas (protagonist), his brother Claus, and Hinata, his mother, are heading back to their house through the forest.  There's so fucking much I could go into about how deep the characters are and I can go into relationships and details, but it's probably best if you played it yourself. Long story short, Hinata dies horribly, Claus dies mysteriously, and Flint, Lucas's father has a nervous breakdown and stops paying attention to Lucas. Also Pokey builds an army and starts messing with the genetics of animals. Then the story focuses on Duster for a while, a thief (less an actual thief, and more the skills taught to him by his father, skills passed down generation by generation and taught before they came to the island) who is sent to infiltrate a castle north of town (with no known explained origin) and find a relic. He meets a ""princess"" by the name of Kumatora, who helps Duster and his father find the relic. Said relic turns out to be the object used to store the memories of everyone who came to the island. They don't know what it does yet, but they know it's important and Pokey's army wants it. While trying to escape them Duster falls into a fast river and is swept away along with the relic. While still escaping, they bump into Lucas who is mourning over the loss of pretty much everyone he has ever loved. When he notices Kumatora and Wess (Duster's dad, btw) being chased, he sicks a Dinosaur on the army. More explanation on that if you play the game. 3 years later Lucas is pretty much dead inside. At some point he finds out that he's supposed to pull seven needles to awake an ancient sleeping dragon because he's gifted with a power similar to that of Ninten and Ness and only people with those power can pull the needles, but he has to hurry because Pokey's mysterious masked Henchman also has the power to pull the needles and is actively pursuing them. At this point it's a race to get more needles, because what persona the dragon takes on is influenced by the hearts of the people who pull the needles. Lucas is implied good but the masked man has no soul, so who knows what would happen if he got the majority needles. Lot's of really cool, funny, sad, happy, generally feelsy stuff happens and ultimately they end up fighting Pokey. Once they have him beat, he escapes into something called the forever-safe machine. While the gang can't ever hurt him in any way, neither can he harm them. And it's sealed forever. They hurry to the last needle. It's been implied all along, but here they go right out and say that the masked man is a cyborg made from what was left of Claus. Claus gets rid of all the other members of the group and fights Lucas one on one, however over the course of the fight the Spirit of Hinata intervenes and appeals to Claus, who starts to remember who he was before. In his anguish and shame over what he became, Claus commits suicide on the spot. Lucas then pulls the final needle. We see shots of earthquakes and land moving, and then... well, that's open for interpretation.

I remember it like it was yesterday. I was digging through youtube for the tiniest of entertainment, when I came across a video by the sticky-paddle called ""Creepy Gaming : Ep.7 // EARTHBOUND Giygas Inception"". Not only did the the title intrigued me, but the picture did as well. It was this misty red complexion warped around into a circle these videos are ""I'll probably never even play this game"". shape, and it looked to be in pain. I loved creepy stuff, so I clicked on the video. I didn't mindy spoilers, as my usual attitude towards I started watching the video, and was surprised when I saw Ness. I knew Ness from smash brothers, but not much else, so I wanted to learn more. I learned about the giygas abortion theory, and kept on reasearching this game. After hours of looking into it, I trailed off the quest for creepyness, and eventually found my self fully submerged in the Earthbound fandom. Then, I found myself on the front page of starment.net. I noticed a couple of tags at the top. ""MOTHER"", ""MOTHER 2"", ""MOTHER 3"". I had recently learned that earthbound was called ""mother 2"" in japan, so the fact that there was a sequel excited me. I clicked on the mother 3 tab, and found lucas. I totally forgot about lucas! I played as him in smash bro's, but nothing more. I did my research on the game, and even asked my friends about it. Only one knew of the games, and assuming that I had already beaten them, spoiled the ending of Mother 3 for me. I didn't mind, as a matter of fact, it made the game all the more special for me. I can't explain why, but it just did. Since then I've beaten Earthbound two times, and Mother 3 two times, and working on beating mato's mother 1+2 translation. The mother series has changed my view on the world and made me appreciate what I have more.

That's my story. Whats your earthbound/mother story?",,False,self,t5_2rkbz,False,,,True,t3_1ir5ze,http://www.reddit.com/r/earthbound/comments/1ir5ze/my_earthbound_story/,

In Mother 1&amp;2 though, these just seem to come from nowhere. Why should Giegue care about people after figuring out if they have psi? He's going to take them out anyways... Then it hit me:

In Mother One, he takes parents. A source of affection and love, and he leaves the children to fend for themselves. In separating himself from Maria in the first game, he's forced himself to hate love, to not understand emotion. So what are the tubes for? The opposite of what pokey uses them for:He's trying to instill in people a loveless nature. It's probably the same reason for the Mani Mani Statue and what happened to Pokey.

Fun aside: 

And you as probably know, Earthbound has a long history of copyright troubles in its music. The arppegiated passage throughout--and especially at the end of the battle theme--is very close in resemblance to [Saint-Saen's 2nd Piano concerto.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlBYLebMTdQ&amp;t=1m30s) Granted, it's very much in public domain.

 (If you want to get technical, and have some music background, in EB64 has major-sevenths in the arpeggios going flat-VI, flat-VII, I, which are straight-up rock progressions.... While Saint-Saen has a long V4-3 sus for the whole arpeggio, which is about as 1860's as you can get.)

I was not prepared for the roller coaster of emotion. Now I only cried for 1 game in my whole life as a gamer and that was Kingdom Hearts 358/2 days. Tonight this game makes it 2. How do they (Game makers) do it? To fill so much laughter in a game and then give you a kick in your manhood and be completely OK with it. The final confrontation with Lucas and Claus made me sad yet happy. Also his sacrifice/Suicide he made to be with Hinawa as well as to be happy really had me going. How that mood was changed was with the ending. It had me frightened. Never has a game made me terrified except this one. What am I suppose to make of it. The world is destroyed, everyone physically is killed and apparently the people are OK with it. Its terrifying that during the end screen that you talk to everybody yet they seem OK. I know that they're going to be fine because, if I got this right, a new world should be made according to Lucas's wishes. But at the moment there is absolutely nothing. Porky also creeped me out a little because of his psychopathic ideals and certain things he said.

Now then I have a few questions:

So Fassad was the last sister of the Magsphyies right?

What made Porky think that the dark dragon was going to listen to him?

The egg seemed unimportant at last minute can someone tell me why it is?

Among them were some real gems, at least to me: *Secret of Mana*, *Wing Commander*, all my old consoles, etc. Worst of all, I let my copy of *EarthBound* go. The store gave me $200 for the four or five consoles and 40 or 50 games.

When I found out a few years later what it was really worth (I didn't even bother to look it up because I bought it for $5 in a clearance bin back in 1998, so I figured it was ultra-common), I was sick. Not only had I sold off my favorite game, I let it go in a lump sale for very cheap (by comparison to its actual worth).

Fast forward to this afternoon: I found a local individual who's selling his copy of Earthbound, cartridge only, for $80.  This is a great deal but it makes me VERY nervous due to all the talk about fakes bouncing around. Is there a good way of telling whether it's authentic or not without cracking the case open?

TL;DR: I'm worried that the copy of EarthBound I'm picking up tomorrow is a fake - short of opening the casing, is there a way to tell?

Thanks for the advice, everybody, but the guy changed his mind about an hour before he sold it to me, so I am once again without EB.

The happy boxes are a way to try to achieve happiness that ironically doesn't provide genuine happiness. 


[Happy Boxes video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-T_4w66vXxM)


After seeing a documentary about the government's usage of psychoanalysis to control society, called the Century of the Self, and seeing this quote by Arthur Miller, I was reminded of the Happy Boxes.


&gt;My argument with so much of psychoanalysis, is the preconception that suffering is a mistake, or a sign of weakness, or a sign even of illness, when in fact, possibly the greatest truths we know have come out of people's suffering; that the problem is not to undo suffering or to wipe it off the face of the earth but to make it inform our lives, instead of trying to cure ourselves of it constantly and avoid it, and avoid anything but that lobotomized sense of what they call ""happiness."" There's too much of an attempt, it seems to me, to think in terms of controlling man, rather than freeing him. Of defining him rather than letting him go. It's part of the whole ideology of this age, which is power-mad.


What do you think about the happy boxes?


edit: This is what the writer Shigesato Itoi had to say about the happy boxes [(source)](http://mother3.starmen.net.s3.amazonaws.com/interviews/m3int_03.html).

- Moving on to the story, I'd like to talk about the tagline ""Strange, Funny, and Heartrending"". I would say Fassad's Happy Boxes in Chapter 3 count as ""strange"".

Itoi   Well, everyone seems to have just decided they're televisions.

- Yeah. (laughs)

Itoi   Well DON'T! (laughs)

- But they do have antennas, and, well, they really do look like TV sets.

Itoi   Yes, during development I wondered if they did look too much like TVs and had them fixed countless times.
But the boxes aren't even displaying anything.

- And they're not computers either, I suppose?

Itoi   Computers? I don't know. I really have no idea. They're just ""Happy Boxes"". So, really, they could even be fish tanks. (laughs)

Giygas is strong as shit, can wipe out your entire party with one move, he doesn't want to, but he has to. Let's say that for now.


If you follow the timeline from Mother 1, Giegue/Giygas was defeated by emotion. Hearing that song that Ninten and the others played from when George and Maria raised him. Could it be that after that entire fight, and during his whole regeneration, that he was having some second thoughts about world domination and all that? But, those second thoughts were wiped away by an outside force, Pokey. So, if Pokey didn't do what he did, Giygas/Giegue would end up being a good guy. You just happened to fight him just when Pokey was getting into his head. You know the Devil's Machine? Maybe that's what's influencing Giygas to keep evil. I don't know if Pokey created it, or is just the machine to power his regeneration. I don't think that's ever clarified. If it was around before Pokey, then Pokey might've made some tweaks or something to give him evil thoughts. I mean, he was around Giygas for a long time. That would explain the whole alien invasion from Buzz Buzz's time. Pokey got around to him, and he kept evil. If it wasn't for Pokey, Giygas would've been good.

I loved the thread about the trillionage using diamonize and stuff like that. So I decided I'd just make my own thread to start some discussion while trying to waste time at work.

What is everyone's favorite segment of the game?
Least Favorite?

My favorite segment is Peaceful Rest Valley, that part between Twoson and Happy Happy Village. I feel like up to that point, everything you fight and everything you do seems pretty tame and standard. Its really when the game picks up the pace every play through for me. Up to then you're fighting mice, ants, mushrooms, boring people, then BAM! UFOS, ROBOTS, GIANT TREES THAT FUCKING EXPLODE. Its really the first large open world area to explore too. The Giant Step dungeon is really straight forward, and this area is massive with hidden presents and cliffs and FUCKING TREES THAT SNEAK ATTACK YOU! From here the game really starts to feel open world to me. Its awesome, every time.

Least favorite is a little more tough. When I was young, I could never beat Magicant or Moonside, but now that I know the game so well and can beat it in my sleep Ive actually come to like those parts of the game. Now, I think my least favorite part of the game is everything you do in Summers.  There are hardly any enemies there, and they are all dumb. Whenever I get to that point in the game I still pull up a guide so I can just get into that club, get some trippy cake, get my shit from the museum, and GTFO.

I am starting a project [tentatively] called ***Gaming Historia*** where I present the history of a particular aspect of the gaming media, whether it be about game series, developers and the people working there, or the consoles and technology themselves. Right now, I haven't settled on a medium to show this (comic style or history show on youtube), but either way I'm working to make it as fun and informative as possible. Basically, I'm taking what **All Your History** started and am attempting to take it to the next level.

I decided to start this with the **Mother** series due to notorious history of the series' lack of releases in the west despite its fervent fanbase and the recent announcement of Earthbound coming to the WiiU Virtual Console. Right now I am in the early research stages, gathering as many links and resources as I can, and planning out the format of the presentation.

I wish to present this as unbiased as possible, so I will omit my own personal feelings about the game. I've come here is ask what your guys' impressions and thoughts on the Mother series, from the mechanics and story to your reactions to the lack of past releases/news of VC release.

Honestly, this is a super confusing song. It has a fast tempo, and seemingly random notes. To make it worse, the time signature is 29/16 (Normal signatures are like 4/4, 3/4, 2/2, etc.). With that level of difficulty, I imagine it would be very hard for someone, like a fan, to write it all down.

At the moment, this is just going to be a practice implementation. Anything further will be done by nuking the entire EB map and rebuilding it as Mother's map.

After that, I should be able to get the music box sequence to work. I'll just have Ness start out with the Sound Stone for now.

* Game starts during daylight
* Pokey is sitting on my couch and standing at my front door BEFORE I have gone up to check out the meteorite
* Escargo Express delivers the Pencil Eraser and Hawks Eye to me. 
* A man in blue runs up to me like EE deliveryman and goes away
* A woman does the same
* The baseball bat present in sister's room is opened and empty
* When I leave sister's room, I get 3 receiver phone type calls from somebody wanting to buy as if I had left a ""For Sale"" sign out
* Pokey follows me to go see the meteorite where I meet ANOTHER Pokey
* I am stuck in my pajamas
* I come home and go back to bed, only to be awakened by Pokey - except, apparently, Pokey was having a sleepover, with me, too, because he's still following me around
* When I go outside to go find Picky, it's daylight
* When I level up to Lev 1, I get the ""Lifeup a"" power

I'd say my favorite would have to be the Wild and Wooly Shambler. For some reason the name of that enemy has stuck in my head since the first time I played EarthBound.

So i bought Earthbound with its box and guide and whatnot online and when it arrived it did not have the box insert (i thought it did, i was sad).  I was wondering if anyone here in the earthbound community would be kind enough to give me detailed dimensions of the box insert so that i could create a temporary one, until i can find someone selling the box insert.  I have been keeping an eye out for one for about 5 months now and have had no luck.
