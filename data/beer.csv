Hi Beerit,

My brewery Back Forty Beer Co. out of Gadsden,AL has applied for a 250,000 dollar grant. We need 250 votes to be considered and we currently have 61 votes. I was hoping you guys might give us a boost!

It's a little bit of a hassle but it would mean the world to us if you guys could help us get considered. To help go to the [missionsmallbusiness.com](http://www.missionsmallbusiness.com) site and click 'login &amp; support' (it's unfortunately tied to Facebook) then search for Back Forty Beer in the Business Name field.

Being a college student, binge drinking is essentially the norm. While I was a ""weekend warrior"" at first, I soon found myself drinking every day, most times to the point of blacking out. Nearly asphyxiating on vomit and alienating friends/loved ones did not show me the light...craft beer did.

When I picked up my first craft beer at the store (Young's Double Chocolate Stout), I didn't know what to expect. I got it on a whim to chase down my normal whiskey, but when I finally tried it I fell in love. You see, I hated how vodka and whiskey tasted, and used it solely to get wasted. It completely caught me off guard to find that an alcoholic drink could actually taste good and have such complex intricacies!

I swore off liquor shortly after, and have been developing a pallet for beer ever since. With beer, I don't feel the need to drink to the point of sickness. I'll have one or two tasty brews (sometimes more in moderation) for the love of beer. I go on tastings, tour breweries, and am very passionate about beer now, with dreams of someday opening up a brewery or working in the industry.

So yeah, it may sound corny and stupid, but beer picked me up out of a bad spot. I just wanted to share this with everyone. Thanks, beer!",,False,self,t5_2qhg1,False,,pint2,True,t3_14a4j6,http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/14a4j6/beer_saved_me_from_a_life_of_alcoholism/,

However, I have found a few that I enjoy and would like to find more. I read the newbie's guide to beer and well, a lot of it went over my head or gave me an idea of what makes X different from Y but didn't help me figure out if I'd like it or not. Most beers that I didn't like were too bitter and I'd like to stay away from strong bitter beers, but they don't need to be completely fruity/sweet.

I figure the best way to start is to list what I've had and what I did/didn't like.

Really didn't like:

* bud (salty) and bud light (bitter, semi-salty)

* Coors light (very very bitter)

* yuengling black and tan (heavy and bitter)

* Shock Top (pumpkin wheat? Again too bitter)

Don't care for but could drink:

* Corona (not much flavor, needs lime)

* Pacifico (tasted like 1/2 corona and 1/2 ocean water)

* Miller lite (the first beer I ""liked"" but I've found better)

Beers I enjoy:

* Guiness (creamy, kind of sweet, but I get very full after just one)

* Sam and Sam light (no complaints, good stuff, like the light more)

* Michelob amber bock (probably my favorite flavorful beer that isn't too filling, for now anyway)

* Land Shark (grabbed a 6-pack on a whim for a party over the weekend and loved it. Not a ton of flavor, but it went down smoothly and wasn't filling at all)

Well there you go, not even a dozen different beers and none of them are probably that great. So teach me, give me suggestions on what to try and what to steer clear of. I have a local store that will let me buy singles so sampling won't be an issue, also I'm located in Augusta, GA if that helps at all. I'll be on for the next few hours and will check back often so if you need to ask more questions go for it and I'll get back to you ASAP.

Thank you in advance.

Edit: Thanks for all the advice and beers to try, I now have a fairly long list that should help me in my exploration of the world of beer. To all you ladies of /r/beer I'm sorry if I offended you by leading off with ""gentlemen"".

So I took a girl I've been talking out for beers last night. Saw they had Dogfish Head Positive Contact on tap, and asked the bartender if he liked it. He said yeah and gave me a sample since he thought it wasn't for everyone. Cool. I liked it and ordered one. She got one too (sweet she likes good beer). He hands us 2 8oz glasses of it. I was fully expecting to pay $7-8 for it, no problem. Get my tab later and it was $10 each, leading to me putting on my best poker face trying not to seem like a cheap bastard. I left a good tip anyways. We had 3 more total, each $5. I was fully expecting to spend about $20-30 no problem, but $43 is too damn much for 5 beers. All I'm saying is, if you're going to charge me $10 for 8oz of beer which I can buy in a 750mL bottle for 15, I'd at least like a head's up that ""oh this is more than usual, that cool?"" probably it will be, but I hate getting that ""oh fuck"" feeling when i pick up my tab.

Someone recommended we try to do this, so lets give it a go. By necessity, this has to have a lot of rules to attempt to control the chaos. If you'd like to discuss more general aspects of the idea of a top beers list, [please do so here](http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/145bhh/hey_mods_top_rbeer_beers_list/) and not in this thread.

Rules: 

1) Anyone can add a beer of any style, but **please do so only under the correct style header**

2) If you don't see a style header yet for a style you want to enter and this post is less than 15 minutes old, please be patient and wait for me to enter it :) Otherwise, send me a personal message, **do not post a new style yourself**

3) **do not post anything at the top level, it will be removed**

4) **do not post anything but a beer name + brewery name at the second level, it will be removed**

5) Feel free to post whatever you want as a reply to a specific beer name (3rd level)

6) Please make sure to check if a beer has been posted yet before adding it

After jumping on the deal, I decided to repaint. Tearing it down for that turned into re-insulating and refinishing the entire thing. Never one to let a project be finished, I settled on swapping out the thermostat with an Arduino + temp sensor + solid state relay. It's way more computing power than I need, but it leaves room for over-engineered future projects!

As for the software interaction: A Guruplug linux server runs a python script that polls the Arduino for temperature data &amp; events once a minute. These are logged out to flat csv files (room for improvement). When the Guruplug's apache server is hit, php parses the most recent csv files and returns 3k readings, which are graphed with the HighStocks library.

Normally I don't venture in there, as I have a normal spot to buy my beer in the town next to us, but I was driving the other way and needed something for a party.

Mind you, our town has less than 400 people. And I live smack in the middle of bumfuck midwest. So the odds of them ever having decent beer is close to none anyway. So imagine my surprise when I look in one of the coolers and they have individual Founder's Breakfast Stouts on the top shelf. Seriously though, nothing but Coors, Bud Light, MGD, etc, everywhere else.

Anyway, next to the FBS (and a bunch of Bud Lite Lime), was a little handmade cardboard sign that said ""Microbrews and Craft Beers: 99 cent"". NINETY NINE GOD DAMNED CENT(S)? So I asked the kind lady if the sign was right and if the FBS was part of that deal and she said ""Yup, no one wants that crap anyway."" It should probably go without saying, but I loaded up with as much as I could get out of there in one trip and told the woman to call me if they got more.

I had never met her husband. Turns out he works for a huge distributor. I start talking to him about craft beer and giving him a hard time about pushing the major brands so hard.

A few more beers in and he tells me that when he was a driver he would go into a liquor store and if a rival distributor had taken more space than he liked he would start damaging their product and pour beer all over their cases. Also, he would give some wort of cash bonds (provided by the big brewing companies) to store owners so that they could sell their cases for less. I might have got that wrong but it was something to that effect.

Now he is a sales rep and told me he goes to bars and if they don't have room on their taps for one of his beers he will use money provided by the brewery to buy what's left of a keg (usually a keg provided by a micro), and give them a free keg of their beer provided they get to own that tap position.

He assured me that this was all common practice and encouraged.",,False,self,t5_2qhg1,False,,,True,t3_o82ws,http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/o82ws/had_a_conversation_with_a_beer_distributor_last/,

PBR holds a special place in my heart. Not because I'm a young college musician with a love of records and slouchy beanies, but because of [this man.](http://i.imgur.com/ufGGI9q.jpg)

In that picture, he's staring with delight at his new grandson. That's my grandad. Homer, as everyone called him.

Homer might not have been the best father for my mom and her siblings (he drank his fair share and wasn't very supportive) but he was a good man and a hard worker, which is more than some people. He loved to spend time working in his HUGE vegetable garden, growing some of the best fresh produce for his family and friends. He was well-loved in the community for sharing his crops and knowledge. He was also a skilled mechanic, able to fix anything from tractors to tricycles. He helped my dad get his first car together, a 1967 Corvette, and although he skipped my mom's graduation, when she came home she found he had been putting the finishing touches on her first car as well. I have fond memories of climbing the big tree in his front yard or looking with wonder at all the odds and ends strung across his workbench. He would always teach me about growing food and take me on tractor rides, showing me the joys of honest work and living off the land.

The reason I mention him with PBR is this; Pabst was Homer's beer. That's all he drank, until the day he died. No Coors, no Bud, no Labbatt. PBR. His long-time girlfriend even put one in his casket before he was buried.

Well today is Homer's birthday, and as is tradition, we're getting a case later tonight and pouring one out in memory of the old man. So if you're out with your friends on this warm Monday night in June, maybe skip the Miller and toss back a PBR for my gramps too. [To Homer.](http://skateparkoftampa.com/spot/images/tpro10pbr.jpg)

It entered me in a contest to fly to Cali and make Lagunitas Fusion 11 for the DC area and the inauguration. 

Got an e-mail 9 days before the trip saying I had won and to pack my bags. It was a hectic time and I had to rearrange a lot, but I decided if I ever won something, especially a trip to my favorite brewery, I damn well better do it. 

Overall it was an amazing experience and I think our beer turned out great. Sorry for the poor quality pics, couldn't find my camera before I left! I'd be happy to answer any questions, and tell you where you can try my beer if you're in the area. Beer speaks, people mumble! Cheers!

I am here to answer questions about Anheuser-Busch, brewing, home brewing, barley, hops, brewing science, or anything you like. My goal is to give you honest answers, correct any misinformation/misconceptions, and share opinions about both Anheuser-Busch and beer in general.

This AMA should not be considered the official word of Anheuser-Busch. It is my words and opinion only. It is not being vetted by the marketing or communications departments; instead think of this as sitting down after work and having a beer (and yes I’ll be having beer(s) as this progresses – so should you!) with a current employee who will honestly share whatever he is able to. Obviously, there may be some questions I am not able to answer because of confidentially or trade secrets, but I expect this will be rare if it even happens at all.

Also, fair warning: my understanding of the 3-tier distribution system and knowledge of how AB products are handled in the wholesaler/retail chain is fairly limited (not nonexistent, just limited). If you want to ask why distributors are portrayed as X or Y in a documentary or a news story or why beer aisles in grocery stores are set up such-and-such a way, I can’t tell you much. I’m a beer and brewing guy, not a business guy. I’ll will try and answer your questions despite that though, provided I do know the answer.

One last note before we start: this is just one guy doing this AMA. It’s not a team of AB employees (I’ve verified this with the Beerit mod Adremeaux, but the rest of you will have to take my word for it). I’m doing it because I love my job and I love beer. With that in mind, over the last couple evenings I’ve tried to brainstorm what I think you guys might ask, and I wrote myself an outline. I did this to help me answer as many questions as possible, because I hate it when I’m reading an AMA and the author only answers like 4 questions or gives 4 word answers. So if you ask a question and see a detailed answer pop up in 2 minutes and you think, “There’s no way he could have written that fast”, you’re right. I probably copy/pasted some of it from my outline of anticipated questions. You guys might surprise me and ask nothing on my outline though, so I guess we’ll see.

So, with that out of the way, let ‘em fly! It’s a pleasure to be here and I’m excited to chat with you guys.

Edit: Taking a short break at 5:50 CST to pick up my wife; be back shortly!

Edit 2: Back and reading, answering questions shortly. Having a beer!

Edit 3: 9:30 CST - Good questions Beerit! I'm off to bed, and I'll pick it up again tomorrow if there's still interest. Cheers!

Edit 4: I'm going to answer a few more this morning and then call it quits, I don't want to overlap with your next AMA.

**Edit 5: 10:15 CST April 18th. I'm closing it down now so we don't interrupt the next AMA. Thanks a lot everyone. I apologize if I didn't get to your question, I did my best! I am still trying to get that home brew recipe from my buddy; if I do I'll post it /r/Homebrewing. Cheers!**

1358433735.0,252,self.beer,16r45n,You can only drink three beers for the rest of your life.  What would they be?,sculptorbyday,355,103,1232,http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/16r45n/you_can_only_drink_three_beers_for_the_rest_of/,"I recently saw a thread here that asked what beer would we choose if we could only have one for the rest of our lives. This is a question that I have posed to my friends in the past.

When we were talking about it, my friends and I, I thought of another question-- what three beers would you choose, if you could only drink those for the rest of your life?  It changes the dynamic of the question, I think.  

Here are mine:

1. Bell's Best Brown (sweet, pleasant, good session beer.  I am a dark ale person)

2. Goose Island Bourbon County Stout (intense, complex, can be aged for different results)

3. Hop Notch IPA (need an IPA in there, this has what I like in hoppy beer)





*update: I'm really happy with the response to this question. Here are some interesting things I've noticed:

1. There are more American Adjunct Lagers than I'd expect.  I'm not talking about the people that only choose adjunct lagers-- that is expected, but not interesting.  What is interesting is that even people who obviously care a lot about their beer still choose an adjunct for session drinking.  

2. Some of the most common beers have been: Bell's Two Hearted, Old Rasputin, Yuengling, Founder's Breakfast Stout or KBS, Edmund Fitzgerald, Pliney, 60 or 90 minute IPA, Zombie Dust.  Not a definitive list.

3. Some people wonder about the rules of the question.  My assumption had been that whatever beer you choose would become readily available to you, but you would still have to pay for it.  You can interpret the question differently if you want.  The spirit of the thread is to come up with three beers that compliment and complete one another. 

4. Some people choose specific vintages.  Some people choose breakfast, lunch, and dinner beers.  Others choose summer, winter, and spring beers. Others choose strong, medium and light beers. Some people choose four beers, for some reason.",,False,self,t5_2qhg1,1358459598.0,,,True,t3_16r45n,http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/16r45n/you_can_only_drink_three_beers_for_the_rest_of/,

I spend a lot of my life writing, recording, playing and, most of all, listening to music. Thus, you can imagine that I probably have pretty specific tastes. I know what I like, and it's generally what I like to consider ""higher quality"" than what a lot of people listen to. That being said, though, I sometimes enjoy cheesy top 40 stuff. If I like listening to a song, I'm going to listen to it. 

I also like good food. I know what good food tastes like, and I love to eat it when I get a chance. But sometimes I want a grilled cheese on Wonder bread with Kraft American slices. And sometimes, I even want a fucking McDonald's burger or some Taco Bell. 

I'm the same way with beer. I'm not as knowledgeable about beer as a lot of you guys, but I think I know a lot more about beer than most Americans. I buy the good stuff when I have the money. And, living in Germany now, I absolutely *love* the fact that there's really good beer all over the place for pretty cheap. 

But that doesn't mean I talk down to people who like Bud or Coors. I don't think such beers are an abomination or a disgrace or anything like that. And, in fact (queue lynching), sometimes I honestly enjoy an ice cold, shitty, cheap beer. 

Basically, I'm saying there's a time and a place for everything. Sitting by myself reading a book, or relaxing with a few friends, or going out to get just a couple drinks at a bar? Bring on the good stuff. 

But if I'm honest with myself, I have to realize that if I'm sitting on a boat in the middle of summer, or I just want to get stinking drunk with my friends, I'd really prefer a Budweiser.

1293650882.0,219,self.beer,et899,Bad keg but amazing customer service.,Sketch3000,248,29,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/et899/bad_keg_but_amazing_customer_service/,"I own a kegerator - I have been using it for a couple years and I want to share an experience I just had. 

Monday afternoon I picked up a keg of [Marshall Brewing](http://marshallbrewing.com/index.asp) - Pub Ale.  For those that don't know, this is an Oklahoma brewery.

I let it sit overnight to get to temp and when I went to tap it, it was absurd foam - ridiculous amounts - I was able to get a reading off the foam and it was at 38.  It's a 2.5 v/v beer and I had it set to 11 PSIG, it should have been pouring clear.  Something I have never seen before was happening as well - the line above the coupler was pure foam - and I bled a cup or two to see if it would change. After continuing to pour foam, I closed the faucet and the foam didn't remain in the line - it started to work backwards, back into the keg. After a couple minutes the line was mostly empty again. 

I started perform a very rough and crude test to find Co2 equilibrium and wasn't until I hit 20 psi that liquid started to appear in the line, it seemed as though somehow it overcarbed between brewery and my kegerator. I started shaking/pulling the relief valve to try to get the foam down - sadly the keg was just too full and not enough headspace existed to make this worthwhile, I gave up.

Just now I took it back to the liquor store - the owner was a bit of a jerk about it, but eventually refunded me. I just wanted to exchange but he said he didn't have any more kegs of that beer. I get home and not 10 minutes later, Eric Marshall, the owner of Marshall Brewing called me and informed me he was making the one hour drive from Tulsa to where I live to replace my keg. I told him it wasn't necessary, but he insisted. I drove back to the liquor store - repurchased my keg and now Eric is driving to my house to swap kegs. 

Obviously, I live fairly close to the brewery, so this wouldn't be common practice for every customer - but I am blown away. Easily the greatest customer service experience I have ever had.

UPDATE:

He just left my house after dropping off the keg.  He is a smaller craft brewery so he handwrites batch numbers on the cap. When he saw the keg he proclaimed it was a really old batch number - he called the brewery and had them check the date - Feb 2, 2010. Needless to say I am more than irritated with the liquor store now.  Not only did they try to blame the foam on my lack of ability to dispense a beer (you probably pumped too much air into it, he said), but they sold me a beer they have had stocked almost a year.

AND - he gave me a bomber of El CuCuy - a black IPA.

Update #2:  For those interested in the Black IPA - 

It. was. delicious.

It's an 8.5% beer so I thought you would be able to taste the alcohol - he did an exceptional job of balancing flavors and masking the taste of the alcohol - there was a hint, but not much.

The bitterness with the hops contrasted really well with the dark malt tones - it was incredibly smooth and left a good flavor on the tongue.  For those that haven't had one - it's tastes like blending a stout with an IPA - with the highlights of both.  I don't know enough about this particular beer to go much further, but the flavor profile is exceptional.  Very nice lacing, a slightly floral/citrus aroma and an all around delicious brew.

1368482185.0,216,self.beer,1e9tmx,I own a bar. Need a recommendation.,salsberry,259,43,410,http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1e9tmx/i_own_a_bar_need_a_recommendation/,"So, I own a bar that focuses on American craft brews. We will under no circumstances carry Inbev, Miller/Coors products or their affiliated brands. Beer quality aside (which is subjective), I cut my teeth in the bar industry in Chicago, where the Big 3 runs distribution with crony capitalist tactics and I cannot in good conscience support that model of business. (I haven't personally or professionally given them a single dollar for the last 5 years and counting). 

Located in Alaska, over the past two years I have cultivated an extremely loyal customer base while becoming by far the biggest account for our little local brewery and the busiest bar in our town. 

In having done that, many people are looking for a ""Budweiser substitute"" because while it started as a ""beer snob bar"", we've basically become the town hub, bringing in all walks of beer knowledge by simply supporting independent breweries while not looking down our noses about it. 

Now, we're talking about customers here, who are always ""right"", and therefore really ""light"" pale ales don't count because they're not pilsner style lagers (yes, you can shake and pound your head with me). These are the beers that i've been able to stock, and to a fair number of customers i'm still not meeting expectations:

* Full Sail Sessions (EDIT: Lager)
* Oskar Blues Momma's Little Yellow Pils (lager)
* Full Sail Pale (ale)
* Rogue GYO Good Chit Pils (lager, but very cost prohibitive)
* ~~Fat Tire~~ New Belgium Shift Pale Lager 16 oz cans

I understand that you don't know my distribution list, but i can pull strings with one of my distributors if it's not currently carried by one of the three available. A good basic rule is that if i can get it in WA, I can *probably* find a way to get it in Alaska. 

What American independent breweries carry lagers that you guys think are the closest to the Miller/Coors/Bud water that so many people are are accustomed to? Thanks guys and gals. 

**TL;DR** Look right above at that last sentence. 

**EDIT 2** I'd like to thank everyone who has posted up a suggestion and made comments. I had no idea I'd get this many responses - I was thinking two or three new suggestions would come across my desk, but I've got a lot of options to look into and track down now. 

I really appreciate it. Ill update this thread again when I have updates, and now that I'm aware of this sub ill be around a lot more. Maybe ill implement an  ""/r/beer suggests:"" bottle list that you guys rotate out for me every month or so. Could be fun. Cheers ladies and gents!!

The schedule is looking to be as follows, all times Eastern:

* April 15th, 7pm EST: Shaun Hill, brewer and owner of Hill Farmstead

* April 16th: (pending) Strategy &amp; Acquisitions/Brand Directors for NYC's two top craft beer distributors (names withheld until we can get confirmation)

* April 17th, 4:30pm EST: AnheuserBusch-InBev, non-corporatized. Ever been curious about how to brew billions of liters of extremely consistent beer every year? Here's your chance to find out.

* April 18th: Chris Cuzme and Mary Izett, former presidents of the NYC Homebrewers Guild, head brewer at NYC's nano-brewpub [508 Gastrobrewery](http://www.508nyc.com/), and hosts of the fantastic radio show/podcast [Fuhmentaboudit!](http://www.heritageradionetwork.com/programs/87-Fuhmentaboudit-)

* April 19th, 4pm EST: Dave Engbers and Mike Stevens, founders of Founders Brewing Co

Specific times will be posted in the coming weeks.

[I know some of you without kids would prefer not to have children around at all, but I'm just talking about the perception here of a baby on the tour, not whether or not my daughter is well-behaved enough to handle it.  If we feel like she's going to be cranky, we'd just as soon not force the issue, either.]



UPDATE:

Okay, I think we've got a pretty good read on what r/Beer thinks.  In  this unscientific survey, we have 143 votes for taking the kid on the tour and 36 votes against.

Some posts were ambiguous because of the way I framed the question (Basically: ""No, I don't think it's trashy, but I don't want kids around regardless."").  And some of the jokey responses I scored for either side just depending on the sentiment.  As I said, this is unscientific.

Interpunct suggested I run this by r/parenting to see what they think.  I don't know that I'll really care what they think (you guys are my people), but I think it might be funny if I post it over there and there is a huge difference in responses.  

So, for any of you who may happen to also post over there, I'd like to ask that you not vote/comment this one time, so we can see what the general mood is in that group without us beer-folks tilting the balance.  Just for fun.

I'll post back here in a few days with results if their responses are dramatically different from ours.

And thank you to everyone who commented -even the people I got into it with.  This was fun!

It's my most expensive hobby. I try all kinds, brew my own, ect. I also work at a liquor store. A customer yesterday complained to my boss that I did not give him a ""dark bag"" to carry his beer as he was afraid the sun would ruin his Duvel on his long trip across the parking lot to his car. Ridiculous, right? Now I know UV can hurt beer but a short trip to your car won't be enough to do anything to it. 

My bone to pick is this: It's OK to be a beer snob/geek (I'm one). Don't be a dick about it. And for god-sake you don't need a bag to carry your six pack. There's a handle, use it.  

**EDIT** *The full story:*

I usually offer bags to people with bottles (like wine, whiskey, what have you) but I generally don't offer them to people with six packs. If they ask I'll put it in a bag. Enter this gentleman. I finish the transaction and say, ""Have a great day!"" He just stands there. I thought, *Oh, maybe he needs a receipt* so I printed one and hand it to him. After that he gets this look on his face like *I can't believe you* picks up his Duvel and walks straight over to my boss and says, ""Your employee did not give me a (and I quote) *very* dark bag.""

1355853289.0,182,self.beer,1527gy,Update: Took a small beercation to Vermont...thought I'd share some observations.,Foreverrrrr,234,52,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1527gy/update_took_a_small_beercation_to_vermontthought/,"Hey folks!  About two months ago, I asked you all for advice on what breweries and pubs to hit along my journeys ([original post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/12l2ea/planning_a_beercation_to_vermont_need_some_tips/)).  Figured I'd come back and report on my observations!

***The Breweries:***

**Alchemist Cannery** - Hit this up at 11:15am on a Friday morning.  Rationed 1 case per customer.  Cannery was sold out of Heady cans by 1pm for the weekend.  Thank goodness we decided to hit this place first.  Tastings are free, so indulge!  Also, Ben and Jerry's factory is literally around the corner.  Do not miss 'em!  Free ice cream!

**Hill Farmstead** - You are not lost.  You DO in fact have to travel 2+ miles down dirt roads into what seems like a barren uninhabited area in order to find HF.  When you arrive, hop immediately in line.  Be prepared to wait between 60 and 120 minutes in line to get your chance at buying/filling up on beer.  Tastings can be done while you wait in line ($5 for 4 tastes) and there's a 5 growler per customer limit.  Get here as close to noon as you can, that way your day isn't lost standing in line.  HF is also cash only, and is not cheap.  Expect anywhere from $8 to $30 a bottle depending, so BRING EXTRA MONEY.

**Switchback Brewery** - They only make two beers, but their brewery tour is the best I've ever been on.  It runs every hour on Saturdays, and is insanely worth it.  This is the best brewery tour I've ever been on, hands down.  Do not miss it.  Tastings are free and they don't skimp out on how much they'll let you try.  If you want a second tasting of the porter, simply ask (if they haven't already asked you).  Also, the brewmasters themselves do the tours, so ask anything you can imagine!

**Magic Hat** - Pretty interesting place.  They've definitely embraced their image as a funky style beer company.  Their tour was a bit disappointing as they were trying to keep ""in character"", and the tour guide was relatively behind on his information about the beermaking process.  It could also be that I went to Switchback right before coming here though.  You get 4 tastings for free, which you can do before or after the tour.  Pro tip, hang out at the end of the bar near the taps.  They have a wall of what's available to be tasted, but there's always something else not on the wall down at the end that may be left.  

**Rock Art** - This place was awesome.  $4 to have 4 tastes, and you got to keep the glass.  I went in expecting Rock Art to be the least admired, and left enjoying them the most.  Vermont apparently LOVES its Pale Ales and IPAs, so it was nice to taste something other than overpowering hops in a beer here.  Also, they sell their bombers for about $3.75 at the brewery.  Pretty awesome pricing!

***The Brewpubs and Taphouses:***

**Prohibition Pig (Waterbury)** - Hit them up for dinner on Friday evening.  The service was pretty bleh.  Our appetizer was delivered to the wrong table (and subsequently eaten, so we were given a replacement for free), our entrees took a while to show up (even though they were relatively not busy), and our drink requests had to be confirmed on more than one occasion.  Maybe we got a bad waiter, I'm not sure, but we were observing issues at other tables around us as well.  The draft list was decent, but was very heavily towards one or two styles of beer.  Was excited to see Lawson's on draft, until I realized it was 4 different IPAs from Lawson's.  Would have preferred some variety.  The food itself was pretty tasty though.  Bottle list was impressive, but a bit on the pricey side of things.  All in all, I probably won't return.

**Farmhouse Tap and Grill (Burlington)** - Hit them up Saturday morning for an 11am brunch.  Got the eggs benedict (which were mind-blowingly delicious).  The tap list was impressive AND had a great amount of variety.  The bottle list was also very impressive and more reasonable on prices.  Service was quick and flawless.  Cannot wait to go back.  Pro tip...get there BEFORE noon.  By the time we were leaving at 12:30, there was an hour wait for a table.

**Vermont Pub and Brewery (Burlington)** - We stopped here for some drinks and snacks mid-afternoon.  They do half-glasses, full glasses, and 3oz tastings for $1 per.  I highly recommend getting the full order of 6 tastings first.  Their beers were all unique and had some pretty great flavors.  Also, they do blends of several of their things.  I did the stout/forbidden fruit blend, and it was absolutely delicious.  One of my favorites of the trip.  For food, we got a cheese plate and a bowl of chili.  Neither was anything to write home for, but we were here for the beer and were not disappointed.

**American Flatbread (Burlington)** - Got here and had to wait about 35 minutes for a table (no surprise, it was dinner hour on a Saturday night).  They have Zero Gravity's beer on tap.  Decent beer (we enjoyed the Dunkel, the Brown, and the Baltic Porter), but were also disappointed at the variety (4 different IPAs and 2 other Pale Ales) and availability (3 taps and their casks were empty).  The pizza was delicious and worth the wait and was a perfect end to our Saturday.

**Three Penny Taproom (Montpelier)** - WHAT A GEM.  This place blew our minds away.  We went there for brunch on sunday.  I had the bangers and potatoes with eggs (everything was amazing) and my buddy got the blueberry pancakes (mind blowing).  We also split an order of toast (which is enough to feed a mammoth, fyi.  Seriously, its a huge order).  The food was phenomenal and easily the best we had all weekend.  The tap list was extremely impressive and bottles as well.  We also scored our favorite beers of the trip here.

***Bottle shops:***

**The Warren Store** - Stopped here first on Friday morning seeking Lawsons.  To our dismay, they had one single type of Lawsons, a Pale Ale.  We were hoping for variety, so wouldn't bother stopping to again.

**Hunger Mountain Coop**- This place had an awesome selection, but was completely out of Lawsons by the time we got there around 5pm Friday.  Found some stuff we've been out of for a while in MA.

**Beverage Warehouse** - This place was a gold mine.  Picked up a bunch of stuff we can't find in MA, along with some old Founders, an Old Stock 2009 barrel aged, and a vertical of 09-12 of Old Stock regular.  This is the #1 place to go for bottles.

***Summary and some TL;DRs:***

 - Alchemist, go first.  
 - Hill Farmstead, go second.  
 - Prohibition Pig can be skipped.  
 - Three Penny is a mandatory stop.  
 - Switchback had the best tour.
 - Vermont LOVES Pale Ales.
 - Best Food, Three Penny's brunch.
 - Best Beer (by variety and taste), Vermont Pub and Brewery.
 - Favorite Beers?  Me: The Hill Farmstead/Jackie O collaboration Saison w/ Pumpkins.  My buddy:  Lawson's Finest Maple Chocolate Stout.  Both were found only at Three Penny Taproom.",,False,self,t5_2qhg1,False,,tulip1,True,t3_1527gy,http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1527gy/update_took_a_small_beercation_to_vermontthought/,

Oregon is fortunate to have a brewing history going back 25 years or more, but there are so many other places that are just beginning to explode.

TL;DR: Drink local if you want your region to keep growing!

Some of you may remember me, I started selling handmade etched glasses about a year ago, and /r/beer was my main customer base (a couple old posts [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/hmc2t/hey_rbeer_remember_my_custom_glasses_thanks_to/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/l8ypz/custom_etched_beer_glasses_by_a_redditor_for/)).

Apparently a few of you thought I was doing something right, and in the last year I've gone from chemical etching by hand, to sandblasting, to opening a custom laser etching and marking business. It's been intense, to say the least. 

Since we picked up our laser, our offerings have expanded, but glass etching is what got us here, and remains our most popular product. We can etch damn near any type of glass, from pints to snifters, pilsners to tulips, wine glasses to tumblers. To bastardize the meme - if it fits, we zaps it. We've even begun adding nucleation marks to tulips and snifters, and the effects are pretty awesome ([here's a semi-out-of-focus video of one in action on some homebrew RIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsJXJWDaJBI)).

If you've read this far, you're probably wondering where this whole ""thanks"" part comes into play.. In appreciation for your support, I'm offering an /r/beer discount through the month of February - 10% off of all glass orders (excluding shipping costs). This isn't a coupon code, however; we are custom shop, and because custom work inherently requires communication between us and the customer, we don't utilize online checkout. All online orders are direct billed through PayPal or Google Checkout, so make sure you mention this post on /r/beer to get your discount.

Visit us at www.BlackMountainMarking.com, or follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BlackMountainMarking).

Thanks for reading, cheers!

My hat goes off to them for making good beer so accessible. Bravo. 

Same goes for Sierra Nevada. That rye pale ale they just put out is right up my alley.

AMA!,Injun,213,42,236,http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1aszd1/iama_pro_brewer_who_loves_beer_and_those_who/,"I saw that there was a lot of interest in an AMA from a pro last week and it looks like the AMA with Founders fell through. Hopefully I can help bring some interesting discussion to those who are interested.

I am the former head brewer at Santa Fe Brewing Company and currently a brewer at Brewery Ommegang. I did an AMA in /r/homebrewing a few months ago that went really well, so some of you might remember me from that. I've learned a lot since then so AMA about beer! The industry, science, technical operations, or just delicious beer. It's noon right now so I'm going to finish my coffee then crack open a Hennepin.

Also, I am not representing either of the breweries I've worked for. I'm merely a pro who lives, eats, breathes, sleeps and sweats beer.

Let's be friends on Untappd! https://untappd.com/user/Injun

I've been getting a lot of ""How do I get into the industry"" questions here and hopefully this will help:

Have a hardcore work ethic, be willing to work for free, be willing to work long hours. If the brewery isn't hiring or doesn't need you don't give up, but don't smother them. Breweries rarely want to hire ""regulars"" or even ""avid homebrewers."" You don't need to bring your homebrew to an interview. It's a nice bonus but it won't help me make a decision to hire you. If the beer is not good then I might not even hire you whether it was a good interview or not. I guess it depends on how bad the beer is!

A good way to become memorable in a brewer's mind is to geek out with them. Ask them about the science of what's going on. And DO NOT fake it. It is very obvious when someone is just trying to look good but doesn't actually know what they're talking about. Be sure to check Pro Brewer and the Brewer's Association Forum for job postings. If the posting says ""requires experience"" and you don't have experience the resume will not be looked at. Expect to be packaging for 2 years before you move up to brewing.

Keep checking your local breweries and make friends in the industry. Good luck to you!",,False,self,t5_2qhg1,1363984512.0,,trap2,True,t3_1aszd1,http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1aszd1/iama_pro_brewer_who_loves_beer_and_those_who/,

Being privileged to live in the Napa Valley of beer, I thought I'd take it upon myself to write up a little guide for those of you visiting so that you can take advantage of all our beer-centric stops and enjoy your stay.  As a beer lover this is one of my favorite times of the year because the whole city gets so geeked up about beer.  Even if you don't have tickets to GABF there are still a TON of events and special releases to make up for it. So without further ado, here it goes!

-------------------------------------

**DENVER BREWERIES**

**[Renegade Brewing Company](http://www.yelp.com/biz/renegade-brewing-company-denver)** - My favorite local brewery, it's located in the Santa Fe Arts District which is kind of a neat little neighborhood, there are a lot of art galleries nearby as well if you want to check out some local art.  They have some kick ass beers.  They are releasing a different small batch beer all throughout GABF week as well as with extended hours.  Here's the schedule:

Monday: Midnight in Bruges (Belgian Black IPA)

Tuesday: Secret Agent (Alt bier)

Wednesday: Farmer's Daughter (Farmhouse Ale)

Thursday: Black Gold (Peanut Butter Cup Stout)

Friday: Apostate (Low-gravity IPA)

Saturday: Javert (brandy barrel-aged Belgian Strong Ale)


**[Wit's End Brewing Company](http://www.yelp.com/biz/wits-end-brewing-company-denver)** - IMO, they make the city's best hefeweizen, Jean-Claude Van Blond.  Pretty small operation, in an industrial part of town, but the owner is super friendly and will take the time to shake your hand and chat for a few minutes. Again, special tappings all week long as well as extended hours.

**[River North Brewery](http://www.yelp.com/biz/river-north-brewery-denver)** - They primarily use Belgian yeasts in their brews, so if you're into that sort of thing be sure to check them out!  They are located in LoDo just a few blocks away from Coors Field so those of you staying Downtown might want to make note of this place. They are also having special small batch releases all week, check out the lineup [here](http://rivernorthbrewery.wordpress.com/2012/09/13/gabf-taproom-lineup-and-denver-beer-fest/)

**[Copper Kettle Brewing Company](http://www.yelp.com/biz/copper-kettle-brewing-company-denver)** -  A little further from downtown, but nearly everything they make is grade A solid.  Some of you may have tried New Belgium's Lips of Faith Cocoa Mole Stout, well Copper Kettle makes a Mexican Chocolate Stout (think dark chocolate with a bit of cinnamon and chili bite at the end) that I think is better.  Be sure and try it if you go here.  [Here are their GABF specials](http://www.copperkettledenver.com/GABF_week_2012.jpg)

**[Breckenridge Brewery](http://www.yelp.com/biz/breckenridge-brewery-denver)** - One of Denver's bigger breweries, they have a pretty large distribution so most people are familiar with them.  Nothing too wild here, but they make a lot of good, solid beers.  Check out the Agave Wheat. [Here's their line up for the week](https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/543354_10152148914170302_167146564_n.jpg)

**[Great Divide Brewing Company](http://www.yelp.com/biz/great-divide-brewing-company-denver)** - Located in the heart of LoDo just steps from the ballpark.  Their flagship brews are solid and they always have something interesting on tap since they just installed a 7 barrel pilot system.  Don't leave Denver without having some Yeti.

**[Bull &amp; Bush](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bull-and-bush-denver-3)** -  They recently took home 4 medals at the World Cup in San Diego, plus the food is pretty damn good.  They also offer tableside hop infusions! (order a beer, then order a hop variety, they pour your beer into a French press and bring you out a saucer of fresh hops, add as many hops as you like and then ""dry hop"" your beer yourself)

**[Del Norte Brewing Company](http://www.yelp.com/biz/del-norte-brewing-denver)** - Mexican style beers.  They just opened a new tap room.

**[Dry Dock Brewing](http://www.yelp.com/biz/dry-dock-brewing-aurora)** - Kinda far from downtown in Aurora, but they have a lot of taps and a huge tasting room. Their hefeweizen won gold at GABF last year, lots of quality brews to be found here.

**[Vine Street Pub](http://www.yelp.com/biz/vine-street-pub-denver)** -  Sister to the Mountain Sun of Boulder, they recently opened their own brewery.  FYI, CASH ONLY, so be prepared.

**[TRVE Brewing Company](http://www.yelp.com/biz/trve-brewing-co-denver-2)** -  Brand new brewery just a hop and a skip from downtown, just a few months old but demand for their brews is high. FYI, it's themed as a metal brewery, but you don't have to like the genre to enjoy the brews, they're not blasting heavy metal throughout the place at ear shattering levels.

**[Hogshead Brewery](http://www.yelp.com/biz/hogshead-brewery-denver)** - English style brews on tap and in casks.

**[Caution Brewing Co.](http://www.yelp.com/biz/caution-brewing-co-denver)** - You could probably hit this one on the way into the city from the airport, it's right off of I-70.

**[Yak and Yeti](http://www.yelp.com/biz/yak-and-yeti-arvada-2)** - This is actually a Indian/Nepalese restaurant, but they also make their own beer.

**[Golden City Brewery](http://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-city-brewery-golden)** - Located in Golden, their tap room is crazy tiny, but they have a large backyard patio with great views of the mountains. Second Largest Brewery in Golden, CO! :D

**[Wynkoop Brewing Company](http://www.yelp.com/biz/wynkoop-brewing-company-denver)** - Denver's first craft brewery, it was founded by our governor! Conveniently located downtown, plus they have a full kitchen unlike most of these other places.

**[Strange Brewing Company](http://www.yelp.com/biz/strange-brewing-company-denver)** - In a quirky spot under the interstate, but they always have something creative on tap or firkin.

**[Prost Brewing](http://www.yelp.com/biz/prost-brewery-denver)** - Another relatively new brewery to the Denver area, but these guys know exactly what they're doing.  The owner, Bill Eye, comes from Dry Dock where he was the head brewer.  Bill is very talented at his craft and is producing a lot of old world style beers.  You're not going to find a lot of quirky, experimental beers here.  What you will find are a lot of German beers that are true to their styles and executed perfectly.  Fun fact about Prost: its brewhouse is a seventy-barrel system that the owners acquired earlier this year from a brewery that was closing in the famous beer-making region of Bamberg, Germany. The gorgeous copper system was disassembled and sent by ship to the States, where it was reassembled in Denver.

**[Crooked Stave](http://www.crookedstave.com/)** - Chad Yakobson, owner of the Crooked Stave Artisan Beer Project, really knows what the hell he's doing when it comes to sour and barrel aged beers.  He up and moved his small operation from Ft. Collins to the River North neighborhood here in Denver and he's got all the legal matters sorted out with the city so they're back to pouring beers at the tap room.  Check out his website where he lists his special tappings for GABF week.

**[Black Shirt Brewing](http://www.blackshirtbrewingco.com/)** - AKA The Red Ale Project, they use essentially the same grain bill from a red ale and alter either the hops or yeast (or both) to create a large variety of different beers.  Their grand opening is on Saturday, Oct. 13th, so those of you staying over the weekend please check them out.  They are located in RiNo so you could hit River North and Crooked Stave all on the same trip.

-------------------------------------

If you have the time to venture outside the city, check out the following:

**Boulder**

**[Avery](http://www.yelp.com/biz/avery-brewing-boulder)** - most of you probably already know of them.  Their taproom is kinda hard to find in East Boulder, but they have a plethora of taps and always have something special and unique to serve.  [Here's their schedule](https://www.facebook.com/events/418492844878069/).  Their taproom is always packed no matter the day, so just keep this in mind if you decide to visit.  Their beers ARE worth the wait, however.

**[Boulder Beer](http://www.yelp.com/biz/boulder-beer-brewery-boulder)** - Colorado's oldest craft brewery, they have a large space with a full kitchen.

**[Upslope](http://www.yelp.com/biz/upslope-brewing-company-boulder)** - Their pumpkin beer (which is exceptional) will be on tap during the week as well as some other limited release batches.

**[Asher](http://www.yelp.com/biz/asher-brewing-company-boulder)** - True to the spirit of Boulder, all of their beers are brewed using organic ingredients.

**[Mountain Sun/Southern Sun](http://www.yelp.com/biz/mountain-sun-pub-and-brewery-boulder)** - Great beer, good food, and a hippie/Greatful Dead vibe.

**[Twisted Pine](http://www.yelp.com/biz/twisted-pine-brewing-company-boulder)**

-------------------------------------

**Longmont**

**[Left Hand](http://www.yelp.com/biz/left-hand-brewing-company-longmont)** - If you come to the Denver area the one of the things you absolutely have to search out is Left Hand's Nitro Milk Stout.  Seriously, this is the stuff dreams are made of. [Here's their schedule for the week](https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/541080_10151391665895116_2134129281_n.jpg)

**[Oskar Blues](https://www.facebook.com/OskarBluesCANS?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts)** - The original brewery is actually located in Lyons, but they have two locations in Longmont.  Homemade Liquids &amp; Solids is their brewpub/restaurant, while The Tasty Weasel is their production/tap room location.  They have a ton of events going on both in Longmont and all around Denver.  Check out their facebook page for details.

----------------

**Fort Collins** - New Belgium, Odell, Funkwerks, Pateros Creek, Equinox, Fort Collins Brewery, Grimm Brothers (Loveland), The Mayor of Old Town (really cool tap house with tons of selection)

------------------------

Also, there are plenty beer centric bars in the area:

**Bars &amp; Tap Halls**

**[The Cheeky Monk](http://www.yelp.com/biz/cheeky-monk-denver)** -  Lots of Belgian imports on tap plus a few hard to find American craft beers.  They have two locations, one on Colfax near downtown and one in Westmister.

**[Rackhouse Pub](http://www.yelp.com/biz/rackhouse-pub-denver)** - They are attached to Stranahan's Distillery but have 20 taps, 19 of which are dedicated to Colorado breweries.  Plus you can try out beers from places like Elevation Brewing Co. or Crazy Mountain which are kinda far from the city.  Food is awesome as well, buffalo or lamb burger with a side of mac and cheese,ftw. (fyi, nothing here is fried, so don't let the term ""French fries"" on the menu fool you, they are actually baked potato wedges).  They are also doing beer education classes all throughout the week, Yeast 101, Hops 101, Sours 101, and Sensory Training.  [Check out the schedule, tickets are still available!](http://www.rackhousepub.com/beer-school-2012/)

**[Ale House at Amato's](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ale-house-at-amatos-denver)** - Awesome patio and tons of taps.

**[Falling Rock Tap House](http://www.yelp.com/biz/falling-rock-tap-house-denver)** - Denver's original tap house. They probably have the most selection of any place in the city.  They are right in the middle of downtown which is nice, but they place gets packed, especially during GABF.  Be prepared.

**[Freshcraft](http://www.yelp.com/biz/freshcraft-denver)** - They're trying to upseat Falling Rock as owner of the most taps, I don't think they're quite there but they are close.

**[Euclid Hall Bar &amp; Kitchen](http://www.yelp.com/biz/euclid-hall-bar-and-kitchen-denve)** - Great food, lots of selection beer wise.

**[Star Bar](http://www.yelp.com/biz/star-bar-denver)** - Has a dive-y feel, but looks can be deceiving.  They consistently have a wide and varied list of beers to choose from both on tap and in cans. [Here's their schedule for the week](http://starbardenver.com/Star_Bar_Denver/GABF_2012.html)

**[Satellite Bar](http://www.yelp.com/biz/satellite-bar-denver)** - Not too far from downtown located on Colfax on Cap Hill. They have about 6-7 taps with usually one on nitro, however their bottle and can list is huge.

**[Highland Tap &amp; Burger](http://www.yelp.com/biz/highland-tap-and-burger-denver)** - Good food, awesome burgers. Nice patio. And again, lots of beer.

**[Hops &amp; Pie](http://www.yelp.com/biz/hops-and-pie-denver)** - Pizza and beer, what else could you ask for?  

**[Dad's and Dudes Brewaria](http://www.yelp.com/biz/dad-and-dudes-breweria-aurora)** - This would actually count as a brewpub, but they also just started distributing their Dank IPA in cans.  They use their spent grains to make the dough for their pizzas.

**[Lucky Pie Pizza &amp; Taphouse](http://www.yelp.com/biz/lucky-pie-pizza-and-tap-house-denver)** - Tons of taps right in the heart of downtown.  Pizza and beer, are we starting to see a trend here?  They have a good patio to enjoy that brew.

**[Breckenridge Ballpark](http://www.yelp.com/biz/breckenridge-brewery-denver-3)** - Operated through a joint venture of Breckenridge Brewing and Wynkoop, you'll see all Breck beers on tap, but they have food and are really close to downtown and Coors Field. 

**[Pint's Pub](http://www.yelp.com/biz/pints-pub-denver)** - via /u/number34 - English style cask conditioned ales right near downtown in a pub setting. The best buffalo wings Ive ever had.  Also the largest collection of single malt whiskey outside of the UK.

--------

Phew.  I haven't even begun to scratch the surface and there are still a lot of places that I'm sure I left off this list.  There are still tons of events going on whether it's beer and food pairings, meet the brewer, tap takeovers, etc

Here are a couple more schedules with detailed descriptions on other events being hosted around town:

If you're looking for other things to check out while in town, but sure to head over to [r/Denver](http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver).  There's a FAQ there for people visiting the city with plenty of things to do and see.

I'll be in attendance at GABF during the Thursday night session and the Saturday evening session.  If any other redditors are gonna go, feel free to hit me up and we'll sling back a few!

Hopslam 2010 &amp; 2011  
Pliny (3 weeks from bottling)  


  

First of all, what a night :).  Here are some notes based on what I can remember.

Many people online seem to prefer the 2010 Abyss over the 2009 (some of the 2009s were infected overall, although I've gone through about 2 cases without a single bad one).  I preferred the 2009.  One of my buddies, also an Abyss fan, preferred the 2011.

Dark Lord is super sweet compared to all the other stouts.  It's a dessert stout!

Two beers surprised everyone:  The Dissident and Old Stock Reserve.  The Dissident is such a delicious drinkable mild sour.     I have always loved Old Stock Reserve and was glad to share it with others - probably half the people in attendance said it was their favorite of the night.  I don't think it gets the credit it deserves.

Zombie Dust and My Antonia seemed to be the other favorites of the night.

As expected, the fresher Hopslam had the sharper hop flavor.  Pliny was obviously even sharper yet.  I'd love to taste them both fresh back to back.

1340718986.0,162,self.beer,vmng2,American Budweiser vs. Czech Budweiser. What's the deal?,bemonk,214,52,122,http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/vmng2/american_budweiser_vs_czech_budweiser_whats_the/,"
What is the deal with American Budweiser (which I will refer to as ""Bud"" from here on out) and Czech Budweiser (which I’ll call “Czechvar” to keep the confusion to a minimum)? I’ll tell you. If for no other reason than that this way I have a place I can link to instead of having to find the details every time someone asks.

I’m an American living in the Czech Republic and get asked this quite a bit (I was a tour guide for a while). Sometimes people aren’t even aware that they are two different things; which is a shame, because one is barely drinkable, while the other is quite good.

I’ll start with the history. Bud is from Anheuser-Busch. When Mr. Busch married Anheuser’s daughter he joined his father’s-in-law’s brewery. At the end of the 19th century Busch went off looking for ways to improve his brewing methods, which led him to Bohemia (in Czech Republic today) There he heard of (or visited) a town called Budweis (today Česky Budejovice in Czech, „Budweis“ is the German name). A beer from Budweis was known as a Budweiser. Though several breweries brewed “Budweisers” it was in no way generic: it had to come from that town.
Busch thought that was a good name and Bud was born. This was in 1876.

Czechvar is of course from Česky Budejovice and is still going strong today. There are actually two breweries (that I know of) that still brew beer from Česky Budejovice under the name „Budweiser“ (Budvar and Bürgerbräu). One was from the same time as Anheuser-Busch’s, the other almost a century before, in 1796 (!) Czechvar is still state owned, I guess a left over from it’s Communist days when it was nationalized.

The legal and trademark distputes are morce complicated and not always as one sided as one might think. Bud was registered first, though the name was used at least a century before in a non-generic way. This argument is used to keep Czechvar selling as „Budweiser“ in most EU countries (but it’s not as simple as that). However, Bud was registered first, which keeps it going as „Budweiser“ in several countries. And Czechvar’s Budweiser logo looks an awful lot like the one Bud came up with. This didn’t matter in the Communist days, but does now. Point for Bud.

However. By EU’s standards (and mine) Bud is not Beer. It is a malt liquor. Beer does not have rice and corn as ingredients (by defenition in the EU) and Bud does (EW!!). Bud also uses gimmicks that are pretty low brow. One example: in the UK they like to see lines of bubbles in the beer (sign of quality or something) and since Bud doesn’t do that (it just kind of sits there) Anheuser-Busch sold or gave away special Bud glasses that were laser cut in the bottom of the glass so they would have those bubbles. 

Also, Bud was meant to appeal to the greatest market. Countless tastetests over the decades ensured that Bud is neither too bitter or sweet or flat or heavy or light or.. anything really. It’s just the quintessential average beer. Yuck! Czechvar ain’t nothin to write home about.. but at least it’s beer. 

There’s my 2 cents folks. There’s a wiki page about this, but it doesn’t have it all. I had a professor in College that used to be a manager for Anheuser-Busch. I’ve been to the Czech brewery several times, and the beer at the source is fantastic. I’d love to hear your comments and input. Did I miss something? (I purposefully didn’t get into the legal disputes, there are dozens of them). Both breweries recently came to an agreement to sell Czechvar in the states as „Czechvar“.. so go enjoy one!

People that are new to beer? Great. People that are looking for rare styles in a specific category? Even better. But these general beer questions should really answered with a general ""check the Newbie Guide"" on the side, and ""check for brewery distribution in your area and reference sites like ratebeer and beeradvocate to find the most recommended beers from those breweries.""

I see a ton of new breweries in the works around the NW and I'm sure it's the same in other parts of the US. 

I see a lot of home brewers going pro starting nanos and investing a lot of time and money to release a very small amount of beer to market. Other than starting to build a name to hopefully scale up production I cannot see them being a sustainable business model. 

Others have started breweries by looking around at the beer scene, deciding it looks fun and starting a brewery with little to no experience. The water is fine so jump on in!

This all hinges on quality to me. People have access to amazing quality craft beer these days and are becoming well educated and critical about the beer they consume, if you don't like it you may never give it a second chance. The new people in the market will have to prove themselves very quickly and even old guys will have to up their game to stay relevant. 

Is this reasonable or am I just a negative Nancy?

I like pretty much everything I've had from Dogfish Head but I live in Oklahoma where we cannot get any Dogfish Head products so it's only on vacations that I get too enjoy them. Also being a hop head I always get a four pack of the 90 min IPA when I can. I've been casually searching for the fabled 120 min for a year or so now, just taking a few minutes out of my vacation day to call around local places and see if anyone knows where any is.  

Anyway, this past weekend I was in Austin Texas for the FunFunFun Fest and someone suggest I try South Lamar Liquors. I called them up and sure enough they had a few bottles. When I got there I found out they had a HUGE selection of awesome rare brews from around the country. Check them out if you're in the area.  I bought 4 12oz bottles of the 120 and and one Pint 9.4 oz. bottle of the newer 75 Minute IPA (brewed with maple syrup?). So I won't be opening the 75 for awhile but I had to try the 120 once I got home.

Now I know American craft breweries have been in an IPA craze lately and some people roll their eyes at the race to create hop monsters of insanely bitter proportions. I understand that but I for one love it. I've also heard that the 120 minute is almost a novelty with its 15-20% ABV. So I really wasn't sure what to expect.

**Actual Review**

The taste comes on almost sweet and then suddenly divides and separates into the deeper rich and heavy flavor you expect from an imperial IPA. The hops come in after with a bit of what almost feels carmelish to me. The big kicker for me was once you've swallowed you realize how incredibly light the body of the beer actually was. You can also feel the burn in your stomach of that high ABV like you just had a whiskey shot. 

My final conclusion is that this is a wonderful and delicious brew that any hop head should try if he/she gets the chance.

Rules of engagement:

To be more specific, this is the only alcoholic drink you're allowed to have for the rest of your life, I just assume most everyone here would pick beer. So for clarity, you are allowed to have a lemon shandy, but no beer cocktails containing other alcoholic drinks. 

You are allowed to choose a a mixed drink, such as a black and tan, however, you must specify which beers are going in, and only those beers may be used and only in combination. This rule makes more sense for mixed drinks, but I pull the strings so I make the rules. An example: choosing Death's door vodka would allow for a vodka tonic, but never a vodka martini because that would include two types of alcohol. Another example, if you choose a boilermaker, you will be forever forced to have that shot with the beer. 

There are no limitations on rarity, and it is assumed there is an available supply of whatever you choose for the rest of your life.

edit: This is not an unlimited free supply, you would still have to pay for the beer/drink. Thanks [Baron_von_Retard](http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/qg3wk/dear_beer_geeks_if_you_could_only_drink_one_beer/c3xcdct).

Between the two of us, we had about 10 bottles.  We found a few other guys in the DC area that also had LA bottles.  After getting [another filler bottle or two](http://www.reddit.com/r/beertrade/comments/um7rc/ft_seat_at_epic_lost_abbey_tasting_iso_a_few_la/), we were up to 16 bottles.  I posted a similar thread on BA and got a message from a guy named Chris from San Diego.  He said he was friends with people at the brewery and did business in DC a few times a year.  If we could maneuver the tasting around him being in town, he could bring Veritas 004 and IP.  No brainer.

So on July 1st, we had the tasting at my house.  And this happened:

[Tasting Video, Part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GfmNZTDPjU&amp;feature=relmfu)

[Tasting Video, Part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xn6Whg6y5c&amp;feature=plcp)

The guy from San Diego actually worked as head of social media for Lost Abbey.  Tomme, Ryan (aka Chris), and Gwen (head of QC at LA) came to my house with 8 bottles and stayed for 2 1/2 or 3 hours.  We watched the UEFA final, drank a ton of amazing beer, and shot the shit.  In the end, they brought:

* Yellow Bus
* Veritas 003
* Veritas 004
* Veritas 005
* Cable Car Kriek
* Isabelle Proximus
* Cuvee de Tomme 2009 (750ml)

Tomme told some great stories, explained the blends of each Veritas beer, and talked about the intensive process of making sour beer.  No, we didn't get a shirt.  Yet.  They are in the mail, as they had no way of getting our t-shirt sizes without looking REAL suspicious ;-)

Overall, it was the craziest thing that will ever happen to me in my beer life.  As my friend Matt said in the video, this is the pinnacle of our beer ""career"", and it's all down hill from there.

About a week ago my 6yr old (couple months from 7) asked if he could try a sip of my beer, and I let him, just a sip. His first ever.  He told his mother, my ex wife, and she is flipping out over it saying it is not ok for me to give her child alcohol and is threatening to call the police and generally making my life difficult. Now I'm questioning my decision.

 My question here is: Was I wrong to allow him to try his first sip of beer at this age?

I'm fully expecting to be flamed into oblivion here but I need some other opinions and experiences from fellow parents here.

Not that it matters but the beer was Pliny the Elder. I've had a hard time finding it in my area and on that day I was lucky enough to find a couple bottles at a local market (first time I ever tried it as well)

Tldr; gave my 6yr old first sip of beer, ex-wife flipped out, was I wrong?

In person I gave him a Vuja De and some fresh Pliny. His end of the trade was some founders goodies and KBS once it released 2 weeks later.

We were in periodic contact via email before and after the KBS release He claimed shipping was delayed on his end due to some extenuating circumstances which I can understand at this point, these things happen, shoot it's happened to me. Jump forward two months and I never get a box or tracking number. I email him again and I get a run around saying it was sent and he's looking for a tracking number. Still no box and no tracking number. I end up moving across the country and give him my new address in the ridiculous hope he will finally ship on his end. He promised to ship again since he couldn't find any record of shipping the first box and then stopped communicating altogether. 

So here we are a year from the original trade and I still have no box or tracking number. I'd let it go and chalk it up to table stakes for beer trading if he wasn't so involved in his local beer culture. It's not even a big trade I feel like this person just cant be bothered to care. If the package did ship I would at least have expected a tracking number somewhere along the line but I was never given one over the course of what must have been 20+ emails. 

I know this is a boring clusterfuck of a story but your advice is appreciated. 



tl;dr: Got fucked over by fronting beer in person to a popular beer blogger. Should I give out his blog and info?

Edit: So I emailed him a recap of events as I saw them and asked him for an explanation. I told him I've given up on getting beer from him but if he convinces me this wasn't malicious I will drop it if not I will post his blog here. I don't want to ruin a reputation for what may have been a horrible chain of events. I Will follow up when I hear back. 

Edit 2: I posted a follow up thread but the short of it is he is staying anonymous and is going to make right on the trade.

1322345570.0,127,self.beer,mq827,Best Brewery Tour Ever: Lagunitas Brewery ,,143,16,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/mq827/best_brewery_tour_ever_lagunitas_brewery/,"Preface: I haven't done too many brewery tours. I did Stone's tour earlier this year and got to visit Green Flash on their 9th anniversary (unfortunately this meant no tours that day). I've done a few winery tours up in Napa/Sonoma as well.

This is not a tour on which you will learn the biochemistry of beer. But it is the most heartwarming, entertaining tour of any professional facility I've ever visited. I used to love certain Lagunitas beers but I'd never felt a kinship with the company. This tour changed everything.

On their website, there is little tour information. It tells you to call to find out about the tour. When you call, at the very end of the prerecorded message, it is mentioned that the tour is at 3 pm (no reservation information, which was a little worrying).

(*Edit: After a little more research, I found tour information under the party tab.*)

As it was 2:25 pm when I discovered this, I may have quickly eaten an edible and then booked it up to Petaluma with my mom (I am only in town for a few days).

I recognized the somewhat small sign right away from the road and turned in. We parked and then tried to find the actual brewery. It was 2:52 pm and I was a little worried about being late and missing everything (especially considering that for Stone's tours you have to reserve 2 hours ahead of time!). A parking attendant directed us to the back right corner of the lot and told us a loud, ringing bell would signify the start of the tour.

We wandered around and considered getting some beer to start but decided to wait as the tour would start soon (and as my mom is not much of a drinker). We tried to find some sort of line or more information but to no avail. We did see quite the number of people hanging out, playing card games on the tables and one game of Settlers (this was the first sign that this tour was about to be amazing).

Eventually, around 3:05 pm, the bell rang. A mass of people headed toward it, us included. There must have been 40 or so of us.

Our tour guide, Ryan, was a tall, bearded man in his late 20s/early 30s(?) dressed in plaid. He lead us up some stairs into this room which was a cross between an old time pub one may see on tv and a heavily decorated bedroom of some teenager from the 80s'. Everything in there was amazing. There were many old comfy couches to sit on and so many pieces of art/memorabilia  on the wall to study. Gary the snail, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, a model ship, those brown burlap sacks that produce can be shipped in (claiming to be filled with 50 lbs of weed in the past), a stop sign that says WHOA, a chandelier made of tiny dolls (made me think of Sid from Toy Story)...

The first thing we did was drink! They brought out 5 beers in 4 oz(?) tasters, one at a time. And sometimes they would leave us extras! Have I mentioned that this tour was entirely free? We tasted the Pilsner, the Pale Ale, the Censored, the IPA, and the Doppel Weizen. They did bring them out rather quickly but there was no rush to finish them because as soon as it calmed down a little, Ryan began his 20 or so minute history of company. 

What I loved about the stories shared here were that they were just hilarious and always about Lagunitas sticking it to the man. Also, there are quite a few mentions of dank buds in these tales. I began to feel a real comradery with the company. I even began to fantasize about working for this amazing company. 

And the edible had begun to seriously kick in. I laughed knowingly at all the jokes and really began to dissect the beers we were tasting. They were hoppy and lovely. My mom, who didn't quite make it through her IPA, enjoyed the Doppel Weizen enough to reconsider her thoughts about beer in general.

Ryan was a great storyteller and tour guide. Some of the crowd, understandably, was a little drunk/tipsy from prior drinking (or perhaps these tasters - they were larger than average). When one guy began heckling him, Ryan immediately called him out. Maybe 5 minutes later, this guy began again but was once again shut down and that was the end of any trouble. Overall though, the crowd became a ton of fun as they became more tipsy.

We got to see the new brewroom they are building and it was beautiful. The walls were purple and the accents were this hotpink/red. Very different from the standard eggshell white on white.

We also got to walk very close to all of the functioning brewing equipment. Perhaps a little dangerous but really fucking cool. More information was given on the history of the company and the naming of the beers. This shit is entirely worth going to Lagunitas and getting the tour - there is just so much backstory to everything that they do, awesome backstory that they refuse to smooth over with time.

Finally, when the tour was over, we were led back to the functioning bar. It was at this point that I wanted to thank Ryan for the best tour that I had ever been on but alas, after my trip to the restroom, he had disappeared. 

I paid for the $5 sampler, which is any 4 beers in 4 oz (?) tasters. Again, they seemed pretty big for tasters. I had the Hop Stoopid, the Little Sumpin Sumpin, the Lagunitas Sucks, and the Wet Dog. I had really wanted to try the Marshall Ranch but they were out - next time!

I don't know that I could pick a favorite out of these. I just remember lots of beautiful tropical smells (guava, grapefruit, clementines, pineapple) and gorgeous colors. Lots of amazing, fresh, green hops. Grassy, dank hops. Citrus-y, piney, resinous hops. 

Hop Stoopid used to be one of my favorite beers, until I discovered Green Flash's Imperial IPA. And then, after Green Flash's West Coast IPA, I thought I had found my one true beer love. Yesterday, my love for Hop Stoopid was reawakened but I believe out of the four, I liked Wet Dog and Lagunitas Sucks the most. Maybe Wet Dog the most - it was wet hopped and delicious. 

Next time, I'll go with a notebook to capture the beauty of these beers. I wasn't certain what to expect this time but I was blown out of the water. Definitely sometime I want to do many more times in the future.

**TL;DR: Lagunitas Brewery has a rich and humorous history, great tour guides, and delicious beer. Extra enjoyable for those who are Ents and those who love hops.**",,False,self,t5_2qhg1,True,,,True,t3_mq827,http://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/mq827/best_brewery_tour_ever_lagunitas_brewery/,

That's crazy...it makes you wonder what we will be lusting after in 10 more years. Also, enjoy your local IPA hype. Beers like Dreadnaught have fallen off compared to the Plinys and Heady Toppers, but it seems like there's a new big IPA every couple of years. I think...in the long run...that's a good thing. Because Dreadnaught is still delicious, and the fact that I can find it on shelves with relative ease means I get my hop fix without having to wait in seven hour lines.

I also noticed they had a 750 mL of [Golden Carolus Grand Cru](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/gouden-carolus-grand-cru-of-the-emperor/6170/) but on their chalkboard menu it was listed for $12.

In my mind I was thinking 'no way that's gotta be for like a glass or little bottle or something, that beer retails for like $20 in the store'

Towards the end of the night I finally ask the staff if it was $12 for a glass or for the big bottle. They tell me it's for the big bottle. I ask again, in disbelief. They tell me that the bottles are from 2010 and they are discounting them so that they can sell 'em all before they go bad.

Most proffessional/semi-pro beer snobs seem to be obsessed with extremely bitter beers. Imperial/Double IPA's (Ruination, Hop Stoopid), Strong Ales (Arrogant Basterd, Dead Guy Ale), Stouts (Dark Lord, Breakfast Stout). Sure, there's a ton of complex flavors. That doesn't mean they're *good* flavors. Also, Hop Stoopid tastes like frickin' grass.

I prefer the other side of the beer spectrum: Golden and delicious beers. Duppels, Trippels, Pale Ales, Single IPA's. I've been known to sneak in a Quadruppel or a Russian Imperial Stout here and there. These are flavorful, but definitely not bitter, beers. This whole ""yellow fizzy beer is bla bla bla"" and ""it's not real beer if you can see though it"" attitude is tiresome, and projets a negative image of the noble beer snob.

All I'm saying is, if you make fun of my Ska True Blonde, I'll freakin' cut ya.

Quite the opposite.  This is definitely one of the better IPA's I've ever had.  It was very hoppy with strong notes of grapefruit and pine, but at the same time it didn't have the ""punch you in the face with hops"" quality of most other West Coast IPAs.  A really well-balanced and delicious beer, and I'm going to make a point to go and stock up on some before it's gone forever.
