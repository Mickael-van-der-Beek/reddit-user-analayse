Once my mother was having a nap in the afternoon and heard my brother calling her, scared. She woke up immediately and found nobody in the room. At the same moment my brother had an accident with his motorcycle and we found out that only later.

On another occasion, my grandfather was in bed, some days before dying, and he told us he dreamt of his older brother, and that he said to him that they would meet soon and not to worry. The fact is that we hadn't told to my grandfather that his brother died only few days earlier. My grandfather died a week later.

A really scary things is that for a couple of months after the death of my grandfather I kept dreaming of him, I was unaware in the dream that he was dead, but he kept telling me that where he was, he was happy. The last time he said he really had to go, but that we would have met again in about (and here I can't remember clearly) 20-30 years. I was 15, now I'm 31. I haven't dreamt of him anymore since.

When I was younger I usually had vivid deja-vus that would span from a couple of seconds to several dozens of seconds. I would recall the dreams in the morning but don't know what they meant since they had no context. After some time the deja-vu would happen exactly as I dreamed them, even the long sequences, and I could clearly remember the day I dreamt them as the pieces finally got together.

Once I got to 15 yo, those deja-vus became really frequent and each one was very long, I could remember entire conversations rolling up before me, so I decided: fuck this, I don't want to play a script and I started to not to do what happened in my dreams. After that moment I started having deja-vu of things that didn't happen. An alternate reality in which, I assume, things went as they were supposed to. I was in a place where I was supposed to be, but different things were happening, I was with different people, and at the same time I had the clear memory of the deja-vu.

Then things got even more complicated, as I started having 2 different deja-vu of the same event, the first from the ""original"" line, and the second that was the new story line. After a while I tried to get away from the second line too, but then a third line of deja-vus opened, letting me see three different story lines for the same things.

These deja-vus are now less frequent and more apart from each other, but still happen from time to time.

**TL:DR: Dreams in my family are really weird and changing things from deja-vus lead only to more deja-vus, you can't escape. Also, I may die at the age of 35 of 45.**

Hours later I woke up and made my way downstairs to a police officer in our foyer, my mom obviously upset/signs of previous crying, my sister glaring at me, and my dad on edge.

Turns out it was around 9PM. My entire family had noticed I was nowhere to be found for a few hours. My dad in his bellowing voice screamed my name, my mom and sister rummaged through the house looking for me. Tearing the covers, sheets, pillows off of every bed. Looking in cabinets, closets, bathrooms, under sinks, you name it. I was 14 so I could not have driven myself anywhere. So they called 911 for a missing person.

I was there, and then hours later to them it seemed i had been kidnapped. My dad ended up driving through the neighborhood looking on the side of the road, in ditches, wooded areas, etc.

All I remember after falling asleep in my sister's room was dazily walking down the stairs. My dad and mom and sister swear they tore every room upstairs apart. While screaming, calling, shouting my name. Threatening me if I didn't show up. I recall none of this.

My dad still swears up and down I was NOT in the house. Last weekend I boarded a plane, and while going through security, something sent off the radar on my head. My head was patted. They do that when the metal detector senses it on your head (bobby pins, etc?). To my knowledge i have zero metal headware.

I have no explanation for what happened, and if it weren't for my sister being in the room at the time it happened, I probably would have checked myself into a mental institute by this point because it quite simply does not make any sense.

I was sitting on my couch using my computer, my sister was sitting 5 feet away on another couch. She notices a moth flying around the room, and being terrified of bugs, I offer to catch it and let it outside so she doesn't have to deal with it. Conveniently enough, the moth flies within my reach, and I snag it out of mid-air with my right hand. 

As this is happening, my left hand is casually making a fist while rested in my lap, which I thought nothing of at the time. After catching the moth, I feel it flutter around in my right hand for a few brief moments, and then it stops. I assume at this point that I had either closed my hand too tightly, killing it, or it had just realized that it wasn't going to get out and stopped putting up a fight. 

After shaking my hand slightly and still feeling no movement, I open my right hand and there is nothing there. Interesting, I think, it must have slipped out of my grip and I didn't notice. I then casually open my left hand which was rested in my lap, and lo-and-behold, the moth mysteriously flutters out. I instantly freak out and ask my sister if she saw what happened, to which she agreed that I had caught it with my right hand, but it had somehow moved to my left hand.

My right hand was never within a foot of my left hand while the whole incident took place over the course of 10 seconds or so, and if it weren't for her witnessing it, I would have thought I was crazy. I have no explanation for this other than a potential glitch in the matrix, quantum leaping, or some other phenomenon that I clearly do not understand.

Four or five years ago, I was visiting my family in New Orleans. I was with my family, and we were staying at my grandparents' house. My grandfather, parents, brothers and myself all went to pay a visit to my aunt and uncle who lived across town. My aunt and uncle had a dog named Barnie, a grizzled old black Scottish Terrier who was probably around 16 or 17 at the time. Anyway, we were all sitting around in the family room, chatting about work, life, etc. Eventually the conversation moved to the topic of Barnie. We talked about his health issues and his diet (homemade Cuban food) and were generally surprised that he had lived as long as he had. 

At this point, my grandfather commented on the gate to the yard being open on our way in, and asked if my uncle was worried that Barnie would get out. My uncle said nah, he wanders the neighborhood all the time, we're not too worried about him. My grandfather was surprised at this, and noted that Barnie wasn't even wearing a collar. Before my uncle could even respond, Barnie casually lifted his head to expose the collar that was hiding under his fur. We were stunned. Nobody had made any move towards him or called his attention; he simply lifted his head to show his collar, then put it back down and continued snoozing.

About 8 years ago, I was driving home from work. Ordinary night, was about 1030pm.

I drive along and a few moments later when I get to the intersection, I see the SAME CAR pull up, slow down, and make the same left turn driving away from me.

1341136745.0,65,self.GlitchInTheMatrix,vvhtb,I've never truly told this story before. My glitch happened in Walmart...,ObscureSaint,76,11,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/GlitchInTheMatrix/comments/vvhtb/ive_never_truly_told_this_story_before_my_glitch/,"Years ago, when I was still a teenager, I went shopping with my dad at Walmart. He had a seizure; it was scary; the end. &lt;-- that's  the story I've related to friends and family in the past. Here's what really happened:

I was a fourteen-year-old young lady, and I was shopping at Walmart with my dad, a friend of mine and a few of my small siblings. We were on vacation, and this was a strange Walmart in a strange place, and thus it took a little longer than we expected to find all of our items. Dad said he wasn't feeling well.

In the checkout line, I turn around and start glancing through all those last minute, impulse items. Gum, candy, magazines. I glance at my dad, and he's staring at the ceiling. ""Dad?"" I ask. He doesn't reply. He doesn't blink. His eyes remain fixated on the ceiling above me -- but there's nothing there.

*""Dad??""* I ask again, more insistently. Something's wrong.

This is where the break happens. One moment, I'm looking at my dad who is staring at the ceiling with his mouth slightly ajar... the next moment I'm kneeling on the floor about six feet away, my dad lying flat on his back on the floor, his head at my knees, my hands cradling the sides of his head. I'm calling out loudly, panicked: ""Dad -- dad! DAD! Dad!"" He doesn't answer and his body straingtens and strains -- every muscle in his body is tight, he's struggling with every ounce of energy he has but is not moving at all.

Everyone around us simply stands and stares.

He's not breathing. I can hear someone screaming ""DAD!"" and realize it's still me.

Within a few moments of my panicked screams, off-duty firefighters who happened to be nearby in the store come over. They don gloves, they assess his vitals and ask questions. ""Did he hit his head?"" one firefighter asks me. 

""I don't know, I don't know,"" I lament. I'm wringing my hands. I don't know. Dad fell, he's on the floor, he must have hit his head, right?

A bystander (my young friend) chimes in: ""No, he didn't hit his head. She caught him!""

The firefighters are able to call an ambulance. My dad grunts and a mouthful of blood comes pouring across his lips. I'm convinced he's dying; people on TV always cough up blood as they die.

He reaches the hospital. He lives. Life goes on as normal, eventually.

--

What I can't figure out, even more than a decade later, is that break in time while dad fell. One moment I was looking at my father and the next, he was lying on the floor and I was six feet away from where'd I'd been standing, cradling his head in my hands. My friend, the witness, says I caught my dad as he fell, but I don't remember an iota of that action. I don't remember contemplating, ""hey, maybe he's going to fall"" or ""I should walk over here to see if dad's okay..."" Nothing. 

It's like I blinked, and reality shifted around me. I'm told I calmly walked over to my father, grabbed him at the shoulders, and guided him backwards to the floor as he fell, keeping his head from hitting the floor. I was 5'2"" and 95 pounds at the time ... my giant father should have crushed me as he fell. I don't know how I would have managed it.

I've always told myself I just didn't remember because of the stress, but it's truly a glitch in my matrix, and sometimes my mind runs wild trying to fill that gap. Did time jump? Did another conciousness take over my body momentarily to do what needed to be done? Did I somehow travel to another reality? Did my dad see something above us that he shouldn't have? Did the MIB have me look at that flashy-memory-stick thing?

And how convenient was it that paramedic-trained firefighters were standing three lines over when this happened? What are the chances of that happening?

TL;DR: As an adolescent, I somehow I walked six steps and caught a full grown seizing man, all without any conscious thought on my part, all without straining a single muscle. I blinked, and I was suddenly somewhere else, and things had happened. Somehow, firefighters happened to be in the exact right place at the exact right time. That's my glitch.

One time back when I was in high school, I stayed home watching Firefly for the first time. I was powering through the series because the movie was coming out Friday. One of you can look up the year this happened.
I was watching my perfectly legal copy on my computer on the main floor when I thought I heard a noise coming from upstairs. No one was upstairs. I paused the video, and listened.
It sounded like footsteps. But my house always sounds like there are random footsteps. I live near the water, and my understanding is that with all the sand in the soil, the houses settle more.
I listen to the footsteps and try to play the dangerous game of ""Burglar or House"" when I hear a scream from upstairs. Well, it sounded like a scream.
There was something off about the sound. I couldn't place what was wrong, but it was wrong enough that I doubted what I heard. So I stayed downstairs, eyes trained on the stairs. My parents came home soon after and I didn't hear anything else and kinda moved on. I figured I worked myself up.
The next day I stayed late at school for some reason and needed to call my mom to come pick me up.
I speed dialed home and instead of the typical connecting rings, I heard the same scream.
I also realized what was off about the sound. It sounded computerized. Like a scream recorded in low quality.

Few years ago, there was a movie release in my country called The Orphan. the title was very familiar to me and I thought I have seen it before on HBO a few years back. (I'm a big fan of horror movies and have quite a good memory of the shows I've watched). I went to check its release date and found out that it was released in the states one+month before the release in my country.  Thus, it was impossible that I've seen the movie so soon on HBO. 

Thinking that I has probably remembered the wrong movie, I bought the tickets for the movie and went ahead with it. Not even halfway through the show, I realised it was the exact plot, right down to even the characters' names.

A friend told me this happened sometimes.. a movie would sometimes be released a few years earlier in its home country before being premiered abroad. I went back to double check the release date again, which was indeed only one month ago.

Otherwise, I'd say my brain just likes to work against me.

I spent the night at my friend's house, let's call her Summer with my other friend Marie. I have always hated Summer's house because I have an unrational fear of ghosts and she loves to tell me tales about the benevolent beings in her house. Especially in the attic, where her new room is. 

We turn in relatively early, around 12 because we have a festival to go to in the morning. Now, because of my fears and weird dreams, I ALWAYS try to sleep with noise and light otherwise my dreams go from weird to /r/nosleep worthy. So, I feel slightly comfortable, being that I'm sleeping in the same room as Marie on a couch and Summer is in the very next room. I have a clear view of the only entrance to the attic(very important to my paranoia) and Marie can clearly see Summer's door. Which is closed. Note this.

Both the girls fall asleep and I get freaked out as usual so I turn on the TV in that room and turn down the volume out of courtesy. I feel better and eventually fall asleep. I continually have to get up every two hours or so to change the channel, because if I don't the TV turns to static. Once, I remember regaining consciousness, sitting up, turning the lamp on and turning the TV back ON. I just walked over and did my thing once again. I just suspected that Marie turned if off, when I sat down her eyes opened and I simply apologized and got back in bed, and turned off the lamp. Soon the sun went up and I felt much better.

Nothing weird happened. Till Marie told me what she saw. She said she woke up from the static and saw that I wasn't on the couch anymore. She was so damn comfy she decided to wait until I came back so rather that get up herself to turn off the TV. She said she waited for like 10 minutes and I didn't return. She dismissed it knowing I'm paranoid and probably crawled into bed with Summer, she gets up and turns off the TV. It's pitch black now and she decides to wait up abit longer to see if I return. Next thing she knows I'm standing up, turning on the lamp and turning on the TV. I sit back down. Apologize. And turn off the lamp.

Never do I remember getting off the couch or walking around her house. Over and over, I asked Marie if she was actually awake and she said yes. However, she doesn't know where I came from. I even asked Summer and her mother if they saw me that night and both said no. They being light sleepers and I've been known to have late night discussions with her mom.

One thing that bothers me the most is that I remember the feeling of raising up the top part of my body to turn on the lamp. But Marie insists I was standing. I don't like my brain telling me lies. Or Marie's.

Secondly, me and my SO like to stay up talking in bed, so much so that we often fall asleep mid sentence. Every single dream I have when we are in the same bed is a conversation with him, with my room exactly as it actually is. The odd thing here is that through the night we will both wake up at the same time and both wonder whether or not we have had conversations, not even the same ones.

It's a large enough area that you can smoke pot in public without worrying about disturbing the other people who are there. It was a really gorgeous Florida day out so two of my best guy friends and I decided to go smoke a j at the park.

When we got there, we sat by the water to smoke privately and once finished, went and sat at a picnic table a just a little ways over from two dads and their kids playing. The fathers were throwing a frisbee around while the kids tried to keep up. All three of us were watching the frisbee getting tossed around. So one dad throws the frisbee to the other, and the guy goes to put his finger up to the center of the frisbee to sort of spin it on his finger (kind of like you would do a basketball) before catching it, and it just...shatters into chunks that disappear into thin air. 

Now, we were a little stoned, but all three of us saw this happen, and of course both of the men playing with the frisbee did as well. They seemed to just brush it off though they were scratching their heads, but we were freaking out. The frisbee didn't just pop out of existence, but break into big chunks that then disappeared (it happened really quickly). There were no pieces of it on the ground-both of the men searched- and it never reappeared. 

I'm seriously so glad my friends were there with me when it happened because people don't usually believe us at first when we tell them this story.

There was no English TV and no internet that i could use and yet I had a dream. This dream was full of detail and i thought it was so original that i was going to write a book about it as soon as i returned to Canada. In the dream i was infected by a fast-acting plague while walking outside of a library in my hometown and blacked out. When i awoke i was in a crowded funeral home in line to be burnt in a cremator. Void of rational thought, i could only feel a ravenous hunger. Me, and several other seemingly ""dead"" bodies leapt out of our coffins and set upon the mourners, biting and scratching them with super-human strength. I then bit the ministers wife before he bashed me over the head with a crucifix. When i came too a second time i saw my family as well as my crush cornered by the undead and my fever broke. I started to tear the corpses apart savagely, using my recovered intelligence and my newly received strength, to outsmart and outmaneuver them, getting the remainders away from my family. As they are lead away one of the pipes full of gas for the cremator bursts, spraying fire throughout the building. Using a piece of the pipe as a club I am able to incapacitate all of the zombies surrounding me and make my way back to my family, leading them safely out of the building now engulfed in flame. The rest of the dream is inconsequential, although it still pertains to the basic idea. Anyway, upon arriving home i quickly found out that an almost identical idea, under different circumstances is the plot of the movie ""warm bodies"", a movie about how a zombie is able to slowly become human again to save someone he loves.

Figured it may get more traction here due to relevance and I'd really be interested to hear any similar stories. 

When I was young I was notorious for trying my damndest to catch Santa Claus delivering gifts on Christmas. It wasn't that I doubted his existence, I just wanted to meet the man. Even after I'd be put to bed, usually supervised to make sure I was asleep, I would usually wake up and run out to the tree to see if he had come yet. One year when I was maybe 5 and my sister 7, my parents got us big kid bicycles. The bicycles were kept next door in our neighbor's garage until Christmas eve because while I wanted to meet Santa my sister's Christmas vice was that she was the worst snooper and would look all over the house for hidden presents and the bikes would be too difficult to hide. That year they asked my Grandfather to come over and watch to make sure I didn't wake up while they were bringing in the bikes from next door.

All went according to plan and I managed to stay asleep during the night but when my eyes opened and I saw the sun already up I ran out to the living room and was so excited to see all of the presents under the tree and my new bike. We did the normal Christmas morning ritual, opened all the gifts, and then it was time for breakfast which was usually pancakes as a special treat.

Even though my sister and I were both too old for it we still had a high chair in the kitchen pushed into the corner. On the seat of the high chair was a cassette tape/booklet combo of [Mickey Mouse Disco](http://imgur.com/6Pm29pq). It was unwrapped but still in the plastic. I grabbed it and brought it to my Mom and asked her if it was for me. She looked at it confused and said she guessed so, but she didn't have any idea where it came from. I had guessed that maybe Santa had forgotten to wrap it and left it in the kitchen because he was running late or since the kitchen was between the room where we had the tree and the room where the fire place was he dropped it by mistake on his way back up the chimney. I overheard my parents discussing where it came from which is something that stuck with me because to a child it was obviously from Santa so why would they question this one gift over any of the others.

When I was older, past the age of knowing Santa wasn't real, I brought it up again and got more information about from my parents. They questioned my Grandfather about it when he came back on Christmas day and thought he must have left it there. He didn't, and it wasn't in his personality to let a joke go on for years, even if he had. Nor was it in my Mom's or my Dad's personality to have never fessed up to it if it had been a joke one of them played on the other. So to this day there's still no explanation where that Mickey Mouse Disco cassette tape came from. But I played the hell out that tape as a kid.

I'm not the most articulate person, so I'm just going to try to get across what I'm pretty sure I experienced before.

My mom and I used to go on rides a lot in our Dodge Neon. This had to be around the late nineties or early 2000s, and I was six or so. I used to look out the window for entertainment. I remember in the next town over I'd used to see this little shack that almost seemed like a farm stand. It had trusses and framing around it, with a little shack in the center. I remember seeing workmen building it a few times.

A few years later, and a change of custody, my dad and I drove by the area, and it surprised me how old and decrepit it looked. The lot was completely grown over, and the wood seemed dilapidated to the point of nearly collapsing. This was surprising because it had only been three or so years since I saw it being built. I wish I remembered more about it, but that's one of my main experiences with a ""glitch"".

I'm pretty sure my dad told me about a similar occurrence. He's a carpenter, and he's worked in a lot of old houses.

It all started with watching [this video about 2012, numerology, 19.5, 11:11, The Masons 33, etc](http://vimeo.com/7880620). The next day when I got into work and plugged my phone into the computer it was 11:11. I thought it was ironic because I had just seen the video. Later that night after work, having not used my phone in a while, I checked it. It was 11:11.

The next day. Same thing. 11:11 at work plugging my phone in, and 11:11 at night; albeit me having checked it about 3 times unlike the first night - so not as 'random' but coincidentally it was a 3rd time. 

Then the last night, after signing into Facebook for the first time since having gone to work that day, [I see this](http://i.imgur.com/ouYbI.jpg). Notice, I also always view feed by most recent, not top stories.

Then come today right after I woke up, while having my first cigarette and a drink, [This other status from another group appears on my feed](http://i.imgur.com/fbLUw.jpg)

Now obviously my human explanation is coincidence, but I'll be damned if I didn't somehow rewire my brain into alerting my internal clock to be more apt to 11:11 from having watched that video and been so engrossed.

Before  I explain the rest, it was late at night, 2AM, and my family was already asleep. 
So, I turn the small tower fan in my room off, shut the door, and go downstairs. I used the bathroom, washed my hands, got a glass of sunny-D, put the glass in the sink, and laying down on the couch with my favorite blanket and pillow. 
Now, this probably sounds like a sleepwalking case, but I assure you, it isn't. I couldn't have fallen asleep in my room because I literally turned off my Xbox, sat down on my bed, and decided it was time to go downstairs. I then did all of those things.
Once again, I wake up and the door to the stairwell in my house was shut, as was the door to my room, which was also locked! My fan was off, and my glass was in the sink right where I had left it.
This freaked me out so much for a few reasons: Things like this have happened before, however minor; and my favorite blanket was on top of me when I awoke.

edit for one more story: My best friend tried to tell me that his house was haunted and that if he demanded an answer from the 'spirits' or whatever they would give him the answer in his head. Well needless to say I had to test him on this, and since I had just changed my AIM (oldschool, yes) password I told him to guess it. Well he gets into this weird trance-like state and says something along the lines of ""Tell me the answer mother fucker"" and then he just stops, gets this weird look on his face, looks right at me and says ""bob barker.""

I check, and bam, there it is, it's the first game I randomly pull out of the little basket of N64 games I have, and it was even sticking out the front.  

The thing is, I never had any thoughts of that game beforehand, and I specifically remember that I had Super Smash Bros. at the front of that little row of games. ",,False,,t5_2tcw3,False,,,True,t3_1086u9,http://www.reddit.com/r/GlitchInTheMatrix/comments/1086u9/a_very_minor_glitch/,

I'm with some friends right now and we were trying to figure out what places were still open for food. One person in our company looked at the microwave clock and said ""it's 2:36 AM!""

Turned out he was mistakenly reading the microwave timer as a clock - though the time on our phone showed 2:36am as well.
