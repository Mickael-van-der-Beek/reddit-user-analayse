(Story inside for those interested),Stellalune,136,16,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/1bvno2/a_thank_you_to_aqua_story_inside_for_those/,"Sorry about the upcoming wall of text, but I need to gush a little and I figured you all might appreciate it. Note: there will be spoilers about Birth By Sleep in here. You have been warned.



Long story short:

Aqua from BBS gave me my spark back after my mother died of breast cancer. I finally feel like myself again after years of deep depression. 

Long story:


I originally picked up Kingdom Hearts for my birthday years ago when I was younger. Like many of you, I adored every minute of it. Sora was a loveable goofball, and my friends and I could fight over who was better between him and Riku. I was shaking after I beat ‘Ansem’ and the ending blew my young mind.


Around the time Chain of Memories came out, we discovered my mother had developed breast cancer. As she told me, she actually broke down and cried on my then 13 year old shoulder. But, due in no small part because of the influence of Sora’s continuously optimistic outlook, I took it in stride. It was early enough to be treatable and, despite some hard times ahead we would get through it. 


Kingdom Hearts II was the first game I ever pre-ordered. I picked that up the day of its release and controller in hand, I plunged in. At this point, the cancer treatments were in full swing. It was taking its toll on my brother, who was always very sensitive, and my parents’ marriage. The fights I overheard were incredible. My father even confided in me that he was thinking of divorcing my Mom at one point. While it fortunately never came to pass, it was a terrifying thought. So, I dove into Kingdom Hearts. There, life was a struggle, and dark and downright depressing. But you just moved through it. And Sora’s journey kept me sane.


As time went on, things started looking up as Mom finished the more intense of her treatments and things went back to almost-normal. However, when I had just reached the final door before Xemnas, I lost my memory card. It was a bit of a hit and I didn’t want to start over, so I left the series for a while. I still haven’t gotten around to finishing it...


Having a DS, I picked up 358/2 days when it launched, but there wasn’t the same excitement for me as there was for KHII. On top of that, because I was beginning university I didn’t get much time to play it. I chose to study Biomedical science, so my free time was very sparse. It also remains unfinished. I really fell away from the series after that.


Since then, my life took one downward spiral after another. School was miserable and consumed all my time and energy. I came home exhausted and drained nearly every day. I was doing well academically, but it came at the cost of my sanity from the constant highs and lows of it. My self-confidence was shot and I constantly self-guessed myself.


In the summer of 2010, we found out that, at the last test before she would have been in remission for 5 years, one of the results was a false negative. It was in her bones, and this time there was nothing they could do but buy time. We were given 5 to 20 years, which is short enough to worry about, but too vague to know exactly when it would happen. This threw us all for a loop and I started spending more time at home. 


But, I kept my optimistic outlook. We had time left so I couldn’t be sad about it. If I just studied harder and kept my mother motivated, maybe she would stick around longer. I drilled in on working in cancer research and kept her posted on all the new developments as they happened. This seemed to work and she even biked 200 km (~125 miles) over two days for a cancer fundraiser.


All the while though, despite my hard work, my grades took a dip as I entered my third year. Destroying what little self confidence I had left.  Around this point is where my depression really started to sink in. Nothing I did was ever good enough, all my achievements were hollow, and I was emotionally disconnected from my family and friend. And this only worsened over time.


In September of 2012, the year I began my final year of University, she took a serious turn for the worse. And, after 3 weeks of the most unbearable misery anyone should have to endure, she passed away on October 9. She survived only two and a half years instead of the minimum of five we were promised at the start. 


I wanted to stay strong during all this and, while my brother and Dad were weeping in a way no one should ever have to, I was distanced from the whole affair. In the following weeks, I buried my emotions and only released them when I was alone. But, the apathy I had for her passing spread towards my studies. I was half-assing my work and only I started to not care if I passed or not. I had no motivation to work or to do much of anything but stare at a wall for hours on end. I wanted to drop out mere months from graduation.


It was in one of these bouts of boredom that I decided to look up Birth By Sleep. Lacking a PSP, I watched a playthough of it on Youtube. It started off as just another distraction at first. Ventus and Terra’s stories were great, but Aqua really caught my attention.
 She reminded me a lot of... well... me. As cliché as it sounds, it was true. An honour student who often achieves her goals, but second guesses her chosen path along the way. She acts as a mother towards the naive Ventus (my Brother) but also has to keep an eye on Terra to make sure he doesn’t fall into darkness (my Dad). She was obedient, but defensively very weak. She also relies on brain over brawn.

There are a number of other traits too, but suffice to say I WAS Aqua during that playthrough. 


She is given nothing but negative feedback in her travels. Her one goal, to prevent Terra from giving in to the darkness ended in utter failure. She tried to kill Vanitas before he reached Ventus, but even after two battles and using every trick in the book was unable to. She was told by Vanitus that she’s not even important to the grand story when compared to Terra and Ventus. I mean, in the end, Terra was dead as far she knew and Ventus was in a permanent coma.  She could have left Ventus in Yen Sid’s care. She could have just gone on her way as a Keyblade Master should, and just treated them both as memories. But she didn’t. She stayed and finished what she started. She used her knowledge to shelter Ven. She even saved Terra using a tactic that she didn’t know would work or not. 


But... in the end she was stuck in darkness. The same as me. Her four lines of dialogue in there snapped me back to who I was.


&gt;“I feel like I’ve been walking for ages. How long have I been down here?”
 
Perfectly described my feelings ever since my mother’s terminal diagnosis in 2010. It was almost as if I was always this way; Disconnected and alone.

&gt; “Maybe...I should fade into the darkness here.”

It reflected my deep sense of surrender I felt since then. Why should I bother continuing to study medicine? It’s not going to help anyone. As well as every other dark thought that I ever had, even a few suicidal ones. 


Then...that moment. Light in the darkness.

&gt; “I guess it's been so long, I almost forgot how to smile.""

 During her flashback sequences, that lingering image of Sora brought back all the feelings of hope that I had long since abandoned. It made me remember my old self, the joy and the hope I once felt about the world. And I smiled one of the first true, happy smiles since October. 


&gt;""There's always a way.""

 Her words resonated perfectly in a way I can’t describe. Just because darkness is everywhere it doesn’t mean I have to give in to it.  And for the first time in nearly two years, I knew that I would be alright. 


Aqua saved me from... me. Her story restored me to who I was before all this happened. It was hope. Not Sora’s corny, naive hope where everything is a happy ending. Instead, it was true hope in the depths of despair and uncertainty. And that means so much more.


Since then, I've got my motivation to work back, I feel more connected other people, and I'm looking forward to my graduation. I'm running on all cylinders for the first time in recent memory. I've been through too much, and I'm still standing. I'm not stopping now. Aqua didn't succumb to the darkness and I won't either. 


Anyways, I think just needed to get this out of my system. Thank you for your time and patience for reading this. Please let me know if you've ever had a similar experience. I'd love to hear it. :D

PPSSPP was recently updated so i decided I would try out BBS. Well, after spending hours trying to get this game to run on JPCSP and previous versions of PPSSPP, to my surprise this update just works. I didn't even have to fiddle around with any settings. I'm so excited to replay this game on the big screen at 4x Render resolution. I started testing it with the tutorial level and the beginning of Terra's story and it looks absolutely gorgeous. 

Here are a few Screenshots.

So, here's my story:
Yesterday, late at night, I'm on Reddit ((what else)) and my friend Kat is texting me, being a general troll as usual. Eventually, conversation turns to me asking: What do you want from me? Read (insert manga I can't spell))? Me to crossdress? Me to be humiliated all over the internet? She chose the first two. Now, me and her like to role play on chat sites. One of the characters I play is a cross dresser, and at 1:00 AM, my brain isn't too awake. Also, I still have myself to blame. At first I was like 0_0, but Then I was like ""okay, sure, I'll go along with this."" Then I realized she was serious. So, unsure of what to do next, I texted my fellow RPer who hasn't played Kingdom Hearts named Neva what to do. Yes, her name is Neva and she's a girl. So, I wondered what to do, and she was on board with this, so, I had two girls wanting me to crossdress. I accepted my fate and tried to lower my own punishment, so, I suggested that it only be for Halloween. Well, that got Kat's mind gears a-turnin', because her plan was to do our cosplay costumes of Roxas and Xion. Her genius idea: I dress as Xion on Halloween.
So, redditors of /r/KingdomHearts, I had gotten myself into a situation of soon cosplaying Xion. Maybe if this gets enough Karma, I'll post pics, and all these fans can fangasm to this wonderful situation I'm in. Really, I am not gonna fight this. It's gonna happen.",,False,self,t5_2s3jo,False,,,True,t3_z97pd,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/z97pd/i_screwed_myself_into_crossdressing_for_cosplay/,

We are months past the release of the 7th game, Kingdom Hearts 3D [Dream Drop Distance], but we still have much to look forward to-- Kingdom Hearts III is all but confirmed to be the next game in the series, and the director, Tetsuya Nomura, has hinted at other developments soon to come.

1359970660.0,62,self.KingdomHearts,17uyy0,"Let's talk about the Guardian (full of spoilers, more understandable if played the whole series)",AschFonFabre,66,4,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/17uyy0/lets_talk_about_the_guardian_full_of_spoilers/,"So, the [Guardian](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100416164854/kingdomheartsfanfiction/images/4/4f/Terranort_%26_Guardian.png) has always been an enigma in the series, he was just there, no explanation at all. What I have learned is the Guardian is in fact Terra. People say that this is just a apart of Xehanort's powers, but lets look back throughout the series.

Now, Terra had troubles controlling his darkness. Master Xehanort took note of that during his mastery test. Now when Braig and Xehanort meet, Braig asks him why he wanted Terra so badly. Xehanort replied he did not want Terra, but what was inside him. It is true Xehanort wanted a new vessel so he could live longer, but he could've chosen anyone. He chose Terra not for his strength, but the immense power hidden inside him. Now, it is relevant that Master Xehanort never summoned the Guardian in his original state hinting it was not his power to begin with, only after Aqua confronts him as Terra-Xehanort does he summon it. 
    
What I have concluded is, the Guardian is what is left of Terra's heart. Xehanort's heart was stronger than Terra's so that is why he has control. His mind was left behind in his armor creating the Lingering Sentiment. The reason the Guardian is a strong heartless is because was made from the darkness in Terra's heart. Now, a heartless is formed when a heart is expelled from the body. I believe this is what Xehanort did, he pushed Terra's heart out of his body which would create the Guardian. This would also explain the way Xehanort/Ansem position themselves when they summon him. They cross their arms as if the put them in a position where they won't just hang there. When the Guardian is summoned they have full control over it, as in they stop motion in there own arms so they could control its arms. Also take into the fact that it's mouth is covered in bandage perhaps from Xehanort's doing to prevent it from talking. This could prove Xehanort has full control over Terra's darkness while he can only watch. 
    

During certain scenes there is shown conflict between the Guardian and the user which add the proof of the Guardians identity. 

* The battle scene right after Xehanort first summons it and before he and aqua fight, you see its arms fidgeting as if it is fighting to control itself. During the battle when you are inside terra's heart, the guardian prevents you from trying to get to Terra, a point a which Xehanort is in control. Now, after the battle Terra has begun fighting over control over his own body, **note** the Guardian had already disappeared at this point. During that conflict Xehanort had won by locking his heart and stopping Terra, and caused him to loses his keyblade in the process. At that moment Xehanort was weak enough for Terra to summon himself as the Guardian. I believe he purposefully opened the portal to try to take his body to the Realm of Darkness to prevent any more harm. But Aqua saved him and was trapped there instead. 

* The only form in which Xehanort can summon the Guardian is ""Terranort"" and Ansem SOD. Every other form of Xehanort has not had Terra's heart in it, example: *Xemnas was only a form with Terra's body*. Now looking at Ansem alone he is the heartless of Xehanort, and Guardian as we know is a heartless on its own. Proof they are two separate beings is that they are two completely different forms. Ansem is an Emblem heartless and Guardian is a pureblood. Now the reason why two heartless and only one nobody was created is clear, Terra's and Xehanort's heart were in one vessel and when they separated, Xemnas could not access Terra's heart and Xemnas mind had full control because Terra's mind was in his armor.

* Terra's ceremony with Riku had always stayed true, events had caused them to meet again. Xehanort sent Kairi away  from Radiant Garden to Destiny Islands. Ansem also went there and waited. Ansem and Riku did not meet because of Ansem himself, but because Terra's heart was also there. From then on Ansem and Terra had followed Riku all over his journey since the beginning. 

* During Dream Drop Distance after their battle between Riku and Ansem with Guardian, Ansem went unconscious and started to fade. The Guardian at that point seemed to have control over itself. It reached out to Riku, but in an act as if it was trying to ask for help. Terra had control of himself and was asking Riku. Riku then held his keyblade in front of him. Terra/Guardian put their hand down almost satisfied with his reaction. I believe this is Terra's act of believing Riku will save him one day and fades away with Ansem waiting to be summoned again.


This is what I have concluded from playing all the games. The last point really made me think about it and I came to this as my answer. The Guardian is Terra's heart and darkness.

1358022478.0,57,self.KingdomHearts,16gaj8,Why Riku is my favorite character (spoiler warning):,ItWillAllBeMine,65,8,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/16gaj8/why_riku_is_my_favorite_character_spoiler_warning/,"For those who have diligently played through the kingdom hearts series, Riku’s story has been one of the most rewarding things to experience. His growth and character development have been connected to the plot of the games, and have finally come to a head after Dream Drop Distance. Players have often seen Riku through Sora’s eyes, but have gotten many glimpses into his character during the main games. In the side games, he is explored in depth, which is one of the reasons people buy those games. 

In the first game, he begins as Sora’s best friend, but due to his actions, Destiny Islands were swallowed by darkness. We see first in traverse town, and later throughout the story as he falls more and more to the darkness through Malificent’s influence (remember the scenes with Pinocchio). We see him working with the villains, all for Kairi. He rightfully views Sora’s adventure as a childish waste of time, and takes the burden of Kairi’s rescue to himself. He eventually steals the Keyblade and even allows Ansem to use his body, (basically selling his soul to Satan). But the worlds are saved by Sora, and Riku pays the ultimate price by being locked away in kingdom hearts. His final words are “take care of her.”

When he is given half the story in Chain of Memories, he begins his atonement process, almost literally rising up from the depths of hell itself (castle oblivion’s basement). He battles his crimes and misdeeds, eventually comes head to head against Ansem, and accepts his darkness as part of himself. He decides to use the darkness for a righteous cause: 

Riku: What are you making me choose now? 

DiZ: Between the road to light and the road to darkness. 

Riku: Neither suits me. I'm taking the middle road. 

DiZ: Do you mean the twilight road to nightfall? 

Riku: No. It's the road to dawn.

Riku ends the game so much stronger than he begins it. He grows up, all in that ascent. Riku learned through his trials who he was and was almost completely redeemed as a character. 

It is such a wonderful story that it could not end; In 356/2 days, he continued to work tirelessly to help Sora, and even showed kindness to Xion, urging her to make the choice that would be the best for everyone. Riku continues working with DIZ and Namine to basically jumpstart the story again. He even accepts his fate of using Ansem’s power when he beats Roxas. 

In Kingdom Hearts 2, Riku gives aid from the shadows, but is finally cured of his “affliction” by Ansem the Wise’s machine exploding. He becomes a party member until the end of the game, utilizing his dark powers to help Sora. In the final battle, players get to control him with a few limited functions. He is wounded, but manages to make it home with Sora. 

In 3DS, Riku is fully playable and customizable for the first time, and is wonderful to play alongside Sora. He begins to use dark attacks like dark aura (from COM), dark splicer, dark roll, and dark barrier, which are some of his best attacks. Finally, Riku saves Sora from Xehanort and beats Ansem one last time for shits and giggles. At the current part in the story, Riku is now the leader of the keyblade wielders, taking his place as the one true keyblade master (not counting Xehanort or Yensid).  

His character growth is amazing. From best friend to enemy to Satan’s lackey, Riku seems to be constantly falling into a bottomless pit. He then turns it around and claws his way back up to become the most dependable and strong character in the series.

Compare this all to Sora, a character who best embodies the “ignorance is bliss” idiom. Sora is by all means a loveable idiot. He is the hero just because that’s who he is. He fills a role, like Mario or Link, and is in this way a classic hero. Sora is simply dragged along for the ride, and accepts his destiny rather easily. Kairi was not even an issue in his mind until Riku brought it up at traverse town, then in monstro, then on Captain Hook’s ship – he was simply going from world to world defeating evil. His lowest point in the series (nadir) was at the entrance to Hollow Bastion in KH1, when Riku takes the keyblade in the ultimate betrayal. But even here, Sora just says “I’ve come too far to give up now,” and must rely on the Beast’s strength and his own magic to make it back up and reclaim his role. Sora tends to be a bland character in order for the player to impose his or her own emotions onto him. What results is a character that is just doing whatever appears heroic at the time. Imagine Ven’s childhood innocence at the beginning of BBS, but remove the all-important backstory. That is Sora. 

Riku is a very human character, a good friend and a capable leader that is able to put the needs of all the worlds over his own needs. His acceptance and mastery over his dark powers without being consumed by them means that he has definitely surpassed Terra, who gave him the power of the keyblade, and maybe even surpassed Xehanort, who became so corrupted that he is the main villain. In fact, Riku may be one of the best written modern video game characters because we see him fall due to noble intentions, and his rise back up to where he was always meant to be.

Beware Wall of Text.

Hello, /r/KingdomHearts , we mods have generally been in the background managing the submissions that make it on the subreddit. Right now, however, we feel it's time for a bit of discussion in terms of the policies we enforce on the subreddit, and we want to know what you, the user, want.

 Currently, if you haven't noticed, there are two prominent blog sites that automatically post their articles to the subreddit through reddit-enabled scripts: [KHInsider](http://www.khinsider.com) and [KH13.com](http://www.kh13.com). However, these two sites have not been playing nice ever since they've started posting on the subreddit: they've been suspected of vote gaming (with the mods receiving messages from each side accusing the other on different occasions); and they definitely use the subreddit as a way to increase page views (which is no crime, but is occurring at the expense of other users and sites being able to post their own content here). Often they race to be the first to post their link in order to avoid being caught by the spam filter or having one of the mods remove their link from the page (we often get up to 4 or 5 links with the same information at any given time). Personally, I have liked the fact that they provide access to informative news content like translated interviews, which is always good to balance the amount of image posts and fan videos that get on the front page every day. However, I wonder if this is the best model for the subreddit to run on.


So we're going to ask you guys what you think we should do. 

Here are some options:

1. Do nothing, let the situation remain as is with a warning to both parties.

2. Remove the post that is submitted second regardless of which was upvoted more. -This is what we've been doing in the past, however it has come at the expense of letting more people contribute, because it is very hard for a normal user to find and link to information faster than a content creator with an automated posting system.

3. Ban both users with the warning that if we ever suspect gaming the subreddit again that user will be banned while encouraging non partisan users to submit the news from their prefered site.

4. Blacklist both sites and tell users to find their KH info from somewhere else (possibly offer to put both links in the sidebar as severance).


5. Ban all blog and news sites and run a mod submitted news circle. This option would be very time consuming for us and we might not be as quick or efficient as the other ones. It also discourages user submissions.


Please discuss and give us feedback! Also, if you have any ideas of your own please write them down as well.

I'd just like to see them go from saving the universe twice, defeating the Heartless and the Nobodies, to sitting in class, just dying from boredom at the sheer mundane-ness of it all.

Picture them sitting in class, gazing out the window at the sky, looking for Disney Castle in the stars, reminiscing about their adventures and getting in trouble for not paying attention.

Let me know if I should add anything in.


If you're curious about the Kingdom Hearts story and don't have a lot of time, you can check out the links below or go down further and watch each of the games in a movie format if you have more time.

[Compact explanation of the story (recommended if you want to brush up on the facts)](https://docs.google.com/a/ucdavis.edu/file/d/0B8cPyvE2GTjOMzE4MTVlZTctMjE5Yi00YzAzLWJjZTAtZTllODY2OTc2MTMx/edit?hl=en_US&amp;pli=1)


*****
For anyone looking for the KH games put into movie form (I put them in chronological story order):

[Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWcrrhZB1XM)


* Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep events occur 10 years prior to Kingdom Hearts and has 3 different protagonists.


[Kingdom Hearts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QFYcuzRHSI)


* [Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ3SIAHIhJ8&amp;list=PLody2_ff0Vs7Ia7-Z-U2wQ_nKiqNCY13Y) begins during the events at the end of Kingdom Hearts when [Sora uses the Keyblade of People's Hearts to remove both his and Kairi's heart so that Kairi could be woken up, which in turn made Sora a heartless. ](/spoiler)


    * **Note pertinent to the length of the video:** It should be noted that the [""original"" 358/2 Days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAEoejIhW8I) is a little more than 2 hours shorter, but Square Enix [remastered the game in a high defintion re-release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_HD_1.5_Remix) (as well as KH and KH:CoM). Although 358/2 days is not playable on the HD 1.5 Remix, the game is adapted into 2 hours and 50 minutes worth of cinematic retelling. It's in Japanese and translated to English because it's only been released in Japan so far, but will be coming to North America, Europe, and Australia on the PS3 later this year in September.


[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMahBvtckFs)


* Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days runs concurrently with the events of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories.


Kingdom Hearts 2: [Part 1/3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqIkClK1lLI), [Part 2/3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6njjNMPQ-MA), and [Part 3/3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G13Bv0-aZJY)






[Kingdom Hearts: Coded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_DY-DoW2Xc)


[Kingdom Hearts: Dream Drop Distance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf-DRCBVeXs)


* **Note pertinent to DDD video quality:** If you don't want to watch DDD as both stories combined in 240p, you can watch the individual stories of [Sora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQQjzfxbwf8) and [Riku](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUQtMT0C55U) in 720p.",,False,self,t5_2s3jo,False,,,True,t3_1j7hsk,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/1j7hsk/want_to_catch_uprefresh_your_mind_with_the_story/,

**Edit: Let me rephrase. It's the first real story progression when it comes to the big characters like Sora and Riku.

If you can't afford a 3DS/don't want to get one, your best bet is to watch a playthrough on Youtube. It won't be the same, but at least you'll get the story. 

Honestly, it's a really fun game in itself. I can't say too much, but the Dream Eater system wasn't entirely a gimmick and I really did find it to be fun. In that system, your party consists of two monster that you create from recipes who fight for you and, upon getting stronger, make you stronger.

The semi-final boss battle would be all 7 guardians fighting all 13 seekers at the same time. This clash results in the creation of the X-blade which both Sora and Xehanort dash to obtain. They both grab the hilt at the same time and this sends them into a dive to the heart, where they have one final battle. In the end, Sora destroys Xehanort's heart once and for all, and leaves the dive. Because the true Keyblade war has ended with this clash, the True Kingdom Hearts comes forth from the darkness. Using the X-blade, which has now been made a weapon of light, Sora unlocks Kingdom Hearts to do the following:

-Give Roxas and Xion Hearts so that they may live their own lives as humans. Their story ends with Lea as they eat sea-salt ice cream atop the clock tower, and the camera zooms out slowly to them being drawn by Naminé.

-The other Organization members, now humans, dedicate their lives to the study of Kingdom Hearts' light, that it may better benefit the worlds.

-The Final Fantasy characters finish rebuilding Radiant Garden, which in a new world order where people travel between other worlds peacefully due to Kingdom Hearts' light is a shining city of hope and peace.

-Terra, Ventus and Aqua pledge themselves to become guardians of Kingdom Hearts' light so that it will not be taken by those who covet it.

-Kingdom Hearts' light destroys all Heartless.

-Since Yen Sid is killed by Xehanort during the events of the game, Riku takes up the roll of Keyblade Master to train new keyblade wielders to guard Kingdom Heats' light.

 And at the very end, Sora and Kairi sit together on Destiny Island and share the Paopu fruit and kiss that they had wished to from the very beginning. 

 And they all lived Happily ever after.

(the Secret boss, which would unlock the X-blade as a weapon, would be a remnant of the darkness that trapped Kingdom Hearts, manifesting itself as a Dark Sora, since he was the one who unlocked Kingdom Heats)",,False,self,t5_2s3jo,False,,Sephiroth,True,t3_ycbe0,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/ycbe0/how_i_want_kingdom_hearts_3_to_end/,

1362952144.0,51,self.KingdomHearts,1a1lo2,Uncover Your Organization XIII Name,Kuxir,55,4,195,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/1a1lo2/uncover_your_organization_xiii_name/,"It came to my attention that some people have a hard time figuring out how to make their organization name, so I thought i'd give it a shot.

Basic formula is just your name + x i.e. Sora=Roxas

This may seem like a daunting task but the first thing to consider is that in most cases youll aim for separating the consonants as much as possible. In Roxas you see the pattern is  c v c v c (C=consonant, V=vowel)

With c v c v c sora could also have turned into

* Sorax Sarox
* soxar saxor
* rosax rasox
* roxas raxas
* xosar xasor
* xoras xaros

This is further complicated when you have a name with 2 or more consonants than you have vowels or vice versa, since there are less strings that sound accurate. This is were it becomes much harder, but you can brute force this process a bit.

Take for example the name ""Slava""
There are 3 consonants, S, L, and V and 2 vowels
c v c v c is impossible so youll go with 

* cc v c v c

&gt;A useful patter would be (lets assume the name is Slava, S=C1, L=C2, V=C3, X=C4, A=V1, A=V2)

&gt;C1 C2 V1 C3 V2 C4 - C1 C2 V1 C4 V2 C3 (switching last 2 Cs)

&gt;C1 C2 V2 C3 V1 C4 - C1 C2 V2 C4 V1 C3 (switching last 2 vowels)

&gt;C2 C1 V1 C3 V2 C4 - C1 C2 V1 C4 V2 C3 (switching first 2 Cs)

&gt;C1 C3 V2 C2 V1 C4 - C1 C3 V2 C4 V1 C2 (switching out a later C with C2, do with with each later C)

&gt;C2 C1 V1 C3 V2 C4 - C2 C1 V1 C4 V2 C3 (then start process with a diff C first)

* Here is an example

&gt;Slavax Slaxav

&gt;lsavax lsaxav

&gt;Svalax Svaxal

&gt;Vsalax Vsaxal 

&gt;Sxaval Sxalav

&gt;Xsaval Xsalav

&gt;Then pair the others, L with the other 2, then v with x

&gt;Lvaxas Lvasax

&gt;Vlaxas Vlasax

&gt;Lxavas Lxasav

&gt;Xlavas Xlasav

&gt;Vxasal Vxalas

&gt;Xvasal Xvalas

&gt;A smart move would be to immediatly throw out the combinations which have bad sounding consonants together, like Vx or Xl

&gt;there would be 4 in each row if the vowels were diff and you would have to switch them

* c v cc v c
* c v c v cc

These are more likely to be gibberish and take longer to map out so that's why c v c v c is preffered. But even with balanced names, if you're up for the challange you can try something like cc vv c or c vv cc for a name like Sora.

* cc vv c

&gt;Sroax

&gt;Sraox

&gt;Sxoar

&gt;Sxaor

&gt;etc

As you see here, much more prone to being gibberish.

1372733010.0,46,self.KingdomHearts,1hgz26,A humble KHIII theory. (Spoilers. Spoilers everywhere.),Jiayizheng,55,9,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/1hgz26/a_humble_khiii_theory_spoilers_spoilers_everywhere/,"Due to the ending to Kingdom Hearts 3D, it is my thought that Sora is neither a Seeker of Darkness nor a Guardian of Light. Lea saved Sora from being possessed by Xehanort's heart, and Master Yen Sid (in his biggest douche move ever) did not grant Sora the title of Keyblade Master, which to me says that Sora doesn't belong to that camp either. (By the way, was anyone else raging at what a jerk Yen Sid was at the end? All through the game he is saying that as long as they both complete the test requirements they will both be named Masters, and they both fulfilled the requirements, yet suddenly at the end Yen Sid says, ""lol jk we only need one master."" Rrrgh.) /rant

So my theory is that, since I believe Sora is neither a Guardian of Light nor a Seeker of Darkness, and since we know from Nomura interviews that Sora has both light and darkness affecting his heart, I believe the final battle is going to be Sora vs. Xehanort with Sora wielding the X-blade, since, being neither a Guardian nor a Seeker, his heart was not used to create it. He balances the light and darkness in his own heart, making the X-blade choose him instead of *DARKNESS*-obsessed Xehanort. This would also give new meaning to his quote from 3D, ""This is what lights the darkness...a chance to make everyone happy!""

1363469034.0,45,self.KingdomHearts,1afg96,Really wild theory. But I'm re-playing the games and had a thought come to mind. (spoilers on almost every game),tetewhyelle,53,8,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/1afg96/really_wild_theory_but_im_replaying_the_games_and/,"Okay. So I'm a pretty avid fan of the games and while I have not played all the games, I've seen *all* the cutscenes. That took a few weeks to get through, but it was important for me to understand the storyline.

Now. In BBS, we find out that Ventus's heart has pretty much been sleeping in Sora's for over a decade. Correct? Sora had the ability to weild to keyblade because of Ventus, but later the keyblade ends up just choosing him or whatever. Anyways, so I started replaying KH1 last night and I got to like the introductory dream 'this is how you play the game' type part when thought popped in my head.

The voice that's like telling Sora what to do and like the whole ""Don't be afraid. You hold the mightiest weapon of all"" and all that. Not like the directions but the voice of whoever is talking to Sora. Well at the part where you're choosing your alignment (strength, defense, magic) the voice says ""Power sleeps within you.""

Now maybe I'm taking this a little far-fetched (and also haven't slept in a few days) but is it possible that it could be Ven's voice? Like he's technically within Sora right? Thats why Roxas looked so much like him nd whatnot. So it wouldn't be too far of a stretch since it seems like SquareEnix is usually pretty good about having most the storyline before making all the games. I mean Sora talked to Ventus in the same sort of way in the beginning of BBS as well. I don't know. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but what do you guys think?",,False,self,t5_2s3jo,False,,Ultima2,True,t3_1afg96,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/1afg96/really_wild_theory_but_im_replaying_the_games_and/,

I feel you should change the way minigames and the Coliseum are handled. Players should get more of a reward for beating a minigame other than getting the journal to 100%. I feel you should reward the player with experience points to make the minigames worthwhile and not just some throwaway add-on like in every other Kingdom Hearts game. As for the Coliseum, I loved the way it was handle in Kingdom Hearts 1. Where you could still gain experience from killing enemies within the fights. I also found the time limit portions in the Kingdom Hearts 2 Coliseum fights to be more frustrating than fun.

Sincerely your loyal fan,

1370802621.0,43,self.KingdomHearts,1fzrp4,"A short rant on why the ""pointless spin-offs"" are the best games to me. (SPOILERS FOR EVERY GAME!)",KadeLylath,49,6,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/1fzrp4/a_short_rant_on_why_the_pointless_spinoffs_are/,"Kingdom hearts one, two, and CoM (I think we can all agree on) are the main story and driving force behind the Kingdom Hearts series, and as such they seem to be the three most keen on pressing the series forward. When fans seen 3DS, BBS, and Coded, they mostly see money grabs or ways to delay the story while the director is busy working on more FF games. I tend to disagree.

While doing a 7th playthrough of the series to date, I realized something that made me grow even more attached to these so called ""Pointless"" games. KH1 was vague. Now some of you may be asking ""Kadelylath, what do you mean by that?"" Well sit down for a moment and let's look at the series as a whole and compare the spin off games to the main three titles, and see what games fill in what details, and in the end, we can come to our opinions and share in the comments what you think I missed or perhaps why you feel I am wrong.


Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days.

This game gets a lot of flack for ""Not bringing anything new"" and ""Not pushing the story in any forward direction."" and most importantly ""You want me to buy another console to continue the series?!"" While I agree that they really need to stop putting these games out each on a separate console, The first two may well be wrong. When we boot up KH2, we are left in the shoes of a character named Roxas, who we later find out is Sora's Nobody from his time as a Heartless. I'm going to skip the first 5 days of the tutorial because it is just that, tiny bits of story with a lot of learning. But the sixth day is different. As we walk through Roxas' shoes, we learn little about who he really is, and KH2 would leave us with that. The moment when he stands before Sora and realizes it is over for him means little because this is a character we only knew for two hours. 358 changes that. We learn more about the Organization, Roxas, and Axel in 358 than we do in any other game and while this may not seem like a big deal, it adds to the emotional and lesser known plots of the game. Xion is introduced in that game and brought tears to my eyes as we lost her. Roxas' ending in KH2 begins to take meaning. Axel goes from witty side character with no real meaning to a fully understood anti hero. This game adds more to KH2 more than KH2 does sometimes!


Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep

This game is well known for being great to I will keep this one fairly short. BBS at first looks to be just another delay and side story that fails to tie in with the rest of the series, but in reality, this game is what creates the rest of the series. BBS has one of the most compelling stories, best game play, and most interesting protagonists! Ven, Tera, and Aqua are arguably the best keyblade wielders simply because their story is one that is constantly pressed forward, even when they do not appear in the games. BBS explains where each of the new trio got their keyblades (Even if they do not expressly say it for two of them.) and explains where the villain of the series, xehanort came from. It shows the eternal struggle of light vs dark and expands on the KH universe, all while setting up for KH1. It also explains why Roxas looks nothing like Sora and why Sora would later come to wield the Keyblade that was to be Riku's. This game also explains to us why Organization 13 was even in Castle Oblivion (Searching for Ven's heart.) and the origin of the castle!


Kingdom Hearts: Coded

Okay, I will admit... This game was really bad. But it did have one good point, and seeing as not even someone as long winded as I can draw this out, we will keep it short. This game is really more of a sequel to BBS than any game but takes place after KH2. This game is fairly important in the aspect of Ven's heart. At the very end of this drawn out and rather boring plot, we find out that hidden within the page's of Jimney's Journal, Namine has hidden the location of Ven's heart. While they could have done this far better, at least we know that we will see this expanded upon.


Kingdom Hearts: Dream Drop Distance

This game gets way more flack than it should, in my opinion. 3DS was my third favorite game in the series and the only real fault I see with it was the stupid dream eater minigames. 3DS is seen by some as another money grab and a pointless addition. This is completely wrong. 3DS is a huge leap forward in the series and is a direct set up for KH3. Assuming you're still reading, I will just assume you all know I am going to spoil a -lot- of this game. 3DS showed the Orgaizations true colors and intent, not to gather and open Kingdom Hearts to gain hearts, but instead to give power to the enemy, xehanort. Not only this but to become darkness itself and have 13 little xehanort clones running about! It explains the true clash of the 7 lights and 13 darks. Plus it has a conversation between Roxas and Sora which has always been something I've wanted... Oh and the characters from the best DS game of all time, The World Ends with You. Most people did not like the game play, which is totally within their right, but I found the flow motion to be fun. Story wise, 3DS is a direct sequel to KH2 and a direct set up for KH3. Unnecessary, I think not.


In conclusion (because I've already given you all a wall of text to read) most of these spin off games are not to delay us or simply keep KH fever going, but to fill in the gaps of the games such as explaining the man in the brown cloak from KH1, explaining Roxas, giving beginnings to the series, and setting up for the next game in a way that does for feel rehashed. Every game adds something new to the plot and in my opinion, expands on the universe that is Kingdom Hearts...

I'm amazed at how many people joke about this line without understanding the deeper meaning of it. 

Ice cream is a symbol of the trio's friendship. Axel practically teaches Roxas over time that Ice Cream = Friends. Using that logic, the phrase can be changed to:

""Who else will I be friends with?""

^*cough*Axel*cough*



P.S. Apparently in the translation from Jap to English, they changed the line from ""Let's have ice cream again, the three of us!"" to its current form, so Axel is forgotten in the English version.

SPOILERS,electrikyle,47,7,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/ul6y3/i_wrote_all_this_up_as_a_summary_to_the_entire/,"**Birth By Sleep:**

Old man Xehanort doesn't want to die, so he does research on the heart (spirit, not biological) and discovers how to place himself in a younger body. Keyblade trainers Ventus, Terra, and Aqua go on a journey and pass their abilities to children named Sora, Riku, and Kairi. Old man Xehanort possesses Terra's body but loses his memory and ends up an apprentice of a scientist named Ansem. Ventus's spirit ends up in Sora's heart.

**Kingdom Hearts:**

Sora, Riku, and Kairi are warped on a journey to numerous worlds after the Heartless attack their home (the heartless being a side-effect of Xehanort's old experiments). Riku is tricked by Maleficent, Kairi loses her heart, and Sora ends up transforming himself into a Heartless to restore Kairi's heart (just go with it). They eventually defeat Maleficent and find the man behind the curtain, ""Ansem."" However.. Ansem is ACTUALLY Xehanort's heartless and has just borrowed his former mentor's name. ""Ansem"" is obliterated by the doorway to Kingdom Hearts. On the other side of the door is... King Mickey, who has been missing the entire game. Riku decides to go with him on the other side of the door, while Sora promises to stay behind and protect Kairi.

**Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days (Part 1):**

It turns out, when someone extremely strong-willed is turned into a Heartless, a byproduct is created - A Nobody - and the strongest-willed of them can actually think, walk, talk, and look exactly like their pre-nobody counterparts; only they don't have hearts and therefore can't feel emotions. The strongest Nobodies have a club called Organization XIII, and their mission is to collect hearts for Kingdom Hearts, 
in the hopes that they can reclaim their hearts and be complete again. Their leader is Xemnas (an anagram of Ansem+X), who is the Nobody of Xehanort, who has been residing in Terra's body. Still with me? Their newest member is Roxas, who was created (but not shown) when Sora made himself a Heartless in KH1. The only catch is that Roxas actually looks like Ventus - who has been residing in Sora's heart this entire time (since Birth by Sleep). After Roxas has been with the Organization for 30 days or so, about half of them leave to go to Castle Oblivion

**Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories**

Sora, Goofy, and Donald go on a search for King Mickey and Riku, and end up at Castle Oblivion. While in the castle, Sora's memory is rewritten by Kairi's Nobody, Namine, who is being used as a pawn by the Organization. One by one, the members in the castle are defeated, except for Axel (who is Roxas's best friend). Sora finally meets Namine, who puts Sora, Donald, and Goofy in sleep-pods where she can reconstruct their memories now that she is free. She does this under the leadership of a bandaged man named DiZ. It takes a year.

**Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days (Part 2):**

Using Sora's memories and Roxas's power, the Organization creates a Replica (read: artificial human or ""puppet"") named Xion to be the ultimate tool in collecting hearts for Kingdom Hearts. It doesn't quite go as planned when Xion gains her own personality through Sora's memories and eventually discovers her origins. She realizes through meeting Riku that unless she is destroyed, Sora will never wake up and gives her life to reunite with him. Roxas, in desperation, fights Riku, who has been submerged in (but not succumbed by) the darkness in his heart. Riku has to give into the darkness to defeat Roxas, but in doing so becomes trapped in the body of ""Ansem"" (the heartless of old man Xehanort from way back when). Roxas is captured and placed in a digitized version of the town where Sora is being kept until Sora is ready to wake up.

**Kingdom Hearts II:**

Roxas awakens in the digital town with no memory of the Organization or who he was. Eventually he finds Sora, they merge, and Sora awakens. Sora finds that a lot has changed since his previous journey, and is attacked by what's left of the Organization. On a quest to find answers, find Riku, and save Kairi, he finally meets King Mickey, who introduces them to Ansem the Wise - the guy who took in the possessed Terra-Xehanort as his apprentice back in Birth By Sleep. Ansem the Wise has been masquerading in bandages as DiZ, and is responsible for helping restore Sora's memory. Sora and the gang discover that by defeating Heatless, they've been helping the Organization in filling Kingdom Hearts - so they defeat the members of Organization XIII one by one. Ansem the Wise decides to destroy what's been created of Kingdom Hearts so far with a special machine and dies in the process. The hearts are released, but Xemnas (the organization leader) isn't ready to give up, so he enters Kingdom Hearts. Sora and Riku follow him there and after defeating him, end up on the Shores of Darkness (think Purgatory). Somehow, a letter from Kairi arrives in a bottle, causing the Door of Light to open and creates a pathway back to their homeworld.

**Kingdom Hearts Re:Coded**

Jiminy Cricket's journal has been corrupted by a virus, which turns out to be a digital version of Namine (somehow writing about her created its own consciousness), and after restoring it all to normal, the gang goes to meet with Yensid (the wizard from Fantasia), who has discovered reason to believe that Terra, Ventus, and Aqua are still rescue-able, but to do so, Sora and Riku will have to become ""true"" Keyblade Masters (which will be the plot of KH3D).

This is pretty much where the story is currently. Ansem the Wise and Aqua (from BBS) are still trapped on the Shores of Darkness, the Nobodies and Heartless are still pretty much running rampant. Ventus is living in Sora's heart, and Terra is/was possessed by Xehanort but somehow he's supposed to be rescueable. Reading over all this I think I would have intimidated anyone from ever picking up a KH game - but somehow they all make sense once you start playing them.",,False,self,t5_2s3jo,False,,,True,t3_ul6y3,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/ul6y3/i_wrote_all_this_up_as_a_summary_to_the_entire/,

If you'd like, you can throw in what you hope they add too. I'd like to see the return of the Alice in Wonderland world and the Tarzan world, I always found those ones to be fun.

       I was around 6 when the first KH was released and even though i couldnt buy it my friend Cole did. We obsessed over it I would spend every weekend at his house playing it from friday night to sunday evening . We played the shit out of that game and he became my best friend over it. One day when i came home from his house my parents surprised me with my very own ps2 and copy of KH! I was absolutely ecstatic and so was Cole. He had already beaten it at his house and he loaned me his strategy guide. And oh god did i play that game, hours and hours on end i flipped through the strategy guide  at school and kept detailed notes on every little secret and trick i discovered. I could never beat the final boss though no matter how hard i tried. Cole and I were best friends for years and we repeated the process when the glorious KH2 released. We stomped that game, i mean we must have put at least 150 hours total into it. But one summer he had to move across the country because his dad got a new job. I cried for days my young mind couldnt comprehend life without my favorite adventuring buddy. Then he left and life continued. I havent talked to him since and our years of Kingdom Hearts faded to my memory. But this morning when i was looking under my bed for my other shoe I pulled out a book. It was his strategy guide with the taped binding and dog-eared pages. I opened it up and immediately all our memories surged back to me, spending an entire night trying to kill the stealth-sneak, storming through hollow bastion and kicking Maleficents ass, Trying to flank those fat heartless. All of it came back in one tidal wave of nostalgia. And i cried reddit, I cried like a little bitch. Ive spent all day reading this guide and now i have some buisness to attend to. Im going to go kick Ansem's ass to honor our childhood spent stopping the heartless. Im sorry for all of my shitty grammar and if this is hard to read but i just wanted to share this. And Cole if your out there somewhere in Pennsylvania reading this, I love you man and I will never forget Jafar that was absolutely genius dude.

The only problem is, it won't let you comment on it.  
So Here I am!  

Basically, my story is:  
I was an avid Digimon fan. And on one of the VHS's there was a trailer. (I don't remember if it was the first Tamers VHS, or the first Adventure 02 VHS, I think it was Tamers.) [This was the trailer.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkzI23pzTVo) Now, to (I think was 2003 so...) 6 year old Josh, this was amazing and I really really wanted it.  

But alas, I did not end up getting it, until like 2006. When I found it. So I got Kingdom Hearts 1. Went through it. Saw Kingdom Hearts II was coming out. But decided I liked to play things in chronological order. So I got Chain of Memories, and tried to play through it...but I got stuck on Marluxia. So I never did beat it...And I decided to get Kingdom Hearts II anyway, and it was like $50-$60 at the time!  

And since then I've been keeping up. (Except for DDD, as I can't get a 3DS)

**The KH games in chronological order, story-wise:**


* Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep
* Kingdom Hearts
* Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories/Re: Chain of Memories
* Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days
* Kingdom Hearts II
* Kingdom Hearts Re: Coded
* Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance


**The KH games in order of release:**


* Kingdom Hearts
* Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories (Re:Chain of Memories)
* Kingdom Hearts II
* Kingdom Hearts Coded (non-U.S. phone release)
* Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days
* Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep
* Kingdom Hearts Re:coded
* Kingdom Hearts Dream Drop Distance


If you want to play everything chronologically, look at the first list. If you want to play the games as they were intended to be played, look at list two. Be sure to note that 358/2 Days and Re:coded should be considered side stories, and while the stories are not up to par in importance with the other titles, they are a part of the KH story line and do reveal details that will show up in other games. Chain of Memories is also technically a side story, but it is a necessary one if you want to understand many elements present in Kingdom Hearts II. Also, 358/2 Days intersects with Chain of Memories, as both happen simultaneously (with Days actually starting before and ending *after* Chain of Memories).

1347205752.0,32,self.KingdomHearts,zlsl9,[Discuss] Sora as a Character [Possible Spoilers],fuzzleface,36,4,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/zlsl9/discuss_sora_as_a_character_possible_spoilers/,"SO basically there is something that has been bugging me for a while now, and I thought KH 3DDD would relieve me of it. Sadly to say it hasn't which has irked me slightly. So far in all the KH games, we have seen Sora slowly mature, thought nothing to drastic. His core persona is a trusting, oblivious, strong sense of justice, loving person. Yet in a series where each game further defines what the make up of a person is, including our hearts, body, souls, memories and dreams, I feel that there is one thing that is preventing me from truly loving Sora.

His failures.

I don't think we have seen him have an actual failure, one with large and massive consequences, for him and for his friends. I may be wrong and have overlooked things, but I dont think I have. Sora has battled and saved worlds countless times, but thats a trial he overcomes with a smile on his face and friends by his side. I argue that for Sora to really flesh out what it means to be the best of us, we need to see him tackle the darkness alone. For any of his words to carry weight for me, there needs to be some kind of baggage weighing over his heart. 

it may sound depressing as hell, but in the end it could create a far better character. Before 3DDD came out I thought that it would be the game which Sora would finally fall and realise the repercussions of his actions. The idea I had was that by the half-way point we would find that Sora and Riku had finished the test, with Riku being the master. Sora slightly upset but not willing to give up goes and trains.

Sora then through trying to do good, by then end creates the worst possible mistake. He was the catalyst not for KH but for the revival of the Keyblade War. Think about it where did all the warriors go? Is it safe to assume that they reside within Kingdom Hearts, awaiting THEIR Birth By Sleep? Surely those 3 words don't have to pertain to the main cast, if they carried another, more hidden meaning. It would be easy to manipulate Sora into acting upon it. 

SO essentially Sora ends up trying to do good, but his childish approach to life causes something bad to happen. We are now left with two possible directions, Sora becomes a depressing little arse until the end of KH3, OR Sora follows a Cloud Strife sort of route and finds himself half way through. (I'm talking about the original persona of Strife from VII, not the my life is over nonstop strife of the more recent editions.)

In doing this through whatever plot is thrown, I think Sora will have matured perfectly. While he would still keep his child like enthusiasm, he could then truly back up his beliefs having gone through the experience of the darkness of the persona. You can argue that this is primarily a game for young people, however when KH II came out, the Org was used to amp up the maturity. 

In the end all I'm saying is, and would love to discuss, is Sora as a person. Does he just fill the role of a child like hero, with the rest of the cast making up for the dark side of the world, or should he himself experience it, have the rest of the cast support him, and then really enrich the symbolism this brilliant series has to offer!

While Sora doesn't know it and you don't find out til later, Ansem's first words to you really hold so true throughout this entire series. When thinking of what we knew about the Kingdom Hearts universe when only having Kingdom Hearts 1 in our knowledge pool compared to what it is now is staggering. 

I'm not too sure how for down the line Nomura had the story when the first game was made, but those lines are so perfect to start the series.

While he may be referring to Ansem, SoD's ideologies behind the hearts nature, it still is awesome to think of it in the way that there is so much to the game outside of Kingdom Hearts 1.

In the first game, it was just a simple story between light and dark, nothing more. Now it's so much larger than what we could of ever even imagine it being.

Just wanted to share that in retrospect after watching some old cutscenes. =]",,False,self,t5_2s3jo,False,,,True,t3_zmbjb,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/zmbjb/i_never_really_took_to_heart_what_ansem_seeker_of/,

**STORY**

The story in every KH game has been fairly well done, but he's what I'd like to see integrated:

* Final Fantasy Characters

The last couple games (358/2, and BBS) have greatly lacked in Final Fantasy characters. In KH3 I think it would be awesome to see not only Squall, Areith, and Yuffie, but some new characters. Why not add in Batheir, and Lightening? How about some characters from older games like Terra and Bartz.

**GAMEPLAY**

* A Trio

The thing I loved most about KH1 and KH2 was the trio, Good o'l Sora, Donald, and Goofy. In more recant titles we've seen that a trio (in gameplay at least) has been sorrily missed. However, how the current story has progressed, I believe it would be better to set up a different trio. Sora, Riku and, Kari. Three best friends, and three keyblade masters. This brings me to my next point

* Leveling

I have really enjoyed the leveling systems added the games such as 358/2 and BBS. I would love to see one in KH3, and with the possibility of a trio, that could mean three different level trees.

* The Gummi Ship

The Gummi Ship was one of my favorite parts of KH1 and KH2, it was so much fun to fly through a gate blasting enemies, I really don' t think much needs to be changed about it. Just bring it back please.

**ONLINE**

Putting KH online, allowing us to play with other people, would be a very nice addition

* Multiplayer 

358/2 tried this by allowing you to repeat missions with Organization members, and it was fun, to a point. For a new Multiplayer I suggest having an arena, and a PvP. An arena would allow players to battle challenging monsters together (not a new concept for KH, just integrated with Multiplayer) and PvP would have players duking it out against each other in several different maps.

* Customization

Assuming an Online Multiplayer was added, there would need to be a certain amount of customization for each player. We would each need to have our own abilities and Keyblades based on how we all play. Personally I would enjoy a character customization. Not a huge character creation menu like in Skyrim or Fallout, but something more than changing the color of your armor.

These are all my ideas, that I would want integrated in the next KH game. Everything here is all written in my opinion, but I'd like to see what you guys want in the next Kingdom Hearts title",,False,self,t5_2s3jo,False,,,True,t3_uc6k4,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/uc6k4/what_i_want_in_the_next_kingdom_hearts_game/,

Anyways, I've been following most of the games (I never had a PSP) ever since I finished KH2, and I've noticed that throughout the series, it lost... something.

Now, I still love the games. But am I the only one who feels like all the sequels/prequels have been straying from the true KH style?

Like Re:Coded, it added this whole technological nonsense that took away from the fantasy. And in DDD, that whole monster sidekick bit made me miss Donald and Goofy even more.

Maybe I'm being picky, and maybe I'm just nostalgic. But I definitely miss the ""I'm a kid, I have two friends, and we have a mission."" feel. 

I just hope KH3 brings back the original three, and forgets about trying to revamp the game. I liked KH for KH. Don't try to change it.

EDIT: It seems the popular opinion is that I should definitely try out the PSP games, as they seem to be the best.

As for DDD, I honestly do not like it. At all. That whole sleep system where both Sora and Riku have to complete the same worlds just seems like an attempt to stretch playtime. I felt like they got lazy, and instead of creating more worlds, they just made you play each one twice. I won't even sugar coat it. I hate it.

Re:Coded deserves no opinion.

Days... meh. Cool story, bro.

In the end, looks like I should start shopping around for a cheap PSP and a copy of BBS. ",,False,self,t5_2s3jo,1349334683.0,,Rose1,True,t3_10w9l5,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/10w9l5/my_hopes_for_kh3/,
1344894140.0,29,self.KingdomHearts,y609t,Xehanort's Story (spoilers for everything up to and including Dream Drop Distance),manlycaveman,39,10,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomHearts/comments/y609t/xehanorts_story_spoilers_for_everything_up_to_and/,"In trying to make as much sense of the stuff with Xehanort as possible, I made [this flowchart](http://i.imgur.com/koueO.png) thing with how I believe everything fits together (as far as I can remember of the details revealed so far anyway). It's not really a timeline since Ansem SoD and Xemnas obviously didn't die at the same time and whatnot. 

Just follow the black line at first. The alpha and gamma segments are when Ansem SoD and Xemnas, respectively, were pulled out of their original time and to the future by Young Xehanort. I assume they *must* go back for some reason (and therefore forgetting everything) because we end up killing them in KH1 and KH2. I'm not even going to suggest alternate timelines because fuck that.

So here's what I think is going on:


1. Young Xehanort grows up on Destiny Islands.
2. Young Xehanort meets his future self, who gives him time travel powers and tells him to gather the 13 darknesses.
3. Young Xehanort gathers everyone and brings them to TWTNW in KH3D.
4. Young Xehanort goes back to his original time and forgets everything that happened in the future.
5. Young Xehanort grows up to become the Master Xehanort we've seen in Birth By Sleep.
6. Master Xehanort abandons his body and takes over Terra's.
7. Aqua fights him in Radiant Garden, defeats him, then saves him from the darkness. He has amnesia now.
8. Xehanort becomes Ansem the Wise's apprentice.
9. Ansem tells him to stop his experiments, but he continues anyway.
10. Xehanort willingly gives himself over to the darkness, resulting in a heartless (Ansem, Seeker of Darkness) and a nobody (Xemnas).

**Ansem, Seeker of Darkness**

1. Time-travelling Young Xehanort brings Ansem SoD to the future.
2. Ansem SoD participates in the events of Dream Drop Distance and KH3.
3. Ansem SoD returns to his original timeline for some yet unrevealed reason and forgets what happened in the future.
4. Time-travelling Young Xehanort tells Ansem SoD about their meeting in his past (Ansem's future), and so Ansem SoD travels back to meet with Young Xehanort and give him his mission on Destiny Islands.
5. Ansem, SoD eventually possesses Riku at the start of KH1.
6. Eventually he gets strong enough to take over Riku's body, changing it to look like his original humanized form.
7. Ansem SoD participates in the events of KH1.
8. Ansem, Seeker of Darkness is destroyed at the end of KH1.

**Xemnas, Leader of Organization XIII**

1. Time-travelling Young Xehanort brings Xemnas to the future.
2. Xemnas participates in the events of Dream Drop Distance and KH3.
3. Xemnas returns to his original timeline for some yet unrevealed reason and forgets what happened in the future.
4. Xemnas participates in the events of KH2.
5. Xemnas is destroyed at the end of KH2.

**Xehanort, Reborn**

1. With the current-Ansem SoD and current-Xemnas dead, master Xehanort is reborn. Sidenote: His body was possibly destroyed back when he took over Terra. His (and Terra's?) heartless was destroyed in KH1 as Ansem, Seeker of Darkness and Terra's body was destroyed as Xemnas? Was Terra also reborn somewhere? If he was, did Xehanort take him over again?
2. Reborn Master Xehanort, past-Ansem SoD, and past-Xemnas are all gathered at TWTNW.
3. Dream Drop Distance ends and they go frolic through fields of flowers and whatever else they're going to do in KH3.


I actually believe I may have the Ansem, Seeker of Darkness timeline wrong near the end. Maybe he goes back in time straight from the future to Young Xehanort's first meeting with him and *then* he travels back to his original time (just before KH1) and forgets everything that happened. Then whatever remnants of memories or feelings are leftover lead him to desire Kingdom Hearts, gather the seven princesses, etc.

He then of course sends a piece of his heart into soras to try and make him one of the seekers of darkness. 
(scene changes to inside soras heart)
The piece of Xahanorts heart forms there (perhaps looking like Vanitas) and is laughing at his now inevitable victory. He then stops, realizing he is not alone in this heart, turns around and standing there is Roxas (maybe Ven too if he hasn't already been saved). They then exchange and few lines then begin to fight (it would be cool to play as roxas here I think) Xahanort fights to put and end to the last defences of Soras heart and Roxas fights to protect it.

In the context of Xigbar's comment about being ""half Xehanort,"" this got me thinking, and I started doing a little research.


[Isa: turquoise eyes.](http://i.imgur.com/KyyXh.jpg)

[Saix... yellow eyes.](http://i.imgur.com/tErgy.jpg)

It's a little bit less clear with Braig, since his eyes were [amber to begin with...](http://i.imgur.com/9o0WW.png)

But Xigbar's are definitely (as we were shown in DDD) [yellow.](http://i.imgur.com/USAGd.jpg)

The obvious conclusion is that there is some connection between yellow eyes and Xehanort, but I think it goes deeper than that. What else has yellow eyes...? Heartless. However, due to the recent discovery that Nobodies can have hearts, the definition of a Heartless is also thrown into question. Let's leave that tidbit aside for now. 

Members of the Organization with yellow eyes: Xemnas, Xigbar, Saix. Others that I can think of are Ansem SoD, Vanitas, Master Xehanort, Terra-Xehanort (only the one wearing Terra's clothes created at the end of Birth by Sleep), and Young Xehanort. This could have been planned as far back as the beginning of KHII. Maleficent had yellow eyes in the movie, but not as noticeably in the games, so she's [iffy](http://i.imgur.com/6ZHkj.png).


So anyone with yellow eyes is a potential Darkness. That brings the list up to 8 (maybe 9); still short 5.


It's interesting to note that apprentice-Xehanort, when he is afflicted with amnesia, has brown eyes, as evidenced by [Blank Points](http://i.imgur.com/gWx6Q.png) *and* [the portrait in Radiant Garden.](http://i.imgur.com/Ip0NY.jpg)

In addition, I was under the impression that Ansem the Wise had [yellow eyes](http://i.imgur.com/3HDaz.jpg) and thought perhaps Xehanort had polluted him as well, but in Blank Points, his eyes are more [orange.](http://i.imgur.com/CST9G.png) Master Xehanort's eyes are [very clearly pointed out,](http://i.imgur.com/toPdC.png) and they are not very similar to Ansem's.


This might also lead us in new directions searching for the lights--perhaps Lea, Riku, and Mickey will be excluded because all the lights will have blue eyes? Sora, Kairi, Xion, Namine, Roxas, Ven, Aqua, and Terra (originally) all have blue eyes, but this is one too many. Namine's are different from the rest, though, they're [lighter.](http://i.imgur.com/F1nd0.png)

Was that the real KH? 

Why did Sora need to use the keyblade forged from the heart of the Princesses to get Kairi's Heart out himself? Why couldn't he use his own keyblade to do that?

When he stabbed himself with that keyblade, why didn't Ven's heart return home too?

Why did Mickey have to go away prior to KH1? He already had a keyblade.

Whats the difference between the Lanes Between and the Corridors of Darkness? Or are they just different names for the same thing?

If Roxas is Sora's body, why does Roxas continue to exist after Sora is re-formed? 

When Terra-Xehanort aka Ansem, Seeker of Darkness, cast off his body and became a heartless, what happened to the body? It became Xemnas right? What happened to Terra's heart, which should have still been residing in the body? Shouldn't Terra have regained control of himself at that point?

Why does killing Ansem at the end of KH1 restore the worlds?

The worlds that Sora visted in DDD were worlds that were consumed by heartless at one point but have since been restored due to Sora's efforts - Why then do you visit Traverse Town and The Mysterious Tower? Those worlds were never consumed. 

Why does the door to kingdom hearts lead to the world of darkness? How does Riku end up there?

Was that even the real kingdom hearts? What is Kingdom Hearts? 

Why did Ven go to Sora's heart after the battle with Vanitas in his mind? Since he became whole, shoudn't he just go back to normal? Why the displacement?

When Young Xehanort was collecting the various iterations of himself from different points in time, where was he getting them from? Did they know of the plan before he came to them? For example, we see Heartless Ansem there, and he only existed in that form for a relatively short period of time - did he swing by between Riku getting consumed by darkness and Sora showing up to defeat him?

Also in DDD, how did Xemnas get revived?

When they were visiting worlds in DDD, were they physically visiting the world, or did they go to sleep and visit the world in their dreams or what? It was never quite clear what they were actually doing here. 

If Xehanort didn't lose his memory after the fight with Aqua in BBS, why did he go through the effort of studying the heartless and writing his reports as if he had just discovered them? If he didn't remember, how did he know to plan for the temporal reunion and the forging of the X Blade?

How did DiZ end up in the World of Darkness after his death? I thought he exploded.

Roxas, the Nobody of a keyblade wielder was able to use keyblades. Why wasn't Xemnas able to? The whole point of recruiting him was to use him to harvest hearts, seems like a waste of effort if Xemnas could have done it himself. 

Why did Roxas and Naminé have to merge with Sora and Kairi? What purpose did that serve? They were already their own beings with their own existences (And apparently their own hearts too), and Sora and Kairi weren't exactly lacking in the body department.

So I think I've thought of a great way for it to start, let me know what you think (yes, I was really bored haha)! I tried to give it enough detail, but there are a few parts that are kinda general. So if this were to ever be a real thing, obviously there would be more cut-scenes and more gameplay segments.
And in mind, I didn't really think about how the rest of the plot would go; I only thought about the intro.


--After showing a new CGI introduction, which summarizes all of the previous games, we're shown a scene at Mysterious Tower. Riku is explaining his encounter with Ansem the Wise in Sora's dreams to Yen Sid and Mickey. He then mentions that he had fought a boy coated in armor, and asks them who that could've been. Their eyes widen, and Yen Sid says ""Riku, I believe Sora was not the only one you had awaken from a deep sleep...""

--We're then brought to Castle Oblivion, and we see Ventus asleep in the chair. He gives a faint smile (just like at the end of 3DS), and slowly, his eyes open. After looking around for a minute, he realizes he has no memories. Ventus then gets out of the chair, and starts walking towards a door. Once on the other side of the door, the door vanishes and we see that he is standing in the same room where Sora had fought Marluxia.

--As he aimlessly wanders the 13th floor, he's approached by a man in a black cloak.
""Well isn't this a nice surprise. They told me that the room you've been asleep in has been impossible to find; glad to see you've saved me the trouble of looking for it"".
Ventus, with a confused expression on his face, says nothing.
""Yeah...they also told me that you'd need help getting your memories back, too. Pathetic. Alright, come with me.""
The two then walk towards the staircase leading to the 12th floor.
""In order to retrieve all of your memories, you must make your way through this Castle. With each floor you travel down to, you'll regain more of your lost memories. Got it?"".
The man then pushes Ventus towards the stairs.

--*12th floor:*
Ventus is suddenly in Twilight Town, and is approached by a bald old man, who introduces himself as Xehanort. He starts to ask Ventus if he's ever wondered about what lies beyond this world. Xehanort then summons his Keyblade, and begins to explain to Ventus what a Keyblade is and how he could use it to travel to many different worlds. He then offers to make Ventus his pupil.
Ventus is then standing in the middle of a desert, and Master Xehanort begins to summon Heartless for him to fight. This acts as the first tutorial. After defeating the Heartless, Master Xehanort tells Ventus that he sees great promise in him.

Ventus is then back in Castle Oblivion, and sees the man in the black cloak leaning against the wall.
""So you've remembered how to summon a Keyblade. Well congratulations...now keep going, we don't have much time"".

--*11th floor:*
Ventus and Master Xehanort are seen sitting in the mansion in Twilight Town. Xehanort is teaching Ventus about the darkness within everyone's hearts, and that in order to gain true power, one must accept the darkness.
Ventus is then back in the desert with Master Xehanort, only this time he is surrounded by a few Neoshadows. This acts as the next tutorial, teaching you more advanced combat techniques. More and more Heartless begin to appear, [which leads into a remastered version of this cut-scene.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOK2BeHVhTU)
We're then shown Master Xehanort carrying Ventus's unconscious body through Destiny Island, [which leads into a remastered version of this cut-scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yXeqAa3O_Y)

Back to Castle Oblivion...
""Master Xehanort....why would he do that to me?""
""Because you're weak. You weren't strong enough to handle your darkness, so you were no longer of any use to him. He abandoned you on that island to let you die in peace. Funny, if you had only accepted the darkness in your heart, things right now would be a whole lot different.""
""W-What does that mean?""
""Never mind that. Now make your way to the 10th floor, I haven't got all night.""
""Wait...who was the boy that saved me that night?""
""You'll find out soon enough. Now, get going!""

--*10th floor:*
Master Xehanort is seen walking Ventus through the Land of Departure, [which leads into a remastered version of this cut-scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGn1fD_yyVg)
Time goes by, and Ventus soon becomes great friends with Terra and Aqua. They train him in their combat techniques (which becomes a tutorial for more advanced commands and Flowmotion).
We're then shown a rapid succession of scenes from Birth By Sleep.

Before Ventus appears back in Castle Oblivion, we're shown the cloaked man talking with another man wearing the same cloak.
“So how's he doin'?”
“Fine. What are you doing here? Don't you have your own work to be doing?”
“As if, things have been pretty slow for awhile. We're just sitting around, waiting for the storm to start....So, where'd you find him? Our old crew searched this place for days and couldn't find a trace of him.”
“Your old 'crew' was also filled with weaklings, rebels, and morons.”
“HA! Can't argue with that!”
“...I found him just walking around the Castle, like a confused child.”
Suddenly, Ventus runs down the stair-case, and starts sprinting towards the next one, anxious to find out what happened to his friends”.
“I guess that's my cue to go.”
The other cloaked man then summons a Dark Corridor, and leaves the Castle.

--*9th floor:*
More flash-backs to BBS are shown, leading up to when Terra fights Master Eraquas in order to protect Ventus.

--*8th floor:*
We're shown more rapid-successions of scenes from Birth By Sleep, leading up to when Terra was consumed by Master Xehanort, and Mickey appeared to help Aqua and Ventus. This leads to a mini boss-fight against Vanitas (though it's much easier than in BBS).
The last few scenes of BBS are then shown, ending with young Sora opening up his heart to Ventus's.

In Castle Oblivion...
“I...I remember everything! Terra...Aqua...I have to find them!”
“Ha! It's been over 10 years since that battle in the desert. Your friends are long-gone; they just dropped your worthless body off in this Castle, and never came back.”
“Shut up! Terra and Aqua would never forget about me! Even if Terra lost his memory to the darkness, his light will help him remember!”
“You really are naive. I can guarantee you that the Terra you once knew is never coming back. And as for the other one, she just disappeared.”
“So then...now what do I do?”
“Continue regaining the rest of your memories. You say that you “remember everything”, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. There's a whole another person on the other side of your heart...”
“W-What do you-”
“Just keep going”.

--*7th floor:*
This floor is just a rapid-succession of scenes from Kingdom Hearts.

--*6th floor:*
More flash-backs of Kingdom Hearts, leading up to when Sora stabs himself with the Keyblade.

Back at the Castle...
“Sora...that was the boy who saved me, twice. My heart was living within him for all those years...”
“And then he went and stabbed himself with that Keyblade. When he did that, your weak little heart was released, and joined itself with his unused body. Your real body was still asleep in the Castle, but your heart continued to live. But as usual, you had no memory of your true self. So...now it's time for you to learn what your heart has been up to for the last year and a half.”

--*5th floor:*
Ventus is standing outside of the mansion in Twilight Town, and is approached by a man in a black cloak. The man (Xemnas) calls Ventus “Roxas”. He then brings him to The World That Never Was, making him the 13th member of Organization 13.

--*4th floor:*
Scenes of Ventus/Roxas interacting with all of the members of Organization 13 (Xion isn't mentioned), and making friends with a guy named Axel.

--*3rd floor:*
Ventus/Roxas begins to question who he is, and decides to leave the Organization. We watch him fight Saix, followed by the scene of Ventus/Roxas fighting Riku.

--*2nd floor:*
We see DiZ and Riku putting Ventus/Roxas in the Virtual Twilight Town, and see glimpses of his “life” in it, leading up to when he's rejoined with Sora.

Back in Castle Oblivion...
“And there you have it...the life of Ventus. How sad; you've had two different lives, and yet you managed to lose everyone that's close to you in both of them!”
“Alright, I've had enough! *summons keyblade* Just who are you!?”
“Hahaha, so you really don't recognize me!?”
The cloaked man removes his hood, and reveals himself to be Vanitas.
“W-What!? That's impossible! How are you here!?” *backs away slowly*
“Don't think too much about it, your little brain wouldn't even be able to comprehend our plan. Now, come with me.”
“....Why should I listen to you? I don't need to be afraid anymore. If my memories are right, I defeated you before...and I can do it again!” *Ventus runs at Vanitas, starting a boss-fight.*

--After the fight...
*laughing manically* “Very good, Ventus. You'll make a great Guardian of the Light. Now get of here, the war is just upon us.” *Vanitas summons a Dark Corridor, and leaves the Castle*

“There's gonna be a...war?”

--Ventus then walks out of Castle Oblivion and makes his way down the long road. Once at The Crossroads, he stops and looks up at the night sky.

I will be able to access Youtube to show off one song from any games in the series. So, that brings me to my query: What song, out of all the games in the series, do you guys think encapsules the story and most importantly, the mood of all the games adequately? If it helps to narrow your decisions, try to pick ones that have the full orchestra in the background, as that will be the most relevant to the class. Thanks in advance for your input!

**Update**: Thanks for all the input!!! You guys were all very helpful! I ended up presenting Fantasia alla Marcia, the class was very receptive to it and most of them had played a game in the series anyway, so they were all at least familiar with some of the musical themes. The most amazing part was something I already knew and felt: the music in this series is something special, it hits people on a very emotional and personal level, whether it be happy or sad. It was definitely something special to see that glimmer in peoples eyes as we all relived memories of playing this game. Thanks again for all your input!

It's been mentioned in multiple games, but we still don't have an answer. Let's look at the facts:

* In BBS, after meeting Ventus, Isa &amp; Lea both stare up at the Hollow Bastion castle. Lea asks Isa ""Are you ready?"", Isa says ""Well, I can tell you are"", and Lea, with a big smile, says ""Yeah."" The two of them then walk towards the castle.
* During the BBS credits, we see Dilan throwing Isa &amp; Lea out of the castle.
* We know that when a person's Heartless &amp; Nobody are defeated, their human-form is returned to the place where they turned. Which means, Lea &amp; Isa were turned into Heartless/Nobodies in Hollow Bastion. It's also worth noting that before Lea became a Nobody, he was already wearing an Organization Cloak.
* In Chain of Memories, Lea (now Axel) kills Zexion and Vexen as ordered from Saix. It seems like it was done simply to give Saix a higher rank, but in a Secret Report from 358/2 Days, Axel says *""Vexen was caught in the middle. Pitiable, but unavoidable. I could not risk his Program falling into their hands. Of greater concern are the traitors. Not the obvious turncoats, but the ones who will get in his and my way. The Keyblade master is not our enemy.""* So it seems like there's more to it than that.
* In 358/2 Days, Axel &amp; Saix's friendship starts becoming strained. At one point, they have a cryptic conversation about friendship &amp; the Organization's plans. Saix ends the conversation by saying ""There's simply too much on the line, Lea.""
* A Secret Report written by Saix: *""I doubt Axel would be among those lost [in Castle Oblivion], but I must plan for the worst. First, I must locate the Keyblade master.""*
* A Secret Report written by Axel: *""I've lost track of the Keyblade master and the other intruders. I'm the only one left in the castle. Everybody else has been destroyed. My orders were to end the traitors, but I think by this point, I fit that bill better than anybody. There's one last thing I need to look into while I'm here...""* That ""last thing"" was most likely him searching the Castle for Ventus. But it's worth noting that he already considered himself a traitor at this point.
* A Secret Report from Xigbar: *""Saïx had a hand in what went down at Castle Oblivion - well, more like a whole arm. Which means Axel was in on it as well. It's a fact that Xemnas ordered Axel to take out the traitors, orders which went through Saïx. No specific names were given, but naturally Xemnas knew who the turncoats were right from the get-go.""*
* A Secret Report from Axel: *""I feel like I've been spending more time talking to Roxas and Xion lately than my old friend, Saïx. This has to have been what it was like, friendship.""*
* A Secret Report from Axel: *""I ought to be able to share all this with Saïx, but I just don't feel like it anymore. It's strange, but I'm content with just missing what's gone. I'm not the one who changed. You did.""*
* A Secret Report from Saix: *""Our plans never accounted for the possibility of both Xion and Roxas leaving. How did this come to pass? When did Roxas grow strong enough to outmuscle me? What were you really after, Lea? We joined the Organization at the same time, and formulated our plan. At this point, it's just and idle fantasy. Everything changed. You, and me.""*

A while back, I read that the Nomura wanted one Kingdom Hearts game per year. Amusing that they stick to this, we can most likely assume that this year will be 1.5, 2014 will be 2.5, and 2015 will be Kingdom Hearts 3... But what if Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out later? That means that we could have another game before the release of Kingdom Hearts 3, most likely made by the same team that made BBS and DDD. Now, this is most likely me just being hopeful, but, if Square does stick to their plan, we can expect another game. What do you think it could be? Dissidia: Kingdom Hearts? BBS Vol. 2? A party game? [Kingdom Karts?](http://media.gamerevolution.com/images/misc/kingdom-karts.jpg)

Oh yeah, and the 3 of them are supposed to have ""Keyblader Wisdom"" and be knowledgable in the ways of light and dark, but Terra and Ventus are the slowest people I've ever seen, here's an average conversation for Terra,

Obviously Evil Person: ""Hey Terra, you should totally be a giant dick, that won't make you evil at all.""

Terra: ""Eh, I can probably trust you and not my friends.""

Obviously Evil Person: ""Muah ha ha HA""

Terra: ""You smell nice.""


Meanwhile, Sora's cleaning up these dumbasses mess, and Yensid is like, [""Yeah bro, I know you've saved every world from here to Christmas Town like 8 times, but you havn't been super-specially trained, sooooo you're gonna have to start all over. KTHXBAI""](/spoiler)

And Sora's probably like, ""Um, listen HERE motherfucker, I can control 2 Keyblades WITH MY GODDAMN MIND, so I think I've grasped the concept of using a Keyblade a little. so unless your'e gonna get off your old ass and save a world anytime soon, I'll save the worlds with the Gummi Ship shoved up my ass if I really want to!""

parent's get really pissed at me when I bring this up at children's parties.
