In a year when the Texans were expected and widely predicted to run away with the AFC South, the Colts have pushed for the title all year. Even as the final three weeks of the regular season are upon us, the crown of AFC Champ is still up for grabs.

I'm from Western Australia, a large mining, oil and gas State in Australia. After seeing so many American's come on over to /r/afl and watch Australian Rules Football this year, I decided to do the same and start following NFL for this season.

Here is a obligatory photo of a snake eating a goanna at the Cloudbreak mine in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, where I'm based at: http://i.imgur.com/DiFLbs9.jpg :)

I [created a post](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1jxv1p/hi_im_an_aussie_trying_to_get_into_nfl_is_there_a/) asking for recommendations on a team to follow, and after looking up what the US counterpart city would be for my home town: Houston is a likely fit. So here I am! A new Texans fan.

I was wondering if maybe you lads could fill me in on the team, and perhaps an NFL 101 on the sport. Also, does anybody know how I could regularly watch the game out here in Aus? Any Australian Texans fans?

Cheers!

Threads just full of angry fans, blaming all the wrong people for losing. Is this what we can expect every time we lose a game? Apparently Kubiak is the worst play caller ever, Schaub is a bad Quarterback, and we are the worst 12-3 team ever. Manage your expectations, people. I dealt with this shitter of a team for 10 fucking years, and in its best year yet, we apparently are only capable of losing three games. That's it, forget the wins, and forget the stats that make Kubiak one of the best offensive coaches in the league, we are just a 3-loss team. Chill out, no front office move will make this team any better, I promise you.

Also, we are now being dickish fans. It is very unsportsmanlike to not give credit to the other team when they best us. The Vikings held us to fewer rush yards than any other team this year. They had their best defensive game, but you all are just dying to call it Kubiak's worst. Get over it, even if it was our worst yet, you all neglect to acknowledge that the reason it looks so bad is because we are use to consistent success from Kubiaks offense. You think the Bears or Steelers balk when they only put up six points? We are all spoiled brats, and I can't stand the way we're acting when we lose. Remember how annoying it was hearing a Pats fan bitch about his team when the Texans had 4 wins? Yeah, try your own medicine Houston. Try telling anyone from San Diego or New York that our coach sucks, and get a little perspective.

Sorry for the rant, but I really can't stand the negativity. I love this team, but I'm having a hard time with some of our new fans, that were obviously not there when we *did* actually suck.",,False,self,t5_2s450,False,,,True,t3_15h0yl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Texans/comments/15h0yl/entitled_fan_syndrome/,

My grandparents live in Columbia Lakes TX and are die hard Texans, so if I had to choose an NFL team it would be the Texans. But coming from a small college town, I've never really cared about the NFL. That is certainly going to change after y'all's first draft pick. Now i'm on the path to being a die hard, and will be ordering a #10 jersey asap.

The reason I am here is quite simple, to follow one of my best friends on his amazing journey.  I have gone to school with DeAndre Hopkins since 3rd grade and we've, played baseball, football, basketball, soccer, etc.  DeAndre and I have remained friends throughout college at Clemson University, and this entire town, in just a couple of days, has become Texans.  Nuk was a child prodigy in Clemson. Ever since he was in 6th grade, the whole town knew he would eventually end up in either the NBA or NFL. NBA actually seemed more likely, and he didn't even play football his freshman year of highschool to stay in basketball shape.  He got back on the gridiron his sophmore year and in his first year of high school football broke the state record for interceptions. 

There is really one thing you all need to know about ""Nuk"", he might not be the most gifted athlete on the field, but he is always the best player. He will go up against any guy bigger, faster, and stronger than him, but Nuk will come down with the ball, smile and trot back to the huddle. He has a winners mentality, knows he is the best, and acts like in on the field. 

Just a few tips, his nickname is ""Nuk"" because when he was a baby he would destroy ""nuk pacifiers"" and it just stuck. Whenever he had a big play, the stadium would just roar with ""nuuuuuuuuuuuk"", i hope to hear that on the TV next sunday! 

Basically, the whole point of this post is to try and let you all know, you got one hell of a football player, but more than that, one hell of a dude.

From the Windy City, I come BEARing praises of your city and your team. So lend me a moment of your time and your wandering eyes. 

The Houston Football Texans have thrashed my Chicago Football Bears, and through my regret filled tears I've come to profess my love of Arian Foster. OH! What a magnificent man is he! Standing at six foot one, at a massive two-hundred and twenty nine pounds (wikipedia), he is all man. While watching him and his beautiful red bow-tie, my girlfriend orgasm'd. 

Arian Foster is not only handsome, but smart. A man of his caliber understands the Chinese philosophical tenent of wei wu wei or effortless doing. He proves his genius by effortlessly running through the many warriors of the National Football League. This ""Aquarian"" is not only a bearer of knowledge, but also a proficient bearer of the football. 

If I could, I would seek him out in the land of the Houston Football Texans and ask him of his ways. I would ask, ""Arian Foster, how do you find those gaps so efficiently? "" or "" Arian Foster, how do tap into nirvana and find that ridiculous top notch speed? "" or "" Arian Foster, my girlfriend now longs for you, how do I even come close to satisfying her now? "" 

Arian Foster, you marvelous scholar gentleman athlete you. You proved to be a truely exceptional player 96 yards per game, 4 yards per carry, and 10 touchdowns on the year. I could only see you skyrocketing from this point on. I agree with Brian Urlacher, you are truly a badass. 
Namaste, Arian Foster, Namaste.

As a Dutch Texans fan I had searched through all the Dutch TV companies to find that single company who aired NFL games. After some thorough researched I found the ESPN channel for Europe (ESPN America) and took a subscription. After a while I realised that ESPN is in love with that other Texas team and the birds from Philadelphia and doesn't air Texans games live and doesn't air them re-live until Tuesday.

So I was back to square one and week 4. So I searched Google and found this gem of a subreddit and found my way to some 'less then legal' online-streams. So I watched a couple of games this way, trying to figure out if the guy who caught the ball was Andre Johnson or Jacoby Jones, if the guy lined up in the slot was Daniel Owens or Kevin Walter and wondering if my Spanish skill were improving thanks to the online-streams from Fox Espanol. I got sick of it by week 8.

I needed something better. So I decided to pull out my wallet again and get NFL Gamepass, an online service that lets you watch all games in HD via the internet. Best hundred Euro I ever spend. 

Fast forward to last Sunday 7PM (that's when the game starts for me). So I was all set to watch Texans history. First half was bad. I was really getting anxius. Second half gets underway, still not pretty. Beginning of the Third Quarter, Barwin forces a fumble an Reeds recovers. ROAAR! I was getting up again! The game goes on, Texans start to dominate but I see the clock winding down. Now I'm getting nervous. 2:33, no time-outs and Yates pulls out that superb drive. And then that TD-pass to Walter. ROOOOAAAAAR! I must have yelled all kind of things for quite a bit because my voice is a bit hoarse. I didn't care it was past 10 PM on a Sunday. I didn't care no one around here knows what 'American Hand-Egg' is. I didn't care I was probably the only person in a thousand mile radius who watched that game. All I knew was that the Texans won!

Now, I probably have to explain to my neighbours that this might happen again in the following weeks and through January and that it might occur at an even later hour due to the time difference. But it was and will be worth it.

Lets hope I can roar a few more time.",,False,self,t5_2s450,True,,texans,True,t3_n9kqd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Texans/comments/n9kqd/a_big_roar_from_across_the_pond/,

Simply put, if i was able to call every run play in the first half before it happened, of course the Patriots could as well. 

I mean, come on. running it on 2nd and 10 up the middle on several consecutive drives? That's major bullshit. We all know he's ran 3rd and long draw run plays all fucking season long and they never fucking work, because our run game is a pile of shit this year.

Kubiak failed to prepare the team, he failed to make the proper adjustments, and he failed to abandon the game plan after it was useless.

**It's not time to fire Kubiak...** Yet. 

I'm of the firm belief that Kubiak is the reason we're where were at right now as a franchise. Regardless of what he does *in game*, Kubiak is majorly responsible for the talent the Texans have assembled.

What i'm saying is that **Bob McNair needs to light a fire under Kubiak's ass**. This is one of those moments where McNair should pull Kubiak aside in private and explain perfectly clear why it's time to adjust his offensive philosophy to fit the team, and stop forcing the players to fit his game plan.

Wade makes his living adjusting his defense to the skills of his players, and it works fantastic. The defense was able to adjust today, it gave us opportunity to get back into the game. four consecutive opportunities.

 Kubiak needs to do the same as well. it's time to switch from setting up the play action off the run, to setting up the run off the pass.

take a moment and ask yourself:

What the fuck is going to happen after the playoffs, and Wade Phillips is signed to HC another team? we're fucked again, that's what.

This year, we have the player talent to beat **anyone, anywhere**, but for some reason in the big games, we're out coached by miles. That doesn't make me very confident for the post season.

I haven't drank it in a couple years, but i'm drinking it again: I'm drinking that Kubiak haterade and serving ketchup with his harshbrowns.


 For fucks sake, we have talent out the ass, blowouts like this shouldn't be happening. Can someone explain to me what other explanation there could be?

1352307454.0,37,self.Texans,12sz4c,The Green Bay Packers Guide to Beating the Bears,corduroyblack,53,16,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/Texans/comments/12sz4c/the_green_bay_packers_guide_to_beating_the_bears/,"Having watched every Bears game for the last several seasons, and being a fan of a team that has soundly beaten the Bears in 8 of the last 10 games, I offer the following thoughts regarding the Texans upcoming game with the Chicago Bears. Game planning against the Bears is not spectacularly difficult if the opposing team has the players needed. Houston obviously has the players needed to soundly beat the Bears.

**1. Rattle Jay Cutler Early**: I have no doubt that the Texans will be able to do this. Cutler is a talented and elite-capable QB, but he withers under pressure. When playing from behind, Cutler has not established himself as capable of leading the Bears's offense through the air. **In the last 41 games played, Cutler has only thrown for 300 yards on 4 occassions**. If the Bears fall behind, it's doubtful Cutler can dig them out. Cutler has a penchant for getting frustrated from sacks and throwing INTs as well. He simply doesn't have the game maturity to throw the ball away if he can't get the ball to where he wants it to go. The Bears can counter this by giving him options to dumping off passes if his first reads are not open. Watch for screens to Matt Forte and Michael Bush. Forte is the #2 receiver on the team (a distant second to Brandon Marshall).

**2.  Take away Brandon Marshall as an Option**: Jay Cutler relies on Brandon Marshall to an extreme amount. Cutler's targeting of Marshall is greater than his targeting of all other WRs and TEs *combined*. Games that the Bears won by the largest margin of victory (+15 points) were all games in which Marshall had over 7 catches and +100 yards. The Bears's one loss to the Packers? Marshall had 2 catches for 24 yards and Cutler was sacked 7 times. In watching that game, it was obvious that **Cutler was holding onto the ball for way too long and looking for Marshall.** Clay Matthews had 3.5 sacks, all of which were not 2 second sacks (getting to QB unabated). Most of the 7 sacks occurred on multiple step drops or shotgun formations after 3.5 secs.

**3. Use power running to tire the Bears defense and rack up first downs**: There's no beating around the bush. The Bears have a great defense. But that being said, they are relatively old and do not have the stamina to sustain themselves on long drives. For example, in games where the Bears have given up more than 12 first downs and have not had 5 takeaways (this occurred in Andrew Luck's first NFL start and Tony Romo's awful INT performance), the games have been extremely close.  Those games excluded, the Packers, Lions and Panthers all had close games with the Bears. 

**4. Don't Turn the Ball Over.** The Bears offense needs all the help it can get. The Bears have forced at least 2 TOs in every game this year. When there have been 2 TOs or less, the Bears lost once (Packers), eked out another victory (Panthers), and barely beat a weak offensive opponent (Rams). Charles Tillman is the main threat here. His tackling is designed to knock out fumbles. This can be effectively countered by power running directly at him. He is successful because RBs and WRs are attempting to avoid tackling. Don't bother with that. Pounding Arian Foster directly into Tillman's face could well lead to broken tackles and a frustated Bears defense. **You can't be afraid of him**, as that response plays directly into his strategy to go for fumble recoveries. If the Texans don't turn the ball over and can get first downs, I don't see any way they don't win the ball game.

**TL;DR:**

**1. Sack Jay Cutler**

**2.  Cover Brandon Marshall**

**3. Run the Ball**

**4. Limit Turnovers**

Every year as a Titans fan, I have to listen to ""this is the Texans year to make the playoff"" and every year I'm kinda rooting for you, because it has not happened yet.

Of course I want the Titans to finish first, but from someone who has unintentionally followed the Texans since day one, simply because I follow the Titans so heavily, CONGRATULATIONS. 

All the adversity of injuries, losing two of your best offensive weapons and your best defensive weapon and somehow managing to win these last couple of weeks. Pulling in the first University of North Carolina quarterback to ever play in the NFL and coming back to beat the Bengals.

Seriously, the Texans earned it this year, and now that you've finally won the division... I hope it never happens again.

If the Titans don't make it to the playoffs, I will be rooting for the Texans all the way... if they do make the playoffs, then I hope you lose in the divisional round.

1369493935.0,29,self.Texans,1f14vi,Warning: Homer alert. All of the following opinions may be influenced in varying degrees by my extreme bias towards the Texans. That said is anyone else ridiculously excited about the Texans 2013 Defense?,C0rnNuttz,35,6,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Texans/comments/1f14vi/warning_homer_alert_all_of_the_following_opinions/,"**Starting D-Line:**  
Earl Mitchell (NT) - In his third year in the league (2012) he split time with Shaun Cody (now injured and still unsigned) but secured the starting spot for the final 3 games of the season. Even with limited playing time he racked up 31 tackles, 19 solo, 3 swatted passes, and a forced fumble.  
Antonio Smith (DT) - Returning for his fourth year as a starter, his performance in 2012: 30 tackles, 22 solo, 7 sacks, and 2 forced fumbles, somehow didn’t get him into the 2012 Prow Bowl despite a 2011 Pro Bowl appearance with less impressive stats. His nickname is the Ninja Assassin. He said he became a ninja by taking an online course but he doesn’t use the full extent of his ninja powers because it wouldn’t be fair to the other players… crazy but in a good way.  
J.J. Watt (DT) – If I need to explain this one you should not be reading this.   
**Starting Linebackers:**  
 Whitney Mercilus (OLB) - The Texans first pick in the 2012 draft, he played mostly on passing downs as a pass rusher. In this limited role he managed to post 25 tackles, 20 solo, 6 sacks and 2 forced fumbles. Also Mercilus (Mercy-less) is a badass name.  
Brooks Reed (OLB) – In his second season he suffered a bit of a sophomore slump (maybe due to an injury costing him 4 games) but still managed to record 27 tackles, 19 solo, 2.5 sacks, 3 passes defended and a forced fumble. His third year should be more reminiscent of his rookie season, hopefully. He also has long, flowing, blond hair like Clay Matthews. And like Clay, that is where he derives his power.  
Darryl Sharpton (ILB) – His recklessness and complete disregard for his body is really exciting to watch. However, the downside of this is a tendency towards injury. In 2012 he posted stats in 7 games and started in 5 and had 28 tackles, 16 solo, 2 passes defended, and an interception.  
Brian Cushing (ILB) – The 2009 Defensive Rookie of the Year, 2010 Pro Bowl Selection, and 2011 Pro Bowl Alternate had his 2012 season cut short by injury in Week 5 (Thanks Jets!). Some of his recent interviews have been hopeful, May 20th: “My return is right around the corner… I can definitely tell you I will be ready for the first game of the season.” And some have been nothing short of frightening (for Texans opponents), April 16th: “There’s gonna be no barrier to hold me back. Been through a lot this year mentally, physically and I think a lot of that pain and aggression will come out. That’s the driving force… and when it’s go time I’m gonna be there.”  
**Starting Secondary:**  
Kareem Jackson (CB) – After an abysmal rookie season in 2010 Jackson has steadily improved and got snubbed for the Pro Bowl in 2012 (see Homer disclaimer above). You may argue with the Pro Bowl snubbing but it’s hard to argue with these numbers: 53 tackles, 47 solo, 16 passes defended, 4 picks, and a TD.  
Jonathan Joseph (CB) – In 14 2012 games Joseph had 57 tackles, 52 solo, 11 passes defended, 2 interceptions and a touchdown which earned him a Pro Bowl selection. His numbers, while good, aren’t mind blowing, but that’s mostly because offensive coordinators and quarterbacks don’t like to throw at him. Texans fans will remember the great Asomugha vs. Joseph free agent debate during the 2011 offseason. Turns out the Texans front office made the right choice (Sorry Eagles).   
Danieal Manning (SS) – Coach Philips likes to use Manning to keep offenses confused and moves him all over the field. In 2012, his third year as a starter he posted 77 tackles, 59 solo, 1 sack, 8 passes defended, 2 interceptions and a touchdown. He has a girl’s name but I think that only fuels his rage.  
Ed Reed (FS) – Hip surgery debacle notwithstanding, Reed will make a good addition to the secondary. He has been elected to the Pro Bowl in 9 of his 11 seasons and is the All-time leader in interception return yardage. The Texans will most likely be looking to him to be an on the field coach and tutor for the younger players in the secondary. Also Tom Brady hates him which is a plus.   
**Non Starters:**  
D.J. Swearinger (FS) – This ball hawking, hitting machine under Wade Philips’ and Ed Reed’s tutelage is a scary addition.  
Bryan Braman and Tim Dobbins (LBs) – Both had decent 2012 seasons as backups and special teams players. Braman was the Special Teams Alternate to the Pro Bowl and is completely nuts. Some of you will remember the solo tackle on a punt return he made helmetless and bleeding in 2011. They will allow Wade to play with the line-up of the linebacking corps. Brooks Reed is learning some ILB in OTAs…  
Ditto for draft picks Sam Montgomery and Trevardo Williams (LBs).  
Shane Lechler (P) – I debated whether to put Lechler in here but he is arguably one of the greatest defensive weapons the Texans will have. In 2012 he averaged 47.2 yards per punt with 21 of 81 inside the 20. So even when Kubiak has overly conservative play calling and Schaub underthrows his receivers or checks to the flat on 3rd and long the defense will still have long fields to work with most of the time.  
**In conclusion:** 6 former Pro Bowlers, minimum 2 future hall of famers (Reed and Lechler) with another 2 or 3 (or more) who have a shot with maintained production (Watt, Cushing, and Joseph); plenty of talent available. 8 returning starters and 8 players entering their third or fourth season with the Texans means it’s a young squad who have had time to gel and absorb Wade’s philosophies. Lots of good draft picks will allow Wade to play with the defensive schemes (Think 3-3-5 with Swearinger playing a Linebacker-Safety hybrid).

Watt and his sudden fame,TTTA,39,10,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Texans/comments/1g7hz5/on_jj_watt_and_his_sudden_fame/,"Watt came through my place of employment recently. I've seen him come through before, and I've talked with him (my job necessitated doing so), even enough that I'm pretty sure he remembers me. But this time the poor man was trying to hide. Hat pulled down low over his eyes, hunched over a bit. Have you ever seen a 6' 5"", 295 lb. man trying to look inconspicuous? It's hilarious. It's like playing hide-and-seek with the 3-year-old who hides their head and leaves the rest of their body out in the open; you can tell they're really trying their best to not be noticed, so you play along anyway just to be nice.

Here is a guy not much older than myself who grew up in a relatively small town in Wisconsin, then over the course of a single year went from a name a few fans might recognize, to a name /r/nfl is circlejerking about and the whole country knows. He can hardly go out for fast food or a drink without being constantly pestered.

So, maybe next time you and your friends see the guy, let the poor man alone. Give him some time to get used to all this.

And no, his license plate is not a JJ WATT vanity plate. At least not on the vehicle he was driving that day.",,False,self,t5_2s450,False,,,True,t3_1g7hz5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Texans/comments/1g7hz5/on_jj_watt_and_his_sudden_fame/,

You have a talented team that isn't going anywhere anytime soon. So kudos on a hard fought season and don't be too discouraged. We'll see you again next year.

No one believed in us and even I found it hard to see how the Jets would pull of that Playoff win. But Rex threw the damn best gameplan he had at Tom Brady by playing coverage and only rushing 3 and 4 guys and showing mainly Nickel and Dime defenses to invite the Patriots to the run game. There were times Tom Brady stood in the pocket for 8 seconds and threw incomplete because the Jets absolutely blanketed all the receivers. One of the greatest Jets games I've ever seen.

Few notes on the draft so far:

+ St Louis has an additional 1st round pick from last year's trade with Washington (the RGIII pick)
+ The Bengals have an additional 2nd round pick from the trade with the Raiders for Carson Palmer
+ The Colts do not have a 2nd round pick (they traded to Dolphins for Vontae Davis)
+ Saints do not have a 2nd round pick (Bontygate forfeiture) 
+ The Jaguars have the #2 overall pick this year.
+ This will be the loweset the Texans have ever drafted before.
+ The Chiefs and the Jaguars will alternate picks each round (Chiefs pick 1st in the 1st round, but pick 2nd in the 2nd round, etc...)

I don't know of anyone who thought we'd be unbeaten at the year's end. We're (at press time) 5-0. We may be 5-1 by the end of the night. 

But this is a _good_ Packer team, despite their record. They came alive tonight, and we could very well see these guys in the Super Bowl. 

This is a great time in the season for a gut-check. Yes, it's a big hole in the middle of the field with Cush gone. Next man up. 

Let's hope Kubes can _adjust_, cause he's never been the best at that.

When and how could we lose?,JohnCHellblazer,32,6,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/Texans/comments/10tky6/now_i_know_how_the_patriots_and_packers_feel_when/,"Probably a little too high on the prospects of an undefeated season but lets look at the schedule

* Jets - Jets are in almost complete disarray.
* Packers - Lost to the Seahawks (Admittedly bad call, but still) and we are playing them at home
* Ravens - Defense has lost a step or two for sure and we get them at home
* Bills - true colors are coming out, and we get them at home after a bye
* Bears - Bears got off last night on MNF but they took advantage of turnovers from Tony Romo.  Schaub is not prone to that at all
* Jaguars - Please
* Lions - Lions are perhaps the most poorly coached team in the NFL
* Titans - Please
* Patriots - Only one that is giving me slight pause.  Will have to see how they are doing in 10 weeks
* Colts - Please
* Vikings - Playing well now but looks like more smoke and mirros
* Colts - Please

At most I see 2 losses on here.  Patriots, maybe Ravens or Packers but those are both at home.  Viking or one of the Colts games if we have homefield wrapped up by then and we are resting players

i do have a couple of concerns though

* Arian Foster - Too many touches so far and whatever the issue is, he is nor running the same as last year.  The line, the plays, the diet, his weight.  Whatever it is, he is not hitting the hole the same and a couple of times Sunday it looked like he was avoiding contact and looking for the sideline.
* Special Teams - Holliday has yet to hit a big one but has made some mental errors.  Shane Graham has been less than impressive
* Running D - We are giving up too much on Run D.  luckily noone has been ahead by enough to try to grind it out, but it looks like it is a possible weakness to exploit.  If anyone would, i would bet on the Bears, Vikings and maybe Packers.

&gt;&gt;from NapoleonBonerparts

&gt;Hi there!

&gt;I am NapoleonBonerparts, a mod of /r/nfl. We're looking to add a pick a team section to our wiki and need your help. The basic idea behind it is a page per team including all the cool stuff about that team in order to lure newbies to the NFL into rooting for them. We were hoping to get your communities input, however, this would be quite the daunting task for all 32 teams. So, we were wondering if you could make a post explaining what we need, join it all together into a finalized product and submit it back to us? From there, we will plug into a premade template and make a page. Here is what we need:

&gt;&gt;Team Description - Current affair of things - Please keep it around 500 characters. Include anything that makes your team and fans special!

&gt;&gt;Top 3 current Players and why - around 200 characters or less per player.

&gt;&gt;Offensive Style - Style, importance to the team, do you favor running or passing, ect.

&gt;&gt;Defensive Style - Style, importance to the team, blitz happy or run stoppers, ect.

&gt;&gt;Division Rivalry and Brief History. Our flame bait rule is still active on these, so no insults to the fanbase or hateful insults against teams in general. Please also rank them from 1 to 3, in order of hatred.

&gt;&gt;Brief History - Again, around 500 characters

&gt;&gt;Retired numbers and who.

&gt;&gt;That just about covers it. Message me back your responses when you are ready. Thank you!

&gt;-NPLN

quick edit: fun thing about the reddit wiki pages: *no character limits!* unlike the nasty lowdown dirty trick of a sidebar that makes us convolve and contrive to restrain our enthusiasm, wikis are swinging free; it's like going from briefs to boxers. I guess we can wait a few days, then put the best stuff together? Whatever you guys vote up is what we'll send over.

Okay ladies and gents, let's get the pick discussion flowing. My personal preference for our first round pick position wise is ILB. I could also see RT or NT depending on who falls. Other areas of need are SS for dime packages, as well as OLB depending on Barwin's contract situation. WR and TE depth are needed as well.

There's no cohesion anymore. It's as if Kubiak has completely lost grip on how his offense operates, and the players have stopped caring.

The defense is playing admirably, but spends far too much time on the field and tires quickly. Nothing they do will make up for the shit fest on offense.

**So what's wrong, if anything, and what does the future hold?**

I just thought of a theory, and for a moment i'm going to have to bring you back to 2010 and before(sorry):

We all know Schaub is a more than competent passer. He fits the scheme well physically. But, we all know that he's susceptible to crumbling under pressure. We know that Kubiak is the same way. he typically makes poor play calls in general, but under stressful situations his game plans break down. I've noticed that if the Texans game plans break down, they generally lose (one recent exception is the JAX game this year).

Back in 2010, the season started pretty well at 4-2. Everything quickly collapsed. The defense was terrible and the offense was incapable of playing from behind or finishing games. There was a ""culture of losing"" mindset about the team, the idea that when things looked bad for even a second, the team would collapse under the pressure. Stuff like throwing a huge interception at the last second in the end zone, or batting a deep ball into the hands of a reciever. you get it.

I had come to a belief that after our historic 2011 season, the Texans had gone over the hump, and grew out of the culture of losing. I thought that with the heroics of TJ Yates and the valiant performance in the playoffs that the team as a whole had grown up.

I think I was wrong. My theory is that, the Offense generally being the same personnel for the last ~4 years, **nothing at all has changed.** the culture is still there. It lives on in Matt Schaub and in Gary Kubiak, and thus, still infects the Offense. The offense is capable of being a destructive machine of running and passing like in 2011/10/09, but is terminally ill.

The difference between 2011/12 and the years before is the defense. The players are wildly different than in 2010 and the scheme is completely new. Paired with a new set of defensive playmakers, a couple we had all along, and a new DC that brings fresh air into our game, It allows us to win just two or three more games a year.

The solution? the offense needs a breath of fresh air. Maybe as ideal as Schaub is to QB this system, it's just not worth it for the weak mental aspects he brings to the team. We need a leader. A vocal, commanding, confident leader. I think signing an extension to Schaub was a huge mistake.

1367033844.0,20,self.Texans,1d75c5,Sam Montgomery: The potential 1st-round talent and why he fell,yellowstonedelicious,27,7,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Texans/comments/1d75c5/sam_montgomery_the_potential_1stround_talent_and/,"**TL;DR: Didn't try against inferior opponents, said giving 100% effort in the NFL will be something he'll have to get adjusted to, made stupid bets with teammates and rationalized them, rubbed teammates and coaches the wrong way. Also, he's apparently very late off the ball.**

[Meet Sam Montgomery](http://i.imgur.com/2svuqZD.jpg) - a [defensive end for LSU](http://imgur.com/6XZFkEm). Sam Montgomery was projected to be [a 1st or 2nd round pick](http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2013/02/23/sam-montgomery-nfl-combine-effort-draft/1941787/) in the 2013 NFL Draft. He played a 4-3 DE in college, but is expected to be a 3-4 OLB in the NFL. However, Sam Montgomery's stock fell dramatically after the combine. 

For one, his coaching staff [did not give him a ringing endorsement.](https://twitter.com/TonyPauline/status/305080914617171968) This is because **Montgomery’s attitude and personality did not sit well with a number of his former teammates or coaches.** [Source](http://www.draftinsider.net/blog/?p=6794)

For another, he had a terrible interview process at the Combine. He **admitted to betting and a lack of effort when facing inferior opponents.** Specifically, he told the media: 

&gt;""You know, some weeks when we didn't have to play the harder teams, there were some times when effort was not needed.""  [1](http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2013/02/23/sam-montgomery-nfl-combine-effort-draft/1941787/) [2](http://www.nola.com/lsu/index.ssf/2013/02/lsus_sam_montgomery_admits_he.html)

He has rationalized why it was okay to do the things he admitted to doing. 

[On betting:](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/02/23/montgomery-admits-bets-with-mingo-lack-of-effort-at-lsu/) 

&gt;“Here’s the thing: Hard work, and betting like that, pushes greatness,” Montgomery said. “That’s actually motivating me and Mingo. It’s not about the money, it’s about pushing us, at the combine and the drills in between. That’s what is pushing us to be the best.

&gt;“It’s always been competitive for me and Mingo and it makes us better in the end. He’s a fast defensive end, I’m more physical. We have to switch over in those realms, so putting big stakes on it makes us more dominant players in the end.”

[On lack of effort:](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/02/23/montgomery-admits-bets-with-mingo-lack-of-effort-at-lsu/)

&gt;“When you are a young, you do things as a boy, but when you grow, you do things as a man,” he said. “From a maturing standpoint, and from everything going into this league that I have learned so far, I was a boy in college, and now that I am going into the league, I’ve become a man.”

[On whether he'll give 100% effort in the NFL](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/02/23/montgomery-admits-bets-with-mingo-lack-of-effort-at-lsu/)

&gt;“Of course, this is a new league, the NFL and there are no small teams, small divisions, it is all Alabamas and LSUs every week. **It’s definitely something I have to get adjusted to**, but I’m sure with the right coaching I will be fine.”

That said, if you're interested in knowing more about his physical talents: Here's [NFL Draft Geek](http://www.nfldraftgeek.com/sammontgomeryscoutingreport.html)  and [Rotoworld](http://www.rotoworld.com/player/cfb/131268/sam-montgomery) and [CBS Sports](http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/players/1679975/sam-montgomery)

Here's his [NFL page](http://www.nfl.com/draft/2013/profiles/sam-montgomery?id=2540149) - a 71.4 rating indicates an 'eventual starter'.

[Cossell noticed one weakness that I've seen in a couple of scouting reports on him](https://twitter.com/gregcosell/status/310551930390847488) 

&gt;One thing that bothered me watching LSU D was how often DE Montgomery was late off the ball. Must be corrected, or he won't be able to play.

I've included the compensatory picks(3rd and 6th round picks) we are likely to receive. My [source](http://bloggingthebeast.com/2013/01/27/2013-nfl-compensatory-pick-projections/).
___________________________________________________________

Round One: [Alec Ogletree](http://draftbreakdown.com/players/alec-ogletree) ILB

Recently mocks have him going in the early twenties as some teams above us desperately need linebackers. If can drop to us it would be amazing to see him play along side Cushing next season. When he signed with Georgia he was a safety but coaches were impressed with his speed and bulk and saw him moved to LB. He has good coverage abilities and can match up against tight ends. He was suspended for the first 4 games of the season due to violating Georgia's controlled substance policy but still ended up leading the team with 111 tackles.

Round 2: Da'Rick Rogers WR

1st round talent that tested positive for drugs in his junior got him suspended indefinitely from Tennessee and transferred to Tennessee Tech. 6-foot-3 and weighing in 206 lbs he has the ability to run deep and play physical. We've been lacking a #2 option for awhile and this year has shown it. Andre racked up 1600 yds but Kevin Walter, WR2, only had 518 yds. Our young crop of receivers had a quiet season as well never stepping and went weeks without catches. When Rogers was a sophmore he was supposed to complement Justin Hunter but Hunter was injured and Rogers stepped up big racking over 1000 yds, had 6 games over 100 yds and earned SEC-All Honors. While his speed and size combo is similar to Julio Jones, his toughness is excellent and absorbed huge collisions while making the grab.

Round 3: [Bacarri Rambo](http://draftbreakdown.com/players/bacarri-rambo) S

Fitting with a last name like Rambo he reminds me of Seattle's hard-hitting talented safeties. Rambo has posted 16 interceptions over his career and seems to have a knack to lower the boom to receivers but he doesn't lower his head so he doesn't draw the flag. His aggressive style has lead to some missed tackles but that can be fixed. Very smart at reading the QB's vision and times his jumps and contact nicely to break up the play. He was the last line of defense for Georgia's stellar defense. A safety like him could eliminate playing times of Demps and Keo.

Round 3(Compensatory Pick): Brennan Williams OT

Before missing the rest of the season due to a torn labrum Williams was projected to be a late first round pick. He helped his team to rush over 2300 yds this season averaging almost 200 yards a game on the ground. He is surprisingly quick on his feet and sets the lane for his running backs to the right. Texans have had a spotty right o-line and struggled to carry Foster over 3.9 ypc for a good majority of the season. Williams could help with that.

Round 4: Kwame Geathers NT

NT for years has been our weakest link in our front 7. Shaun Cody was not the answer to stop running backs and open up holes for our LBs to exploit and was overpowered quickly. A 6-foot-6 355 lbs Geathers could solve that. While overshadowed by John Jenkins, Geathers had a solid year of his own when he was on the field. Having man like Vince Wilfork take 2 players can open up lanes for Watt and LBs to make an impact on the backfield. 

Round 5: Michael Mauti OLB

Too many LBs can never hurt. Mauti ranks 7th in Big 10 in tackles, 4th in interceptions, and 3rd in forced fumbles. His draft stock is low because of questions in durability tearing his ACL twice over his career since high school. He is a smart defender reminding me of DeMeco Ryans. With not too many holes to fill Phillips could take him in as a project and hone his skills.

Round 6: Levine Toilolo TE

Another project that can be very interesting if he pans out. Measuring at 6-foot-8 he was behind a great duo of tight ends at Stanford. This pick is more for potential than for numbers running up only 400 yards. Also he fails to finish his blocks in the run game that could have possibly impacted the loss against Notre Dame.

Round 6(Compensatory Pick): Sam Brenner OG/OT

Texans love to draft project offensive linemen and Brenner fits that definition. At Utah he played both positions so the flexibility is a nice thing. He fits our zone blocking scheme perfectly and can get to the second level and open up some lanes. His work ethic and determination are a plus.

Round 7: Ryan Allen P 

Allen led the nation in punting this season with an average of 48 yds per punt and leads the nation in net punting with a net punting average of 43 yds. He also booted the longest punt this season with an 85-yard kick. Over 44 percent of his punts this season have landed inside the 20 and over 46 percent of his punts have gone over 50 yards. He also became the first player to ever win the Ray Guy Award (nation’s top punter) in back-to-back years. He can serve as replacement for Donnie Jones.

I'm excited, but worried. The Bears present a lot of matchup problems. They're really scared about Watt+co over at /r/CHIBears, but it feels to me like they have every other advantage. 

**With Cushing gone,** our run D has suffered. Forte is capable of running it down our throats.

**JJo has not been in top form** this year. He's had to give up a lot of slants and underneath routes to prevent WRs from burning him on the deep ball. Marshall, as big as he is, will give JJo a lot of problems.

**Penalties are still a problem.** They cost us the GB game, they didn't look much better against Buffalo, and...

**It's a primetime game.** I'm not convinced we've ever played a good primetime game.

**Andre v Tillman** Andre doesn't seem to have that elusive speed he would've needed against a CB like Tillman. If we turn the ball over in the air, the Bears D knows how to score points. 

**Foster and the O-line** are running the ball at barely a 4.0ypc, and it won't come as easy against this Bears D. I'm really mainly worried by what I saw of our run game against the Packers, where Foster ran it at 1.7ypc and this Bears D is better than that D.

Here is our game plan: We will hand it to Adrian Peterson. Stop him if you can.

If you get a decent lead going into the second half, Musgrave will think that he has to pass on all downs and we'll go 3-and-out again and again.

Our kicker, Blair Walsh, was 5/5 for field goals vs. the Rams last Sunday and is 8/8 from 50+ on the season.

Our wide receiver corps is lackluster. We've got ok guys, but nothing great. Our qb, Christian Ponder has been a 'work in progress' for a long time now. Don't worry about the deep passing game.

Prove it! Put it in writing, and go up against your fellow burrito lovers!

***

**The contest**: 

Predict the Texans 2013 NFL Draft Class

**The Prize**: 

Reddit Gold to the Top 5 entries. And Bragging Rights. Possibly a unique Draft Winner Flair next to your username.

***

**The Rules**:

1. Submit your prediction to this thread by **April 24th, 2013 at 11:59p CST**. Entries submitted after this time will not be valid. You are allowed to edit your entry as often as you'd like until this time. At 11:59, We'll be taking a screenshot of the page and using the entries as they are.

2. **The 5 entries with the most points** wins Reddit Gold.

3. Each entry shall consist of the **NAME** of the **first** player the Texans select (No matter the round), worth 10 points, the **POSITION** of the next 2 picks, worth 5 points each and the **SIDE OF THE BALL** of the remaining 6 players (worth 2 points each).

4. Ties will be broken in order of earliest incorrect answer. So if you have the first pick correct and none of the rest, you will still win over someone who has picks 2 and 3 correct and no others, even though they both have 10 points. The same goes for if someone has 1 and 2 correct, they will beat someone who had picks 1 and 3 correct

5. Only submit one entry. If a user is discovered to have submitted multiple entries, you will have your burrito privileges revoked. 

6. Please note that this is picking the players selected in a certain order, and not in which round, so if we trade our 1st round pick for an additional 2nd and 4th round picks, the player selected in the 2nd will still count as the first player selected, no matter the round. Make sense? Good.


***


**The Format**: 

Submit your post in the following format (Make sure you follow this format!):

 1. JJ Watt, Wisconsin, DE (Player Name, School, and Position for the first pick)

 2. Inside Linebacker (position only for the second and third picks)

 3. Offensive Tackle (still position only for the second and third picks)

 4. Defense (side of the ball for all subsequent picks)

 5. Offense

 6. Offense

 7. Defense

 8. Offense

 9. Defense


***

**Additional Notes**: 

* Please make sure you're specific about the position with the first three picks. Offensive Lineman or Defensive Back are not specific enough. Needs to be Offensive Tackle, Offensive Guard, Cornerback, Inside Linebacker, Outside Linebacker, etc. (Abbreviations like OT, C, QB, CB are fine)

* Punters and Kickers are not part of the rules.  If for some reason they take a special teams player, everyone will get that position correct regardless of putting Offense/Defense.

**Rules are subject to change!** *But probably won't unless someone points out a mistake to me*

(complete Texans Players contract info inside),lovetape,22,5,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Texans/comments/16iy3o/schaub_is_signed_through_2016_hes_also_the/,"+ Current 2013 Payroll: $101,151,259
+ Estimated 2013 NFL Salary Cap: $121,000,000
+ Texans will have 'around' $19,848,741 to sign Drafted Rookies and re-sign Free Agents.

***

For anyone who wants Schaub cut:

Short of finding an amazing rookie QB in this years draft, we're going to see Schaub again next year. 

He's owed:

+ $10.75 million in 2013
+ $14.5 million in 2014
+ $17 million in 2015
+ $19 million in 2016
+ Free agent in 2017

If the Texans were to cut Schaub anytime before 2016, they would only owe him any remaining money from his Signing Bonus (which is currently 3.5 million a year). SO if the Texans *were* to get a wild hair up their arse and cut Schaub, they would only owe him 3.5 million **x** however many remaining years he had left on his contract; and yes, this would count against the Texans Salary Cap figure. (that's how the Texans ended up owing DeMeco Ryans $9 million dollars this season - even though they traded him, they still owed him his signing bonus, and it became due within one year instead of being prorated over the life of the contract.).

I will be starting a new game thread, thread? every game day starting today. Ive noticed over the season that a lot of us have similar questions during games regarding streams, times, sidebar bets etc etc. I will do my best to update the thread as the game goes on for injuries and streams I live in Chicago so I always have to stream the games which means I will always be on reddit :D

I know the /r/nfl game thread is awesome and I encourage everyone to join in on the conversation but this thread will contain more Texans pertinent information if that makes any sense.


This thread is going to evolve over time as I learn to format better and get more information throughout the games so I will post a couple hours before game time for stream links. I will eventually set up an IRC or something so we can have game time chats and stuff,

suggestions are always welcome!

Seriously.  I moved to Houston from Lafayette, LA a few years back and was never going to stop being a Saints fan, but I always wanted to see the Texans win (unless they are playing the Saints).  I lucked out and got tickets for the game yesterday.  The only other time I have seen the Saints play an away game was when I was 8 years old we went to Atlanta to see them play the Falcons and some douche poured beer all over my Bobby Hebert jersey then kept throwing stuff (empty beer cups, foam footballs) at me and my parents.  So, i was a little nervous walking in Reliant with my Drew Brees jersey and my fiancee with her Pierre Thomas jersey on and sitting in the Bullpen area.  I was amazed at how genuinely nice Texans fans are.  I had great conversations with the other people around us and loved every second I was there.  Thanks Texans fans for being badasses!

I honestly feel good about all of those matchups, regardless of who we have a QB knowing that Andre will play and Wade will be back.
