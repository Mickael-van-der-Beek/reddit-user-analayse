1365420742.0,114,self.Korean,1bwtkz,[Tip] My advice for Korean beginners/intermediates,prBun,124,10,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/1bwtkz/tip_my_advice_for_korean_beginnersintermediates/,"I’ve been self-studying Korean for about 8 months now. Here are some things I’ve discovered along the way that I wish I’d known sooner. I know this is a long post but if you’re in the first few months of learning, I believe it’s worth a read.

**1. EVERYTHING that I learnt before learning the alphabet was a WASTE OF TIME.**

I started off using Pimsleur’s Korean, an audio tape set that encourages recollection and repetition of set phrases. I also had a romanised phrasebook. Both were useless, I couldn’t tweak any of the sentences to have a slightly different meaning because I didn’t understand how the sentences were formed. I was learning sounds, not understanding them. Seeing the words written in 한글 not only helps you with pronunciation, but also makes understanding the changes words undergo for grammar purposes a lot easier.

**2. I was using Anki poorly and why Memrise will eventually fail you. (tip 3 is about how Anki fucking rocks with the new updates and when you use it properly)**

Any vocabulary I learnt before using Anki and Memrise would naturally be too easy to forget. Nobody else is going to ask you to recall the word for ‘tree’ enough times for it to be nearly impossible to forget. 

Memrise helped me type so much faster in Korean because of the practice and time pressure. The old leaderboards were a huge incentive for me to keep planting new words. The old Anki showed a timer in the bottom right counting up, instead of down like Memrise. The longer I took, the guiltier it would make me feel, and it allowed me to sit there for a long time getting frustrated with my bad memory. There was also a red bar that indicated I was struggling. 

I was refusing to click “again” in Anki because I felt like I should be remembering these words… huge mistake. It meant that words I didn’t even know would then come up less and less frequently.

However, when you have around 1000 words or more planted in Memrise, you leave it for a few days and come back to “300 plants need watering” and the overwhelming number just grows faster than you can shrink it and so you lose motivation to water them at all. Then there are the bugs and issues with Memrise I won’t go in to…

**3. Two Anki tips that will change the way you learn vocabulary**

So I decided to go back to Anki, and the update Anki 2.0 was awesome. No more timer, no more red bar of failure. 

The best thing I did was to mark myself harshly. If you take nothing else from this post, remember that if you couldn’t get a word on Anki: press again. Press again, not just once, but as many times as it takes.

The second best thing I did with Anki was to create my own deck. It’s hard to beat the process of finding a solid definition for the word using Naver or Daum dictionaries, inputting the word and understanding how it used in a sentence before learning it.

**4. Listen to the language, and no you’re not going to understand it.**

I see a lot of tips about how much K-dramas help you learn. There are definitely positives of watching Korean films, variety shows and K-dramas. You can familiarise yourself with the sound of the language. You recognise intonation patterns and learn better pronunciation.

But if you want to use K-dramas as a learning tool, passive watching isn’t enough. 

Whenever a character says something slowly enough that you can break down what they are saying or whenever you read the subtitles and think “Hey, I should know that in Korean” you need to go back and listen to them say it again. Listening a few times to that phrase you might realise that you knew what they were saying, it was just too fast for you. You eventually want (I’m assuming) to be able to understand Korean at a natural pace, so try this out. Next time you hear those words being said, you should be able to understand it without subtitles. 

If you don’t understand a word of it, but want to, go look up the words on an English-to-Korean site. Translate single words at a time using the Naver or Daum dictionaries I briefly mentioned earlier. Try to piece together how the sentence was formed. You’ll be learning how to create Korean sentences and if you want to think and speak as an independent person, this is a great skill to have.

Sorry for taking the fun out of K-dramas haha.

**5. Don’t be afraid to learn GRAMMAR, why are we all so scared of it?**

Hey I know that word! Hang on why have they done that to it? How does that change the nuance?

One thing that makes Korean so difficult is the number of endings that slightly change the intended meaning of a sentence. Recently I’ve copied those endings into Google, added the word “grammar” to them and voilà. For example’ㄹ까 하다 grammar’ brings up a few sites with explanations. Now I understand these phrases each time they come up. 

If you don’t know what I’m talking about, check [this](http://pakgultom.wordpress.com/2011/06/17/ive-compiled-this-list-of-korean-grammar-so-you-dont-have-to/) out 

There’s a list at the bottom of the page, albeit with a few spelling mistakes of grammar points that you can use to advance your Korean without breaking a sweat. Google them, understand when they are used and start using them yourself.

**6. Lang-8. Wow.**

“This free Korean lesson was brought to you by TalkToMeInKorean.com and HaruKorean.com, practice making your own Korean sentences at HaruKorean and get corrections from native speakers.” Is now how every TTMIK lesson starts.

What they don’t tell you is that there is an already well-established website for native corrections, and it’s free.

Lang-8.com functions on L points, meaning the more you help others out by correcting their English (or whatever your native language is), the higher your Korean practice sentences show up to other users. There really is a ‘you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours’ mentality. And often you’ll get a good explanation as to where you went wrong.

Hope this helps. Feel free to discuss your own experiences :)

Also, they have a separate series called ""Real English"" for people learning English. [An example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faEsEeUQInw).",,False,,t5_2rd8q,1374055726.0,,,True,t3_1ih3cg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/1ih3cg/real_korean_by_allyfunshow_a_series_of_youtube/,

As people suggested, the anki deck will not have example sentences but only simple meaning + pronunciation audio. 
I've compared all the words with [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmNSiKPlnDtTdFE2WXd2UFo3OVRkSDdFcTZNdzNqQVE), double checked on naver dict, edited/fixed the file... so it's much better now. Here are the links:

- [anki (no audio)](http://www.mediafire.com/?oosoos5vu1s130g)  

Some notes about the list:  
- Most of the word only have one simple meaning (the most common meaning -  the 1st meaning on naver dict)  
- Some words have 2 meanings, because both meanings are quite common.  
- Words that appear two/three times on the list will all have different meaning (the higher rank of the word on the list, the more common meaning they get; no word is duplicated)  
  
About the anki deck:  
- Audio will be autoplay (on the front cards). You can change the way it plays (on back cards/mute...) by [changing the card templates](http://ankisrs.net/docs/CardLayout.html)  
- Words that have same writing, same pronunciation will be merged in 1 card.  
- Words that have same writing but different pronunciation will be in different cards [(more info)](http://chaemii.blogspot.com/2009/02/blog-post_3402.html)  
  
Ex:  452, 821, 881: 배 will be in 2 cards

* 배 [배] Abdomen, stomach, belly; Boat, ship, vessel [배]  
* 배 [배ː] Multiples (two times, three times, etc) [배ː])

There are a lot of great resources out there already for learning Korean, so these videos aren't meant to compete with any of those. Instead, it's best to learn with a variety of resources, so this would just be one more to add, for those of you learning Korean.

The channel is called **[Go Billy Korean](http://www.youtube.com/gobillykorean)** and currently there are 3 Korean lesson videos (5 videos total), with more to come each week. I also take suggestions on topics to cover.

The current 3 Korean lessons cover:

1. ""Want~"" and ""Want to~""

2. Conjugating the ~요 form

3. ""Have to~"" and ""Must~""

As for my credentials, I'm a fluent Korean speaker with a major in the Korean language, have a Korean Mastery Certificate from the A.C.T.F.L., and am a native English speaker from Los Angeles.

1361029811.0,54,self.Korean,18n2jv,"""Official"" rules of Korean pronunciation, summarized in English",kjoonlee,62,8,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/18n2jv/official_rules_of_korean_pronunciation_summarized/,"Not_Ayn_Rand has introduced us to a link to an overview of Korean pronunciation rules.

* English overview: http://www.korean.go.kr/hangeul/cpron/04_sound/02.htm
* Korean full rules: http://www.korean.go.kr/09_new/dic/rule/rule02.jsp

The overview is incomplete, though, so I thought I'd summarize the ""official"" rules in English.

I assume you all know what a 받침 is, but first, some terminology:

* Conjugation: plain verbs and descriptive verbs change shape. I'll call this conjugation.
* Utterance-final: when you will pronounce nothing afterwards, I'll call that utterance-final.
* Stop: When airflow stops (in one way or another) I'll call that a stop. Examples are ㅂㄷㄱ for oral stops, ㅁㄴ for nasal stops. When people say ""stop"" they usually mean oral stop. Nasal stops are more commonly called nasals.
* Fricative: Hissing sounds like ㅅㅆ.
* Affricate: When a stop meets a fricative it's an affricate. Examples are ㅈㅉ.
* Aspiration: ㅍㅌㅋㅊ are aspirated. When a puff of air comes out of your mouth it's aspiration. Hold up a piece of tissue to your mouth and say ""star"" and ""tar"": the puff will be there for ""tar.""
* Fortis: ""Double"" sounds like ㅃㄸㄲㅆㅉ. I'll call them fortis.
* Lenis: Not fortis, not aspirated. Regular ㅂㄷㄱㅅㅈ.
* Assimilation: When one sound becomes similar to another, or sounds become similar to each other, then that's assimilation.
* Reduction: I don't know what the proper name is. I'll just call it reduction. (You'll see what it is by reading the rules.) If something gets deleted by being reduced, I'll call that reduction to zero.
* Morpheme: if something within a word carries meaning, or if something within a word changes meaning, and you cannot split the meaning further, that's a morpheme.
     * Morphemes are defined as the smallest things that carry/change meaning. BTW, some morphemes do not carry meaning, but instead only change it... :)
* Grammatical morpheme: morphemes that serve a grammatical function (Korean particles, past tense -었-, etc.)
* Lexical morpheme: ""meaty-part"" morphemes that don't serve grammatical functions but instead make nouns or verb roots, adverbs, adjectives, etc.

And some conventions:

* // slashes denote sounds before sound-change rules. The ""idea"" of the sound, phonemes.
* [] square brackets denote sounds as they are pronounced. ""Physical"" sounds, phones/allophones.
* &amp;lt;&gt; angle brackets denote letters as they are written, graphemes. I also used angle brackets when I wasn't sure whether the sounds were phonemes or allophones...

## [Consonants and vowels](http://www.korean.go.kr/09_new/dic/rule/rule02_0202.jsp)

* 5.1. &amp;lt;져, 쪄, 쳐&gt; in conjugation is pronounced like [저, 쩌, 처].
* 5.2. /ㅖ/ may be pronounced [ㅔ]. /예, 례/ are exceptions, they're still [예, 례].
* 5.3. If a syllable starts with a consonant, the /ㅢ/ vowel must be pronounced [ㅣ].
* 5.4. The syllable /의/ may be pronounced [의] or [이] if it doesn't start a word. The particle &amp;lt;의&gt; may be pronounced /에/. 

## [받침](http://www.korean.go.kr/09_new/dic/rule/rule02_0204.jsp)

* 8. Only seven consonants are allowed in utterance-final position. They are [ㅂㄷㄱㅁㄴㅇㄹ]. Other consonants are reduced to [ㅂㄷㄱㅁㄴㅇㄹ].
* 9. Oral stops, fricatives, and affricates get reduced to unreleased stops, [ㅂㄷㄱ].
* 12.1. /ㅎ/ causes aspiration to following lenis stops, lenis affricates: /ㄷㄱㅈ/ become [ㅌㅋㅊ], and /ㅎ/ itself is deleted. This is before reduction to [ㄷ] as per rule 8. (Why no /ㅂ/? Well, /ㅂ/ doesn't appear in conjugation, and /ㅎ/ only ends syllables in conjugation.)
* 12.2. /ㅎ/ causes fortition to following lenis fricatives: /ㅅ/ becomes [ㅆ], and /ㅎ/ itself is deleted. This is before reduction to [ㄷ] as per rule 8.
* 12.3. /ㅎ/ is reduced to [ㄷ], so changes to [ㄴ] before another [ㄴ]. See rule 18 below.
* 12.4. /ㅎ/ is deleted before a verb stem that starts with a vowel.
* 15. If a 받침 meets a lexical morpheme that starts with /ㅏㅓㅗㅜㅟ/, reduce the 받침 before moving the 받침 to the next syllable.
* 15.1. Rule 15 explains [마덥따]. Rule 15.1 says that [마싣따] and [마딛따] are both good pronunciations for &lt;맛있다&gt;.

## [Assimilation](http://www.korean.go.kr/09_new/dic/rule/rule02_0205.jsp)

* 17. 받침 /ㄷㅌ/ + /ㅣ/ -&gt; [지, 치]. (Classic example of palatalization.)
* 18. Anything that's reduced to [ㅂㄷㄱ] is nasalized and pronounced [ㅁㄴㅇ] before nasals [ㅁㄴ]. (The nasal [ㅇ] cannot start a syllable.)
* 19. /ㅂㄱㅁㅇ/ + /ㄹ/ -&gt; /ㅂㄱㅁㅇ/ + /ㄴ/ -&gt; [ㅁㅇ] + [ㄴ]
* 20. /ㄴ/ + /ㄹ/ -&gt; [ㄹㄹ], /ㄹ/ + /ㄴ/ -&gt; [ㄹㄹ]

* 23. If [ㅂㄷㄱㅅㅈ] come after anything that's reduced to [ㅂㄷㄱ], they become fortis [ㅃㄸㄲㅆㅉ].
* 24. In conjugation, /ㅁㄴ/ + /ㄷㄱㅅㅈ/ causes fortition to [ㄸㄲㅆㅉ]. 
* 25. In conjugation, /ㄼㄾ/ + /ㄷㄱㅅㅈ/ -&gt; [ㄹ] + [ㄸㄲㅆㅉ]
* 26. In Hanja-based words, /ㄹ/ + [ㄷㅅㅈ] -&gt; [ㄹ] + [ㄸㅆㅉ]
* 26.1. But not when there's reduplication of Hanja like in [허허실실] or [절절하다].
* 27. After the attributive conjugation /ㄹ/, /ㅂㄷㄱㅅㅈ/ -&gt; [ㅃㄸㄲㅆㅉ].
* 28. In places where you might expect a 사이시옷, it causes fortition, even if a 사이시옷 is not written there.

## [Insertion](http://www.korean.go.kr/09_new/dic/rule/rule02_0207.jsp)

* 29. In compound words and derived words, if the front part ends with a consonant and the following part is the syllable /이여야요유/ then /ㄴ/ is inserted: /니녀냐뇨뉴/
* 29.1. This is before rule 20, so if a /ㄴ/ is inserted after a compound word that ends with [ㄹ], it changes to [ㄹ].
* 30.1. If a 사이시옷 comes before a syllable that starts with /ㅂㄷㄱㅅㅈ/ then it causes fortition to [ㅃㄸㄲㅆㅉ]. The 사이시옷 is meant to be reduced to zero in principle, but it may be reduced to [ㄷ].
* 30.2. Rule 18 applies to 사이시옷 as well. It's reduced to [ㄷ] so it's pronounced [ㄴ] before nasals [ㅁㄴ]. (The nasal [ㅇ] cannot start a syllable.)
* 30.3. Rule 29 sort of applies to 사이시옷 as well. If the front part ends with a 사이시옷 and the following part has an /이/ sound or has the vowel /ㅕㅠ/ then /ㄴ/ is inserted: /베갯잇/ -&gt; [베갠닏]",,False,,t5_2rd8q,1365429639.0,,native,True,t3_18n2jv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/18n2jv/official_rules_of_korean_pronunciation_summarized/,

However, if you have to use it, I recommend to use Google translations and detour Japanese. E.g. Kor-Jpn-Eng or Eng-Jpn-Kor.

Automated translation between Japanese and Korean works like a charm, as they share the vast amount of words and grammar. I have no problem browsing through Japanese web sites as long as they're text-based. 

Also, there're well-constructed database regarding Eng-Jpn translations, as Japanese sub-culture such as animes or mangas have devastating influence on the internet. 

It's a little bit shameful that Korean lacks such things. Nevertheless, this trick should give you much desirable result.

So I decided to take it to the streets; which meant visiting a Korean takeaway/diner on a road that is near my University. I did a quick Google search, found a place called Seoul Kimchi and set off on my quest to have what was to be one of the greatest conversations of all time…

Okay I’ll cut the crap now, but having an awkward attempt at a Korean conversation wasn’t as bad as it sounds. It’s fulfilling to know that I tried and the purpose of this post is to urge everyone else on this subreddit who hasn’t had a go at a real dialogue to do something about it.

For anyone interested in what was actually said…

I found myself too nervous to say 안녕하세요 (Hello), so after ordering 불고기 (BBQ Chicken) I waited until the food arrived and said “고맙습니다” (Thank you). The waitress giggled and even if I had decided to speak no more Korean, I still would’ve felt like a boss. 

While paying I said “배 안 고파요 하지만 맛있어요” (I’m not hungry but it’s delicious). I realised I’d probably fucked up the tenses so I broke into English and said “I’m trying”. Then we spoke in English about where I’m learning Korean from and she found it cool that my response was “The Internet”.

So fellow beginners, don’t wait until you’re a multilingual God/Goddess to speak it. You’ll be satisfied that you made an effort and they’ll no doubt be impressed that you tried. Good luck and thanks for reading.

While [Q] and [TR] are pretty self explanatory, we've added **[Tip]** for anything you'd like to share with others that you've learned; think of it as r/Korean's very own [TIL] tag. I hope this will encourage users to post their own explanations of concepts to each other, and learn as a group. **Let's keep [Tip] as our own lessons and tips to each other, and not use it for just linking to other websites.** Other websites and resources are already listed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/rq3th/the_ultimate_beginners_resource_thread/).

Second, based on your suggestions, r/Korean **now has flair!**

You can assign your own flair based on your skill level as follows:

**초** - Beginner

**중** - Intermediate

**고** - Advanced

**태극기 (Korean flag)** - Native Korean speaker *(if Korean is your 1st language, please give yourself this flair)*

**Assigning flair is on the honor system. Please assign your own flair correctly so the moderators don't have to do it for everyone.**

* Three pronunciations of 의? (I can only think of two.)

A reading of a short paragraph, like ""The North Wind and the Sun"":

* 바람과 햇님이 서로 힘이 더 세다고 다투고 있을 때,
* 한 나그네가 따뜻한 외투를 입고 걸어왔습니다.
* 그들은 누구든지 나그네의 외투를 먼저 벗기는 이가 힘이 더 세다고 하기로 결정했습니다.
* 북풍은 힘껏 불었으나, 불면 불수록 나그네는 외투를 단단히 여몄습니다.
* 그때에 햇님이 뜨거운 햇빛을 가만히 내려쬐니 나그네는 외투를 얼른 벗었습니다.
* 이리하여 북풍은 햇님이 둘 중에 힘이 더 세다고 인정하지 않을 수 없었습니다.

And some other sounds too:

* Sucking in air when you're uncertain
* [Emphasis on something big](http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/12r3sv/what_is_the_throat_clearing_sound_that_ajummas/)
* [Sound after you've drank soju](http://youtu.be/quF-CDV3K68?t=3m28s)

I've been thinking of doing this for ages, and I might record these in my own voice. However, I don't have the loveliest of pronunciations (I tend to drool when I try to record things) so now I'm thinking of hiring a professional voice actor and renting a studio and do this some time.

Do you have any other samples you might want to hear, in case I manage to pull this off?

Voice actors charge by the hour AFAIK, so if I succeed, there'll probably be a lot of material I'd be able to cram in.

No guarantees I can get this to work! But if I do, I'll probably be releasing it under a public domain license on Wikimedia Commons and SoundCloud.

**당신:**

1) ""당신"" can be used by one spouse to another, formally. Often instead of ""당신,"" nicknames are used, the same way we might use affectionate names between couples in English; first names are also commonly used between couples. (Or for a more direct approach to saying ""you"" informally, although usually not rude between couples, 너 may also be used.)

2) ""당신"" can be used to refer to ""you"" when not specifically referring to anyone; an example would be if you saw a self-motivation sign that said ""You're special."" (""당신은 특별한 사람입니다."") It's also used in example Korean sentences, since ""you"" is unknown.

In many situations, ""당신"" can be considered condescending and rude.

**너:**

(Also pronounced ""니"" in some dialects)

1) ""너"" is safe to use between friends, [only 친구] (people who are the same age as you), or anyone who is younger than you ONLY once you're well-acquainted with them. Using ""너"" the first time you meet someone younger than you can come across as rude. The only exceptions are for very young children, and animals. (In the case of animals, you should always use the lowest form of Korean) However, it's still good to use polite Korean to children, as the parents will worry if you're teaching their children the ""correct"" way to speak.

2) ""너"" can be used between dating couples, even if one of them is older than the other. However it's not preferred (nicknames, first names, and other callings such as 누나/오빠/etc are the norm).

3) Never use ""너"" to anyone older than you. However, it *can* be used to people who are older than you, if they explicitely tell you to, or give you permission to.

As a foreigner, you might be allowed to use ""너"" to older friends. Keep in mind that this is not the norm, and it should still never be used to anyone older than you with whom you are not very well acquainted.

Note: be careful to never say ""너"" to another person who's clearly older than you in public, *even if they've told you it's okay to say ""너"" to them*, as this may be embarrassing to them in front of other people.",,False,,t5_2rd8q,1343348014.0,,advanced,True,t3_x7jb9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/x7jb9/tip_tips_on_using_당신_and_너/,

* I get my textbooks in PDF format (or scan them myself using the iPad's camera), and then use GoodReader to annotate them.  You can type/draw right onto the book inside of GoodReader.

I'm planning on proposing to her in Hawaii, but I'd like to get her parents' permission first. However, while they've been supportive of our relationship, they don't speak much English. Does anyone here have any suggestions on how to go about asking them for permission for their daughter's hand in marriage? Unfortunately, I don't speak Korean, but so far my best bet has been to write a letter and then have it translated into Korean... They live pretty far away, so it's not feasible for me to go to them in person, but I figure this would be the next best option, since communicating directly with them is somewhat difficult. If anyone has experience in Korean translations, or could point me in the direction of a trusted professional service, or has any other suggestions, I'd be forever in your debt!

Dear Mr. &amp; Mrs. xxx,

I am sorry that I am not able to tell you this in person, but I hope that you will accept my sincere feelings in this letter. For the past seven years I have had the honor of knowing your daughter. During that time, I have been fortunate enough to discover what a truly kind and compassionate person she is. Nothing in this world brings me as much joy as seeing her smile. She has had a tremendous impact on my life, and without her, I would be a completely different person. She has been my best friend throughout difficult times and I cannot imagine life without her.

As you know, later this month, we will be traveling to Hawaii. During our vacation there, I plan to propose to your daughter. I respectfully and sincerely ask for your blessing. I hope you would allow me and find me worthy to marry your daughter. Thank you for your support in our relationship thus far, and I hope to use this opportunity to bring our families together.

Yours Truly,

1346660058.0,21,self.Korean,z9t1k,[Tip] Useful Hanja,Pikmeir,26,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/z9t1k/tip_useful_hanja/,"I often read posts on r/learnjapanese discussing how useful/worthless it is to know Japanese characters (Kanji) when learning Japanese. Well, almost the same applies to Korean as in Japanese; although I don't recommend learning Chinese characters when you're completely new to Korean, after you have a solid understanding of the basics, knowing Hanja will really boost your Korean in every way.

**1)** Knowing Hanja will let you understand new words your first time hearing/seeing them. For example, if you heard the phrase ""백문불여일견"" you'd have no idea what it meant (unless you know it already), but if you know basic Hanja this would/could be easy. 百(백) = hundred, (聞)문 = to hear, (不)불 = not/isn't, (如)여 = like/similar, (一)일 = one, (見)견 = to see. ""Hearing something a hundred times isn't like seeing it once."" If you know basic Hanja, not only would this be easier to understand, but a cinch to memorize. In fact, Korean is filled with Chinese idioms like this (as is Chinese and Japanese), and knowing basic Hanja will make learning them much more feasible.

**2)** Your vocabulary will expand exponentially each new Hanja you learn. Say you learn the Hanja for ""month"" (月)월, which also means ""moon"" originally (same as English). If next you learn (末)말, which means ""end,"" you can now say 월말 which means ""end of the month."" If you learn (週)주, for ""week,"" you can now also say/understand 주말 for ""end of the week"" automatically without having to learn it separately.

**3)** You can closely guess a word's meaning without having ever learned the word, and sometimes without even knowing its context. In English, you can do the same thing through knowing root words and Latin; in Korean, you can do this through Hanja. For example, take the word 무제한. If you know (無)무 for ""none,"" you can guess that the word's meaning must be something like ""(having) no 제한."" Assume you don't know the word 제한, but you did learn the word (限)한 which is also a simple Hanja that means ""limit,"" you could easily guess that 제한 must also mean ""limit"" so you get ""unlimited"" from the full word. If you didn't even know 한, you could probably still understand the word from the context of the sentence only knowing 무.

**4)** You will be respected as a real Korean learner. Although being a foreigner learning Korean already gets you 100 cool points with Korean people, being able to write Hanja will show you have a true interest in not only ""learning to talk in Korean"" but also in simply ""learning Korean."" It's freaking cool to whip out a pen and write some Hanja right in front of a Korean. You'll find that through studying Hanja, you'll learn more than most younger people are able to write, which will bring upon them an eternally burning shame toward their ancestors. But actually, you'll find that many older people are familiar with Hanja, and it will bring you up a full level of maturity in their eyes through learning it.

**Here are some good sites for learning Hanja for free online:**

1359933343.0,24,self.Korean,17tzmr,[Tip] For those extracting audio samples from ttmik lessons: how to download from naver's dictionary,qkwym,26,2,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/17tzmr/tip_for_those_extracting_audio_samples_from_ttmik/,"I've seen two people mentioning how they extracted the audio samples for their anki cards from ttmik lessons. I used to do the same thing when I started my deck, and I ended up realizing that: it was time-consuming; it kept me from paying full attention to the lesson itself; and the audio quality ends up being inferior to recordings made specific for this purpose. So here's a tip on a better way to get audio for your deck:

First of all, download and extract into your deck's media folder all the samples from [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/166zb8/update_korean_1000_most_common_words_anki_deck/) by therealdummy

Now, for the words not contained in there, install [this script](https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/158252) in [greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (firefox) or [tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) (chrome), then search for the word in [naver's Korean dictionary](http://krdic.naver.com/), and you'll get a download link for that word's audio. You'll find most Korean words in there, except for slang, cursing, etc. For those, try [forvo](http://www.forvo.com/).

**Extra tip**: You probably want to add [replaygain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replaygain) tags to your files so that they'll have equal loudness. In linux, osx, etc, you can use [mp3gain](http://mp3gain.sourceforge.net/faq.php). In windows, if you don't run [cygwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygwin), you can try doing it with [winamp](http://blog.winamp.com/2009/08/24/automatic-volume-leveling-in-winamp-with-replay-gain/) or maybe some other program, I can't really test since I don't have a windows machine available.

**Second extra tip**: Again, for those in linux, etc, [here](http://pastebin.com/Rmk0P5WU) is a script to download the mp3 directly from the command line. Just call it with the words you want, for example:

    ./naver.sh 가다 오다 하다

You can also generate a list with all the words in your deck by clicking in anki File &gt; Export (or pressing Ctrl-E), choosing Export format ""Notes in Plain Text (*.txt),"" saving it somewhere (I'll call it notes.txt), and then running something like the following (which will select only the first field in the note, then only the hangul, then sort and remove duplicates, then download each one) (note you can also use xargs here, but if your deck is big enough it will fail because of too many arguments):

    cut -f 1 notes.txt | grep -Po '[가-힣]+' | sort -u | while read word; do ./naver.sh ""$word""; done

I see no end of translations being done quickly and simply, and people helping each other learn aspects of grammar or vocabulary and everything else.

However, these days far too many threads seem to contain responses that contribute nothing due to the fact the commenter doesn't actually know the answer OP wants.

To give an example:

&gt; I don't really know, but...

&gt; If I had to guess...

I'm sure many people recognise the type of comment I mean. I think when someone asks a question they want a definite answer. If you can't provide one, it's probably best you stay out of the discussion, or certainly don't leave a comment in which you state that you don't know as a primary comment.

I think it's often people with a 초 level flair, but not always, and I'm in no way trying to discourage lower level learners from commenting. In fact I think beginners often know grammatical rules and so on better than some more advanced speakers if they've learned correctly and recently.

So I guess my request is for people to answer with what they know. If you don't know, then the question probably wasn't for you. In that situation wait for a correct answer and use that to improve your own knowledge. This goes for all of us.

The answer is: there's a hell of a lot of difference.

There are hundreds of Korean words commonly used in South Korea that are adopted from English in the last 60 years.

North Korea, as part of their ""self-reliance"" policy, has even tried to replace a lot of Korean words that come from Chinese Characters, preferring to use ""pure Korean"" vocabulary.

I suppose this could be even more broadly answered by the huge use of English in the Korean language. But it just seems odd that they would use things like keo-pi or ba-suh rather than having their own word. Or perhaps there is a more ""korean word"" but the conglish word has come to dominate?

Any insight would be great =)
Thanks!

In my native tongue as well as the two languages I learnt back when I was in school (English and French) pronouns were never dropped so it was something so fundamentally odd to me that I just couldn't wrap my head around it for the longest time. Now it seems perfectly natural to me, after all more often than not we can deduce what we need to know by the verb ending and the context .

그래 seems like it can be used as a question (""Really?"") or as another way to say ""yes"" or confirm something. Is that right? Are there other situations where I'd use this word?

So as many of you all know, we here at r/korean have an IRC Channel (a chatroom)! It’s great, there are many regulars, a couple of experienced learners, and a bunch of natives.  
What goes on in there? We talk about anything from programming to TV programs. Just hanging out, or trying to learn together.

Here’s something crazy: We all like new people in the chatroom.  
If you want to poke your head in and talk about hamburgers, if we’re not in the middle of something else, we’ll be glad to talk about hamburgers.  

Join in and have a question about Korean? We would LOVE to talk about it.

But here’s the catch: We need time. Quite often, users join the channel, quickly say: “HELLO IS THERE ANYONE HERE WHO CAN TRANSLATE???!!!1!?&gt;!1/1??”, and then proceed to leave after 10 seconds. I sincerely apologize that we do not stare at IRC 24/7, waiting just for you so that we can answer your question. Sometimes we are not looking at the computer, sometimes we may not even be at the computer, we have lives too!

It’s called a chatROOM! Rooms are sometimes full, and sometimes there’s no one in it at all, so stick around! :) If no one is talking, give someone a ping (simply by typing out their name in IRC, their computer will flash / make a noise / something, and they’ll know)-- better yet, ping ME, “trevarr”, spelled exactly the same as my reddit name, I’m pretty much always in the chat, and, I admit, I look at it much too much. I’m not the smartest or best at Korean, but i’m sure we can find others in the chat who can answer your question.

I realized a few days ago that many of you may not be aware of /r/team_korean or the Total Annihilation Challenge.   The TAC is a competition between the various language learning communities of Reddit to learn as much of their target language as possible in a year.  The competition began in January, but it's definitely not too late to join the team!  

The idea is pretty simple.  Every week on Sunday, you write self post on /r/Team_Korean that describes your progress, difficulties, or anything else you want to post about your Korean studies in the previous week.  You can also comment on other posts asking questions or for advice, or simply to provide encouragement.  At the end of the year, a judge will determine which team was the best organized and had the best participation.  Team members help encourage and help each other another along the journey of learning Korean!  

By keeping a log each week and seeing how others are overcoming their challenges, it is a great motivation and tool to learning Korean. 

The rules for the challenge can be found here along with the proper format of your weekly posts: http://www.reddit.com/r/totalanguage/comments/15qvu0/mod_announcement_updated_rules_for_the_tac/

Like I said, it is definitely not too late to join and we would love to have more team members to share the journey with.  There are still 10 months left in the challenge!

I've been studying Korean on and off over the last 2-3 years, and most recently I just completed a semester (3급) at 외대.  I feel like my motivation to learn is at it's lowest.

-I don't particularly care for Kpop or drama.  

-I like some Korean films but the really interesting ones are still a bit too much for me.

-Korean language instruction feels about a decade or two behind the times.  Really heavy on grammar, and very superficial when it comes to developing skills.  You also tend to get beat over the head with Korean culture.  Imagine learning English and always having to read about George Washington or how to make apple pie or may poles.

-Being a white dude in Korea means that most people are going to open up conversation with you in English (I'm a native speaker, but this happens to European students of Korean as well).  Especially conversations you don't want to have, haha.  Even if you start the interaction in Korean, you sometimes get replies in English.  When I'm with my wife people feel like they have to go through her to ask me even rather simple questions.  I don't mean to judge this as wrong, because the truth is that most whites in Korea don't speak Korean and Koreans using English well is good for tourism, just that nonetheless it's very demotivating for me because it makes my studies and progress feel useless.  I envy my Japanese and Chinese classmates! (Yes, I realize this point is definitely under the category of White People Problems/First World Problems)

-This is the worst, but there are very few people I have any desire to speak Korean to.  My wife speaks excellent English and it's our habitual mode of conversation.  I have few Korean friends and they, by and large, speak better English than I do Korean.  My in-laws are great but honestly the culture of interpersonal interactions really demotivates me to put much effort in.

I feel a responsibility to continue learning, but it's troubling that my interest and motivation has sunk so low.

* 더 means ""more"" when placed before an adjective or adverb.
* 열심히 means enthusiastically or eagerly. 
* 노력 means ""effort"" or ""attempt"". 
* 공부하다 means ""study"". Simply remove 다, add 기 to nominalize the verb. Then add the direct object particle ㄹ. (**Correct me if I'm wrong here*)
* ~야 한다 is another very useful grammatical construct, which means ""have to"". ~야 되다 also works.

I'm going to write some things that stuck out to me while it's still fresh in my head.

1. I wish I brought an eraser. I had a pencil and white-out, but it would have made writing the essay a lot easier if I could just have erased stuff. They hand out pens and you could buy pencils (that didn't have erasers) and white out outside, but yeah, an eraser would have been nice. Didn't think of it.

2. People around you will look at the questions before you're supposed to and nothing is done about it except  after they see multiple people doing it, they remind everyone not to do that. If your conscious won't bother you, I'd say it's probably ok if a lot of others are doing it (of course, this could vary a lot from place to place and from teacher to teacher).

3. Take note at what time the test started.  They didn't start telling us how much time we had left until we had 30 mins left. 

4. Practice taking sections of the test under the time constraints you'll have in the test. I thought I was great at the reading section, but it turned out that although I could get the right answer, I was taking too long.

5. If you have no clue what the answer is, just fill something in.

I took the suggestion to begin watching Secret Garden, which is strange because I am quite a masculine man but I am enjoying it quite a lot so far (on episode 3). I am here to ask what is the most efficient way to self teach yourself a language like Korean. I have no one to speak it to me and teach me or correct my mistakes (I live in the states). Should I look for something when watching Korean dramas or just watch and read subtitles to familiarize myself with the language?

Any tips anyone can give me or resources for self teaching Korean that I might have missed or not have been posted? Thanks for the help, you guys do great work!",,False,,t5_2rd8q,False,,beginner,True,t3_1793cg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/1793cg/q_self_teaching_korean_efficiently/,

Below is a quick summary of what went down. The third chat will be next Sunday schedules permitting, but no later than in 2 weeks. There will be another post when the timing is officially announced.

Just to go over the point of these chats again-- a lot of people on /r/korean are learning on their own without much chance to practice speaking in conversation. This will hopefully give those people an opportunity to test and enhance their speaking skills. Learners of all levels are welcome!

* 만나서 반갑습니다~
* 열공 열공

날씨 -

**좋은점:** 

Skype was a lot less buggy than tinychat!  
Little lag  
Sound clearer  
Study Guide gave better structure for the chat, helped people prepare and have something to refer to  
We were able to go through the entire study guide! Hooray!


**단점:**

There was a lot of people so practice was a little thinly spread, but adding more questions should help that.

**랜덤 인용:**

* Hello. It's your turn. GO.
* All in Korean please. Unless of course you can't speak Korean, in which case ALL KOREAN UNDER THREAT OF BANNING.
* 뷁! 뽟!
* ""I wanna be old so I can be a jackass""
* ""우리 집에 다시 오겠죠?"" ""NO.""  (You'll come to our house again, right? - NO)
* 여자 하나 더 나타났습니다! 그리고 부자이세요!  (There's another girl! And she's rich!)
* 윤성 의미도 없는 소리 좀 하지마세요. 다들 헷갈리게 만들어요. (Yoonsung, please stop saying random things. Everyone's getting confused)
* ID2's 더러운 남성스러운...애기/애교 목소리
* Has the chat died? Yes. Lance killed it.
* Above all, what you should take away from this chat is: make friends with kids
* Oh, and very half-priced to meet you all.

On the front of the card you have an image, the sentence in Korean, and the sound bite.

On the back is the sentence in Korean again, and the English translation.

I hope you all enjoy, and if you want I can continue with the series. I will be creating video decks as well, but I won't upload those unless someone specifically asks for them. They get pretty big.

Also, I'd like to locate more Korean subtitles to create decks so please point me in the right direction if you know any. I currently know of D-Addicts and one other private site that has some, but not all are in a convenient format (.srt, .ssa, etc.).

I am posting these directions to make life easier when filling up your ipod/mp3 player with podcasts for the next few lessons you're working on (instead of having to download them all one at a time).  If you're using the premium content, please pay for a subscription.

This will work for any of the {language}class101.com sites.

You will need the following:

* 1 week trial membership which gives you unlimited access to the premium content, followed by a paid subscription to support the creation of more files
* Firefox (I used the latest version [3.6] though older versions will probably work)
* [AutoPager addon for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4925)
* [DownThemAll! addon for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/201)

Follow these directions to download the files you want.

* Log into {language}class101.com
* Click on Tools - AutoPager - Site Wizard
* Under URL Pattern, select ""http://www.koreanclass101.com/index.php*"" (without quotes) from the drop down.
* Click the Check Box at the top of the wizard to add the site
* Close the wizard if it doesn't close automatically
* Navigate to the category you wish to download (All, Beginner, Intermediate, etc)
* Click Tools - Auto Pager - Immediately Load - All Pages
* Wait until all of the pages have loaded, you may have to scroll to the bottom occasionally (Ctrl+End is helpful here) to see if it's done - but there is usually a green ""Loading"" box in the bottom right corner anyways
* Click Tools - DownThemAll! Tools - DownThemAll!...
* Uncheck everything under Filters
* Expand Fast Filtering and enter the following without quotes "".mp3, .m4v, .pdf""
* Click Start! and wait.  This will take a fair amount of time depending on your connection

Koreanclass101.com Beginner section is about 2.1GB, the remaining sections take up about 0.9GB (total of 3.0GB for everything on their site).

The naming convention of some of the files are somewhat odd, and I haven't take the time to sit down and figure them out (and write a quick script to rename them something more logical), so if anyone does that, please post back.

Ask for any help if needed.

The main qualities I'm searching for:

* Has some form of supernatural/magical aspect, for the entertainment/escapism factor.
* Has a strong command of the language, in the same way popular English fantasy novels usually use a slightly older/more formal style of English and show a broad vocabulary.
* An original piece (or refix of a traditional story) written by a Korean person and not translated from another language, this means that phrases and language is more likely to be more natural and would include unique cultural nuances.
* Not much depressing content, dark books are fine and sad moments are too but after watching a few dozen Korean movies I've learnt that Korean people are uncomfortably good at portraying depressing situations when they choose to and I want to have fun reading it(or trying to)

I get bored learning the basics in correct order too easily and find I progress best if I just dive into something that is way over my head and work through it slowly until my level of understanding catches up, so at first it's a challenge to figure out, and as I get through it, it becomes an enjoyable book that just happens to be improving my Korean. So please disregard the fact that my Korean level is nil, I learnt the alphabet but my language is the level of a 2 year old, I'm looking to sit down with a dictionary or other translation device and really grind it out from scratch.

When I'm speaking, I tend to lag far behind what I've learned. 

Part of it is a confidence problem, I think. When I'm in a certain mood I can speak really well however the problem is that when I'm not in a specific mood, it takes a long time to organize what I want to say and I still have a hard time choosing the vocabularly and grammar that best fit the situation.

What actually came out: 오늘... 야근... 해야돼서... 만날 수 없거든요... 

Any suggestions for catching my speaking up to my writing? My reading is actually where I want it to be. I can comprehend stuff I read at a pretty decent level.

* Criminal homicide: 범죄살인. Deliberate and done with malice aforethought (의도적살인).  의도적임 refers to intent.  So if someone spills coffee on you, you could ask, ""너 방금 의도적의로 했지?""

* Negligent Homicide: 과실치사.  치사 means lethal, but it's more commonly used to mean dishonorable.  If you're playing a game with a friend and he cheats, you can say, ""이런 치사한 인간...""

* Listening Skills
* Pronunciation
* Sentence Drills
* Amassing a large inventory of example sentences from natives
* Getting used to natural Korean sentence structures

With this in mind, I propose /r/korean have a periodic song translation challenge. Learners of all levels can collaborate to translate, fix mistakes, and explain grammar points. This should help expose people to Korean songs as a resource and have a fun way to practice. 

To start off, I chose a short, simple song: 사르르 (I Wanna Be Your Love) by J.ae (제이) ft. 정엽.
You can listen to the song [here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqye9hLxEZo) 

The lyrics are should be accessible to beginners as well as intermediate learners. Difficulty level can be adjusted for future songs, but this is meant to be aimed more at beginners.

The lyrics will be posted by verse in the comments. Leave a comment reply to add your translation (or questions!) for any section. Translations do not need to be complete verses.

If challenge #1 is successful, I may post one song every month or week.

Read this first.,jakeinkorea111,25,13,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/za39y/tip_thinking_about_learning_korean_read_this_first/,"I wish I had read this blog post before I spent five years learning a language that nobody wants me to use: [http://koreanchamp.com/?p=11](http://koreanchamp.com/?p=11)

This is my experience, and that of others may vary (I encourage them to chime in here), but if you are of non-Asian descent I believe you WILL encounter constant difficulties in getting Koreans to speak Korean with you. As it says in the blog, no matter how good you get at Korean, this fact will not change. Korean people who are not good at English will be afraid to talk to you and constantly apologize that they cannot speak English, while those wanting to practice their English skills will seek you out. Not always, but often enough, people will insist on speaking to you in English despite you being fully capable of having the conversation in Korean.

In addition, I've had multiple frustrating experiences where I've been outright mocked to my face by people I did not know for using Korean, both in social and store/restaurant/bank settings. If you're going to learn Korean, you better have tough skin.

That said, if you ARE Asian (not necessarily even Korean), the default will be to talk to you in Korean. I know this because when Asian friends come to visit me in Korea, people talk to them despite me responding and despite them not knowing a single word in Korean. However, this can also be a curse; Korean American friends have told me how rude people can be to them if their Korean isn't perfect, accusing their parents of not raising them correctly.

Unfortunately for me, I'm not aggressive or bold enough to do any of the suggestions that the author makes in his blog. So if you can't see yourself doing any of his suggestions in order to learn Korean, perhaps it's worth considering a language where native speakers will be more willing to speak with you.

Finally, one last observation. I have noticed that the main exception to this barrier in learning Korean is those who have a Korean partner and who speak Korean with them. These people, in my experience, tend to be able to go from advanced to fluent.

While I have had many positive experiences in Korea and plan on continuing to live here, part of me wishes I had just stopped at an intermediate level for daily life and travel instead of continuing to study. So, fellow learners of Korean, do you have any thoughts on this? Similar experiences? Disagree completely?

And to future learners of Korean: please take this post with a grain of salt. I have loved learning Korean and find it to be very enjoyable.

I'm fairly fluent in Korea but if there's something I just can't wrap my head around it's the difference between ""-므로(써)"" and ""-ㅁ으로써"".

The Korean Grammar Dictionary ([link](http://koreangrammaticalforms.com/entry.php?eid=0000001190)) says:
&gt; -(으)ㅁ으로써, i.e., particle 으로(써) on a substantive in -(으)ㅁ, here meaning through or on account of/by ...-ing. By itself, (으)로써 is an emphatic synonym of -(으)로 in certain of its meanings: (means) with, by, by means of, through, using etc., and is not to be confused with -(으)므로(서), the substantive in -(으)ㅁ + instrumental (으)로(서), meaning with (as, etc.) the doing or being; since (because of) the doing or being.

No matter how many times I read this, it still doesn't seem quite clear.

Even natives seem to confuse these two forms sometimes -- at least based on the number of hits on Naver.

For instance, Pusan National University ([another link](http://urimal.cs.pusan.ac.kr/urimal_new/learn/dictionary/pronun/frequent/frequent.asp?ID=102030636&amp;page_num=4&amp;search_str=)) gives the following examples as guidance on proper usage:
&gt; 그는 의술을 **베풂으로써** 사회에 봉사한다.

&gt; 너는 뭐든지 잘 **먹으므로** 남자들이 좋아하겠다.

However, I still don't see what the difference is. Is it because my own native language doesn't have this kind of a distinction, so I'm not familiar with the concept?

*Summary at the bottom (When I started writing I didn't know I would make this big of a post)*

**Background**

About 6 weeks ago I decided I want to learn Korean for various reasons. I had gotten my hands on a book called *Colloquial Korean* and from here on started learning from this book.

A month ago I found out about this subreddit. I've read a lot of topics with people being in the exact same position as me. I got a ton of useful links and websites. However, I'm still using my book as my main method of learning.

**Story so far**

First two weeks I tried to master Hangul and all the characters involved. This boosted my motivation greatly, because I felt I could instantly pronounce every Korean sentence, which feels great.

This is where I started on the actual lessons. The book is set up in a way that it teaches you a bit of grammar, like 75 words and two dialogues in certain theme (e.g. greetings, office, friends). Audio is also included.

I am now nearly done with the third lesson. So at this point I:

* Have a vocabulary of 200-250 words
* Can form basic sentences with proper grammar as long as the 200-250 words I know are used
* Could speak a simple dialogue using my very limited vocabulary


**My question / the problem**

On this subreddit the general advise is to read a lot of Korean in the form of transcripts/books/comics and/or to watch Korean TV/shows/series.

So my initial thought upon reading this advise was ""Yeah! Makes sense, I should really do this, nothing teaches you faster than being involved in it constantly"".

I started watching a Korean drama and started reading a comic, and here's where my problems come in:

* Spoken Korean in an actual TV series goes really fast for the untrained mind. But even worse, with my limited vocabulary I cannot understand the meaning at all. I recognize sentence endings, honorifics, sometimes I heard a subject case marker or whatever piece of grammar I've already learned, but it's not like I can guess the meaning of a sentence, because I simply do not know the nouns and words used. So does this actually help? I feel like I should just expand my vocabulary knowledge to at least 1500~ words, before I can start understanding entire sentences.
* Same goes for the reading. I open up a comic and I find myself lost in the first bubble. I'm like ""Yeah, I see typical Korean structure in this, no clue what this noun means, nor what this verb means.."". Then I end up using a translator for the most part, and I think to myself: I should actually just be 'grinding' words - expand my vocab. Is it beneficial to keep reading this?
* This is a bit unrelated to the rest of the post, but the book I use seems to be very traditional, maybe even outdated (if this is possible with a language?). It focuses a lot on honorifics, built-in honorific verbs, sentence endings and social ladder. Am I going down a proper path here, or am I wasting my time with things that might not be all that important nowadays?


**To summarize (TL;DR):**
Should I drastically expand my vocabulary before even thinking about watching a Korean show / read a comic. Or should I just watch/read these even though I understand about 1% of it?

It has become very obvious to me that I am going to be in Korea for a very long time. The reason I found myself in this situation is a girl. I met a girl that I plan to marry and I did not come to Korea with that intention at all. In fact I didn't even have it in my mind that I wanted to date anyone, let alone a Korean that is so attached to her family and country. We met almost 3 years ago and the only reason we were able to talk is because she speaks English very well so we're very comfortable speaking English at home.

Unfortunately, this has created a bad habit for us. I'd like to start learning to speak Korean but it's difficult to get out of this habit. One of the main reasons I need to learn to speak Korean is to meet her parents. I'm scared that I don't know nearly enough Korean in order to start speaking to her. To give you an idea, I would estimate that I know thousands of Korean words. However, that doesn't translate to me being able to speak Korean. Basically I don't have zero ability. I have had friends and coworkers recommend that we just stop speaking English entirely. I don't think this will work. Does anyone have any experience with this situation and how did you get your feet wet in speaking? Any particular rules to this that would be useful?

Another difficult part of my situation is I have a job that keeps me very busy. I have been known to work 70 and 80 hour weeks (rarely, but it does happen) and usually work a split shift, getting in contact with coworkers in Europe and America at night. It's one thing to study a language when you have free time or if that's your job (you're a full time student), however, I have a job that frequently interrupts my study schedule so it's hard to form a habit.

One last bit that I would like to mention is that I'm not exactly enthusiastic about learning an entirely different language. Especially one where I am not too enthusiastic about the pop culture available such as dramas and music. I do like a lot of Korean movies and am trying to gain an interest in Korean history, though. I know that it's going to be a very long process and I have no illusions that I will be a will be able to speak very fast. This is actually a very discouraging fact for me.

I speak some Korean, but not enough to confidently talk to strangers. I recently moved into Korea to learn Korean, and I haven't really talked to anyone in this country for about 5 months now. So you guys would probably know that I'm feeling a bit lonely. I go to the internet cafe to play games with my friends that live overseas, etc. But this one cashier has been so kind to me. The way I see it is that Koreans are shy talking to strangers. So I assume that no one would be inclined to talk to me solely because of this and I don't mind that. For the past few days, the cashier has been coming up to me while I was playing games and asking me if I wanted any more drinks, or if I even wanted some of her chicken for dinner. I'm PRETTYYY sure that employees at internet cafes aren't required to do so. She talks to me but I can't really hold a conversation with her due to my lack of Korean knowledge. All I can say is ""thank you"" or ""no thank you"" very simple dialect.

I really want to thank her for making me feel less lonely. My first issue is that I'm REALLY shy at approaching people. So I decided to write her a letter, just full of my gratitude and gratefulness. The next issue is that, the letter is in English. I don't think I would be able to write as much as I could in Korean without losing the stuff I want to get through. I'm not going to ask someone from /r/Korean to translate the entire letter for me. 

Now that you guys know my dilemma, I just wanted to hand her the letter and say in Korean **Although this letter is in English, I hope you will understand how grateful I am.**

This is my first post in /r/Korean and I'm sorry if my post didn't follow accordingly to the rules.

**EDIT** thank you everyone for helping out! Believe it or not I feel a bit motivated to give her the letter now. I'll report back tomorrow!!

I don't know if any of you know about Benny the Irish Polyglot. He's a minor celebrity in the CouchSurfing and language learning communities. Basically his bit is that he goes to a new country on a 90-day tourist visa and then studies the language all day, every day. He speaks 8 or 9 languages, I think. I've been reading his book, ""The Language Hacking Guide"". He has a lot of advice about how to force yourself to use the target language instead of English, and the biggest piece of advice is ""speak from day one"": try to do everything you do in your target language, and make mistakes constantly; that way you're learning.

I'm embarrassed by the fact that I lived in Korea for two years and still don't know how to say some pretty basic things. I put myself in the ""English bubble"" and didn't ever really immerse myself in the language.

Now I'm not living in Korea, and I really miss it. I wanted to make a big goal for myself that will kick-start my Korean learning and motivate me to get back to KimchiLand.

I set up a daily Skype language exchange with a friend's younger sister (university student) who wants to move to the U.S. next year. I'll spend an hour speaking Korean most days, and I'll spend a couple of hours studying.

I think the most important thing for me is to make short and long term goals, so I decided to take the next TOPIK test in October. I'll be motivated to study every day, and I'll get a ton of positive feedback once I pass the test!

First off, don't consider the title of the post to mean that I'm giving up, that's not going to happen!

So tonight I realized that a lot of the advice I've been taking regarding Korean has been from learners who aren't fluent. It made me wonder... why aren't they fluent? Why are these bloggers that dedicate so much time to learning a language not seeing good results?

I decided to search Google for foreigners who have actually become fluent in Korean. Well, not to discourage any of you but, there aren't that many. They do exist though! Unfortunately not many of them are bloggers that learnt from the Internet and are now returning their wisdom.

Now while I couldn't find the advice of foreigners that became fluent in Korean, there is plenty of advice from *genuine experts in acquiring languages*. (Some of you may have heard of ""Benny the Irish Polyglot"" who learns languages fluently in 3 months. His technique mainly involves immersion which isn't possible for myself, and I appreciate that it isn't possible for many of you reading this).

The *main* thing all these guys advocate is the **need to get rid of one-to-one translations** (at least eventually). They create an extra required step in our heads that slows us down in listening and speaking. Don't just take my word for it, check out these two posts from a guy who becomes fluent in a language EVERY FUCKING YEAR o.0

Wahhh, what about my beautiful Anki deck :(? I can't just lay it to rest, can I?

Well I might say that Anki has helped me tremendously, I definitely want to say that because of how much time I've put into it. Alright fair enough, I'm **slow** to understand and speak and I'll admit it must be down to the translations I have to go through every time in my head. So combining my stubbornness with the great advice from a professional that is in front of me, I'm going to compromise. When I reach a point where I've learned enough vocabulary through Anki (because I find it helps memorization immensely) I'll find a way to see the words for what they really are, and not just their English equivalent.

Today we're gonna talk about three words: this, that, and that (far away object - over there). This seems pretty straightforward but very useful in learning the Korean languages.

- This: 이것 (written), 이거 (spoken)

- That: 그것 (written), 그거 (spoken)

- That (over there): 저것 (written), 저거 (spoken)

So some simple examples of how to use these words:

1) 그것 뭐야? What is that? (Used for close proximity to the object). In the case of an object far away write (or speak) 저것 뭐야?

2) 저거 누구예요? Who is that? 

3) 이것 누구 책이에요? Whose book is this?

Pretty easy no? How about places? Let's talk about the words: here, there, there (far away).

- Here: 여기

- There: 거기

- There (far away): 저기

You'll probably notice these are very similar to one another. Hopefully this makes things easier, rather than harder. 

Some examples:

1) 지금 거기 희남 있어요? Is Heenam there now?

2) 여기는 미국이에요. This is America.

3) 제 가방은 저기 있어요. My bag is over there.


 - If you are having difficulty on this topic, [here's a link](http://parksguide.blogspot.com/2006/11/another-useful-this-it-and-that.html) to this topic on the other grammar blog which may also help you and has additional examples (as well as the formal level - which I am not covering here if you are interested in it).

**So, questions/comments on this lesson?**

EDIT: Thanks *roflburger* for bringing up a good point I missed. You can also use these pronouns to demonstrate, or point our a particular noun. Think as if you are pointing to the noun you are talking about. In this case you use:

- 이 + noun = this noun ---&gt; Ex: 이책은 재미있어요. (This book is interesting.)

- 그 + noun = that noun ---&gt; Ex: 그사람은 한국사람 이에요. (That person is Korean.)

- 저 + noun = that noun over there ---&gt; Ex. 저건물이 뭐예요? (What building is that over there?)

- 어느 + noun = which noun ---&gt; 어느극장이 뭐예요? (Which theater is this?)

1262556247.0,10,self.Korean,al5ng,[중급의] More common expressions in Korean!,chem_vixen,10,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/al5ng/중급의_more_common_expressions_in_korean/,"So if you've been following the posts, you should be able to construct some basic sentences by now. Here we'll discuss a few more common expressions to help expand your vocabulary even more.


- *To want* (a noun)


We have previously discussed ""to want"" but this was for verbs (-고 싶다). However, to say you want a noun you use the verb 원하다 which means to want (a noun). However to say someone else wants to do something, you use -고 싶어하다. Just attach to the verb stem.


Examples to show the distinction:

1) 자고 싶어요. (I want to sleep.)

2) 엄마가 자고 싶어해요. (Mom wants to sleep.)

3) 차를 훤해요. (I want tea.)


- *currently doing/happening*


Aside from present tense you can express that you're currently doing something or something is happening right now using -고 있어요. Just attach to the verb stem.


Examples: 

1) 먹고 있어요. (I'm currently eating.)

2) 책을 읽고 있어요. (I'm currently reading a book.)


- *to have to, to need to*


Use this to express that you have to or need to do something. Using -야 되다, drop 요 from the SP conjugation of the verb and add this. 


Examples:


1) 자야 돼요. (I have to/need to sleep.)


2) 화학을 공부해야 돼요. (I have to study chemistry.)


- *can/be able to*


Take the verb stem and add -(으)ㄹ 수 있어요 to express ability. Depending on the verb stem ending, 을 or ㄹ is added. See the examples below.


Examples:


1) 김치를 먹을 수 있어요. (I can eat kimchi.)


2)  학교에 갈 수 있어요. (I can go to school.)


- *may/have permission to*


To express that you may or have permission to do something, attach -도 되다 to the informal conjugation of the verb. Be careful as this is similar to express ""have/need to"".


Examples:


1) 가도 돼요. (I may go.)


2) 밥을 먹어도돼 돼요. (I have permission to eat the rice.)




**HOMEWORK** Translate the following sentences from English to Korean. This will also help test your use of particles as well. If there's a word here you don't know use (www.dic.naver.com) to find it!


1) I have to work.

2) I want an apple.

3) I want to eat rice.

4) Heenam (희남) wants to go to the store.

5) I can swim well.

6) I have permission to drive the car.

7) I need to do homework. 

8) I am currently eating kimchi.

9) I want a computer.

10) Mom wants to buy rice.",,False,,t5_2rd8q,True,,,True,t3_al5ng,http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/al5ng/중급의_more_common_expressions_in_korean/,moderator
1259159129.0,9,self.Korean,a826y,[Beginner] Forming words...,chem_vixen,10,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/a826y/beginner_forming_words/,"It can be difficult to learn a language such as Korean since the alphabet is different from English. And you'll learn that there are certain sounds in English you will not hear in Korean and sometimes the lines are a little fuzzy between some sounds because they are similar (i.e. ㄱ g/k sound).
 
But once you've familiarized yourself with the alphabet and the accompanying sounds, the next step is understanding how to form word. If you see a word in Korean, they look like the word is comprised of blocks and you're right. Syllabic blocks to be more precise. Each block comprises it's own syllable and thus contributes one sound to the word. There are some general rules for constructing syllables:

- Each syllable starts with a consonant.
- Must contain atleast one consonant and one vowel. 
- Placement of consonants depends on the vowel used. For example:

리 : The consonant goes first and is *to the left* of the vowel because it is a vertical vowel.

조 : The consonant goes first and is *above* the vowel because it is a horizontal vowel. 

You'll notice that there are more complex constructions of syllables, just looking at the word 한글, we see that there can be more than one consonant in a syllable. Additionally you'll note that these consonants go under the first consonant and vowel. [Here](http://imgur.com/LC86K.png) is a good picture of the construction of the blocks in the case of two vowels (i.e. the complex vowels) and more than 1 consonant.

Also, check out some of these links for some more practice, especially with sounding the syllables:

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Lee,

Everything is good here. The weather is getting hot which I like and the outside world looks beautiful. 

I am glad to hear Chaemoon is well.  Even after all these months we are still getting used to a quiet house.  My heart skips a beat every time he texts me (even if it is 2am ^^).  Everything still reminds us of him and I think it always will. You have raised a wonderful son, I know you are very proud of him and so are we!

I know Chaemoon is making some big decisions for his life right now. If he comes back here, there will be rough times. I can’t guarantee he will go to the college he wants to go to or that he will get the job he wants or a green card. I know he will get homesick, that happened often when he was here, but this time it’s not over in a year. I can guarantee to provide, love and protect him to the very best of my ability. That I promise you. My prayer each night is for him to be happy and successful. 

I thank you sincerely for the gifts. They were very thoughtful and sweet. I am sure Chaemoon has told you that I don’t have very good fashion sense so when I took the bag to church everyone said “Chaemoon sent that to you didn’t he? How do you live without him?” 

Truly we are the ones that are thankful to you and are in debt to you. We have prayed many years for a family and then Chaemoon came. The pride and joy you feel each time you look at your children we got to feel too. We were able to experience those everyday moments that families have. It was the most priceless gift we could have received. 

May God bless your family always.

I'm looking for a 3-4 week intensive Korean course in either Seoul or Daejeon while I'm there. 

I lived in Seoul in  2010-2012 but did not pick up much more than basic phrases and reading Hangul while I was there.  I now live in the States and have been seriously studying Korean with the help of my wife for the last two months. I've been making some good progress and plan on keeping this up until we go to to Korea later this year. My wife's parent's can't speak english, so I am extremely motivated to learn Korean so I can actually speak with them without my wife translating.  

While I'm in Korea, my primary goal is to work on my Korean and I would like to get the most of of my month there.  I've seen some posts on intensive Korean courses offered by some of the universities as well as at Hagwons, but I've found that many of the universities don't offer courses during the time frame that I'm there.

So a couple of questions:

1. Does anyone know what opportunities, whether university, Hagwon, (or other) in Seoul or Daejeon that last 3-4 weeks starting end of December or beginning of January?
2. What programs would offer the best returns in the 3-4 week period?
3. What is the application process like for these programs?

Money is not a major factor in my decision, so I am willing to pay more for a university course if it would be better than a hagwon and vice versa.

Thanks!

This is a basic recap of the skype chat on Sunday, November 11, 2012!  Participants, feel free to comment and add/correct :)

First - quick introductions

Second - listening and speaking practice using 취미 (취미가 뭐예요?)
During this part we discovered that lots of people play and enjoy watching Starcraft 2 - 스타2하는 사람들이 많이 있는데요!

Third - ~하는 것 vs ~하기 which in many cases means the same thing, but depending on the verb you tend to use one or the other (longer verb = 하는 것, shorter verb = 하기)

Fourth - ~한지 / (으)ㄴ지 paired with 되다 which we use to mean ""since"" in the time sense rather than the ""since"" using the because sense.  This one was kinda stumping me a little, so I have to practice.

Fifth - ~하기로 하다 (마음을 먹다), to decide to do

Sixth - ㄹ pronunciation guide

Seventh - 가/까/카 pronunciation comparison - put your hand over your mouth and say each sound; 가 and 카 push air out of your mouth while 까 won't push out much of any.  **Special note - ** women and men pronounce this a little differently

Eighth - we were going to do 받침 but around this time we had biscuits and his ... wife? girlfriend? who bumped it up a notch.  We did some vocabulary quizzes ranging from words like 학교 &amp; 병원 to ""inlaws on the mother's side"" (I don't remember the word)

Ninth - Counting to five using the hanja 正 ([http://dicimg.naver.com/hanja/stroke/11-09-15-05.gif](http://dicimg.naver.com/hanja/stroke/11-09-15-05.gif) for stroke order)

Tenth - Throat clearing sound mostly used by older people or for funny/emphasis

Eleventh - Idioms and ""사자성어"" (4 character idioms based on Chinese characters"" (e.g. 고진감래)

We're back today with a lesson in using a very common conjunction: and. It might be a little different to speak English without it. Hopefully, after you learn how to use it in Korean, your conversations might flow a little better.

**and**

There are several different forms that are used in Korean. 
- 그리고: which is used to join sentences only. The sentences are still separate but linked by the conjuction. Example: 어제 한국어를 공부했어요. 그리고 희남 씨랑 얘기했어요. (Yesterday I studied Korean. And talked with Heenam.)

- 와 and 과:  this is used as and to link two nouns together. Use 와 when the noun does not have a final consonant and 과 when there is a final consonant present. Examples of both cases: 너와 나 (You and I) and 책과 음악 (books and music)

**and/with** 

- 랑 and 이랑: Similar to the above case. This can mean either with or and and is used to join nouns together. 랑 is added to nouns which end in vowels and 이랑 is used for nouns that end in consonants. Also, for a string of nouns in one sentence, the conjunction is used for all nouns except for the last one. For a simple examples of all cases: 밥이랑 두부랑 고기 먹었어요. (I ate rice and tofu and beef.) 


Hopefully I've missed any typos but if you find any, please feel free to point them out so I can edit them. Questions/Comments? **EDIT** Also, don't hesitate to use this space to practice. If you feel inclined try writing some sentences here using and/with and allow others to translate them back to english.

1263864003.0,8,self.Korean,ar8nq,[중급의]Adjectives,chem_vixen,9,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/ar8nq/중급의adjectives/,"Seems like a pretty straight forward concept in English: adjectives. In Korean, they are also rather simple to form, of course there are always exceptions.


So to make adjectives, you start with a descriptive verb that you want to use to describe a particular noun. 

1) Regular verbs: Drop '다' from the verb and add 'ㄴ' or '은' depending on the ending of the verb.

Ex: 행복하다 (v. to be happy) --&gt; 행복하 + 'ㄴ' = 행복한 (adj)

행복한 사람 (happy person)


2) For verbs that end in 'ㅂ' - drop the 'ㅂ' and add 우 + 'ㄴ' to make the adjective

Ex: 덥다 (v. to be hot) --&gt; 더 + 우 + ㄴ = 더운 (adj)

버운밥 (hot rice/meal)


3) verbs ending in 'ㄹ' - drop the 'ㄹ' and add 'ㄴ'

Ex: 멀다 (v. to be far away) --&gt; 머 + ㄴ = 먼 (adj)

먼집 (far away house)


4) 있다/없다 verbs - drop '다' and add '는' to make an adjective

Ex: 재미없다 (v. to not be interesting) --&gt; 재미없 + 는 = 재미없는 

재미없는 사람


Ok, so that's really all there is to it. Now here's some homework for you to practice with.


**HOMEWORK**
Take these verbs provided here and convert them into an adjective. Once you've done that, I've also provided an English word for you to write in Korean and describe with the adjective written. (Also, you should look up the verbs so you can learn more verbs and their meanings!)

1)작다, house


2) 비싸다, wristwatch


3) 싸다, beer


4) 크다, car


5) 재미있다, book


6) 멋있다, friend


7) 맜있다, meal


8) 좋다, music


9) 길다, hair


10) 춥다, weather


**EDIT**

Using more than one adjective in a sentence. This has a different structure from the adjectives described above, but is much simpler. You just take the descriptive verb you wish to use, drop '다' and add '고' to use multiple adjectives. Here you don't have to worry about the different irregular verbs, much easier right? 

So perhaps an example:  나는 진짜 맜있고 맵고음식을 원해요! (I really want delicious spicy food!) ",,False,,t5_2rd8q,True,,,True,t3_ar8nq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/ar8nq/중급의adjectives/,moderator

A: 학교 식당은 유니온 빌딩 안에 있어요.

B: 도서관 밑에도 학교 식당이 있어요.

In ""A"", the cafeteria gets a topic marking particle, while in ""B"" it gets a subject marker instead. In both sentences though, its about where the cafeteria is in the school, so why does the particle it gets change?

I have done some thinking about it, and all I can think is maybe it gets marked with a topic first, and then gets a subject because its already understood to be a topic? Then I have another thought: if that is true, would giving the cafeteria in ""B"" a topic particle change the sentence from ""It's also under the library"" to ""there is another cafertia under the library""?

And one final thought about subject particles:

저는 학생이 아니에요.

Why is it with the verb ""to not be"", the subject marker isn't what we would normally call the subject? The subject in the setence is normally what the setence is about right? So why isn't it with ""I"" instead of ""student""?

I took two classes of Korean about two years ago in college and I would love to continue learning it. I would like to become fluent and take the skills to become a translator or an interpreter. My current job is alright, but it doesn't interest me at all.

Anyway, I did pretty well in those classes, I'm sure I've lost some touch with it, as I didn't really practice speaking, but I did a lot of reading and writing. I plan on taking classes again, but I have no idea where to start. I feel like if I start from the beginning, I'd crush it, but if I start at the next level, I might be lost. I guess the logical step is too start from the beginning, but if there was some test I can take, it would clearly tell me if I need to take classes from the beginning, or merely review old text books and go to the next level.

It's been a journey, but I've been getting better and better at figuring out the difference between them all and I wanted to make 100% sure I'm doing it right.

ㅂ ㅈ ㄷ ㄱ--These guys are unaspirated (no puff of air). I like to think of my mouth as being very lazy when I pronounce these guys, and it feels kind of like I'm holding my breath. Their sound changes depending on where they are in a word so they can either have a b, j, d, g sound or a p, ch, t, k sound. 

ㅍ ㅊ ㅌ ㅋ--These guys are aspirated (puff of air) and are pronounced with the same p, ch, t, and k  sound that most English words start with, which is why a lot of words adapted from English words (커피, 텔레비전) use these characters/letters.

ㅃ ㅉ ㄸ ㄲ--These guys gave me some trouble but I think I understand them better then I did before. I've been doing research lately and this is what I've come up with (correct me if I'm wrong, because I still don't fully understand double consonants).

ㅃ ㅉ ㄸ ㄲ are stressed/tensed versions of ㅂ ㅈ ㄷ ㄱ (which actually makes no sense to an English speaker). Firstly, unlike the single consonants, these double consonants do not change their sound. They will always have a b, j, d, g sound, but to be more accurate they have a bb, jj, dd, gg sound (which makes more sense to an English speaker, but they still won't understand what that means fully). I always thought stressed/tensed version meant I needed to use a higher tone of voice, use more emphasis, more abdominal strength, to pronounce these consonants, and while this may or may not be true, these consonants should be explained in a better way. In English, b, j,d, and g are pretty much tensed versions of p, ch, t, and k so is this what they mean by tensed? 

But these double consonants aren't exactly like b, j, d, and g either but more like bb, jj, dd, and gg. What does that mean exactly? Cause I'm not too sure. Maybe it does mean there more emphasized than just a single b, j, d, g consonant. Or maybe they are held slightly longer, like ㅅ and ㅆ. Or maybe there is no difference. Maybe these double consonants sound the same as the single consonants (in there b, j, d, g form) and the consonants are only different in spelling (I read somewhere that this is sometimes true) So which is it?

What is the difference in pronunciation between 아바 and 아빠? Or is it just a spelling difference (because as far as I know 아바 isn't a real word).

I'll try to keep it short... I'm 100% Korean, but I was born in America. I used to speak only Korean until I started grade school where I learned how to speak English. My Korean slowly faded away year after year.

When I started high school I took a Korean class to relearn everything, especially how to read and write since I never knew how. In about a month I could read and write Hangul, but sadly I don't understand a lot of what I'm reading and my reading isn't at all fast. However I moved and that class was no longer available after about half a year which is when I moved on and learned Spanish.

Finally... I'm kind of sad that I can't seem to pronounce words very well anymore. My Korean accent is almost completely gone from speaking primarily English for the past few years. Its either that or its because I have braces thats messing me up, because I also have trouble pronouncing some English words.

Can any redditors help guide me on where I should start? I constantly feel embarrassed whenever I have to talk to a distant relative or family friend that speaks Korean only, only being able to say ""neh"" and nod. Or is it supposed to be ""yeh"", because its honorific? If so, I probably disrespected a LOT of people..

**To want to**

In order to express your desire to do something you use ""-고 싶다"" with verbs that express action. So to use it you take the desire you are trying to express, let's use to sleep ""자다"". Just take the verb stem, in this case '자' and attach '고 싶다' and conjugate 싶다. (I'm neglecting the formal conjugation because I don't think it's very useful.)


SP: 자고 싶어요.

I: 자고 싶어.


Pretty straight forward, right? Also, as an additional note, if you use the verb 보다 (to see) with this phrase, '보고 싶어요' can mean ""I want to see"" but can also be used to express 'I miss you'. 


**Can't**

In order to say that you 'can't' do something, you use the adverb '못'. For regular verbs, just place it in front of the conjugated verbs, but for 하다 verbs the placement is a little different. For verbs like, 좋아하다, the adverb gets placed in front of the verb as well: 못 좋아해요 (I can't like). However, for verbs like 전화하다 (to call), which is constructed from a noun + 하다 then you place 못 in between the noun and 하다: 전화 못 해요. (I can't call.)


**HOMEWORK**

As request by one of the readers, here's some homework for you to try. Post your homework here, or, if you don't have the Korean keyboard installed then write it out by hand and if you can take a picture and post that here.

1) Take the following verbs and express your desire to want to and also express that you can't in Formal, Standard Politeness and Informal conjugation levels: 

a. 일하다 (to work)

b. 울다 (to cry)

c. 여행하다 (to travel)

d. 읽다 (to read)

e. 가다 (to go)

f. 사다 (to buy)

g. 마시다 (to drink)

h. 공부하다 (to study) 


2. Take your skills a step further and express the above conjugations in Past and Future tenses. 


3. Translate the following sentences in English:

a. 저는 진짜로 김치를 먹고 싶어요!

b. 희남씨는 소주를 못 마셔요.

c. 저는 안 일고 싶어! 

d. 책을 사고 싶어요. 

e. 못 봐요!!!! 

f. 기은씨는 진짜로 한국에 가고 싶어요.

질문:

1.  ""신뢰가 가다""와 ""신뢰가 있다""는 똑같은 뜻이에요?
2.  저는 문맥을 통해 ""나의 비밀을 말 할 수 있는 사람""은 ""내가 비밀을 말하면 다른 사람에게 한 마디 못하는 사람""이란 뜻을 알고 있어요.  하지만 만약 문맥이 없고 저는 이런 글을 읽다면 ""내가 내 (소중한?) 비밀을 말하면 해당 사람에게 말할 수 있는 사람""이란 뜻을 알텐데요.  정말 이 문구가 완전 다른 두 가지 의미를 지니고 있어요?

English translation, in case my Korean is horrible:

From the webtoon [""마음의 소리""](http://comic.naver.com/webtoon/detail.nhn?titleId=20853&amp;no=746&amp;weekday=tue):

&gt; 애봉이: 내가 어떻게 하면 신뢰가는 사람이 될수있으까? 

&gt; 조석: 음...나의 비밀을 말 할 수 있는 사람 ~~ 그런 묘한 힘을 가진 사람이 되어야지

Questions:

1.  Does ""신뢰가 가다"" mean the same thing as ""신뢰가 있다""?
2.  Based on the context, I know that ""나의 비밀을 말 할 수 있는 사람"" means ""a person to whom I can tell my secrets"".  But had I read the phrase without any context, I would have thought the meaning to be ""a person who can tell my secrets""!  Can this phrase really be interpreted in these two completely opposite ways?

-------------

EDIT: 3rd question!!  I don't like how I wrote question #2 in Korean.  Are the following translations acceptible?

가뭄

                 김민지


빛은 가둔 블라인드 사이로 열차가 지나간다


기침소리에 맞춰 어깨를 흔드는 사람들


핸드폰 액정을 쳐다보는동안


혀는 마른 입술을 적신다


목구멍이 간지러운 사람들


갈라진 식도의 끝을 핥고 싶다


창가에 앉은 여자는


담벼락에 풍경을 찍은 사진을 내걸고


오래도록 그녀 안에서 방치된 말은


배를 뒤집은 채 펄떡이고 있다


-긁고 싶어


기침을 하자


말의 잔재가 공중으로 흩어졌다


맞은 편 아저씨의 귓바퀴에


귀지처럼 앉은 잔재들


누군가 나에게 말을 거나


하고 복도에 던졌던 그의 시선이


다시 신문에 박혔다


남자가 후- 불어낸 그녀의 잔재가


누군가의 옷에 내려 앉는다


곧 비듬처럼 털어지겠지


한 단어가 그녀 안에서 


말라가는 물고기처럼 죽어가고 있다

I'm a white girl, pregnant with the son of my ex long-term boyfriend, a Korean-American.  He intends to remain involved with the baby, I intend to let him, and I would like my kid to feel connected with his roots.  The baby's father won't be around very much, due to his lifestyle choices and the fact that he lives far away, but I live close to his mother.  

After the baby is born, and the hospital stay is through, I have decided that it will be best for baby and I to spend the first day out of the hospital at his paternal grandmother's house (very long story, but it's the best option), and then I will return to my parents' house.  Baby's father will be at his mother's house on that day as well.

The ex's mother is very supportive of me, and wants to be as accommodating as possible, but I have encountered difficulty with her in the past due to the language/cultural barrier (she moved here from South Korea in the 70's).  She speaks fairly good English, but sometimes the meaning can become obscured and we have misunderstandings.  I very much would like my boy to have a good relationship with his grandmother, however, and would therefore like to know if you have any tips on what I might expect to encounter right after the birth.  She is a caring woman who appears quite willing to help me, but at times I have found it difficult to manage the cultural divide, e.g., sometimes I wonder if she actually doesn't understand what I mean, or if she is just feigning misunderstanding because she doesn't agree with me.  Hard to tell.  Also, his grandmother's older sister will very likely be there... and, while I generally like the baby's grandmother, his great aunt is a narcissistic, unpleasant woman who bosses her little sister around.  *She* would be a nightmare if I had to be at odds with her.

Anyway, I'd appreciate if any of you could offer some insight as to what I might expect in this situation.  For instance, I heard from a friend that Korean women tend to try to take the baby from the mother except when he needs to eat, so that she can recuperate more quickly (I don't know if this is true, but would not want this if it were).  Since my ex has been kind of an ass recently, I haven't been able to talk to him much about this, except to tell him that I will need a space where the baby and I can rest if I feel too overloaded by the situation.  Any advice on what I might expect would be appreciated - this will already be emotionally difficult, and I think I'd be better off if I had an idea of what was coming.

**TL;DR:** I'm a white girl about to give birth to a half-Korean baby boy.  Dad is not terribly in the picture, but his first-generation, generally nice mother and extremely domineering aunt are.  I will be visiting the family the day after I leave the hospital.

I've been working on the alphabet, hoping that it will give me a better basis for saying words. I've been having a lot of pronunciation issues. Every bit of Korean I know right now, which granted isn't a lot, is based on me hearing something and then saying it. The way I thought things are ""spelled"" (with English characters) are not correct, so I imagine learning the alphabet would help me.

For example, I learned ""suddenly"", which I thought was ""cupchagi."" I learned that it's more like ""gabjagi,"" even though the pronunciation is very similar to me.

I'd like a site or something that has sounds bits of every vowel and consonant. I've been using [this](http://www.koreanwikiproject.com/wiki/index.php?title=Learn_hangeul), but for some reason, it doesn't have individual sounds clips for the consonants, which really bothers me. 

Also, something to help me on pronunciations? One word that got me laughed at a lot was water, or ""mul."" My friend tried to help me with it forever. First she'd make fun of me for the wrong ""oo"" sound, then the wrong ""l"" sound. That word is actually demonstrated on the site I just linked, but they say it so fast I can't even see what I'm doing wrong.

1261939516.0,7,self.Korean,aiyf4,[초보자의/중급의] It's a Particle Party!,chem_vixen,7,0,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/aiyf4/초보자의중급의_its_a_particle_party/,"So up until now, we've negelected discussing particles, but you may have noticed them popping up in the examples we use. So here's a little description of some of the particles you've seen. Please note that there are generally two options for particles: one which begins in a vowel and one beginning in a consonant. You choose based on what the word they are following ends with but the meaning is the same (see the examples with each for clarification).


1) Topic marking particle (은/는) - This follows the topic noun of a descriptive sentence.

- 희남은 키가 각아요. (Heenam is small.)

- 정호는 키가 커요. (Jeongho is big.)


2) Object marking particles (을/를) - These are used to indicate the object of the sentence and imply that an action is being taken. So this indicates what/whom the action is being performed on.

- 아만다가 커피를 마셔요. (Amanda drinks a coffee.)

- 키은이 아침을 먹어요. (Kieun eats breakfast.)


3) Subject particles (이/가) - These determine the subject of a sentence that depicts an action is being done so this indicated the who is doing the action. (See the above object particle examples.)


4) Location particles (에/에서) - 에 is used for directional movement to an indicated location while 에서 is a setting or location of an activity.

- 마이클은 내일 LA에 가요. (Michael goes to LA tomorrow.)

- 혁는 병원에서 일해요. (Hyuck works at a hospital.)


5) Comparison particles (도,만) - 도 is used to indicate similarity and 만 is used as ""only"" or uniqueness.

- 정호는 의사 예요. 희남도 의사 예요. 마이클만 선생님 이애요. (Jeongho is a doctor. Heenam is also a doctor. Only Michael is a teacher.)



Also, we also should note that often particles are omitted in speech but the meaning or intent of the sentence is still maintained with their omission. 


So have a look through the old examples we've used and make sure you understand why each particle was used. Now you should be able to construct some sentences on your own! So...


**HOMEWORK** Try your hand at writing some full sentences in Korean and post them here. Feel free to use the verbs/nouns we've shared here or look up your own at the Naver dictionary. Here's a few sentences to get you started (Translate from English to Korean!)

2) My friend lives in Germany.

3) I don't have any beer at home.

4) I am studying Korean.

1260973556.0,7,self.Korean,afbtf,[Resources] Textbooks,chem_vixen,8,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/afbtf/resources_textbooks/,"We had a request for suggestions on textbooks for *studying/learning* Korean. Here are some of the more highly recommended books:


1) **Integrated Korean** developed by the Korean Language Education and Research Center. They have a series of books from [beginner](http://www.amazon.com/Integrated-Korean-Beginning-Textbooks-Language/dp/0824834402/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1260972037&amp;sr=8-1) to [high advanced](http://www.amazon.com/Integrated-Korean-Advanced-Textbooks-Language/dp/0824825691/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1260972037&amp;sr=8-12). 


2) **Elementary Korean** Which is definitely a good place to start if you are a [beginner](http://www.amazon.com/Elementary-Korean-Tuttle-Language-Library/dp/0804836140) with not much knowledge on Korean. This book is then complimented by **Continuing Korean** which is proceeds to [more advanced](http://www.amazon.com/Continuing-Korean-Ross-King/dp/080483430X) studies of the Korean language.


3) **National Institute of the Korean Language and The International Korean Language Foundation Series** This series is also pretty basic but one of the [textbooks](http://www.amazon.com/Listening-Korean-Beginners-w-CDs/dp/1565912470/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1260972684&amp;sr=1-3) also includes audio which is really useful in learning how to pronounce the characters.


4) **Sogang Series** This [series of books](http://www.amazon.com/Sogang-Korean-various-authors-Song-hee/dp/8976995775/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1260973002&amp;sr=1-2) comes highly recommended, however these books do not have English in them so they won't really be useful unless you are already good at reading Korean or have a good dictionary. 

**EDIT:** 5) **Korean Made Easy** This is another basic beginner [book](http://www.amazon.com/Korean-Made-Easy-w-CD/dp/B0027Z4KZW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1261020293&amp;sr=8-2) which also has a phrase book and CD to accompany the lessons. I own this one and it's good for the basics but it doesn't seem very easy to acquire. But, it's good for having audio so you can hear the pronunciation.


If you need help with *reading/writing Hangul* then I suggest you head over to the [KoreanClass101.com channel on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvcKYW5ustw). I know it's not a textbook, but their videos are pretty useful for beginners and it's also a free resource that they've made available instead of having to pay for access to their site.

**EDIT2** 6) **Active Korean** (as suggested by *aussiekevin*) Another [series](http://hanbooks.com/acko1wcd.html) which promises to be on par with Integrated Korean. Also includes CDs which is good for learning pronunciation.

If you are interested in learning about the Korean language from a *linguistics/cultural point of view* the best resource available for this is:

**The Korean Language (SUNY Series in Korean Studies)** I do own this [book](http://www.amazon.com/Korean-Language-Suny-Studies/dp/0791448320/ref=sr_1_17?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1260972844&amp;sr=1-17) and have read a portion of it so far. I find it useful for understanding the origins of the language, which is interesting to me. It also can help to understand some questions about the language which native speakers themselves may not be able to answer.",,False,,t5_2rd8q,True,,,True,t3_afbtf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/afbtf/resources_textbooks/,moderator
1259982426.0,7,self.Korean,aba87,[Beginner] Hada (하다) verbs,chem_vixen,8,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/aba87/beginner_hada_하다_verbs/,"This post is about....you guessed it...hada verbs. These are verbs that end in 하다 so they are really easy to spot and also recognize (I think). So first, 하다 itself is a verb and means ""to do"". A very wide range of verbs can be formed using 하다 by tacking it onto the end of a word. As examples:

일 + 하다 (""work"" + ""to do"") = 일하다 (to work)

공부 + 하다 (""study"" + ""to do"") = 공부하다 (to study)

사랑 + 하다 (""love"" + ""to do"") = 사랑하다 (to love)

And hopefully you get the gist by now. So how are hada verbs conjugated in present tense? As with the normal verbs previously discussed the verb stem 다 is dropped and the ending for all 하다 verbs are as follows:

Formal: 합니다 ( 하 + ㅂ니다)

SP: 해요 (하 + 여요)

I: 해 (하+ 여)


So since this applies to all hada verbs let's conjugate the above three examples in the various levels of politeness:


**공부하다**

F: 공부합니다

SP: 공부해요

I: 공부해


**일하다**

F: 일합니다

SP: 일해요

I: 일해


**사랑하다**

F: 사랑합니다

SP: 사랑해요

I: 사랑해


Got it? Here's a few for you to try on your own.

- 시작하다 (to start)

- 햏복하다 (to be happy)

- 좋아하다 (to like)

- 싫어하다 (to dislike)

- 미안하다 (to be sorry)

I've been learning (or trying to learn) Korean for the past couple of months. it started off okay; I was surprised how quickly I was able to learn the Korean alphabet, but now I'm at an impasse. Learning how to recognize and pronounce the Korean alphabet took a few days, and I practice reading quite often (although I don't know exactly what I'm reading -- it helps with my pronunciation).

Now for the past two months, I feel like I haven't made any progress -- other than the alphabet/pronunciation. I don't really know where to go from here. I've tried to wing it; watching Youtube videos, visiting various websites, etc. but what I think I'm lacking is insight. I jumped into it blindly, but I am quite serious in wanting to learn and be fluent in Korean.

Can anyone point me in the right direction? Where do I go after learning the alphabet/pronunciation? Did you have a set itinerary when you decided to learn Korean, or did you wing it, like I'm doing? I have so many questions, but I'm not sure what they are (if that makes sense).

I would love to hear what path everyone has taken to reach where you have gotten.

Thank you for taking the time to hear me out -- I look forward to hearing from everyone!

[YOUTUBE VIDEO HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoMMCrwkeGs)

It has been 11 days since my last video update. I said I would make a video every week, and I failed already!

The good news is, I have been studying Korean for at least an hour or two every day. I send and receive text messages with my Korean friends. I am doing a Skype conversation with my language exchange partner 2 or 3 times a week.

I started studying for the TOPIK beginner exam by downloading all of the test files for the 30th TOPIK Beginner test. I'm slowly working my way through all of them.

I downloaded Level 1 and Level 2 of the Talk to Me in Korean .pdf and .mp3 files. I finished Level 1, and made it through the first 5 lessons of Level 2.

I made an Anki deck that currently has about 200 cards. I haven't been reviewing it every day, that's something that I need to be more disciplined about.

I haven't been able to follow the ""speaking from day one"" advice. Even during my language exchange, I often say something in English when I could try to say it in Korean. That's something that I need to do better.

I'm spending about 25 hours a week studying. That's good, but not great. When I get home next month, I plan to spend a solid 40 hours a week for the two months leading up to my exam.

Overall grade: B. 

Thanks for the support. 고맙습니다.

The exercise is to fill in the blanks with 이/가, 은/는, or 도.

Question 2 is:
A: 소피아씨, 2학년이에요?
B: 네, 2학년이에요. 리사씨 --- 2학년이에요?
A: 아니요. 저 --- 2학년이에요.

So A is asking B if she(sophia) is a sophmore
to which B(sophia) replys to A by saying that Yes, she is a sophmore, then following on by asking A, which i assume is Lisa, if they are also a sophmore, which would be the 도 particle because asking if she is to?
But this is where I got really confused,  A responds to B by denying the previous sentance with 아니요, but then continues to say she is? 
""A: 아니요. 저___2학년이에요.""  also the particle for the blank here i used 는 would this be correct?

So to summurize my questions are 
Is this a missprint in the year number on A's reply?  or am i missreading this?
and
Are my choices in particles correct?

1359922324.0,7,self.Korean,17tmaj,Tip for using Korean programs where gibberish is displayed (need native locale),sojubang,8,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/17tmaj/tip_for_using_korean_programs_where_gibberish_is/,"As I shared with some of you last night (if you were on IRC), I went through the process of making applications not display gibberish. For some things, changing the Windows display language to Korean works. For others, you need to change your computer's locale and restart.

The problem comes when you have two conflicting programs that both need their locale to be something else. In my case, I have Windows 7 Ultimate and VMWare Workstation 9 (64-bit) which I need for work. In order to get World of Warcraft in Korean running, I had to change my locale to Korea. Otherwise, when I typed in Korean only ""?"" would be displayed. Nothing else would work, so don't go hitting the comment button unless you have some truly amazing method that not everyone knows about :)

This was fine until I needed to launch a VM which uses two physical HD's attached to my machine. It saved the location as ₩₩,₩PhysicalDrive2 and 3, which caused VMWare Workstation to throw an error message of ""Dictionary Problem"". Well, using VMWare Workstation without the physical devices was not an option and restarting my computer to change the locale and thereby disable it in the process just to play a game was not an option either.

Enter Applocale. https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13209

If you download and install this (either run the command prompt as administrator to run the .msi or disable UAC on Windows 7), then create a shortcut to your program, it will allow you to use USA or whatever for your locale and create a shortcut that starts your program of choice in Korean locale. The only caveat that I've found so far is that it doesn't work for 64-bit programs.

I'm submitting this because it seems like a much more attractive option to those of us that either want to maintain their locale or have programs that have conflicting locale requirements. Anyway, I hope it helps!",,False,,t5_2rd8q,False,,,True,t3_17tmaj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/17tmaj/tip_for_using_korean_programs_where_gibberish_is/,

This will be my second language, and it's pretty exciting especially after memorizing Hangul. While I don't know any words yet aside from 안녕하세요, 감사합니다, 네 and 아니요 (my god it took long to type those out, let me know if I made any mistakes!) I imagine I'll learn more each and every day.

Anyway, straight the question: For a complete beginner, how helpful is watching Korean movies? Should they be watched with English or Korean subtitles? As I only have a small vocab I should be watching them with English subtitles, correct? I'll be honest, I'm just looking for an excuse to watch some Korean movies because I love their horror/thriller/mystery genre (so hopefully they do help!).

Also, I was hoping to get some feedback on some basic Anki cards I add to my deck after each episode of TTMIK for each word:

Card 1 - Korean audio on front, Korean and English meaning on back

Card 2 - Korean on front, Korean audio and English meaning on back

Card 3 - English meaning on front, Korean audio and Korean on back

I randomize all my cards when I do them so I obviously don't get those three cards in a row. I also attempt to write the word in Korean for every card and while it does take long I feel it's helping me remember. Is this good practice? Are there any other cards I should be adding to help me remember?

This is understandable as learning a new language, as with any great endeavour, sees many people begin but not many finish.

I'd like to suggest that an intermediate language speaker is someone who can carry on a conversation with little trouble, watch television and understand most of what they hear, listen to a comedy podcast and be able to follow along, and perhaps read children's stories.

An intermediate language learner is not able to understand the news because the vocabulary is too high, read poetry because the grammar is too obscure, give effective presentations because they lack the social graces known by native speakers, and read novels because they seem impenetrable.

For those of you who have moved on from being an intermediate speaker to an advanced/fluent speaker, what steps did you take? Did it just happen with practice or were you specific in your methods?

Can you give a timeline? How long (of course roughly) did it take you?

All answers are welcome, but I'm particularly interested in those who have done it themselves and know what it took rather than those who, like myself, can only speculate.

Thanks. 감사 감사.

QQ But it’s my own doing, and there is still time to work on it. I’ve been busy. My main thing is I need to make a plan and set aside time: a little bit every day. In some ways it would be good to have structure. 

But that’s hard without a class, which I cannot attend. In any case, I have “basic Korean” by Andrew Byon. It’s a good book. But is dry. That’s not my main problem though. IT gives a list of vocab, and then goes into using it in the lesson. I understand the grammar, but not so much the vocab. I think my main problem with it is the lack of cognates. Compared to Spanish, where you can refer to TONS of nouns, which are pronounced super similarly in the same alphabet, Korean uses hangul to express cognates differently. Furthermore, there are very few cognates. In any case, my big problem is an inability to use my time effectively in studying vocab. I’ve used anki and the like. I just can’t stick with it. Dunno if it’s just my weak will Also have listened to some of the talktomeinkorean.com stuff. It’s all audio, and there are worksheets. Should I use these two in conjunction? The problem with that is you learn expressions first grammar later. But maybe that’s not necessarily bad? Same as with Spanish, if I can get to a basic level, I can read and gain knowledge in the language.

I think the two main big points are

1. what is a good structure to get started with?

I also suggest that listening to some Korean music can help you become more familiar with some word recognition. Alot of the times you can search for the music videos on youtube and you'll be able to find a version with English subtitles. Or you can try to understand them based on the Korean you know. Also, you'll notice alot of the Kpop includes a significant amount of English in the songs, especially since many times, there isn't a Korean equivalent for an English word. You'll find more-so in Korean dramas the [English words are Korean-ized](http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/include/print.asp?newsIdx=49030). To use the example in the article:

Pizza = Pi-Ja 피자

Anyways, back to the point. I am going to suggest the following bands/singers to listen to. I'll be back later with an edit including the Korean characters for the bands (I don't have Korean on my work computer).

Sorry if this is a bit of a silly post, or if the answers are blatantly obvious, but I'm fairly new to learning a language and I'm not quite sure how to go about it.

I've lurked in /r/Korean for roughly a month and a half now and I've read through the Beginner's Guide on the sidebar. From there I've located several resources that come with high recommendations, first among those being Integrated Korean: Beginners and Anki. These are the two tools I'm hoping to focus on, at least in the beginning, when it comes to learning Korean. I've already taught myself how to read, for the most part, and once I'm confident in that I'll move onto learning grammar and increasing my vocabulary.

But before I do, I have a few questions in regards to the two learning tools I mentioned earlier:

In Integrated Korean: Beginner's, there are several points at which most of the learning is supposed to be vocal with a teacher to correct pronunciation etc. For those who have self taught using this book, how did you get around this? Do I simply ignore it and move onto the written parts/grammar? Or do I have to find someone to listen to me speak?

And secondly, I'm completely new to Anki. I downloaded the 1000 common Korean words list for it and I've tried learning using it, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it optimally. Any tips on using Anki in this particular instance would be incredibly helpful.

Again, sorry if this is a stupid post, or if any of these questions are too vague/obvious to really answer. If that's the case feel free to ignore me.

I was born in South Korea but was adopted and emigrated to the United States when I was three months old. I definitely look Korean, but for all intents and purposes, I'm American.

Recently, though, I've been interested in learning a lot more about my Korean heritage. I know I was born in Taegu (Daegu?), and some day I hope to go back when I have the finances. I was given a Korean name at birth, but my adopted parents changed my name when I came here.

I was hoping to get my Korean name tattooed on my arm in the Korean alphabet. I know I could probably find it on my birth certificate, but my dad has it, and I don't see him very often. I've been trying to learn the Korean alphabet, with limited success. So I was hoping someone could verify my efforts.

According to my mom, my Korean name was Hyun-Kyu Lee, which as far as I know is 이 현 규. If someone would be able to verify this, I would greatly appreciate it. I know some people look down upon people who get symbols and/or words that have no colloquial meaning to them, but this would be something personal that would have a lot of meaning to me.

I'm looking for a book (or other resource) for learning Korean. I'd like something detail-oriented to help me thoroughly learn the grammar and nuance of the language; I'm less interested in learning conversational phrases (although it wouldn't hurt).

I started with an [Introduction to Hangul](http://langintro.com/kintro/toc.htm) and worked through the [Korean Wiki Project](http://www.koreanwikiproject.com/wiki/index.php?title=Learn_hangeul) lessons. I also did the first few lessons at TTMIK, but I found it less satisfying.

I found [The Korean Language](http://www.amazon.com/Korean-Language-Suny-Studies/dp/0791448320/ref=sr_1_17?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1260972844&amp;sr=1-17) in the Beginner's Resource Thread, and I think it *might* be what I'm looking for. Reviewers seem to have mixed opinions on the romanization scheme it uses, but will this really be a problem if I'm already somewhat comfortable with Hangul? ([One review](http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I0AYL3G1E52F/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=0791448320&amp;nodeID=283155&amp;store=books) gives a really mixed impression.) It otherwise looks like the sort of tome I want on my shelf. If this isn't a good buy, is there something similar I should look at?

Bonus question: In the meantime, I'm going to revisit TTMIK and the Eisenberg tutorials to get more exposure to grammar. Are there any online resources that didn't qualify for the beginners' thread that you recommend?

After getting a bit better, I think my pronunciation improvement has leveled off. My pronunciation in an academic sense is fairly accurate, but the natural inflections in my speech are still far from fluid and still sound very ""white."" The common advice is to speak more often, but I already have several short back-and-forths with my mom, a native speaker, everyday. I watch some Korean dramas and shows, too, but I think that I'm just not absorbing the native inflections. 

Can anyone explain some natural speech patterns and common inflections to me? By this I mean, explain things like when certain sounds are extended or shortened, when pitch is altered, and/or common places for breaks in sentences. 

Also, I often see the word 네가 written in song lyrics, but it almost always sounds like it's sung 니가. I don't recall ever learning the word 니가 and I've only seen it written a handful of times. They seem to be used in the exact same context though. I asked my mom and she said that 네가 is the right word, but it is often said as 니가 for ease of pronunciation and to avoid confusion with 내가. To add to that, she also said that 니가 is not actually a word.

Can anybody explain this further? Or did my mom cover everything correctly?

Finally, 애 vs. 에. I'm sure this question has been brought up before, but I'd like some clarification. My mom said that there is a definite difference in pronunciation between the two, but I can hardly hear it. I also asked one of my Korean friends, and she said that there is no difference. It's possible that because she's younger she was taught that there is no difference, meaning that recently the discrepancy has been more or less phased out. 

Can anyone provide an explanation or possibly upload a file clearly emphasizing the difference?

I won't be finished with college for another three years so I have plenty of time to start learning korean now so that I will be very prepared when I get there.

I've read stories from korean people who dislike when foreigners come to korea with no intention of ever learning the culture or the language. Fortunately for me that is not the case. I've been very interested in the korean culture for a good while now and as said above, plan to pursue living in korea as a life goal of mine. 

**On to the point**

I started learning basic hangul. I was told it was the best place to start. I have a pretty good understanding of it so far give or take a few things here and there. 

My biggest question is where do I go from here? Should I focus on grammar? Learning to pronounce hangul and then further my knowledge on how to read it? It's getting a bit overwhelming having to teach myself due to lack of classes where I'm from (US, Alabama). 

To learn hangul I used these websites:

http://quizlet.com/267257/korean-alphabet-pronunciation-flash-cards/
http://rki.kbs.co.kr/learn_korean/lessons/e_index.htm#

I've been told to STAY AWAY from Rosetta Stone as much as possible. At the same time though I've read it's a good start for beginners. 

My free time is at this time, through the roof so I have basically all the time in the world to study. If I can find the right things to study I could put in 4-6 hours a day in getting my korean speaking to fluency. 

edit: **I am very serious about learning korean for the next 3years.**

I love finding random things on Netflix, and recently they added a ton of Korean television shows from the past couple of years into their directory.  The first one I watched was *Lie To Me*, but I didn't like it much.  Next was *City Hunter* and I loved it.  Now I'm trying to get through *Hero* and it's okay, not my favorite but I'm 8 episodes in and I may as well finish it.

I'm not really familiar with Korean culture, although I do have some exposure to other Asian culture (both Chinese and Japanese).

So, what is the deal with people announcing that they're the first to leave?  Like, someone will leave a restaurant and announce that they will leave first?  Instead of just saying goodnight or whatever.

It seems like everyone in Korea has 3 names, and each has exactly one syllable.  Is there a reason for this?  China is a bit like this, but Japan is not like this at all.

Also, can you recommend any TV shows that are similar to *City Hunter* and are either available on Netflix or on torrents?

One final question... what is Korean food like?  The reason I ask is because where I live, we have a large Chinese and Korean population, and almost no Japanese, but the restaurants, are either Chinese or sushi/hibachi and they're all staffed by Koreans.  I guess it seems odd to me that there aren't more Korean eateries.

“26일 오후 2시 건양대병원. 평범해 보이는 소년이 피아노 선율과 함께 병원 자선 음악회에서 부를 가곡을 연습하고 있다. 스스로 ‘뼈 나이와 생각 나이는 40대 중반’이라는 어른스런 소년가장 최선봉군(18·대전예고 2년)이다. 성악을 시작한 지 3년. 그는 평범한 가정에서도 뒷바라지가 힘들다는 예술고등학교에서 성악을 전공한다.
“대전 한 터미널 인근 나이트클럽에서 성악가를 초청한 적이 있었어요. 손님에게 껌을 팔기 위해 업소에 들어갔는데 음악을 듣는 순간 전기에 감전되는 것 같았죠.”
하지만 최군은 원하는 공부를 할 수 있는 형편이 못된다. 태어나자마자 부모에게 버림받은 후 서울의 한 보육원에 맡겨져 5살 때까지 지내다 ‘탈출’했다. 이후 대전에 정착해 길에서 자랐다.
“배가 고프니까 어린 나이에도 뭐든 하게 되더라고요. 터미널에 오가는 사람에게 껌과 박카스를 팔면서 하루하루 생활했어요. 잠은 계단이나 화장실에서 잤죠.”
껌팔이 생활만 10여 년. 14세 때 터미널 인근 떡볶이 아주머니의 권유로 야간학교에 입학했다. 초·중등 검정고시를 차례로 합격하고 ‘노래’를 가르쳐줄 선생님을 무작정 찾아 나섰다. 이때 만나 조건 없이 성악을 가르쳐준 분이 아버지나 다름없는 박정소씨(33·루체음악학원장)다. 정규 교육을 받지 못해 처음에는 악보조차 읽지 못했지만 박씨를 만난 후 열심히 연습해 예술고에 입학했다. 예고생에게는 필수인 레슨비와 생활비를 벌기 위해 1년 전부터 옥천의 한 물류센터에서 오후 8시부터 다음날 오전 7시까지 야간일을 하고 있다. 건양대 병원에 입원하게 된 것도 일하던 중 높은 곳에서 떨어져 다리를 심하게 다쳤기 때문이다.
최군은 요즘 성악을 포기해야겠다는 결심을 굳히고 있다. 1년 더 공부해 음대에 진학하고 싶지만 지금도 어려운 형편인데다 성인이 되면 정부의 학비 지원마저 끊기기 때문에 등록금 마련부터 걱정이다.
“이 길이 내 길이 아닌지, 지나친 욕심을 부리는 건 아닌지 고민이 많아요.”
최군은 이번 자선음악회를 끝으로 성악을 그만둘지 모른다. 그런데 꿈을 꺾어야겠다고 다짐할수록 자꾸만 하늘을 바라보게 되는 이유는 무엇일까. &lt;봉아름 기자&gt;

It's important to emphasize the sound this consonant makes. We know that each syllable must have atleast one consonant and one vowel, but what happens when we want to make an 'ah' sound? We only need a vowel to make that sound but to make a syllable we need a consonant. That's where 'ㅇ' comes in. * When placed first in the syllable 'ㅇ' has no sound.* Thus, 아 sounds like 'ah' as if only ㅏ is there. 

What about when we place 'ㅇ'  at the end of a syllable? I mean, it *is* a consonant. So for example the first syllable of the word 행복 which means happiness, 행. *When placed at the end of a syllable, 'ㅇ', sounds like 'ng'.* So ㅎ + ㅐ + ㅇ = h + ae + ng = haeng. Pretty simple if it's at the beginning it's silent and at the end has an 'ng' sound.

*And as a side note*

If you haven't already studied the complex vowels (ㅐ,ㅒ,ㅔ,ㅖ,ㅢ,ㅙ,ㅘ, ㅝ, ㅞ, ㅟ) start studying up on how to ]pronounce them](http://langintro.com/kintro/diph3.htm).  ",,False,,t5_2rd8q,True,,,True,t3_ababo,http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/ababo/beginner_ㅇ_the_placeholder/,

The three basic levels are: Formal, Standard Politeness and Informal. So depending on who you are talking to, you need to take these levels into account. I think (any native Korean speakers out there can correct me) for people who are your elders and seniors (meaning they are older than you) you should be using Formal level. In general, for all others it seems Standard Politeness is acceptable. For people you are very close to or someone who is younger than you, you can use the informal level. As such, there are different ways of conjugating for each politeness level. We'll start with verbs ending in '다'. 이다 (to be) is irregular and does not follow the basic conjugation.

In general the 다 is dropped and the following is added to the verb stem for the different levels:

- Formal: -ㅂ니다 or 습니다 (mnida or seumnida) For stems ending in vowels use ㅂ니다 and for verbs ending in consonants use 습니다

- For Standard Politeness and Informal we use the 아/어/여 (a/eo/yeo) conjugation. 

아 is for verbs that have ㅏ or ㅗ  as the last vowel in the verb stem

어 is for verbs that don't have ㅏ or ㅗ as the last vowel in the verb stem 

(여 is for hada verbs and we'll get to those later)

EDIT: If the*verbs end in a vowel* you follow these rules for the termination of the verb stem. 

For ㅏ, ㅗ verbs:

1. ㅏ + ㅏ = ㅏ

2. ㅗ + ㅏ = ㅘ ('wa' sound)

For other verbs:

3. ㅓ + ㅓ = ㅓ

4. ㅜ + ㅓ = ㅝ ('wo' sound)

5. ㅡ + ㅓ = ㅓ

6. ㅣ + ㅓ = ㅕ 

7. ㅐ + ㅓ = ㅐ('ae' sound)

EDIT: If the *verb ends in a consonant* you just tack on either the 아 or 어 to the existing verb stem.

And to make the distinction between Standard Politeness and Informal you add 요 ('yo') to the Standard Politeness conjugation. Check out [this](http://imgur.com/fUNW2.png) for some examples.

I'll return later with a list of some Korean verbs for you to try to conjugate.",,False,,t5_2rd8q,True,,,True,t3_a9pix,http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/a9pix/conjugating_verbs/,

For example:

English: I am Amanda.

Korean: 저는 아만다 입니다. 

Romantization: Jeo neun Amanda imnida.

English: I am a student.

Korean: 저는 학생 입니다.

This is a very basic question, but I cant seem to find the particles 에게서 or 한테서 anywhere :/ 

I'm sure they exist and their meaning should be *from* or *by*. 
So, 3 points:

**1)** Please confirm that this is correct:

*I received this gift from Mira.*

*내가 이선물을 미라에게서 (or 미라한테서) 받았어요.*

and

*That door was closed by my sister.*

*그 문이 누나에게서 닫혔어요.*

Her sister lives in Flushing so after a small lunch we took I-95 down to Queens. I was really nervous meeting her sister, but my GF assured me that she's very easy going.

Walking around this area of Queens I really felt like I was in another country. All the store signs were in Hangul and everyone pretty much spoke Korean. I'm really amazed at how my Hangul is progressing. Looking at signs I was immediately able to ""read"" certain parts without having to translate it in my head 3 different times. I just saw the characters and the sounds popped in my head - even though I had no idea what they mean, and I could only read part of each word (double consonants and dipthongs are something I'll tackle this month, I swear!)

Our waitress spoke Korean to us, and I even understood some of the words. I got to practice what I've learned so far - though not much since most of what I've learned is not applicable at this point. I was able to say ""gahmsa hamnida"", ""chugeo"" (I think that's how it's romanized - it means ""excuse me"" or something), and ""annyeonghi gaseyo"", with only minor chuckling from everyone as a result.

I asked my GF about it and she said ""When Americans speak Korean it sounds 'cute'."" What does this mean, exactly?

Why the fuck is the ㅅ reduced to ㄷ if it's followed by 없, which clearly starts with a vocal? T_T It's been driving me nuts for an hour now.

Isn't the rule that consonants are reduced when they are followed by a consonant or end at a syllable break? And if they are followed by a vocal they are not reduced (at least that's what I've learned from 맞아요)...
