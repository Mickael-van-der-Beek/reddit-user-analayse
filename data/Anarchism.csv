1365819453.0,459,self.Anarchism,1c8xd6,Lessons learned: why anarchists fail or succeed,hakomasong,538,79,189,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1c8xd6/lessons_learned_why_anarchists_fail_or_succeed/,"I've been an anarchist for a decade, since I was a teenager, but I can count the concrete victories by anarchist groups I've been involved with on just a few fingers. I've been a part of Austin Indymedia and Food Not Bombs, Occupy Seattle, the NoJuvi working group, and the Seattle Solidarity Network. 

As a participant in these groups, this is in part an accounting of my own failures and a chance for me to vent about past screw-ups. Here's what I've learned. 

**Anarchist groups should focus on doing one thing of value to the community and do it well.**

E.g. Indymedia, which I got involved in around 2004/5. The concept was great (a site with open-publishing where anyone can post, citizen journalism, creating counter-narratives to local corporate media). But the implementation was not. The group tried to do too many things at once - maintain a constantly-updated website, contribute programming a low-power FM station, and create a physical space where community members could create their own media. The costs and logistics of doing any one of those things were significant. With a small all-volunteer collective composed of young people with work/school obligations, it was impossible to carry out all these activities and raise the money to do so. An inordinate amount of time/money was sunk into creating posters for benefit concerts and stickers - all of which was fun and self-gratifying, but not a core objective. 

IMO, we should have reached out to web developers, created a really solid website, and then gone out and done really solid reporting on local issues. We should have just tried to do that until we'd built up a proven track record, then potentially tried to grow into other areas.

[Seattle Solidarity Network](http://seasol.net) is a counter-example. I've only recently joined, but this group is singularly focused on standing up for workers and tenants when bosses/landlords attempt to abuse them. They do this and win the vast majority of the ""fights"" they take on. They've built a network of community-members that can be mobilized. In the past six-eight months, the group has won two fights. After numerous pickets in front of local businesses, intransigent bosses finally caved in and paid the wages owed to vulnerable employees who'd been taken advantage of. 

[Treasure City Thrift Shop](http://www.treasurecitythrift.org/) in Austin is another example - a non-hierarchical collective formed and opened a thrift store that donates the profits to grassroots groups. It's been a great success.

**Anarchist subcultures do far more harm than good. They create insular cliques which wall off, rather than build bridges within, communities. Be vigilant against their emergence.**

At Food Not Bombs in Austin, we did regular servings of dumpstered and donated food to the local homeless in a downtown park. Great. But what became clear to me over the course of a few years was that for many of the participants, FnB was more of a chance to get together and hang out than to actually challenge poverty in Austin. We had fun cooking together, driving out to a park, and serving/eating together. We did one thing and did it reasonably well, but no one ever went to the trouble of trying to self-evaluate - to measure how many people we were serving, how we could reach more, or survey the people we were purportedly helping about how we could do better. In fact, when I talked to homeless folks, it became clear that Mobile Loaves and Fishes, a church-affiliated group, was seen as a far more dependable source of relief (and they were, because sometimes we'd show up a bit late or not at all). We heard disturbing anecdotes from homeless folks about police harassment and the conditions at city shelters, but we never acted on them. 

Occupy Seattle quickly degenerated into a clique, complete with its own insider norms and power dynamics. There was a fetishization of “twinkle fingers” - which to outsiders looked idiotic. To most people who saw Occupy on TV or even those walking right by the encampment, the group seemed chaotic and alien. When I arrived, there was no organized process for intake of people who wanted to join. That first night, there was a general assembly. I and a few other newbies had no clue what was going on, because no one cared enough to explain it to us. Some of the veteran Occupiers, indeed a lot of anarchists I’ve met, came off as arrogant and bitter. Certain personalities dominated. I know local anarchists with kids and jobs who felt like it was a hopeless project. I think they should have at least tried to participate - the larger public shares in the blame for Occupy’s deterioration - but I sympathized with their concerns.

**Do not be afraid to participate in local policy struggles and ally with non-anarchist groups. Embrace the values of respect, pragmatism, strategy, and discipline - don’t denigrate them.**

Foot Not Bombs showed no inclination towards organizing against a local ordinance that would have criminalized the homeless for panhandling. Other liberal groups took up the cause of opposing it. We could have been a major voice in that debate. But, going back to the subculture point, most of the FnB volunteers were too busy hanging out with each other to follow local news and know what was happening. It was pathetic, I thought.

The fact is that all politics are local. So I was excited to join a group last year organizing against a King County ballot proposition to renovate and expand the local juvenile detention center - the NoJuvi working group. But the group was more interested in articulating, for itself, its own purist view of prison abolitionist politics than actually doing the work of organizing against the jail. At one meeting, a local defense attorney from the Black community who works on these issues showed up. He tried to participate, demonstrating a reservoir of knowledge and community expertise as he did so, but was mostly ignored. Nobody took down his contact info or was willing to recognize his unique qualifications - he did not come back. At several meetings I attended, the question of an official position on prison abolition kept being discussed ad nauseum. 

No direct actions were carried out. No community organizing was accomplished. There was a wholesale dismissal of local groups like the ACLU or NAACP, instead of attempt to reach out to them.

Ultimately, the proposition passed by a fairly slim margin. I’m sure that if we’d focused even a little more on actual organizing, we could have succeeded in defeating it. The counter-example I was involved in was the private immigrant detention facility in Hutto, Texas. Anarchists were participants in that struggle, but instead of obsessing over ideology, they focused on allying with immigrant groups and journalists and creating a public relations nightmare until they achieved their objectives.

When I worked at UW, my office and building was targeted by white supremacist neo-Nazi graffiti. An anarchist friend - great guy - called for an assembly on campus to discuss the incident. The vice-provost of the university actually showed up, which I thought was great. But instead of including her in the dialogue, my friend and his buddies tried to ignore her. My friend’s attempt to create a stronger anti-racist discourse around the incident went no further.

There are zero historical examples of successful US social movements composed solely of anarchists, or people who subscribe 100% to a single political vision (that I know of - enlighten me if I’m wrong). Movements are built upon shifting alliances and a gradual expansion of common ground among various social factions. We have to be not just willing, but eager, to work with lawyers, workers, doctors, journalists, musicians, celebrities, NGOs, and even on occasion a politician or businessperson who may agree with us. We have to bury whatever reticence there might be or contempt we might have towards these folks - ultimately, they’re our brethren, our community, and we rise or fall with them. Some individuals and groups are certainly beyond the pale, but they are a minority.

**It’s okay to hold each other accountable. Recognize differences in capacity, but check them by practicing mutual aid.**

Egalitarianism doesn’t mean that all people are the same. Some people are better at certain things than others. Some are better writers. Some are better at being concise and logical in meetings than others. Some are better at following up on what they say they will do. There are often inequalities in experience and ability.

As anarchists, it seems like sometimes we think we can’t acknowledge that. That no one is allowed to say, “Person A really didn’t do a good job of this, but person B knows how to do it. Thanks for your efforts Person A, but person B really should be the one to handle this from now on.” If Person A is offended or demonstrates a passion for the thing they failed at, the group or person B can work on training or accompanying them. 

In order to be effective, people need to get good at doing things, and when they do, that should be encouraged by their peers. A culture of rewarding accomplishment - if it’s accomplishment in resistance to capitalism - isn’t capitalist. It’s common sense. 

**Drugs, alcohol, and cursing suck. Strongly discourage them.**

I videotaped myself being [pepper-sprayed](http://www.mediahacker.org/2011/11/15/in-which-i-am-pepper-sprayed-in-the-face-by-police-at-occupyseattle/) in the face by the Seattle police at an Occupy demonstration. The video got picked up by the New York Times and various media, and I thought it was pretty damning. But when I showed it to a bunch of non-anarchist friends, the thing that stuck out to them were the people around me in the video, who were hurling a stream of invective at the cops. 

We have nothing to gain from hyperbole. Yes, it’s self-gratifying to talk about “burning shit down,” as I often hear anarchists tell each other. Or to curse “the pigs.” I understand doing this privately here and there. 

But we shouldn’t be nursing this constant rage. It’s not healthy for us and it won’t lead us to have productive interactions with anyone. Have you ever seen someone respond positively to yelling or cursing? Do we do this to each other? No. I’m not going to get into the violence vs. non-violence debate here, although you can probably tell which tactics I prefer. But regardless of what tactics we chose, we should collectively discourage screaming and cursing.

I won’t belabor the point. The same reasoning basically applies to drugs and alcohol. They don’t make us any stronger or appealing.

**tl;dr Anarchists should try to do one thing of value to the community and do it well. They should do so in a strategic way and be open to alliances. Subcultures, drugs, alcohol, and rage suck.**

Also, we should do a better job of advertising that we're anarchists.

Thoughts?

There have been serious protests there the past few days and though I'm not there today, over twitter things seem crazy. More militant and confrontational then OWS at it's peak. People are throwing bottles at the police, which happened about twice at Occupy. 

If you want updates about it, https://twitter.com/NYCityAlerts/status/312032860028682240/photo/1 

Just throwing this here because this is barely being talked about, while this is a perfect example of bottom-up uprising against an unfair system that isn't being done by people from outside the community that came to agitate like it was in many other cases. This is an oppressed community standing up to police oppression.

Edit: Written up by radanarchist, important contextual info.

""FYI: the reason why this protest is so confrontational, I prefer that word over militant in this case, is because the majority of the protest is very young, black and angry that their friend was killed by the pigs. Most are around 16 years old and know each other, in other words, this is an actual community protest made mostly of young locals who knew Kiki personally.

We intend to stay until we see movements toward real change in our country and the world.

This is the third communiqué from the 99 percent.

Today, we occupied Wall Street from the heart of the Financial District. Starting at 8:00 AM, we began a march through the Wall Street area, rolling through the blocks around the New York Stock Exchange. At 9:30 AM, we rang our own ""morning bell"" to start a ""people's exchange,"" which we brought back to Liberty Plaza. Two more marches occurred during the day around the Wall Street district, each drawing more supporters to us.

Hundreds of us have been occupying Liberty Plaza, a park in the heart of the Wall Street district, since Saturday afternoon. We have marched on the Financial District, held a candlelight vigil to honor the fallen victims of Wall Street, and filled the plaza with song, dance, and spontaneous acts of liberation.

Food has been donated to the plaza from supporters all over the world. Online donations for pizza, falafels, and other food are coming in from supporters in Omaha, Madrid, Montreal, and other cities, and have exceeded $8,660. (Link to donate: www.wepay.com/donate/99275) On Saturday we began our general assembly, two thousand strong, based on a consensus-driven decision-making process. Decisions were made for the group to occupy Liberty Plaza in the Wall Street corridor, bedding down in sleeping bags and donated blankets. By 8:00 PM on Monday we still held the plaza, despite constant police presence.

We speak as one. All of our decisions, from our choices to march on Wall Street to our decision to camp at Liberty Plaza were decided through a consensus process by the group, for the group. We are building the world that we want to see, based on human need and sustainability, not corporate greed.

Planned and spontaneous actions will continue throughout the coming days. Expect us.

My route will be from the east coast of the US to the west coast, then down into South America. I'll be taking about 90 lbs of equipment with me, 40 in a backpack, 30 -40 in a duffle bag, and the remainder in a harness-vest on my dog. I'll be taking tools necessary for rudimentary woodworking, stonework, pottery making, shoe &amp; clothing repair (i'll eventually be making all my own), gardening, and other general wilderness necessities. Only stuff that can last me a lifetime unless I can learn to make it myself, since I'll only be taking an emergency cash reserve and otherwise not using money or credit. I've also constructed a pair of roll-up solar panel capable of powering a small tablet PC and smartphone, which I'll be taking along with an external harddrive packed with 3 terrabytes of information (all proudly pirated). 

I'll be growing, gathering, and fishing for my sustenance and harvesting all my other necessities from nature. I'll also be planting and transplanting a large variety of comestible flora, from which others can benefit in the future. This will all be done ""illegally;"" I will be trespassing and squatting, but I plan to mostly avoid other people and try to remain unnoticed so that this won't be a hindrence. I will, very occassionally (once or twice a year), walk into a town to find an internet connection, but I will otherwise attempt to eschew the rest of mankind.  

EDIT: Ok, the part of the trip heading into South America is very tentative, and would not happen for several years, if it happnes. A lot of you are focusing on that as the main point of commentary, and while I appreciate the interrest and concern, I have few details to offer regarding that portion of the trip yet because I planned of having a few years to properly educate myself about the feasibility of it. If it proves to risky a venture for my liking, I will set my sets elsewhere. But again, thanks for all your feedback. This has been a helpful AMA for me, and hopefully interresting for some of you. 

EDIT: I'd like to thank everyone for your diverse comments, questions, suggestions and well wishes. I won't be able to check this for about a week, but I will comment or answer any further posts the next time I can.

** Update.. **

I think its worth noting the meta-conversation at stake here. Trending anti-police threads, followed up by the Restore The Fourth parade. Not to mention daily trending articles with Snowden. Just being observant here. But it shows all the signs of string-pulling, mechanisms outside of the *au naturale* trending algorithms we're used to. Its nice to see these strings so politely pulled in the favor of the common human. But alas, its these artificial tools that inevitably separate us from taking ownership of our lives in a real face-to-face way.

It's become the most bureaucratic secretive sub-reddit in the entire width and breadth of Reddit. Which in itself makes me want to eat my keyboard. I largely do not interact here and have not, some of that is because I do not agree with the policies being enacted, the way some mods have tried to bend this sub-reddit in a direction it didn't need to go, etc - None of you are actually organising ANYTHING to further the revolution, in fact all this in-bitching, hierarchy structure, policies and banning is SENDING THE WRONG MESSAGE TO ANY NEW PEOPLE WANTING TO GET IN TO ANARCHISM.

Co-intel-pro couldn't do it any better. 

For the mods not happy about other people's use of language etc, wait until you step out in to the real world away from your computer, it's a lot worse and that's **where** it needs **changing**. You'll NEVER EVER beat the trolls here on Reddit, you're up against immaturity that can't yet comprehend *serious business*, instead you're making it intolerable for the rest of us. Every time you ban someone or create yet another wet paper bag policy you radicalise the rest of us in to *not* wanting to contribute in case we happen to use language not authorised by the chosen self aggrandising few. I don't want to contribute only to have to spend the next 14 hours being dissected and micro analysed to see if I am a comrade or not, you're not allowing me to freely associate. That's the kinda thing that FASCISTS do. I don't want to read rules about what can and can't be here, that's the sort of thing a GOVERNMENT DOES, I don't want to have to ask to join a place that should be transparent and free for all, that's the sort of thing CAPITALISTS do. I don't want my /r/anarchism feed corrected by mods, that's the sort of thing CENSORS do.

It's quite simple, all of your remove yourself as moderators, remove the rules and let us all organise as a SINGLE NONE HIERARCHY GROUP. Most of us do not care about spam, that's what the ""hide"" button is for, same goes for the trolls etc. Everything you're trying to do is against the one fundemental core principle of anarchy: 

**EVERYONE IS RESPONSIBLE AND ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEMSELVES!**

And you're all removing that from us and by holding people accountable from a position of power you are... well... 

I'm sure this will be removed, but I had to spew it fourth regardless.

If Walmart was worker-owned, each employee would be taking home $57,119 more in 2012 on top of their $6k-19k average.",TheLateThagSimmons,307,56,124,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1avm9u/crunching_some_numbers_if_walmart_was_workerowned/,"Gross profits in 2012 topped $119 billion: http://www.wikinvest.com/stock/Wal-Mart_(WMT)/Data/Gross_Profit/2012/Q1.  
It is adjusted for *profit*, not gross sales or total gross product. Their workforce is currently at [2.1 million employees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_employers).

Sales associates, which make up the greater bulk of their employees, make [$6k-19k](http://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Walmart-Stores-Salaries-E715.htm) a year at $8.84 an hour. That $8.84 *is above* federal minimum wage of $7.25, so when they claim most of our workers make more than minimum wage, they're technically not lying.

Granted, some of the more technical and trained positions like pharmacists ($118k a year) and programmers ($66k a year) do have a decent salary for their specialized and salaried positions. I personally have no problem with specialized positions like that garnering a slightly higher percentage and this would have to be factored in. 

Conversely, most higher wage/salary management positions could probably be erased entirely which lowers labor costs by $44k-$90k depending on the now unnecessary position.

-----

It should also be noted that an entirely worker owned operation would most likely not utilize overseas sweatshop labor for the bulk of its products; I feel this would most likely even out by slightly (if not greatly) higher prices all across the board. This is a whole other issue.

(Shh.... Don't let capitalists find out that sweatshop labor is bad. They'll throw a hissy fit about how they're rising these people out of the darkness and helping them or some shit.)

-----

All of this, still does not show the whole picture of worker ownership, such as expansion, development, investment, returns, hiring/firing practices, retirement packages, all that good stuff. Just a basic idea of what worker ownership could mean. 

With prices capable of remaining relatively similar (although in this particular case, prices would need to go up to adjust to not using slave labor) even within the current capitalist system of private ownership of land, assuming that rent/leases were still a significant cost, you're looking at the greatest bulk of the local workforce living in the $60-$90k range instead of the $6-$19k+welfare/food stamps range. Which then is transfered to the rest of the local (and worldwide thanks to the internet) economy. 

(Of course, the state still exists and there are taxes and shit to consider; gotta afford those bombs to drop on Middle Eastern children somehow.) 

It doesn't mean that there are no more rich people and no more poor people. But it does mean that the rich are not *as rich* and the poor are not *as poor*.

How far are we willing to accept that investment is the greatest thing to build an economy? That the investors deserve the bulk of the profits? That ""risk"" is a justifiable excuse to steal $57,000 each from 2.1 million people?

-----

Just some thoughts and numbers for you to pass along. Feel free to add any other factors that support or oppose worker ownership. ",,False,,t5_2qh5j,False,,orangeblack,True,t3_1avm9u,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1avm9u/crunching_some_numbers_if_walmart_was_workerowned/,

On September 18th, 2011, about 400 of us woke up in the Financial District amidst heavy police presence. After an impromptu dance party, we resumed our General Assembly in One Liberty Plaza around ten in the morning. We made our demands heard, which are many but revolve around a common point: our voice will no longer be ignored.

At noon a large group of us marched through the Financial District and Battery Park chanting “this is what democracy looks like.” During our march many onlookers joined our ranks, while many more expressed solidarity with our cause. By the time the detachment returned to One Liberty Plaza over 100 sympathizers had joined us. Our efforts were bolstered by generous donations of food and water from across the country and the world. As the day progressed our numbers continued to grow, and by three in the afternoon we were more than a thousand strong.

Before sunset 500 of us marched on the Financial District, where hundreds of onlookers joined us. After we reconvened the General Assembly the police demanded we remove our signs, but they did it for us instead.  Later, they threatened to arrest us for using a bullhorn, so we spoke together in one voice, louder than any amplifier.

We speak as one. All of our decisions, from our choice to march on Wall Street to our decision to continue occupying One Liberty Plaza, were decided through a consensus process by the group, for the group.",,False,,t5_2qh5j,True,,,True,t3_kk9ip,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/kk9ip/a_message_from_occupied_wall_street_day_two/,

1328450227.0,212,self.Anarchism,pbti0,Greek Hospital workers decide to occupy the hospital and run it themselves,IvanTheNth,243,31,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/pbti0/greek_hospital_workers_decide_to_occupy_the/,"Link: http://athens.indymedia.org/front.php3?lang=el&amp;article_id=1374098

Unfortunately their announcement is in greek. I translate it below, though it's far from a perfect translation (Kilkis is a city in Greece):

&gt;The workers of the Γ.Ν. (General Hospital) of Kilkis: doctors, nursing and the rest of the staff that participated in the General Assembly concluded that:

&gt;1. We recognize that the current and enduring problems of Ε.Σ.Υ (the national health system) and related organizations cannot be solved with specific and isolated demands or demands serving our special interests, since these problems are a product of a more general anti-popular governmental policy and of the bold global neoliberalism. 

&gt;2. We recognize, as well, that by insisting in the promotion of that kind of demands we essentially participate in the game of the ruthless authority. That authority which, in order to face its enemy - i.e. the people- weakened and fragmented, wishes to prevent the creation of a universal labour and popular front on a national and global level with common interests and demands against the social impoverishment that the authority's policies bring. 

&gt;3. For this reason, we place our special interests inside a general framework of political and economic demands that are posed by a huge portion of the greek people that today is under the most brutal capitalist attack; demands that in order to be fruitful must be  promoted until the end in cooperation with the middle and lower classes of our society.

&gt;4. The only way to achieve this is to question, in action, not only its political legitimacy, but also the legality of the arbitrary authoritarian and anti-popular power and hierarchy which is moving towards totalitarianism with accelerating pace.

&gt;5. The workers at the General Hospital of Kilkis answer to this totalitarianism with democracy. We occupy the public hospital and put it under our direct and absolute control. The Γ.N. of Kilkis, will henceforth be self-governed and the only legitimate means of administrative decision making will be the General Assembly of its workers.

&gt;6. The government is not released of its economic obligations of staffing and suppling the hospital, but if they continue to ignore these obligations, we will be forced to inform the public of this and ask the local government but most importantly the society to support us in any way possible for: (a) the survival of our hospital (b) the overall support of the right for public and free healthcare (c) the overthrow, through a common popular struggle, of the current government and any other neoliberal policy, no matter where it comes from (d) a deep and substantial democratization, that is, one that will have society, rather than a third party, responsible for making decisions for its own future.

&gt; 7. The labour union of the Γ.N. of Kilkis, will begin, from 6 February, the retention of work, serving only emergency incidents in our hospital until the complete payment for the hours worked, and the rise of our income to the levels it was before the arrival of the troika (EU-ECB-IMF). Meanwhile, knowing fully well what our social mission and moral obligations are, we will protect the health of the citizens that come to the hospital by providing free healthcare to those in need, accommodating and calling the government to finally accept its responsibilities, overcoming even in the last minute its immoderate social ruthlessness.

&gt; 8. We decide that a new general assembly will take place, on Monday 13 February in the assembly hall of the new building of the hospital at 11 am, in order to decide the procedures that are needed to efficiently implement the occupation of the administrative services and to successfully realise the self-governance of the hospital, which will start from that day. The general assemblies will take place daily and will be the paramount instrument for decision making regarding the employees and the operation of the hospital.


&gt;We ask for the solidarity of the people and workers from all fields, the collaboration of all workers' unions and progressive organizations, as well as the support from any media organization that chooses to tell the truth. We are determined to continue until the traitors that sell out our country and our people leave.
It's either them or us!

&gt;The above decisions will be made public through a news conference to which all the Mass Media (local and national) will be invited on Wednesday 15/2/2012 at 12.30. Our daily assemblies begin on 13 February. We will inform the citizens about every important event taking place in our hospital by means of news releases and conferences. Furthermore, we will use any means available to publicise these events in order to make this mobilization successful.

&gt;We call

&gt;a) our fellow citizens to show solidarity to our effort,

&gt;b) every unfairly treated citizen of our country in contestation and opposition, with actions, against his'/her's oppressors,

&gt;c) our fellow workers from other hospitals to make similar decisions,

&gt;d) the employees in other fields of the public and private sector and the participants in labour and progressive organizations to act likewise, in order to help our mobilization take the form of a universal labour and popular resistance and uprising, until our final victory against the economic and political elite that today oppresses our country and the whole world.",,False,,t5_2qh5j,True,,,True,t3_pbti0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/pbti0/greek_hospital_workers_decide_to_occupy_the/,

1368307153.0,209,self.Anarchism,1e5ct7,Iama anarchist and I was active in the European extreme right for 5 years. Here is my opinion on antifascism.,ExNeoNazi,265,56,122,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/1e5ct7/iama_anarchist_and_i_was_active_in_the_european/,"I am in my early 20s and I up until last year was a very active member in the European far right scene. I come from Sweden and that is where most of my experience comes from but I have travelled to other places and met a lot of people from all over the far right. 

The far right movement is an environment, it isn't based on organizations. Members of groups that officially hate eachother hang out. The best way to describe the extreme right is that the extreme right is like a marketplace or a town square. Most people are casual visitors who look around. Then there are a few people selling their idea and making a lot of noise. They attract the visitors and get them to follow their belief. 

What attracts people to the extreme right? Mainly one thing, mainly young men feel that they got less than they expected in life. We are the first generation that has it worse than our parents. Many of us expected to get a simple job with lots of jobsecurity making 2800 euros a month with a 35 hour workweek and lots of benefits. We where told that we where going to get this. Now we either are unemployed or work 55 hours a week doing crap jobs with no benefits or status and make less than our parents did at our age. 

This is the common denominator amongst people who join the far right.  They are people who feel that they didn't get what they deserve. They feel cheated, bitter and without pride. If you are 25, unemployed and live with your mom you probably can't find a partner. This is the main reason that the far right is misogynist/antifeminist. 

These people come to the marketplace that I described above without ideology. They have a strong sense that they where promised things that they didn't get. The look around the marketplace and they see various prophets and they find one that they like. It can be nationalsocialists, Christian conservatives, Fascism, counterjihad or some other idea. This new prophet tells them that society was good and that for some reason (jews, muslims, communists) they are not getting what they deserve. We must get rid of the problem so that we can get what is rightfully ours and return to a good society!

The extreme right scene is very interesting to watch. The marketplace that I described mainly exists on the internet. If you watch the forums you will see bitter users who just signed up and older users who support a certain faction. When something happens in the world they turn to their prophet (David Duke/Gates of Vienna/Nigel Farage) and start spreading their prophets message. Whoever makes the most noise wins. Often the message is purposely dumbed down and simplified so it can easily be picked up and spread.

How is this most effectively stopped? First of all recognize the legitimate issues that make them bitter. Unemployment, crime and segregation are real problems. See them as bitter workers, not evil capitalists. I saw thousands of anarchists during my years in the far right. They where all wearing masks and throwing stuff at me. We saw anarchists as violent intolerant drugaddicts with little intellect.

I think the best way to stop the far right is socially. Take your mask of and talk to the local nazi. Why are they bitter? What social issues concern them? Provide them with new information. The far right forums have strong hivemind. If you say the wrong thing you get punished, quote a non far right source and you are discredited. Lack of information/proper newsreporting is a big problem. Many might think that muslims are violent and crazy for hating the west. Explain imperialism and why Palestinians throw rocks at settlers. Many se rampant crime as a problem. They see a brutal policeforce as an obvious solution. Explain that brutal dictatorship isn't a good answer and that many societies don't have policing and very little crime. Most importantly explain that the system is the problem, not muslims/jews/communists. I have gotten people to leave the extreme right by explaining these issues. 

Ask them what society they want to live in. Don't base your struggle on what you hate but what you want. Ask them what they want  and discuss how this can be achieved. We spent so much time discussing problems and the future race war but completely forgot what was going to come after the race war. 

The worst antifascist campaign ever was in Germany when antifa had a sign that said no sex for nazis. The last thing bitter rejected men need is more rejection. That was what created Breivik. The next time there is a nazi demonstration in town I am going with a sign that says we still love you alternatively free hugs for nazis. The best way to stop them is to change their opinion, not by temporarily scaring them off the streets and on to the internet. Violence never stopped us, it just made us adapt our tactics.

Why don't disgruntled workers join the left? Many reasons. Some are put off by culture war issues, some are put off by Stalinism. Many feel that the changes that have happened are bad at that we need to stop them. This reactionary view is probably the biggest separator. Tell them that we can make a much better society. The problems are systemic, it is the system that has to go.

There are two types of people in the extreme right movement. Followers and prophets. Followers are the people who I described above. The next group are the ones that are the big problem. I call them the prophets. These are the ones that provide bad solutions to the members. They are the bloggers and the ideologues behind the extreme right. These people are extremely dangerous. In economic hard times they might get a mass following, in fact in some places they have a mass following. They explain the problems that ordinary people face in bad ways that just confuse the workers and make them fight the wrong enemy. When looking at the far right this distinction is incredibly important. Is the activist the source of the idea or is he just spreading someone elses idea. Often the person that is public or organizes demonstration is not the source. Find the source and well I could tell you what to do but the police would knock on my door if I did. This distinction is incredibly important and I think it is very much overlooked.

Being not-for-profit financial cooperatives, credit unions have always been exempt from the corporate taxes paid by big banks who are in business to generate profits for their shareholders. Credit Unions return the ""profits"" directly to the members, and the member-owners, through lower rates on loans, higher rates on deposits, lower fees, and conveniences like ATM surcharge rebates. Perhaps more importantly, this unique structure helps credit unions exist as an alternative to big banks in the financial services marketplace.

Congress has begun the process of reforming the tax code, and will be considering corporate taxation on credit unions for the first time in history. The big banks view the increasing popularity of credit unions as a threat to their profitability, and see this as an opportunity to weaken them. Their lobbyists are working very hard to convince legislators to impose new taxes on credit unions. If they persuade Congress to take away the not-for-profit tax exemption, it would be very challenging for credit unions to continue offering the high level of value which members deserve and have come to expect.

As far as moderators go, it *is* possible to be an anarchist and have organization. There is a difference between fluid, temporary, voluntary, participatory (etc.) structures of organization and the rigid oppressive institutions of the State or capitalism. Moreover, you could say that just because an anarchist dismantles oppressive hierarchies whenever they arise doesn't mean they sit around while opportunists (here, trolls) take everything. Groups can and should spontaneously form and organize to defend themselves. The problem arises if that organization becomes so rigid that the oppression starts taking place internally. EDIT: yes, this may have even occurred in r/anarchism.

And yes, there is some drama at the moment. It mostly revolves around some rather legitimate issues on the subject of feminism and patriarchy, and their roles in an anarchist setting (and by extension, this subreddit). Most of us are more casual members of the community, and for us it functions more like a book club than a model for an anarchist society. EDIT: maybe this is my privilege for not holding unpopular views in this community.

We'd all be happy to answer any of your questions about the most relevant anti-capitalist tendency of our times!

TL;DR Don't all redditors love Noam Chomsky? *He's an anarchist.* (Has anyone besides r/anarchism *actually* read his books?) And he's not a dumbass. Neither are we.

I just finished reading ""Chomsky on Anarchism"" by Noam Chomsky/Barry Pateman and he is a man i really admire. How ever it looks like his ideas differs a lot from what i'm seeing here on r/anarchism. 

One example is the quote I put in the titel, the original quote is this: ""In today's world, I think, the goals of a commited anarchist should be to defend som state institutions from attack agains them, while trying at the same time to pry them open to more meaningful public participation - and ultimately, to dismantle them in a much more free society, if the appropriate circumstanses can be achived.""

Chomsky argues that as it is today any inch of power that is taken away from the state is just given to private corporations instead, and that is not a step towards the anarchistic ideal an anarchist should aim for (even though those ideals of course can be very different). It would just be to give more power to an even more unjustified authoritarian power.

On September 17th, 2011, approximately 2,000 of us marched on the Financial District. At twelve noon, a detachment of us marched on the head of Wall Street and formed a spontaneous blockade, prompting the New York Police Department to threaten arrest. Speakers including the Reverend Billy Talen of the Church of Stop Shopping, and actress Rosanne Barr spoke on the steps of the American Indian Smithsonian Museum to the crowd, which included conscious rappers Lupe Fiasco and Immortal Technique.

Over 1,000 of us marched from Bowling Green Park amid heavy police presence, across the Financial District and chanting “Wall Street is our street” and “power to the people, not to the banks.” Many stayed at One Liberty Plaza, where later in the evening a meal was served and water was distributed. Song, dance, puppetry, and other art added cheer across the plaza. 

Two thousand strong, we held a general assembly, based upon a consensus-driven decision-making process. Decisions were made for the group to occupy One Liberty Plaza in the Wall Street corridor through the evening, bedding down in sleeping bags and donated blankets. Another assembly is scheduled for 10 AM ET today.

",the_bell_jar,230,41,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/zyycp/my_friend_and_i_are_planning_something_awesome/,"I'm always explaining my anarchist views to people, and often they are puzzled to hear that I see anarchy more as a personal lifestyle than something the whole of society can fall into (though I wish it could). You're all familiar with this I'm sure. Anyway, so I was browsing reddit and came across the ""what anarchist stuff do you do everyday?"" themed post and was reading the comments for inspiration.  
  
My anarchist friend told me that he's procured a neat bit of land out in the bush which the local government had forgotten about. He asked about it and they said he could do whatever he wanted with it, live there if he wanted and all for $120. Per year.
The place is awesome-heaps of indoor space, heaps of potential. So we're turning it into a sustainable community-based area. We're making   plans to grow epic amounts of food, install solar panels and a wind generator, and run a sort of travelers' hostel there. We're also thinking of making a free store and free library stocked with political literature, and using the space to teach tourists how to grow food and do things like guerrilla gardening. Eventually I'm going to move in there as well.   
  
Basically, the place is going to be completely off the grid and we think we'll probably be able to buy the land at some stage. It's pretty isolated out in the bush so we can do all the scheming we like there in our free time, and the greatest part is, we'll need essentially no money considering the circumstances, there are plenty of local business we've chatted to who are keen to buy surplus vegies as well as farmers' markets in the area.   
  
I'm pretty excited and just wanted to tell someone  ^_^ I caught up with all my friends from Occupy last night and they were all really stoked, feelsgoodman. There's furniture already being donated by them as well. The power (unfortunately grid power, for now) will be on within the month so we're going to start the project ASAP; laying floorboards and fixing the insulation, then making vegie patches etc. During the process we're going to make videos, take photos and I intend to start up a blog documenting the process and offering tips to help other people become self-sufficient.   
  
And while we're at it, has anyone else here helped create some kind of commune and if so, any tips to help us on our noble journey?   
  
EDIT: Forgot to mention, the coolest part is, it's an old police barracks. The building's doing an ideological 180. I feel powerful :D  
  
EDIT 2: Thanks for all the love guys. I really hope it all goes according to plan. For those who brought it up, I reckon it is a pretty good idea to keep the full on activism stuff on the DL when it comes to the local community since we're still living there with permission from the local government (though local governments are often not as shit as the federal government around here). We're basically going to create a community space for locals and share knowledge of sustainable living with the country folk. My blog and zine will be aimed more at the activists among us, and I hope that will open a good forum for discussion.

For Antifa purposes, I made an account on the NSM's (largest neonazi group in the US) forum. I did not use my real name, nor did I use a email which anybody knows. I wanted to spy on the enemy and see if there was any form of event nearby me soon. I did not post anything and only went back there once. Keep this in mind for later.

However, I am also an active participant in my local anarchist community. I also am a participant of OWS. A simple google of my name would tell anybody that. So would looking through my arrest record. 

Still, today I got a knock on my door. I opened it and it was two men in their 30s with suits. They asked me my name to clarify they were talking to the right person. They were. Then they asked if I minded if they came in to talk, which I did. Then they asked if they could ask a few questions, and I said they may but I won't answer anything. They asked if I was a citizen, so I said yes. Then I insisted I wasn't going to answer any more questions without a lawyer and I asked why they are here, and they said that they received a complaint about me preaching neonazi ideology. I knew that I had never done this and so that relieved me.  Then one of them said that this is a free country and I can believe whatever I want, be it the NSM or whatever, but only if I express that in a peaceful way. I then laughed and told them I'm not affiliated with the NSM. They asked what groups I am affiliated with and I told them that I am not affiliated with any groups, and am a registered independent. Then they said that it's fine to have my beliefs, insisting that I was a neonazi (important), as long as I act out my thoughts peacefully. Then they asked if I know of any big plans that might go boom any time soon, and I stated that I am not a nazi and that I don't know what about any plans. Then I was asked again in even more blunt terms if I knew about anything about anyone planning on using a bomb for political purposes. I said no. Then They asked if I was planning on traveling any time soon, and I said no and that I am done answering questions. Then the agent gave me his number and told me to give him a call if I change my mind. As he was writing down his number, I saw part of a mugshot from when I was arrested a while ago, so I know that they had done research on me and knew that the neonazi accusation was bullshit.

I know I didn't react perfectly, but I did well enough and did not say anything.

But just keep in mind these two things.

* They affiliated me with the NSM, incorrectly, through me signing up for their forum and going back one time. This means that their forums are tapped or that my IP number is being traced. It's (if not both) probably the second one. So remember comrades, you're not safe from their eyes. I never thought this would happen to me, but it did.

* They thought they could trick me into saying something about my beliefs through accusing me of being a nazi. Even if it wasn't about that, they did it for a specific reason, they obviously know that I am not but they did it on purpose. 

Now, since my IP is tapped, I'm sure they will see this but I am using a throw away just to be safe. Point is, be safe comrades. I didn't expect this so it was like a sucker punch, so let that be a lesson to you.",,False,,t5_2qh5j,False,,,True,t3_zhgz5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/zhgz5/visit_from_the_fbi_today/,

Many of the janitors this will effect are workers at universities in Boston, including Northeastern, Emerson, Simmons, and others. This is a great opportunity for students and workers to come together at these schools. I'm not sure what's happening at other schools, but I know that at Emerson there's a group called Emerson PRIDE (Progressives and Radicals in Defense of Employees) that is organizing to support the janitors. I'd imagine there are similar groups at other schools (or at least there should be!). 

If the strike goes forward, which it looks like it will, there will be many ways to get involved, including daily actions put on by SEIU.

We are now not only experiencing the build-up of historical conditions directed towards totalitarianism, but their execution by a system that denies culpability in the process. These conditions are exactly the same as the developments of the Nazi state and its emphasis on a system committing atrocity rather than a gathering of conscientious people. 

We need action in the next two weeks. We need dedicated, non insipid action. The Restore the Fourth rallies failed. Hopefully they build, but they have failed so far. I attended one in Boston. The people at large are too docile to demand their government back or its dissolution. 

This is not the time to decide what should replace the current government, this is the time to unite in its dismantling. The widespread destruction, controlled media, corruption, violations of rights, and the damnable reality of the populations silent complicity in allowing these acts must end. 

John Milton said, in one of his political documents, that no matter the tyranny of a government, the people of the state deserve this tyranny so long as it occurs. This is true because the people have the ability to stop these acts should they truly believe in stopping them. 

I currently reside in Boston. I am willing to attend whatever can be organized in this area, or to take transportation to NYC. 

There is no appropriate time for revolution. The time is always the occurring present. 

I propose July 15 as a date for more radical, at the very least civilly disobedient action. 

EDIT: Some have pointed out that the tone of this post is parochial. I apologize for that, but I am attempting to valorize action. It's a common contemporary trope to take on a tone of analytic coolness, as if such a tone affects a greater credibility. That's fine when I am trying to make a coherent argument, but I am trying to get people to start acting. 

I think my generation tends to be content with ""being in the know"" rather than actually doing anything about a problem. I just want to change that.

EDIT 2: I accidentally wrote being in the now rather than being in the know. Oops

EDIT 3: The post has turned into discussion surrounding ideology when I wanted it to be surrounding idealogical fluidity WITH action.

[2,300 year old Mayan pyramid destroyed to harvest rock for use as road fill.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1eb1wu/2300_year_old_mayan_pyramid_destroyed_to_harvest/)

I just read this and felt the need to vent a little:


People interviewed in the article, and in comments have stated how this oversight, laziness, ignorant etc. But really? Is that all we can see is ignorance? What really drove them to tear it down? What really drives companies to do much of anything other than profit?

My mind can't help but thinking ""Capitalism Strikes Again."" In a system that promotes capital, and profit over everything else, these types of events are all too frequent and only increasing. Regardless of where the orders to tear down this structure came from, the problem lies in the system from top to bottom. Whether it be the institution that contracts the company to build the road on a low bid contract and demanding it be finished quickly by any means necessary, or the contractor who see's an opportunity to save some money by harvesting rocks from a nearby pyramid. From the foreman who see's a chance at finishing quicker and possibly getting a bonus, to the workers who are under-paid and laboring in the hot sun who see the opportunity to do less work and go home early. 

The Capitalist economy does have a trickle down effect, one of manipulation. Regardless of class, Capitalism feeds off of desire and need. It manipulates us to go against our better judgement for the sake of capital (whether it be out of greed or necessity to survive). Often times it even leads to the breaking of the law *created* by the very systems that exist to protect and perpetuate Capitalism.

Almost every thread I go to and an ancap posts, they are usually dismissed with posts like, ""Fuck off,"" or, ""Get out, ancap.""

Yes, it has been established that anarcho-capitalism is not a form of anarchism.  Yes, these people are holding up a system based on oppression and exploitation.  Yes, some of these fuckers are sexist or racist.  But the worst thing we can do is downvote and completely dismiss them.  The way we come off is dogmatic, and unattractive to both the ancap and any outsider interested in anarchism, this does not help our movement.  Instead of acting the way we've been acting, we could help to educate them (of course they won't listen right away, but anything as small as an opposing opinion can help make them rethink, and eat at their existing opinions).

Then we have [proposals like this](http://www.reddit.com/r/metanarchism/comments/1ibw1o/proposal_autoban_any_anarchocapitalist/).  What, are we all /r/communism now?  This is fucking embarrassing.  The worst thing we can do is exclude people with opposing beliefs from discussion.  This minimizes our movement, and makes discussion fucking bland.  Related, there's also that Noam Chomsky quote.

&gt; The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum - even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there's free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate.
- Noam Chomsky

It's not only that.  I've seen ancaps downvoted simply for being ancaps, when what they said was totally valid and relevant.

If we want a healthy sub with healthy discussion, then we need to treat ancaps better, in a more civil manner, and with patience.  A lot of these people are misguided, and excluding them isn't going to do shit.

We are writing, publishing, distributing literature on the practical aspects of a GS -- how to form a strike committee, sample resolutions to bring to union locals, the benefits of a general strike, etc.  Other actions we're taking are not appropriate for discussion on a public forum.  There is a real possibility that we can demonstrate the true political power of solidarity.  This is about more than anti-union legislation.  It is an opportunity to demonstrate the power of direct action and to stand against unrestricted global capitalism.

Please pm me or go to [facebook.com/midwestiww](http://facebook.com/midwestiww) if you'd like to help in a practical way -- writing about the benefits of and history behind the general strike, contacting organizations abroad for solidarity, etc.  We are also doing these things but we are spread very thin.

also please go (or tell your friends to go) to [madison.iww.org](http://madison.iww.org) to donate towards I.W.W. organizing efforts. all donations to Madison I.W.W. go to food, housing, &amp; transport for protesters, NOT to the pockets of union bureaucrats!

Or something like this. Visible, daring and interesting with a message that clearly calls out the institutions of state and capital.

Some cranes are reported to be moving.

Many of these blockaders have been out since yesterday's 5:30AM anti-capitalist bloc.  [OakFoSho](http://www.ustream.tv/occupyoakland) is pushing 37 hours awake and still streaming strong right now.  The organization and dedication this group has shown is truly awesome.  I never would have thought that something like this would go down in America.

This movement is only growing and its only radicalizing.  Dealing with the liberal hangers-on is actually worth it for once.  Now's the time to get active, get out there and fly the black flag, and to continue building the resistance.

On my way to work on Wednesday, they decided to swing by and ask me some questions. If you find yourself in a similar situation, here's some pro-tips:

1) Don't panic, a technique they'll use is to build up the situation and then ask for small amounts of info. Since the info seems insignificant, you're more likely to give it over.

2) Don't lie! I can not underline and bold this enough, never lie to a fed, even if you think you can get away with it. This will make the situation so much worse for you since this is a felony and if you get taken to court, they will use this against you.

3) Don't admit to anything! You know the part of the Miranda Rights that goes ""can and will be used against you""? Notice how there's no ""can and will be used for you"". There's nothing stopping them from using anything against you at all in court. Let's say you tell them you went to the 7-11 at 7:30 pm, but a receipt they have from the store says you went at 8. You just lied to a fed and this could be used against you. Never give specifics; if they ask if you know the time, your answer should only be ""yes"".

4) Actually, just don't say anything. Say that you want to clear everything with your legal representative and nothing more. They'll probably keep pushing the issue by saying ""Come on, we're all friends here"" or ""you don't need your lawyer."" Stand your ground and do not give in.

Stand strong comrades.

This was absolutely fascinating! We've learned a lot from this, haven't we? Soon the waves will settle and the sandcastle will have been beaten down a mite...but it doesn't take much to rebuild. I've spent more time on this sub in the last couple of weeks than I ever have, and I think I'll be lurking here a lot more.

But I would like to say this: let us please make this a more welcome place, even for the uneducated and misguided. They have a thing or two to learn. So did I, in the years I've been on this sub. I might have considered myself an anarchist when I first signed up here, but I had no idea what true anarchist theory was. I can tell you, I was downvoted to oblivion on more than one occasion.

But I wasn't banned. And from what I've read from /meta, it doesn't take a whole heck of a lot to get the boot. These backroom deals scare the hell out of me, and I don't want to see this shit.

I said this before, and I'll say it again: go see the mods of r/guns if you want to see good people. They feed trolls a downvote and some informative reading about why gun control doesn't work, and **poof**! either the troll's disappeared or he's a gun nut! This is what we should be doing!

Our allies on the West Coast, as well as those in Houston and elsewhere that are planning economic blockades of their own, are likely to need our mutual aid including funding legal support, bail, etc.  

I don't know about you, but I think it has been for too long that workers are viewed as having the sole agency with which to call for industrial action.  We are all reluctant stakeholders in an economic system that is not merely corrupt, but that is actually defective by design.  It gives me hope to see a community-called and organized industrial action like today's port shutdown.

There is no shortage of polemic criticism of the Occupy movement coming out of the anti-capitalist community.  Much of the criticism is right on point, but we have to recognize that an exciting mass action like this port shutdown would simply not have happened without involving those outside the anti-authoritarian ghetto.

We all love to consume the riot porn that comes out of Greece.  But behind every Molotov is a huge network of support for the insurrectionists.  Building support and networks and radicalization is a process.  We can either choose to act in solidarity with this nascent movement or we can remain bitter, cynical people that continue to write angry messages on the internet.

Please keep an eye out for calls of support and materially aid your allies when the time comes.  It is only with the support of the broader community that these attacks on capital will continue to thrive and resistance will build.",,False,,t5_2qh5j,True,,,True,t3_n9qsg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/n9qsg/today_is_the_west_coast_port_shutdown_solidarity/,

Protesters surrounded by cops, brutalized, and falsely arrested.",Teh_Slayur,180,50,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/e35rj/cop_who_executed_unarmed_man_at_bart_station/,"[Link](http://inoculatedcity.wordpress.com/2010/11/07/police-brutality-at-the-oscar-grant-protest-on-november-5th-2010/)

This is about the cop who shot the unarmed, handcuffed man while other cops were holding him on the ground on a BART train. Remember how those cops were desperately trying to confiscate people's cellphones because they were taking video footage?

Well, they were able to move the trial to LA with an LA jury (note that the victim was black, and LA is known for having much more racial tension than San Francisco). The jury was mostly white, with a few Latinos thrown in. The cop claimed he thought he was pulling his Taser, which was on the other side of his pants. Well, despite the fact that he had no justification to use a Taser anyway, the jury went with involuntary manslaughter, and the judge only sentenced him to 2 years, most of which has already been served.

People gathered in Oakland (where the shooting happened) to protest the ruling. Cops had already been sent from as far away as Monterrey, in what was apparently a pre-organized assault on anyone protesting the ruling. There were a few bad apples among the protesters who had just been hanging around drinking on the corner, and chose to use the protest as an opportunity to smash windows, but the vast majority were peaceful protesters. The cops cornered them and forced them into residential neighborhoods.

Associated Press(http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_TRAIN_STATION_SHOOTING?SITE=TXHAR&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT), the propaganda wire service, is framing the entire protest as violent, and saying the people chose to ""terrorize"" residential neighborhoods!

The truth (see first link) is that the cops cornered them, then illegally arrested them (they gave no dispersal order) while using excessive force (most of the protesters ended up with bruises), then subjected them to things like: Driving them around erratically while they were handcuffed, refusing to let them use the restroom (one woman urinated in her pants), falsely telling women they were pregnant (They give woman who are arrested pregnancy tests as a routine policy), sexually harassing the women, etc.

The average age must have been about 14 or less, and their instructors wore bright red shirts some sort of imperial coat of arms on the top left. The instructors were around 20, some younger. It was essentially the blind leading the blind to their slaughter. 

The most disturbing part was when they needlessly marched them into the building in single file after making them stand at attention in two lines. The sound of their sneakers hitting the pavement in unison was pretty disturbing. 

This made me think of the Hitler youth and of Kony's child soldiers. I will never understand why a parent would send their child to be indoctrinated by the imperial cult so that their son or daughter can go die for the whims of the ruling class. The most ancient feudalism, monarchy, is what fuels this behavior in Canada. There are pictures of the queen in public school, and I can see a picture of her from where I sit in my University library. Her picture is qualitatively no different than the ludicrous pictures of the North Korean dictator. She is the 'dear leader,' the 'head of state,' and children are expected to learn to fight for her to their death. 

I cannot think of a more disturbing sight to see in a modern society than children being trained to march. There is no better way to sew the seeds of destruction than to teach a child that they are a slave to the head of state, and that they are nothing more than cannon fodder. 

""I, [name], do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada, Her Heirs and Successors. So help me God.""

There is no mention of community, democracy, or solidarity. It is just blind allegiance to a Czar. This is not something children should ever learn.
