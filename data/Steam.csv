ArmoredCavalry here, bringing you a /r/Steam Game Giveaway!

For those unfamiliar with myself or my site, I run [CheapShark.com](http://www.cheapshark.com), a site which keeps track of prices on digital download sites (Steam, Amazon, GreenManGaming, etc.), to make sure you get the best price on digital games. In addition, we now run weekly game giveaways as well.

I've done quite a few reddit giveaways in the past, including the ""Great Steam Game Giveaways"" over on r/gaming, here was the [last one](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/vblz5/the_fourth_great_steam_game_giveaway/).

I've spoken to the mods here, and they have kindly allowed me to run this one-time giveaway to introduce my site to you all.

**The Giveaway**

I'm giving away a few games, all of which will be in the form of a key which redeems on Steam. So, how do you enter for a chance to win? That part is easy. Just submit your reddit username along with which game you are interested in to the google docs entry form here:

**~~OFFICIAL ENTRY FORM~~** Entries are now closed

**Update:**

All winners have now been picked and PM'ed, congrats:

* Sonic Generations	- GhastlyBespoke

* R.U.S.E.: The Art of Deception - BillygotTalent

* Rochard - Alphafax

* Legend of Grimrock - Thebostralian420

* RAGE - SirLeos

* Sine Mora - WookieTriumvirate

* Batman Arkham City: GoTY - thatunoguy

That's it! As long as your account is more than a day old, you are automatically entered for a chance to win. Also, please only submit one entry, as any duplicates will simply be tossed out. The contest will stay open for the next 48 hours. Winners will be chosen randomly and announced here (as well as PM'ed) by the end of the week.

Also, if you do enter the giveaway, *I humbly request you consider* upvoting this post!

So, thanks for reading, be sure to check out [CheapShark](http://www.cheapshark.com) or the [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/cheapshark), and good luck to you all!",,False,self,t5_2qwis,1364583029.0,,,True,t3_1b2iyl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1b2iyl/the_great_rsteam_game_giveaway/,

At first I thought it was a bot or spam so I ignored it.  This morning I got this:

&gt;A few days ago, I sent you an offer to cooperate with our monetization platform, but you have not replied to me. Don't you want to make some profit out of your extension?

&gt;I looked at your Enhanced Steam extension - it looks great (you really did a good job there). Now let us try do our best, so both of our parties will benefit.

&gt;Let's work together. Let's see what happens.

This this was my reply:

&gt;Sorry I didn't answer your previous email, I did so out of courtesy to you.  Your website was registered just a little over 6 months ago, and it looks terrible.  Thus, I have no reason to trust it or you.  Your ""offer"" is deplorable: ""Commercialization is a fact of life"" (as it says on your website) is a terrible and untrue slogan.  You obviously did your research enough to find out that I administer a popular Google Chrome extension, congratulations.  What your research failed to show is that it has now been published as open-source material.  This means that if I were to suddenly stick a bunch of advertising in as you suggest, someone could easily fork the code and release an ""ad-free"" version.    You asking me to add advertising is like asking me to give up something I've worked hard to create.

&gt;Using Enhanced Steam requires a fair bit of trust on the part of my users, and commercializing the extension would be the quickest way to lose that trust.  You see, I didn't write this extension to make money, and one of my three original goals (as it states on my website) is that ""Enhanced Steam is 100% free to download, install, and use"".  This includes adding advertising.  

&gt;Your views of the world are obsolete.

I wanted to share because I want the community to know that Enhanced Steam will always be free and open.  If you don't already have it installed (and would like to) you can download it for Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox at [http://www.EnhancedSteam.com/download.php](http://www.EnhancedSteam.com/download.php)

And a huge ""Thank you"" again to the awesome Steam community for your support!",,False,self,t5_2qwis,False,,blackSteam,True,t3_1d5m7k,http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1d5m7k/im_the_original_author_of_enhanced_steam_here_is/,

No need to be a dick.
from junzafra sent 3 minutes ago
That was pretty mature of you to just remove me from your list, but that's cool. Be a dick about it and make sure that you go through with things next time. Oh yeah, you're an asshole.

.

I guess some people just can't wait and be patient for a FREE game, junzafra can forget about it, someone else will be picked as a winner instead. To the rest of you, who are being patient... thankyou for your patience. Re-installing my PC, upgrading, work, school and more work at the moment, but I will send the gifts soon. Sorry for the wait :)

1341338282.0,408,self.Steam,vzm65,Tinfoil-hat Crackpot Theory on the Impending Sale,PSBlake,541,133,307,http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/vzm65/tinfoilhat_crackpot_theory_on_the_impending_sale/,"This is going to sound crazy. It probably is, but then again, ARGs and scavenger-hunt clues get pretty esoteric sometimes. If Valve was trying to subtly hint at when the sale might occur, they would probably do it with the kind of bizarre moon-logic that Sierra On-Line used to use in games like King's Quest IV. Put simply, my hypothesis is that the date of the upcoming sale is being hinted at in the representative image for each Daily Deal game.

Running through the logic in my head, I feel like [Boyd](http://psychonauts.wikia.com/wiki/The_Milkman_Conspiracy) piecing together an elaborate pattern from disparate sources. Nonetheless, here goes:

* Most of the Steam community expected that the Summer Sale would follow the pattern of the previous two Summer Sales - Launching on the last Thursday in June. The sale which went up instead was for [Analogue: A Hate Story](http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/209370/capsule_467x181.jpg). A few people focused on the clock, but for purposes of my mad theory, look instead at the girl's ponytail. There are seven segments to her ponytail.
* The next daily deal was [Midnight Mysteries Collection](http://cdn.steampowered.com/v/gfx/subs/15239/header_586x192.jpg). I'm having a hard time fitting this one into the theory, but I can see one possible justification: The clock face shows two minutes to twelve: 12 divided by 2 is six. Admittedly, this is a bit of a stretch. (And no, there are more than six fireflies or whatever they are - I count at least eight)
* The next daily deal was [Governor of Poker 2: Premium Edition](http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/70210/capsule_467x181.jpg). Note the $5 chip in the lower right corner of the image.
* Next came [Zombie Driver](http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/31410/capsule_467x181.jpg) - Four blades protrude from the front of the vehicle.
* Yesterday's deal was [Space Ark](http://storefront.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/19320/capsule_467x181.jpg) - The rocket has 3 windows.
* Today's deal is [Legendary](http://cdn.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/16730/header.jpg?t=1270602384), which shows a human fighting several monsters. There are two gryphons.

The pattern (if there is one) forms a countdown, indicating Thursday of this week - which, by my understanding, is when major events generally happen on Steam anyway.

Yes, it's reaching. Yes, it's based primarily on wishful thinking and shaky reasoning. Sure, I'm probably wrong. But it still makes a weird, ""throw the dehydrated water canister to kill Orat"" kind of sense.

If the pattern holds, I would expect a game tomorrow which emphasizes the number 1 - Maybe Serious Sam: The First Encounter, Alpha Prime, or Lone Survivor. In fact, Lone Survivor would seem more probable to me, since it fits the pattern of a lower-profile, indie-developed game which won't generate a lot of excitement if it goes on sale (Since it was included in the most recent Humble Bundle).

That's it. That's my daily dose of crazy.",,False,self,t5_2qwis,False,,,True,t3_vzm65,http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/vzm65/tinfoilhat_crackpot_theory_on_the_impending_sale/,

Games were $60, or maybe a few bucks less if you waited 18 months. I played basically only AAA titles. Old games / indie games may have been interesting, but rarely motivated me to buy a disc.

Then I got a gaming PC, and some Steam credit. So I was able to put together a very large library (which means a big backlog) for very little money.

and now - $3-$5 i consider low enough to take a risk on something even if i end up not liking it.

Now, with the huge backlog, it's no problem to wait for AAA titles to go on 75% off sale, and with all these good old games (KOTOR II, for example) on sale for $3, it's just making the backlog even longer. 

So I have Dishonored at the top of my Wishlist, but no real motivation to buy it because I have dozens of games that will easily fill the time between now and...the next Winter Sale, probably. Hell, I'll probably fill that much time *re-playing* Skyrim.

These pennies add up after a while, but never to an amount where you could actually buy something worth it with them. I was wondering if it would be a good idea to maybe get Valve to put in a tip jar steam feature to where you can donate a few cents, and all proceeds would go to a charity. I personally would use it all the time with the 1-3 cents I usually have left after a purchase of a game or item on Steam. It could be limited to small amounts too, to keep it like a tip jar (because if you wanted to donate 10 dollars to charity, you should probably be on their website, donating it to them directly lol). This idea is just something that could make a great use of those stray pennies in our steam wallets taking up virtual space.

Get a list of 10-15 games that you know you want right now on your wishlist and that way when you can use it as a checklist throughout the event to make sure you use your wallet money on things you really wanted BEFOREHAND. 

This also serves a dual-purpose because on the last day during the ""Last Chance"" deals you can just check your wishlist to see what is worth picking up at the end and what is not.

1357147533.0,190,self.Steam,15u13t,Steam Big Picture - Everything you need to know,IamAnEngineer,237,47,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/15u13t/steam_big_picture_everything_you_need_to_know/,"Hi guys,

I figure our steam reddit could use a general guide (with more details than the official website) for people to get up and running with big picture quickly - I have accrued some wisdom trying to set up my own but perhaps people could comment in with additional details and I can update the main post.

**What is Steam Big Picture (SBP)**
Essentially with the new update of steam, the top right corner will have a ""Big Picture"" option which will make steam more navigable with a game pad. The menu system is revamped to easily switch between tabs and find your games, and there is a nice browser interface as well. This mode is aimed at connecting your PC to a large monitor such as a TV where it is assumed you are sitting far away and you are using a gamepad. Games on steam now have a designation wether they are controller compatible, partially compatible, or not very compatible.

**What you will need**
You will need a way to output video and audio (if required) to your larger monitor. A wireless gamepad is recommended, but a wired one is good too. Or use your wired/wireless keyboard and mouse. Additional accessories such as wireless video adapters might also be required - read on.

**Choosing an input device**
Ideally you will want a gamepad of some sort - wireless is the best option. I recommend the microsoft xbox360 controller for PC. It can be had for about ~$40 in the US. Also the logitech F710 is a good pad, but slightly more expensive. If you live in Canada, I managed to find prices for both controllers for around $40 on sale (usually around 60-70). A note about the 360 controller - most PC games are designed for it, so minimal tinkering is required with the settings if you go that route. If you don't want to shell out lots of money for a new gamepad, you can buy a cheap USB bluetooth dongle for PS3 controller (if you have a ps3) and use appropriate drivers from the internets to set it up that way (google ""motioninjoy""). Finally, I find having a wireless keyboard is useful if you want to do web browsing in SBP.

**Connecting SBP to your PC**
There are several routes you can go here. If your PC is in close proximity to the TV, you can get an HDMI cable. This will carry both audio and video. There are several consideration: makes sure the HDMI cable is rated ""high speed"", not all HDMI cables are made the same and they all have some inherent losses. HDMI cables usually have some AWG rating. For cables 15 ft and under, you will be safe with a 28 AWG cable, for anything longer go with 26 or lower. Here is an explanation from monoprice: http://www.monoprice.com/home/home.asp?pn=help&amp;idx=12. Note their standards are a bit exaggerated. Do not drop big $$$ on HDMI cables that tout having gold connectors or buy the ""monster"" brand. This is all B.S. I got a great HDMI cable that is 15 ft for about $15. For us Canadians, I highly recommend shopping at Canada Computers (their iCAN brand is fine). Other options involve using a long DVI cable or VGA, and having sound come from your PC speakers. If your TV is far away from your PC, you can invest in some sort of wireless technology. I don't know much about this subject (perhaps others can comment) but such a technology for example is WiDi (you can google). It allows sending of a 1080p signal wirelessly between compatible devices. Expect to invest some serious $$$ if you end up going this route.

**Latency and Sound Configuration**
One drawback to using SBP is latency found in a lot of TVs. Latency refers to how long it takes between when you press something and when it actually happens on the screen. Samsung TVs are among the best picture quality wise, but suffer from some latency. Luckily, some TVs will come with a ""Game"" mode or a special input that has reduced latency at the expense of post-processing (very small expense). For example, in my samsung TV, I have an input labelled DVI/HDMI1 which is specifically designed to have a lower latency. If you are buying a new TV, try to read up about latency. Usually the TV is the major bottleneck for latency.

If you connect big picture via HDMI, you'll notice something annoying in that windows can only output to one sound device, and it doesn't automatically know to switch to the TV. Usually what I do is right click on the speak icon in the task bar and change my default output device to the TV. Alternatively, you can follow this guide to have both your PC speakers and TV output audio at the same time: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-pictures/is-it-possible-to-have-speakers-and-hdmi-play-at/4563a5f8-4be4-4463-b312-eff594a9ae49. Note you will have to turn off the PC speakers for things not to get annoying when you play big picture.


I think that covers quite a bit - please feel free to comment with more details and I'll add them. Cheers!

**Useful tips from members:**

* when connecting to a TV, you might get overscan, particularly over HDMI. possible solutions include (1) setting your TV to ""1:1"" or ""just scan"" or ""screen fit"" (samsung) mode or (2) adjusting overscan in your video driver settings. CCC, for example, has the ability to underscan. You can also improve 10-ft readability by adjusting DPI settings in windows.
* holding the XBOX button on a 360 controller for 10 seconds will launch Big Picture Mode, even if Steam is minimized to the systray.
* a $20 USB ""xbox wireless controller adapter"" is perfect for this setup
* if using audio over HDMI, set your PC to never turn the display off. at least with AMD cards, it appears that this will disable the audio and require you to reboot your PC.
* some games will still require you use a launcher, so you'll need a K/M.
* the MotionJoy driver only works with certain bluetooth adapters. i'd recommend checking that before buying a PS3 controller.
* While HDMI does carry audio, DVI by default does not. So if you only have DVI outputs on your GPU(s), you will need to look into how to get your GPU to output digital audio along with video. If you have an Nvidia card, this is done with a S/PDIF cable that is supposed to come with your GPU. The two pronged end goes into your GPU, the other end connects to your audio card or motherboard's onboard audio. I'm not sure how it is done with AMD cards.
* SBP mode works in OSX too. But to use the Xbox controller you might need this driver http://tattiebogle.net/index.php/ProjectRoot/Xbox360Controller/OsxDriver
* Seems a lot of people tend to recommend to disregard the ""high speed"" designation and go for any old HDMI cable - at least for short (&lt;15 ft) cables. The official HDMI website says that the ""high speed"" standard is named so for a reason, as it can accommodate high data rates, and offers further expandability to higher resolutions: http://www.hdmi.org/learningcenter/faq.aspx 
* If you want to grab an xbox controller, best buy will pricematch internet prices. I got two of these wireless controller + dongle packages for $32 and $40 on two separate trips to best buy. The price was had changed on amazon in the meantime.
* there are a few ways to launch directly into Big Picture mode
1)steam protocol: steam://open/bigpicture
2)command line args: steam.exe -bigpicture (I think -tenfoot works too)
3)steam settings: Settings &gt; Account &gt;click ""Start Steam in Big picture mode""
* If you use a wired xbox controller (i use one of the newer black ones) you don't need to buy any plug in to connect the controller and window automatically installed the drivers for it.
* For a logitech pad being used with non-supported games, you will have to switch the mode and configure the software, and REMEMBER to turn the mode (xinput, direct) back if button bindings and joystick directions are weird in some games (saints row 3, red faction armageddon, and spec ops the line are three games that act in this way)",,False,self,t5_2qwis,1357232086.0,,,True,t3_15u13t,http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/15u13t/steam_big_picture_everything_you_need_to_know/,

Personally, I do it sometimes, but I always feel a little bit bad for it (especially if it's an awesome game and I spend a lot of time on it).  That being said, I just wanted to share a little story...

So I went through a few months late last year where I didn't have a lot of cash to spend on ANYTHING, let alone entertainment.  I'm talking flat broke, no money whatsoever broke...  So, during that time I downloaded a bunch of games from different torrent sites to keep myself occupied, some were awesome, some not so much.  

Fast forward a few months, I decided that I'd start buying the games I'd previously pirated on Steam to make up for it.  I had about 10 of them in a folder on my PC, and every time I had a bit of extra money I would go buy one of them on Steam and delete my pirated copy.  Finally today I completely cleared out that folder, feelsgoodman.  

Anyway, I'm not posting this for karma (clearly since it's a self post), but I just wanted to put it out there that if any of you have a bunch of pirated games that you GENUINELY ENJOYED PLAYING, it's not too late to go and pay for them after the fact.  It's only fair for the developer to get the money (especially if they are small), and often times you'll find that a $60 game you played when it first came out might only be $10 to buy now.  Even though you're getting it for 1/6 the price you would have paid up front, it's still better to pay the $10 then nothing at all.  

That's it, happy gaming!",,False,self,t5_2qwis,True,,,True,t3_tfau0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/tfau0/its_never_too_late_to_pay_for_games_youve_played/,

In rare conditions, I could also do five pages for any game under $10, although I would prefer to alternate readers (I don't think you can proofread more than 2 pages efficiently). I will have every page proofread by two readers.

The subject is economy, it's a pretty simple read. Some pages have tables and pictures on them, so luck to you!",,False,self,t5_2qwis,False,,,True,t3_wlzqa,http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/wlzqa/i_will_buy_you_any_game_under_5_the_only/,

* If you are not posting something genuinely unique and interesting please do not post. There are other subreddits that  would rather have your ""My wallet is dying"" or ""Gaben"" posts. 
* All the sales will be able to be found on /r/steamdeals or [Steam's homepage](http://store.steampowered.com/) as well as there will be a condensed listing in each day thread. 
* All individual threads about should I buy this game will be removed. Please post them in the Day 4 thread found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1ia6om/rsteam_should_i_buy_this_game_steam_summer_sale/).

Plenty of people probably don't want the game you do, and every person should vote for their personal preference.

This is such a small community that vote requests are probably not going to do anything anyways, and usually are for the game that is viewed as the ""favorite"" to win.

I think most people would like to see sale discussions, or maybe posts about deals that aren't advertised right on the front page.

So let's make some good out of this.
Just to gauge interest...
I might buy this goofy stupid game, and any other games that come on sale this week for &lt;$10, and run a stream from 6PM-11pm trying to ""beat the game"" I'll also have a donation button setup that donates money toward a local charity. Could call it ""Steam's Shitty Sale Stream 2012"" ?

EDIT: Making stream.

If someone wants to X-post this into /r/gaming or something that would be fine too.

After 2 hours of streaming, and 10 viewers. I can no longer in interest of my sanity continue to play this game.

How would I describe it?
2 Hours of rainbows, while playing ""BrickBreak game"" Seriously. 

Rainbows.... Everywhere...

* All the sales will be able to be found on /r/steamdeals or [Steam's homepage](http://store.steampowered.com/) as well as there will be a condensed listing in each day thread. 
* All individual threads about should I buy this game will be removed. Please post them in the Day 7 thread found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1ihtb2/rsteam_should_i_buy_this_game_steam_summer_sale/).

I had been meaning to get in on Steam in a sale, but can't complain with free xD.

First thing's first i downloaded the installation files and installed it.

This loaded up Ubisoft installer, which you run through, but doing so made me realize i hadn't installed a game normally like this in maybe 2 years? I felt like a god damn peasant! :p

It installed fine and so i loaded uPlay. No game tied to my account. Thats odd i thought.... I manually browsed to the Farcry installation folder and ran the exe manually, and then it picked up in uPlay. I wonder what would happen if someone didn't realize they had to browse to the installation directory?

Ran the game... and now it needs patching. Well i downloaded the full game just now, why wasn't it the latest version&gt;&lt; 

Ran the patch, it crashed. Ran it again, and it worked.

Clicked play.... and now another patch-which also crashed.

Got it working in the end, but god damn do i love Steam.",,False,self,t5_2qwis,False,,,True,t3_14lkei,http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/14lkei/didnt_realize_how_much_i_appreciate_steam_till_my/,

My tip is:
If you want to put money into your steam wallet, buy them from Game.
Get a GAME loyalty card. 


For every purchase you get points, which can be used for money off a purchase in the future.


I know people don't like GAME as they over price products, but you can't over price vouchers. £20 is £20.  
So it is like free money.  


Just yesterday I got £20 Steam Wallet Voucher for £15.

EDIT: as LordGravewish pointed out below, it seems the code above can also be used on other games for 25% off. It's in the sidebar but worth repeating...[list of games on Green Man Gaming that can be activated on Steam](http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2046945)

So, I decided to make a tutorial on it. The reason I wanted to get the pictures, is so I could make a [launcher] (http://i.imgur.com/bPmJX1j.jpg) with [rainmeter] (http://rainmeter.net/cms/) but that's for another tutorial.

Downloading the steam banners is actually super easy.

1. Go to the store page for the game you want. I'm going to use [Portal 2] (http://store.steampowered.com/app/620/?snr=1_7_15__13).

2. As you can see in the URL bar, there is a section with ""/app/(number)"". For portal, its ""/app/620/"". Therefor, Portal 2 is app ""620"". You will need this number for every game you want to download the banner for.

3. Next, go to [this website] (http://cdn.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/%5Bappid%5D/header.jpg). You will get a ""404 Not Found"" error. As you can see in the URL bar, there is ""/[appid]/"". You want to replace the [appid] with the app number from the game you chose. So the new URL will be this: 

  |http://cdn.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/620/header.jpg

 |Notice the 620.

4. It will now show a picture (hopefully from the game you wanted).

5. Right click the picture and click ""Save-As"" and download the picture.



If you want to change (or add) a banner to a steam game, go into the [steam grid view] (http://i.imgur.com/pSyTwMo.jpg) and right click a game. Chose ""Set Custom Image..."" and browse for the image. 

I found a cool pack of banners for a ton of games [here](http://mustkunstn1k.deviantart.com/art/Official-Steam-Grid-Image-Collection-319862312) It has some pretty sick banners.

Well, it's not so obvious, because Valve don't own that domain - instead we have some 90s design site with simple msg: 

&gt;""welcome to steam.com. Steam.com is the former home of Steam Tunnel Operations. **This domain is not for sale.**""
(screenshot for paranoid parrots: http://i.imgur.com/JV0hm.png )

At the beginning I thought it might be some Public stuff that doesn't care, but as ""WebArchive"" tool [shows](http://web.archive.org/web/19961227144652/http://www.steam.com/ ) it was site of some IT company. It was registered in 1994 (via whois tool) and from what I dug up for all this time is still possession of [one guy](http://who.godaddy.com/whois.aspx?domain=steam.com&amp;prog_id=GoDaddy). The site is pretty much in same state (simple design/""not for sale"" sign) since 2004 and it's really puzzling. I mean, it's like someone would register ""McDonalds.com"" before they made success and almost 10 years later still holding the domain with ""not for sale"" sign instead of getting *some* $. 

Is it possible that the owner is simply not aware what brand ""Steam"" become since ~2004? Or maybe he's rich like hell and he don't care? Or maybe he's dead and after 11-Jul-13 (expiration date) ""Steam"" will have new homepage?

Go to control panel and open internet options. Go to connections then lan settings and untick Automatically detect settings.

This instantly makes doing anything within steam miles faster than how it acted before you made the change.

I do not know why it fully works but I am sure someone will be able to fix it.

If for whatever reason things suddenly break when you untick that box, retick it and live with slow steam.

1343292448.0,130,self.Steam,x6jdr,New Steam User? Read this!,essidus,155,25,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/x6jdr/new_steam_user_read_this/,"Okay, so the Steam Summer Sale (SSS) has brought a lot of people into the Steam-based gaming fold. Many of you have questions, and so I've decided to give you some answers!

This guide is not a detailed examination of the Steam platform. I'm sure there's plenty of that out there. If there isn't, I'll make one later. This is to help you newbs get acclimated to your strange, scary, new enviornment and get the most out of it.

The most important thing to remember about Steam is that its actually three different things put together. It's a virtual software merchant/DRM handler, a software manager with cloud support, and a community. I only bring this up because you'll need to know that as we continue.

So, the biggest question a new Steam user asks is ""What games should I get?"" This is like going to a video store and asking what movies you should rent. Ya know, if such places still existed. Its 100% what kind of games you like. Here's a couple things that will help though:

* Look up a game you know on the market, and scroll down to the bottom of that game's page. There will usually be three games recommended, and so far its worked fairly well for me.

* Search by genre. Right up on the top of the store page there's a list of genres. Starting from that, you'll usually find your way to something interesting.

* If you absolutely must ask the world, the friendly folks over at /r/gamingsuggestions are the best people to ask. Mention that you're on Steam, and you're looking for games like X and/or game style Y.

Speaking of search (I did mention search somewhere right? ...Yep, cool) the advanced search system on Steam is a masterfully crafted tool. You can set up params for nearly every field games have connected to them. In a few clicks, I get the full list of games under $5 with a metascore above 90. All three of them.

Now, general shopping on Steam can be confounding at first. Aside from the things above, here's all you really need to get started: On the right side of the Store's featured items page there's a box called Specials. Clicking see all will show you most of the things that have a limited time sale price. 

Just above that in the blue box is the daily deal. It'll show a new game every 24 hours and generally resets at noon Central Standard Time. What does that mean for your time? I dunno, check the timer. There's also the midweek madness sale, which is usually -%75 and runs from Tues noon to Thurs noon (CST), and the weekend deals which runs from Friday noon until Monday noon (CST). Small note- Daily deal is usually one game, midweek madness is normally one game or one game franchise, and the weekend deals are normally several games.

Last thing on sales: check out [Steam Game Sales](http://www.steamgamesales.com/). They give a rather thorough list of sales not just on Steam, but from elsewhere.

Okay so now you know all about how to find games and get the best deals. But can you even play these games? Well, each game page will show the minimum and recommended specs for a game. That's pretty useless though. Instead, go to [Can you run it?](http://www.systemrequirementslab.com) and look up your game there. it will run a little app that tastes your computer and lets you know if you have the right flavor.

**Note for Apple Users**: You don't have a whole lot of games to choose from. On the store's main page, look for your little apple symbol. It'll take you to a special storefront that shows all the games that can run on OS X. Otherwise it operates more or less the same as the general storefront. 

**Note for Linux Users** They're working on it. Chill.

**Note for Windows 7 Users**: Old games don't always play well on new systems. If a game was made before around 2006, you'll need a second opinion. Search the net or join the game's official group (right side of the game's store page) and ask in chat or on the forum. Some friendly person will let you know if you should be expect any trouble.

This next part could probably be called Steam: The good the bad and the ugly. That's super overused though, so don't call it that. Lets say you bought, I dunno, Railworks 3: Train Simulator 2012. That purchase is tied to your Steam account. First, that means that you've bought it forever. The license is yours until the end of Steam. Second that means that **no matter what computer you're on, as long as it has Steam you can use it to play your game**. Of course it helps if the game is already downloaded. If the game uses the Steam Cloud feature, it means it also saves a copy of your game files online, so even those will go with you.

There are problems with this, however. Especially the cloud part. Lets say your neighbor forgot to pay their internet bill, so you don't have an internet connection. What happens then? Well, you can still run Steam in offline mode. However, some of your games either won't play at all, or will give you a lot of trouble. This isn't entirely Steam's fault. a lot of the issues come from [3rd party DRM](http://steamdrm.flibitijibibo.com/index.php?page=DRM_Lists/The_Big_DRM_List). That list will show you most of the games on Steam that have some sort of DRM, and how to deal with it. If you aren't sure what DRM is, [read this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management).

There is another, far less major problem. The personal library is very unyielding sometimes. The default layout puts the games in alphabetical order, and the only way to change it is to manually put them into a Category. The most I end up using this for is to remind myself which games I'm actively playing right now. The list view gives you more control over sorting but, its too ugly to use regularly. There is also a grid view, but it just looks cluttered.

You can also add your non-Steam games (and every other piece of software on your computer, really) to your library. Sometimes it'll even give you the Steam overlay.

Finally, a brief bit about the Steam community. There are a ton of steam groups. Most of them are useless, frankly. A fair number of games have an official group set up, which can be useful for finding out more information about the game, setting up groups for multiplayer, etc. I've found though that most of the user groups don't do you a whole lot of good, especially when they come from random people inviting you. It doesn't hurt you in any way to join a group though, so feel free to shop around! By the way, [here's the primary reddit group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/reddit).

The more important thing about the community is the involvement with game development, through the Steam Workshop. Team Fortress 2 is the best example of this. Most of the maps, guns, and hats were developed by members of the community. Portal 2 has a community-based testing thing that lets you run chambers made by other people. DotA 2 isn't even released yet and people are making custom stuff for it. Valve believes in the power of community creativity, and uses that to help improve their games. Their philosophy is shared by other developers, and support for that sort of thing is slowly being added for non-valve games, such as Skyrim.

As with any other kind of online interaction, you have to be careful about others in online games. There are plenty of cheaters, hackers, scammers, griefers, and all that other fun stuff. Don't accept game invites or gifts from people you don't know unless you can verify that its legit. Trust your good sense to identify potential elicit behavior, and immediately remove yourself from it. Steam uses something called the VAC (Valve Anti-cheat) system. [Details here](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7849-Radz-6869#notvac). Basically, its an automated system for detecting and removing cheaters. If VAC bans you, it'll ban you across all VAC-secured servers. This doesn't mean you can't play online any more. First, many games have servers that aren't VAC-secured, or a mix of both. Second, you can appeal a VAC ban with tech support.

Okay, that's it, I'm pretty sure I'm done. Everything else will be handled via FAQ or just asking.

First of all I just want to say how much we appreciate the feedback we got from our last little pow-wow . As you can see we have taken some of the feedback and have begun to implement some new features (the current deals in the banner). We know that they have been sort of lax on updating but we are gonna get on our shit, I promise!

Alright, lets get down to brass tax (incoming wall of text!!). The Steam Summer Sale will be starting shortly if not tomorrow and I just want to say that there will be some serious traffic here during that time. Because of this and what we have seen in the past, we will be removing all posts that contain memes that dont have any substance. A perfect example is the Game of Thrones meme stating ""Summer Sale is coming"". Or [this.](http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/22533568.jpg) Also, please check to see if there are already posts about what you are going to ask. There do not need to be 5 posts about whether or not you should get this game. On that note, NO BEGGING FOR GAMES BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO MONEY. I know that might sound cruel but honestly I am sick of seeing them. This is not the subreddit for that type of thing.

Other Notes:

* We have added /r/SummerHunt to the sidebar to help those with the Summer Sale 
* We also have added [FAQ about Steams Big Sales](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/vnrr5/faqs_about_steams_big_sales/) (credit to [bryanhbell](http://www.reddit.com/user/bryanhbell)) to the sidebar. 
* WE ALMOST HAVE 15k SUBS!!!!

We are gonna be working on the Steam user names in flair soon so stay tuned. Also if you have all have any suggestions for how we can improve things here like more flair (suggestions would be helpful), your pet peeves about posts here, or just how much we suck, we would love to hear them.

Thanks all, enjoy the Summer Sale and dont go bankrupt!

Day 3 will be Tomb Raider.

The background is a map, http://i.imgur.com/FZSI0dw.jpg the icons represent the games that will be the 10 daily deals, these games have postcards, they will be revealed to have trading cards before or at the time of their sale. I expect the map will update, showing us where we are going to next and revealing the next days daily deal before it is live.

We are going on a summer getaway, flying from deal to deal each day, buying the games, collecting cards, getting a postcard. Starting with bioshock infinite.

So the following games will be dailydeals, and have trading cards by the time they are on sale. So don't buy them before the daily if you want them at the cheapest price.

    Kerbal Space Program

    Tomb Raider

    Chivalry: Medieval Warfare

Also I literally just bought the Canadian bundle/ am anticipating doing research for school that will involve the Myst series, and I thought it was worth it to buy the Cyan bundle but I haven't worked on my research yet so subtracting the games from those two bundles there are only 51 games that I haven't played a lot.

Also there are some games in bundles I've bought that I just dislike.

I did [another giveaway](http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/rkxl1/i_got_a_little_raise_today_reddit_to_celebrate_im/) a couple of months ago and this one will be in the pretty much the same format.


Here's how it works. Should be simple enough:


1. Everyone who wants a game, pick an English language movie and also the game you'd like (with an approximate price to make my work a little easier). I specify 'english language' because last time, one person assumed I meant movies from England.


2. I'll get back on this thread some hours later, maybe even tomorrow, and present a list of random movies that come up in my head (without reading the comments).


3. Once the list is ready, I'll find the first person (chronologically) to comment with that movie and that person wins the game they asked for. I'll do this up until I hit around about the $75 cap.


4. I'll also put up the list of winners so you guys can verify that I have the right ones.


5. [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/rkxl1/i_got_a_little_raise_today_reddit_to_celebrate_im/c46p2x8) is the list of movies I came up with last time. These movies are **not** going to be in the list this time around!


Good luck, reddit. Let's do this!


**A couple of clarifications:**


1. If two people have the same movie, it goes to the person who posted that movie first.


2. If I have only, say, $20 left and someone asked for a game costing $50, that person will get the chance to change their game to something fitting the budget.


3. As an example, ""Lord of the rings"" is not a valid entry. If you mention the name of an entire series of movies, I'll assume you mean the first part. It would help to be specific.

The user *vgxmaster* told me ' if you ask Steam Support REEALLLYY NICELY, they sometimes remove the game from your account. '. So I went ahead and wrote an email:


&gt;Dear Steam Support,

&gt;The problem is, that I already activated it, well a relative in Asia
did it for me. I found out that I could play, after some searches I
got it installed and was able to play a game, after some waiting.
Now, I can not play or download it anymore, 'region restricted',
everytime. So my very very sorry request is for you to remove my Dota
2, because I really really want to play it, because I have an invite
that I can acitvate, but I already have a region locked version of
this great game installed, so it will not activate. Pretty pretty
please? (Even though the physical appearance of 'please' makes no
difference?)

&gt;With (very) kind regards (and quite possibly love),

&gt;DeLiri0us

A few days later:

&gt;Hello,

&gt;A staff member has replied to your question:

&gt;Hello DeLiri0us,

&gt;I have removed the title from your account.

&gt;If you have any further questions, please let us know - we will be happy to assist you.

So it IS possible.

1341780408.0,112,self.Steam,w8hae,Advice For Posting About The Steam Sale,bryanhbell,142,30,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/w8hae/advice_for_posting_about_the_steam_sale/,"Over at /r/Games, the mods recently submitted [this post](//www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/vp0a7) outlining their rules for posting about the upcoming Steam Summer Sale 2012. I don't know what special rules the mods here think are appropriate for this subreddit, but I thought I'd summarize what the mods at /r/Games said because it seems likely to apply here as well.

The basic idea behind the guidelines is to cut down on the volume of duplicate, irrelevant, and off-topic posts so redditors can enjoy the other wonderful content in the subreddit.

1. **Please don't beg for games**: this includes (but is not limited to) ""That game isn't available in my region, can someone buy it for me?"", ""I'm poor and can't afford it..."", ""I get paid tomorrow but it's on sale today, can someone spot me?"", etc. Better to post these kinds of things at /r/RandomActsOfGaming or /r/GiftofGames instead.

2. **Please don't post trade threads**: this guideline is already clearly laid out in the sidebar, but bears repeating. Better to post these to /r/SteamGameSwap instead.

3. **Please don't post giveaways**: normally, I enjoy seeing and participating in these threads, but during Steam's big sales when games are really cheap, people get generous and we start to see way too many of them. During the big sales, it's best to post these kinds of things at /r/RandomActsOfGaming instead.

4. **Please try to keep discussions relating to the Steam sales to a single thread per day**: this includes (but is not limited to) ""Is this game worth picking up"", ""Have they patched _____ since release"", etc. So before you post, check to see if there's already a similar post first. If someone posts something here like [this](//www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/nray9), you might want to add a comment there instead of creating a whole new post.

5. **Please read the [FAQs About Steam's Big Sales](//www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/vnrr5) before posting a question about the sale**: I made this FAQ to help out redditors who are new to Steam's big sales. The mods here have graciously agreed to include a link to it on the sidebar. If you have questions about the sale that you don't see in the FAQ, ask it in the FAQ thread. I (and likely other redditors) will monitor that thread to provide answers before, during, and after the sale.

As some may know, a Multiplayer mod has been in development for a few years now. It wasn't until 2012 that the development of it truly spun off though, and ever since the summer of 2012, the developers of this Multiplayer-mod has regularly held weekend-tests (And a single full-week test).  

This weekend, there's another test being held for this mod. The test started roughly 10 hours ago, and will run for the next ~38 hours (A total of 48 hours).

If you already own Just Cause 2, the Multiplayer-mod can be found over at www.jc-mp.com.  
Your Steam-account will be used to gain access to this mod.

Be a gentleman, and give those who doesn't own this game a chance at grabbing it for cheap. I know it has been up for sale quite a few times the past year or so, but let's kick it off one more time, now that the focus is all around the summersale, and more people are utilizing Steam than usual!  

EDIT:  
Allow me to also mention that Just Cause 2 is a great game by itself, and anyone who hasn't, should try out the singleplayer as well! This WIP MP-mod is simply just an amazing added bonus. It has even gained recognition and appreciation from Avalanche Studios (Developers of JC2), and a couple of individual developers at the studio.  

EDIT2:  

Just to expand a bit, with some more info regarding JC2 Multiplayer:  

Multiplayer for JC2 is open world free for all.
Keep in mind, as it is still going through some heavy development, this mod is not yet meant as a solid platform solely for your multiplayer pleasure. They are not adding features per request. So do not get upset or angry if certain things do not cater to you, or if something is bugged. Instead, report it properly.  

These weekend-tests are held so that the developers can find any issues, and correct them - and at the same time optimize it, to make it ready for another weekend-test at a later date. This is a ""rinse &amp; repeat"" process. Once they feel comfortable with what they have, they will release the server-files. The server-files for this mod should release later this year, according to the developers.

Right now, you can do a few things in the multiplayer, including:  

- Normal FFA in the open world.  
- Teleport to specific areas in the world. (Hotspots such as the airport)  
- Join or create factions. Factions can have passwords, and members of a faction can teleport to each other.  
- Join the Destruction Derby dome - this is in a different instance, secluded from the open world.  
- Join races. These are also in an instance secluded from the open world.  
- Purchase new player-models, weapons, vehicles and aircraft. Money is earned by killing other players in the world, and completing races. (Only player-models save upon death/reconnect)  
- Chat with people. There's both a global and a local chat. The global chat can be disabled.  

When you're in-game, the F-keys can be used to enable/disable certain things, or open certain menus. The B-key can be used to open the Buy-menu. I can't remember the exact keys, but try the keys between F1 and F8.  

To anyone who needs help, or wants to chat about the mod; you can join the official JC2-MP IRC: https://www.jc-mp.com/chat/ - or through your own IRC-client: irc.jc-mp.com #jc2-mp",,False,self,t5_2qwis,1374369052.0,,022,True,t3_1ipdh1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1ipdh1/just_cause_2_vote_for_it_buy_it_and_take_part_in/,

If you're into this sort of game you should check out this free program.
 
http://en.spaceengine.org/

This Russian programmer created the observable universe as a free 3D space simulation and made it available online.

It let's you fly around the universe basically. I would kill if Mass Effect or something used this for a basis of a game.

**Edit:** Excerpt on the Program/Capabilities:

* All types of celestial objects are represented: galaxies, nebulae, stars and star clusters, planets and moons, comets and asteroids.
* The observer is free to move around the universe. Transition between any celestial body and any scale occurs seamlessly.
* Known celestial objects are represented using data from the catalogs: galaxies (NGC/IC), stars (HIPPARCOS), star clusters, nebulae, planets (our Solar system data and known extrasolar planets).
* Uncharted regions of space feature procedurally generated objects: galaxies, stars, star clusters, nebulae and planetary systems.
* The observer can move around in space using the WASD keys, like in First Person Shooters. Movement with inertia is made possible in Spacecraft mode or Aircraft mode.
* ""Select and fly"" autopilot: just click on any object with the mouse and hit the 'G' key to automatically go directly to the object.
* Automatic binding of the observer to the moving object and automatic selection of optimum flight speed.
* Search for celestial objects by name. Search for stars in certain radius. Scalable map of the Universe and a planetary system browser. Saving locations and autopilot's journal.
* Built-in Wiki system with descriptions of many known objects and ability to extend by user. Possibility of renaming and describing of any object, including procedural ones.
* The orbital motion of planets and stars is calculated in real time, with the ability to accelerate, decelerate, or reverse the flow of time.
* Showing of orbital paths of celestial objects, their rotation and motion vectors, labels and markers, celestial grid, current selection pointer and user velocity vector.
* Volumetric 3D models of galaxies and nebulae with interstellar dust clouds.
* 3D landscapes of planets and stars: for many solar system bodies actual data from space probes is used, for uncharted and procedural planets the surface is generated procedurally on the GPU.
* The exact model of the Earth's atmosphere (code by Eric Bruneton), adapted for the other planets.
* Lighting effects: lens flares, solar eclipses, shadows of planetary rings. Celestial objects cast light and shadows onto each other.
* Controllable space ships (alpha).
* Localization of many languages with the ability to add new ones.
* Ability to import users addons: models, catalogs, textures.

It can no longer be updated, the dev (overhaul games) is in a legal struggle about the rights. Right now they get no money from the steam sales (and can't sell it on their own platform anymore: http://www.baldursgate.com/) and until the Atari rights find a new owner and they get an agreement in place with overhaul games, I strongly recommend to keep away from this version.

Secondly this version offers very little you can't have with the original Baldur's Gate game and some mods. The core experience is arguably even better with the modded original version. In fact if you grab both Baldurs Gate and Baldurs Gate 2 from www.gog.com and get the BGT mod you probably have the best Baldurs Gate experience possible right now. They are not on sale over on gog atm, but usually they go on sale about 2-3 times a year.

**tl;dr:**

Because of legal struggles the version can no longer be updated and the dev gets no more money.

I am currently running the game on Windows 7 64-bit with a standard Intel HD graphics card. After spending somewhere around 5 or 6 hours looking all around for any help with this matter and trying numerous things, I have finally figured out a fix for it. First, I recommend going to http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1328904 (as fellow redditor Biomilk suggested). If you try the fixes on this forum and still can't fix the problem, here is my suggestion:

If you installed the game through Steam, go to your games/fallout 3/ folder and copy the d3d9.dll file,
then go to your Fallout 3 folder in steam/steamapps/common/fallout 3 goty/ and paste the d3d9.dll file in this folder. Try running the game again and if that still doesn't work, delete the d3d9.dll file from steam/steamapps/common/fallout 3 goty/ and instead download the d3d9.dll file from here www.mediafire.com/?am8daeaj1rmc7oe. This fix solved my problem, and I hope it helps anyone else out there who is struggling to run this game. I'll post this to a Steam forum as well in hopes that anyone else having difficulties can get past this and on to playing!
