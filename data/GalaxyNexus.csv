I compiled this a while back, and I figure that it will be useful to some people here! It's a little U.S.-centric right now and maybe a bit out of date now, so if you have anything that you want me to add or change here, let me know.

**Buying/getting started**

Where to buy:

* US/UK: [Unlocked GSM ($350)](https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=galaxy_nexus_hspa)

this is happening over multiple networks (home, work, mobile), so it's not a problem with the connection, it's gotta be the phone.  i've been running bigxie's 4.2 build for the past week or so, with no issues until this one.

thoughts?  anyone running into the same problem?

1337621893.0,123,self.GalaxyNexus,txs87,"Guide: How to unlock the bootloader, root, install recovery, ROM, kernel, and radios on your Nexus!",driscoll42,173,50,106,http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/txs87/guide_how_to_unlock_the_bootloader_root_install/,"**NOTE:** This has only been tested on my VZW Galaxy Nexus. I cannot guarantee that all the steps will work perfectly on a different variation. For the ROMS and kernel at least I know you will need to get a different one. Check out the [XDA Forums](http://bit.ly/pTc8yL) for the ROM and kernel for you.

**1. Get the Galaxy Nexus ready**

Go to Settings-&gt;System-&gt;Developer Options and enable ""USB debugging"". [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/RVBGh.png)

**1a. Install the Android SDK** - (OPTIONAL - You don't need this, but it could be useful if you run into issues and need to debug)

Now install the Android SDK, which will let your computer communicate with your Nexus' internals. The download links can be found [here](http://bit.ly/3jNWwL). I installed all the Extras, Android 4.0 and 4.0.3, and the Tools. You certainly don't need all of those but I erred on the side of caution.

**2. Setup your computer**

Download [Galaxy Nexus Toolkit](http://bit.ly/uUfnGX) (v6.2 at time of writing) and once it installs open it and choose whichever phone you have (to check go to Settings-&gt;System-&gt;[About Phone](http://i.imgur.com/LIcxE.jpg) for your Android Version, you should know which carrier you're on).

Then choose ""1. Install/Uninstall Galaxy Nexus Drivers on your PC."" (by pressing 1 and enter). Pick your OS and wait for it to finish installing. [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/agY1J.png)

**3. Backup Phone**

You can probably skip this step if you just got your phone, but better to be safe than sorry. With your phone on and in ADB mode (that is the mode where you normally use the phone) plug it into your computer. Make sure the Toolkit recognizes your phone by going to the main menu and you should have under ADB Mode at the top see some kind of numbers/letters under it. If not choose ""26. Refresh Main Menu"". If you don't see it, your phone is probably off.

Now ""2. Backup and Restore your Phone"" Follow the on screen instructions in the toolkit and phone to fully backup your phone.

**4. Unlock Bootloader/Root/Custom Recovery**

Once your phone is fully backed up reboot it into Fastboot (You do this by holding down the volume up AND volume down and the power button while turning it on, [looks like this](http://i.imgur.com/VjaZv.jpg), if you just hold volume down and power you will boot into [Odin Mode](http://i.imgur.com/lzS7R.jpg). If you are in Odin mode just restart by the power button or taking out the battery, you can safely ignore the Downloading...). 

Check to make sure the Toolkit recognizes you are in Fastboot in the Main menu (refresh the menu, 26). Then enter in ""7. 1-CLICK FOR ALL"" and follow the on screen instructions. After that you should now have a stock phone with root and recovery. 

**4a. Recovery**

If you already rooted your phone like me reboot into Fastboot but choose ""5. Rename Recovery Restore Files"", follow on screen instructions, then ""6. Flash Custom Recovery [CWM Touch or TWRP Touch]"" and follow the on screen instructions.

You may want to stop after this step. At this point you have not made any radical changes to the phone, it's a pure ICS experience, just with root and recovery. From here on I will be going on deviating from stock. (Though you may want to flash 4.0.4 for a pure and updated ICS if you are still on 4.0.2)

**4b. ALTERNATE METHOD**

Instead of using the Toolkit you can instead use the Android SDK and ADB to unlock the bootloader, root, and install a custom recovery. To do so check out [this guide](http://bit.ly/MnoKLC)

**5. ROM and Kernel**

(Note: If you want to be EXTRA careful, download [AFV](http://bit.ly/LNlXJu) and check the MD5 sumcheck of every file. I never had an issue, but it's probably worth the five minutes to make sure you don't brick your phone. This applies to the kernel, ROM, Gapps, Radios, anything you're flashing)

**CAUTION** Make sure you get a ROM and kernel that are compatible. You either need a CDMA/LTE ""Toro"" or GSM/HSPA ""Maguro"" ROM. Just be sure to download the proper ROM/kernel.

Download the ROM and kernel of your choosing, I chose [AOKP M5](http://bit.ly/KnqG9m) and [Leankernel](http://bit.ly/LQtmpM). Place the .zip files (DO NOT EXTRACT) onto your phone, I put them in the Download folder just for the sake of convenience but anywhere on the sdcard should work.

Reboot into the Fastboot Mode and use the volume buttons to navigate to Recovery Mode and then use the power button to boot into Recovery. [TWRP looks like this](http://i.imgur.com/rN3Vb.jpg)

Now choose ""Wipe"". To be safe I do a Factory Reset and wipe the Dalvik Cache, Cache, and System. Once finished go to Install and find your ROM. Flash it. Then to be safe I booted into the ROM and made sure it worked. If so reboot into recovery and flash your kernel (wipe the Delvik Cache first).

You now have a custom ROM and Kernel!

Note: If it really doesn't seem to be working, do a hard reset by pulling out your battery and putting it back in. Only rarely will you need to do this but sometimes it's required.

**5a. Gapps**

When you put on a custom ROM you did wipe everything on there and due to legal reasons, Google apps can't be bundled with the ROMS. Thus you will have to [download the latest Gapps](http://goo.im/gapps/) (be sure to sort by Modification Time for the latest) and transfer it onto your phone in the same place as the ROM and kernel. Boot into recovery and just flash them onto the phone as you did the ROM.

Included apps: Google Play, Syncing, Phone, Voice Search, Setup, Search Bar, Gallery, Backip, One Time Initializer (mostly crucial behind the scenes apps)

Not Included: Gmail, Youtube, Maps, Navigation, Street View, Books, Movies, Earth, Goggles, Music, Drive, Reader, Voice, Chrome (You'll have to download these yourself from the Play Store)

**5b. Restore Apps**

Note: You'll probably need to reenable USB Debugging as in the first step again now that you've wiped the system.

If you backed up the phone in the Toolkit, plug in your phone (in ADB Mode) and choose ""2. Backup and Restore your phone"" then ""2. Restore a Backup to your Phone"" and follow the onscreen instructions.

**5c. Kernel Tweaks**

To make your life easier, I highly recommend you download and flash [LeanKernelTweaks](http://bit.ly/J4UKA6) if you're using LeanKernel or download [franco.Kernel Updater](http://bit.ly/w7CXO2) if you're using franco. These just make it easier to mess with your kernel.

**6. Radios**

Now my Verizon phone that never got updated radios even if the custom ROM did give it 4.0.4. Download the latest radios onto your phone in the same place you put your ROM/kernel ([VZW](http://bit.ly/Np30Ph) and [GSM](http://bit.ly/HoeVvf)). Then flash them as you did the ROM and kernel, no need to wipe anything.

To check what radios you have go to Settings-&gt;System-&gt;[About Phone](http://i.imgur.com/LIcxE.jpg) again and look at the ""Baseband version"". Compare what's there to what the versions are that you can download.

And just to wrap it all up, [this is what my final About phone looks like](http://i.imgur.com/wGyrk.png). You'll see that it's 4.0.4, updated radios, leanKernel, and AOKP M5.

**7. Bootscreen**

If you're like me, you just know that if your phone restarts at work or somewhere, the pink unicorn of AOKP is going to get you some undesired comments. It's fairly simple to put on a new boot screen. First off choose the one you desire ([here are some](http://bit.ly/JX2nt0) though I chose a [LCARS boot](http://bit.ly/LDqTnW) but I am designing my own at the moment) and download it onto your computer. The download [Empty_CWM_BootanimationZIP_Flashable.zip](http://bit.ly/KvHVyY) (taken from [this XDA thread](http://bit.ly/N3l8lf)). Don't extract that file, rather drag and drop your desired bootanimation.zip into the /data/local directory in the zip file. Delete the readmes and flash it onto the phone like you did the ROM/kernel.

---

**ALTERNATE METHODS**

I did not personally use this method but in the interest of presenting alternatives, you can use the SDK and ADB to do all this from a command line. The above is a more user friendly GUI way to accomplish the tasks but this will give you more power.

Repeat steps 1 and 2 as given.

[**3. Unlock Bootloader, Root, and install Recovery**](http://bit.ly/N3l8lf)

---

**Revert to Stock**

**CAUTION** This will wipe EVERYTHING, even what's on your SD card. Backup anything you want to save.

Sometimes you need to go back to stock, be it warranty, giving it away, selling, whatever. There are four things you must do, reinstall stock ROM, reflash stock recovery, unroot, and lock the bootloader. Download and flash [the stock ROM for your device](http://bit.ly/JvTq9k) (same as the ROM in step 5, wipe cache/delvik/factory reset). Then reboot into Fastboot and open up the Toolkit. With your phone attached choose ""10. ReFlash Stock Recovery"" and follow the on screen instructions. Once finished, in the main menu of the Toolkit choose ""11. ReLock your Bootloader"" and follow the on screen instructions. Once finished you now have a stock GNexus again!

---

Also for the CPU Governors (Settings-&gt;System-&gt;Performance), I was a bit confused by what they all did, so here's a general [Android CPU Governers](http://bit.ly/xY9ba9) and if you're curious [some more governors which aren't included and other kernel info](http://bit.ly/vidtgW). Be sure to set your Maximum CPU Frequency to 1350 MHz! (Note: to save your OC and chosen Governor you mus check ""Set on Boot""

Please give me any feedback, criticism, steps I may have skipped or other ideas to make this better. Or unneeded steps, pretty sure I don't need to wipe as much as I did, but I preferred to be safe.

A tutorial aimed at those who know next to nothing.,LAR0311,122,27,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/1192xd/how_to_root_your_galaxy_nexus_with_adb_a_tutorial/,"This tutorial is aimed at those who would like to manually root their Galaxy Nexus but are not familiar or are uncomfortable with ADB.  I am using Windows 7 so I am unsure of how it works on other operating systems.  Additionally, I am using a Verizon Galaxy Nexus, so a few things may be different for others (I will point out those parts).  Let's get started!

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**PRELIMINARY STEP 1**

**1.)** Plug your device into your computer with the USB cable

* If the USB drivers are already installed your device will pop up and you're ready for the next step

**PRELIMINARY STEP 2**

**1.)** With your device still connected to the computer via USB, go to Settings &gt; Developer Options &gt; select USB Debugging

* Wait for the appropriate drivers to install and you're ready to move to Part 1

**===EDIT: If your computer does not automatically install the drivers, follow these instructions===**

* Download the [**Samsung USB Driver**](http://downloadandroidrom.com/file/GalaxyNexus/rooting/Samsung_USB_Driver_for_Moblie_Phones_v1_4_6_0.exe)

* Install the Samsung USB Driver

* Turn on USB Debugging (Settings - Developer Options - USB Debugging)

* Connect your phone to the computer via USB

* The drivers should then install automatically (I just tested and confirmed this to work, if you have any problems please let them be known)

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**PART 1: Download and install the Android SDK**

* [**Android SDK**](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

* Once downloaded, install like you would anything else

* Be sure to record the destination folder, or choose where you would like it

   * Example: Mine is in [**c:\android\android-sdk**](http://i.imgur.com/M5pEl.jpg)

* Once installed, start SDK Manager (the checkbox will already be selected)

* Once the SDK opens, check the first three (3) boxes; they are labeled ""[**Tools**,"" ""**Android SDK Tools,**"" and ""**Android SDK Platform-tools**](http://i.imgur.com/sSYns.jpg)""

* Install these packages (they are the only ones necessary for rooting/unrooting)

* Once the packages have finished installing, you are done with the SDK.  Close it out

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**PART 2: Gathering the Required Files**

* [**Download JB-SuperSU.zip**](http://www.2shared.com/file/J5xZ8Y9U/JB-SuperSU.html)

* [**Download ClockworkMod Touch Recovery 6.0.1.0**](http://www.clockworkmod.com/rommanager)

   * Scroll down to your device (Google Galaxy Nexus) and your specific version (For example: Toro for the Verizon Galaxy Nexus).  **Be sure that you are choosing the Touch Recovery** (It's in the third column).

* Once both of these files are downloaded, place them in the Android SDK [**Platform-Tools**](http://i.imgur.com/IrelS.jpg) folder

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**PART 3: Unlock Your Phone**

**----THIS WIPES EVERYTHING ON YOUR PHONE----**

**----THIS WILL ALSO VOID YOUR WARRANTY, CONTINUE AT YOUR OWN RISK----**

* Turn on USB Debugging (Settings - Developer Options - USB Debugging)

* Connect your phone to the computer via USB

* Open a command prompt window (click ""Start button"" and type ""cmd"" in the search bar)

* Set the path to the platform-tools folder in the command prompt

   * For example: Mine is [**cd c:\android\android-sdk\platform-tools**](http://i.imgur.com/q38qN.jpg)

* **ALTERNATE (EASIER) METHOD FOR OPENING THE COMMAND PROMPT**

   * Open your platform-tools folder (C:\android\android-sdk\platform-tools)

   * Inside the folder, press and hold **Shift** and **Right-click**

   * A dialog box will popup, select [""**Open command window here**""](http://i.imgur.com/06UNU.jpg)

* Check the ADB connection status by typing [**adb devices**](http://i.imgur.com/dpZBo.jpg) into the command prompt and press enter

   * If a serial number is displayed, the connection is successful

* Type ""**[adb reboot bootloader](http://i.imgur.com/cN7Fo.jpg)**"" into the command prompt and press enter

   * This reboots the phone into ""fastboot"" (Big green Android guy with the green word ""Start"" at the top

* Type ""**[fastboot oem unlock](http://i.imgur.com/ey43n.jpg)**"" into the command prompt and press enter (If a FAILED message pops up like in the picture, just ignore it.  Everything works just fine)

   * You will then be prompted on your phone on whether or not to unlock the bootloader (it also mentions that it may void your warranty).

   * Click yes if you want to continue (**Volume Up/Down** to highlight and **Power** to select)

   * Once you’re back at the screen with the big green “Start,” unplug the USB cable and press the power button to reboot your phone

**Please note that it will take a while for your phone to reboot, it's normal**

**DO NOT CLOSE THE COMMAND PROMPT**

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**PART 4: Pushing the SuperSU File to Your Phone**

* Turn USB Debugging back on (Settings/Developer Options/USB Debugging)

* In the command prompt, type ""[**adb push jb-supersu.zip /sdcard/**](http://i.imgur.com/gfaiW.jpg)"" and press Enter

**ALTERNATIVE:**

* If you do not wish to use the ADB Push method, you can simply drag the JB-SuperSU.zip into the root of your SD Card like you would anything else.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**PART 5: Loading Custom Recovery (See warning at the bottom of step 5)**

* In the command prompt, type “**adb reboot bootloader**”

* Once the phone has booted to the bootloader screen, type ""[**fastboot flash recovery recovery-clockwork-touch-6.0.1.0-toro.img**](http://i.imgur.com/EpHZx.jpg)""

   * Everything after ""fastboot flash recovery"" depends on what recovery you downloaded.  This is the latest version of ClockworkMod Touch for the Verizon Galaxy Nexus.

* You now have custom recovery!

* Stay at the bootloader screen (Big Green ""Start"" at the top)

**WARNING**

Installing a custom recovery will prevent you from receiving OTA (over the air) updates (like us Verizon users know what those are, heh).  There is an alternative for those who wish to root but do not wish to load custom ROMs and still want to receive OTA updates

* Once you're at the the fastboot screen (big green ""Start"")  **DO NOT** do type the ""fastboot flash recovery recovery-clockword-touch-6.0.1.0-toro.img""

* In the command prompt, type ""**fastboot boot recovery-clockwork-touch-6.0.1.0-toro.img**""

* This will boot the custom recovery one time and allow you to install the JB-SuperSU.zip

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**PART 6: Flashing the SuperSU file**

* At the bootloader screen, press **volume up** twice and you will see ""**Recovery Mode**"" in red

* Press the power button to enter Recovery Mode

* Tap ""**install zip from sdcard**""

* Tap ""**choose zip from sdcard**""

* Tap ""**jb-supersu.zip**""

* Tap ""**Yes - Install jb-supersu.zip**""

*  Once it finishes installing, tap ""**+++++Go Back+++++**""

* Tap ""**reboot system now**""

   * **NOTE:** If you get a notice saying ""disable flash recovery,"" confirm it or your phone will overwrite the custom recovery on boot

* Your phone will reboot

* Once your phone is back on, open the app drawer and select [**SuperSU**](http://i.imgur.com/J8Z6d.png)

* Once the app opens, a dialog box will pop up saying ""[**The SU binary needs to be updated. Continue?**](http://i.imgur.com/CBHg0.png)""

* Press continue and it will say Installation Success once it's finished

**YOU ARE NOW ROOTED AND READY TO START FLASHING CUSTOM ROMS!**

](http://mycolorscreen.com/2012/04/08/dark-pie-ui-edits/)

[Light Version](http://mycolorscreen.com/2012/04/01/pie-ui/)

The instructions on how to do this are very vague, I had to play around with my settings and tweak things for a long time. If there is enough interest I will write up a step by step..

[Home screen](http://i.imgur.com/JHdWt.png)

[Lock Screen](http://i.imgur.com/AIwlJ.png)

One thing I have not changed yet and will is the ""9gag,"" I will probably end up removing it and just leaving ""Browse"" and ""search""

:)

EDIT: Starting out on the guide now, I will make it as detailed as possible as I hate seeing something and following directions only to figure out they are confusing as shit.


Edit:2 Uploading everything now!

Here is the guide!

http://i.imgur.com/W0h6D.jpg

Here are all of the files needed.

http://180upload.com/j4t3d2dw3jhw/break1ngbadPIEUIinstallguide.zip.html

Click ""Go to the video or file for free"" and download.. enjoy everyone!

I will be taking a break now as I have just spend almost 4 hours putting this together. Sorry for any spelling mistakes.

I will check periodically to answer any of your questions and I will also be at work from 11PM until 5 AM, If you questions have no been answered by anyone else I will answer them tomorrow.

And for those wondering the ""pie chart"" on the wallpaper just compliments the buttons on the bottom and is not actually clickable to my understanding. I have not figured a way to place icons correctly around the circle to do it.

One more thing, check to make sure in Widget Locker it is set to ""fade in"" for a better lock screen effect. 

Good luck!

EDIT 3 : if the icon for the weather UCCW is not showing up please let me know, I thought the icons come preinstalled with the app but if not I can upload them for everyone. So far one person didn't hae the icon set.

EDIT 4:

Just in case here is my whol UCCW folder icons and widget backups included for both weather and clock

http://180upload.com/ms89py5a89de/UltimateCustomClockWidget.zip.html

EDIT 5: Please use the new Minimilastic Text clock backup as it fixes the minutes showing up as ""10:5"" to ""10:05""

I had uploaded the old one and forgot to update it, sorry! here is the link.

http://180upload.com/4oyiojxn2bkk/New_mintext.zip.html,

Known ""bugs?"" - The UCCW widgets sometimes turn into a [blue block](http://i.imgur.com/nDpc6.png) with UCCW, and the way to fix it is to go back into the app drawer and open up the UCCW app and back out. No idea why that happens and I have emailed the developer to see if there is a possible fix coming.

Also, when pressing the icon to bring down the notification bar the UCCW widgets will shift due to the bar taking up a few pixels on the top screen, and everything was made to be in place without the bar on, but they should move back up to regular place when you back out of the notification bar.

1. Samsung Accessory Support cannot confirm or deny whether or not the docks for the GSM Galaxy Nexus will work with the VZW Galaxy Nexus.

2. They have not heard many direct requests for these types of docks from VZW Galaxy Nexus owners.

3. Samsung often will not produce certain accessories for a phone unless it believes that there is a demand to be met.


Apparently, we need to be more vocal if we actually want these.  **Would any of you be willing to contact Samsung and request these accessories, either for yourself or your fellow Nexus owners?**

Send them an email: [https://contactus.samsung.com/customer/contactus/formmail/mail/MailQuestionProduct.jsp?SITE_ID=1](https://contactus.samsung.com/customer/contactus/formmail/mail/MailQuestionProduct.jsp?SITE_ID=1)

-or-

Call their Accessory department: (800) 757-0280

**Talking Points**

* Will a Desktop Stand and/or Vehicle Navigation Mount that supports 3-pin charging ever be released for the Galaxy Nexus i515?

* Accessories similar to these are already available for preorder for the Galaxy Nexus i9250

* The Vehicle Navigation Mount displayed on the Samsung and Verizon websites are nothing but glorified phone holders and do nothing to power the device.

* The docks currently being offered for the i515 force the over-usage of the USB port, which can lead to equipment damage

* Why exactly aren't the docks for the i9250 compatible with the i515?

* Why are the contacts even on the side of the phone if nothing will ever be compatible with them?

Do your best, r/GalaxyNexus.  Of course: be firm, but be polite.


Thank You

Don't get me wrong, I love my Galaxy Nexus - got it on day one after all the rumors with the piano teacher and all that. I'm **finally** stoked for a Nexus device to lead the Android pack. If you've seen [The Verge video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66-4uMQqerA), you'll notice that Duarte talks about how a lot of manufacturers wanted to be Google's choice to make the next Nexus phone and LG stood out from the rest because of the amount of tech they brought in (and they managed to keep the prices down). I think at some level, Samsung is only interested in keeping the Nexus profile as low as possible to help them sell more of their own flagship S3s. Even in my country, they did not advertise the GNex at all :(

Verizon does not block applications. Google Wallet is different from other widely-available m-commerce services. Google Wallet does not simply access the operating system and basic hardware of our phones like thousands of other applications. Instead, in order to work as architectured by Google, Google Wallet needs to be integrated into a new, secure, and proprietary hardware element in our phones.  We are continuing our commercial discussions with Google on this issue.

That really doesn't make any sense to me.

Previously, opening in a specific app would require one tap, while setting default would require two. Now in Jelly Bean, you must select an app and choose ""Set Default"" or ""Just Once,"" requiring two taps for either option. I know it isn't a major headache, but after opening a couple multi-app links (twitter, facebook, reddit, etc) it gets annoying. Am I the only one who feels this way?

Find out more about this package, and everything else you could want to know about the GApps on RootzWiki: http://wiki.rootzwiki.com/Google_Apps

Changelog: 

    * **Not compatible with 4.1.x.**
    * Installs Photosphere and Picasa sync on Mako (Nexus 4), Manta (Nexus 10), and Tuna (Galaxy Nexus, all variants).
        * Does not include Grouper (Nexus 7) because it does not have a rear camera.
        * The GalleryGoogle.apk's for each are different, thus why there is one APK for each.
        * Overrides custom ROM camera features on all three due to replacing the AOSP camera/gallery APK.
    * ThinkFree and Microbes live wallpaper removed to save space.
    * All APKs updated to 4.2.0 versions, where applicable.
    * Still allows sync between AOSP calendar and Google Calendar.
    * Does not include non-NEON libraries, as there have not been any non-NEON devices (Tegra and Tegra 2 devices such as the Motorola XOOM) which have received 4.2, and the 4.1 libraries are not compatible with 4.2.
    * /system/etc/g.prop updated:
        * Users on 4.1 will **not** receive GooManager update notifications to 4.2.
        * Users on any past or third-party GApps packages and 4.2.x will '''not''' be recommended the proper package in GooManager when tapping on ""Download gapps packages"" then selecting to ""Download latest google apps"".
        * GooManager recognizes 20121130 (and future 4.2.x packages) as a new platform (''jb42'' instead of ''jb'')

[GooManager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.s0up.goomanager) ~~users should receive an update notification within 12 hours (by default) or by opening the app and selecting ""Check for updates"". If you want to turn the notification off, you can do so in the app's settings.~~

EDIT: After talking it over, we're going to be reuploading this pack with a minor tweak: The Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 4 will be using the Google Gallery/Camera APK that has the working Picasa sync and Photosphere. Other devices are unfortunately SOL, as Google's APK checks the device, and hacking the APK to work on all devices is very much illegal for us to edit and distribute. Sorry!

EDIT2 (Noon PST 11/28): I'm uploading the new build now. It's got the fixes to install Picasa Sync and Photosphere on Galaxy Nexus (all variants) and Nexus 4. The separate Picasa Sync and Photosphere package for non-Nexus devices is also uploading. I'll have them up tonight at the latest!

EDIT3 (17:00 PST 11/28): We've pulled down the current pack because too many people on 4.1 are flashing it and getting bootloops, errors, etc.. I'm working with s0up, the awesome lead dev of GooManager, to see if we can have it not notify for those on 4.1. We're also hoping to fix the package to have proper libs for non-NEON devices like the XOOM. I personally apologize for the CF this release has been. We thought that we'd found all the bugs, but it looks like we overlooked a few.

EDIT4 (11/30): The new package has been uploaded. The changelog has been updated. There won't be update notifications in GooManager for those on old/third-party packs, since it's a new platform for 4.2.",,False,,t5_2sypj,1354474841.0,,,True,t3_13xuwc,http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/13xuwc/gapps_20121128_for_android_421_now_available/,

* One of the best and most tweak-able kernels, Franco kernel.
* Light Flow

    * [Premium license](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.rommanager.license)

Now, download the following:

* [Bootloader](http://wonderly.com/bb/TORO/OEM/PRIMELC03.zip)
* [Radios (Only if you don't already have Baseband I515.09 V.FC04 / I515.FC05 when you check in Settings --&gt; About phone --&gt; Baseband version)](http://wonderly.com/bb/TORO/OEM/I515.FC05_I515.FC04.zip)
* [Bugless Beast ROM](http://wonderly.com/bb/TORO/ROM/JELLYBEAN/pete_toro_ota_2012-07-24.zip)
* [Or, to get the newest nightly build](http://download.peteralfonso.com/toro/rom).  The newest builds will be at the bottom of the entire page.
* [Adobe Flash](http://www.mediafire.com/?lqxd6qnr63kj2t1) or [Adobe Flash](http://d-h.st/o1I), either will work, just mirror links.
* [Stock Browser](http://d-h.st/R6g), from ICS.  I'm nostalgic and like the old browser better than Chrome at the moment, plus it works with flash.

Next, boot into recovery and:

* Do a nandroid backup
* Factory reset
* Wipe cache partition
* Advanced --&gt; Wipe dalvik cache
* Install from zip (All of the following in the same order):
    * Choose PRIMELC03.zip
    * Choose I515.FC05_I515.FC04.zip (If you need to)
    * Choose pete_toro_ota_2012-07-24.zip or if you have a newer one, choose that.
* Wipe cache partition (Yes, again)
* Wipe dalvik cache (Yes, again)
* Reboot
* Now wait...  This could take 20 minutes or longer, but it will boot.  Jelly Bean doesn't boot as fast as ICS did, but I don't really reboot very often.

When you're up: 

* Set up your Google account
* Launch Google Play and install [ES File Explorer File Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop&amp;hl=en)
* Launch ES File Explorer.
* Go into settings and make sure the option to mount system partition as writable is checked
* Tap on and install the Adobe flash apk
* Copy the BrowserGoogle.apk file
    * Paste it into /system/app/
    * Now tap and hold the BrowserGoogle.apk file and go to permissions.
    * Set permissions on BrowserGoogle.apk to:
        * User: Read, Write
        * Group: Read
        * Other: Read
    * Click OK
* Reboot

If you want Franco Kernel (Allows over and under clocking, over and under volting and governor settings for CPU and GPU, color, gamma, and contrast tweaking, sound volume tweaking, USB fast charge, etc.):

* Install [franco.Kernel updater](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.franco.kernel)
* Download the newest nightly and choose 384 version.  (You can run the 512 version, but your phone will run hot if it even boots properly)
* Reboot into ClockworkRecovery
* Install from zip and choose franco.Kernel-rXXX.zip (replace XXX with whatever version you actually have)
* Then wipe cache partition and dalvik cache once more
* Reboot
* Use the Franco Kernel Updater app to configure your kernel.
    * I only recommend changing the following settings, but it's your phone, do what you wish.  JUST BE CAREFUL!:
        * Max cpu: 1420 MHz
        * Scaling governor: wheatley
        * Maximum frequency for screen off: 384 Mhz
        * Trinity's Contrast Interface: 0

To get notification screen toggles that you may have had in previous custom ICS ROMs, I recommend this appropriately named app: 

* [Notification Toggle](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.j4velin.notificationToggle)

Also, LightFlow works great too:

* [License](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rageconsulting.android.lightflow)
* [Lite app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rageconsulting.android.lightflowlite)

Now all that's left is to finish installing all your apps from Google Play, restore your SMS and call logs, and set your beast up.

-------------------------

**EDIT:** If you need to use My Verizon Mobile app and are having issues logging in: 

* Download [VerizonLogonClient.apk](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/25218780/VerizonLogonClient.apk)
* Install it.
* Now fire up My Verizon Mobile and log in.
    * Note: I've had issues trying to log in to My Verizon Mobile the first time if I'm on Wi-Fi.  The solution was to turn off Wi-Fi and log in the first time over 3G/4G.  After that, logging in via Wi-Fi worked just fine.

1335383303.0,67,self.GalaxyNexus,ss9la,Dirty Flashing: What it is and is not. Let's set the record straight.,Thracks,85,18,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/ss9la/dirty_flashing_what_it_is_and_is_not_lets_set_the/,"I've seen considerable confusion popping up lately regarding whether or not you should wipe between builds of AOKP, CM9, or any other ROM.

The reality is that you probably *don't* have to wipe between builds, even if it's advised. Before we explain why ROM devs recommend it, we should establish some background, first.

A ""dirty flash"" refers to the process of flashing a new version of your ROM over the top of the one you have, ***without using the ""Wipe Data/Factory Reset"" option in recovery.*** Even if you intend to dirty flash the update, you should **always wipe cache and dalvik cache.**

1. Wipe Data/Factory Reset: This option erases all data on the device. Every application, and all data generated by those applications, will be erased. If you do not wipe data, all the data files generated by *every* app on the system will persist through an upgrade. This includes the data files generated by core system apps, like the phone dialer, the Android UI, its option menus and core features. Remember, *everything* you do on Android is an application that generates data! **NOTE:** The storage you see when you connect to USB will not be erased. 

2. Wipe Cache: Every application on the system, even those that run things like your UI and the options menus, generates cache files. These cache files are more or less unique to the current installation of Android you are using, and are generated dynamically. These cache files help Android load and run faster. When changing ROMs or updating to a new version of a ROM, you should *always* wipe the cache partition, or you're gonna have a bad time: Force closes, boot loops and sluggish performance are just some of the perils that await you.

3. Wipe Dalvik Cache: Android executes programs inside of software system called the ""Dalvik Virtual Machine."" The DVM interprets and runs APK files for Android. Dalvik maintains its own cache to again improve performance for your device by offering faster app loading and execution. The Dalvik Cache is again unique to the current installation you are running, and it should always be wiped whether you're installing a new ROM or simply updating versions.

Now that you know what these options do, let's discuss why ROM developers often tell people to perform a full wipe: erasing data, cache and dalvik.

1. Users often don't pay attention to specific installation instructions. Making sure no prior OS is loaded is the easiest way to ensure that a dev's ROM is installed correctly. 

2. Users have significantly altered core UI frameworks with mods, e.g. a custom theme, new graphics in the window shade, or new information in the status bar. When these mods are installed, the data these essential frameworks generate no longer match the structure the stock frameworks you're flashing are expecting. The result is FCs, reboot loops and sundry other issues. The easiest solution for ROM devs is to tell people to wipe.

3. Far more rarely than the above two scenarios, a full wipe is *actually* required, because the dev has made substantial changes to core system frameworks. These new framework APKs are incompatible with the internal structures of the data files generated by the ROM version you are attempting to upgrade from.

4. The user has backed up all sorts of system APKs with Titanium Backup, and foolishly restores them after flashing the new ROM. Even if the data from the old APK is compatible with the new system APK, it does *not* mean that the hodgepodge of differently-versioned APKs are compatible with one another! If it isn't colored green or white in Titanium Backup, you probably shouldn't be backing it up!

Before I get to the conclusion, I want to impart one more piece of advice: you should always use Titanium Backup to back up the apps that are colored green and white. These are the apps+data YOU have installed, and the persistent system data like WiFi hotspots, Bluetooth pairings, contacts and other harmless-but-important data. Then, once in recovery, you should **always make a Nandroid backup** just in case something goes to shit. You never know, something might. You won't know if you *really* needed to wipe without trying.

So, here's the deal:

For starters: never use the ROM Manager application to do ROM stuff. It's unreliable. Reboot to recovery and work from that interface.

Now, let's say you're on AOKP build 34, and build 35 comes out tomorrow. If you've never installed a UI mod of any kind, and diligently wipe cache+dalvik cache before flashing build 35, it's likely going to work just fine. Remember to also flash GAPPS and your custom kernel, if you were using one.

Yours truly has done an in-place upgrade (""dirty flash"") of every AOKP version since build 28. That's right: from 28 to M4, through the 4.0.3 to 4.0.4 upgrade, and everything in between, my SGN continues to run like a champ.

**The TL;DR Version:**

* Never flash from the ROM Manager application. You should always reboot into recovery, and use the recovery UI to do any of the work described in this guide.

* A full wipe erases the entire phone. All data, except for what you see when connecting your phone to your PC, will be erased. It is achieved by using the ""wipe data/factory reset"" option in recovery, in addition to erasing the cache and dalvik cache.

* A dirty flash is installing a new version of a ROM without selecting the ""Wipe data/factory reset"" option in recovery.

* You probably don't have to do a full wipe, even if the ROM dev tells you to. A dirty flash is usually fine.

* If you've installed any sort of UI mod (e.g. custom theme), you will have to do a full wipe. You absolutely cannot get away with a dirty flash.

* If you are switching ROMs, e.g. AOKP to CM9, you will have to perform a full wipe.

* You should always use Titanium Backup to back up the apps that are colored green and white before rebooting to flash.

* You should always make a backup in recovery before flashing. You never know.

* You should always erase the cache, and the Dalvik cache, before flashing.

* You should always re-flash GAPPS and your kernel after flashing your ROM upgrade.

* If you experience issues after dirty flashing, then and only then should you reboot to recovery and wipe data+cache+dalvik. You will have to reflash the ROM+kernel+GAPPS when you do this. Once booted, you can restore your user data with Titanium Backup and reconfigure your settings to get back on your feet in 20 minutes.

Thank you for reading.

//EDIT: Added clarity on what a ""full wipe"" is, and added guidance on flashing from recovery vs. ROM Manager.

It would have come earlier but Pie delayed the release a bit. So here we are, this is our first release candidate. We used the time to fix some minor bugs that were still left and added a couple of features.

&gt;Pie panels are centered and glide right under your thumb, don't stretch in landscape

&gt;New pie default colors (holo) for disabled per-app-color

&gt;Screenshot option

&gt;New statusbar icons (dont look ""washed out"" anymore)

&gt;New bootanimation

&gt;Unlockpattern cut off is gone

&gt;IME is themable

&gt;MMS black on black fix

&gt;Pie without search agent should be fixed

&gt;PAPrefs has been polished for easier use (still much to do)

&gt;PAC support for bluetooth icon

&gt;(Mako) Perfect kernel calibration, made one extra for pa

&gt;(Mako) Autobrightness is adjusted for it

&gt;(Mako) Fart vibration for on-touch is gone

&gt;Tons of optimizations under the hood


We are sorry, battery % couldn't make it into the mix for now. Expect it in the next revision.

We will concentrate now on getting up Gerrit and a bugtracker. When that's done PA will go into another phase, it will hopefully become a community project just like CM or AOKP. This will allow requested features to find its way in way quicker than before.

Maguro and Mako are out. The others follow soon. we are certain that you'll also see ports to legacy devices soon on XDA.

But the weird part is that I haven't heard as much complaining about these issues as I would expect. Do very few people have the Verizon version? Did they just go through many replacements until they got a working phone? 

**So if you have a Verizon Galaxy Nexus that works adequately:**

*1. Is this your first one? If not, how many replacements did you go through to get your working one? (I've read of people going through as much as 7)*

*2. Does the area where you live have great 4G coverage?*

*3. What version/ROM of Android are you running?*

*4. What are your radios?*

Finally, what other recourse do we have? I remember snippets from other threads about calling the bad reception a breach of contract and threatening to terminate or file an FCC complaint but I forget which.

Edit: Thanks for the responses! It's really lessened my worries. My exchange phone should be coming in today so we'll see how it works out.

This alleviated the problems a bit, but it was still poor and painful to use sometimes.

It describes how a Galaxy Nexus user stumbled upon a way to enable WiFi tether on his VZW GN without root by simply using the [Switch Pro Widget](https://market.android.com/details?id=alei.switchpro&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImFsZWkuc3dpdGNocHJvIl0.) WiFi Hotspot switch.  Then I realized that I already had that widget so I gave it a try.

Normally, when you go into your phone's settings and try to enable Portable WiFi hotspot your phone does a subscription check with VZW.  If you are paying for the service, it allows the box to be checked and your WiFi tether is activated.  If you don't, you are offered the chance to add the overpriced service to enable WiFi tether.

Something magic happens when you tap on the Switch Pro Widget WiFi Hotspot switch.  It activates the service.  When you tap to configure it, you are taken to the settings screen where you see the checkbox already checked.  It bypassed the subscription check and activated the service.  I confirmed that I do not have the subscription on my account (24 hrs later).  Now, my phone is rooted, but still running stock 4.0.2.  My buddy's GN is not rooted and it still worked for him as well.

Any way, this wasn't anything I personally discovered, but I wanted to share with fellow VZW GN owners.  Please don't do anything like cancelling your home Internet now that you have 4G speeds on a hotspot though.  That will surely get you noticed and cause you to get billed for the usage.

_____________________________________________________________

Ok, before we begin, if you do not have 7zip, [download and install it now!](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html)

___________________________________________________________

**PART 1**

* Download the Android Factory Image for your specific device (4.1.1)

* [**Factory images**](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images)

* Locate the downloaded file

* Example: For Verizon it will be called ""**mysid-jro03o-factory-f17426.tgz**""

* Right click the file, select 7-Zip, then select [**Open Archive**](http://i.imgur.com/sxBuJ.jpg)

* Double click on the [**.tar**](http://i.imgur.com/RvHpu.jpg) file in the 7-Zip window

* This will unzip the file

* Drag the [**unzipped folder to your desktop**](http://i.imgur.com/Uae5y.jpg)

* Open the folder and you will see some files (7 based on the Verizon/Toro version)

* Open your Android SDK/Platform-Tools folder

* Select all of the files inside of the factory image folder on your desktop and drag them into the [**Platform-Tools folder**](http://i.imgur.com/qNiCs.jpg)

**Everything is now set up and you are ready to begin unrooting/relocking your phone!**

________________________________________________________________

**PART 2**

Before we begin with unrooting, I suggest making a text file with all of the proper commands. What you do is copy the commands from the text file and paste them into command prompt by right clicking and selecting paste (Ctrl+V won't work). This is not necessary but it speeds the process up for me. [**Here is my example.**](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/38069307/UnrootGNex-JRO03O.txt)

**===WARNING===**

**All of these commands are based on the Verizon/Toro version. The file names will depend on your version. The bootloader, the radios, and the image file will be different.**

* Turn on USB Debugging on your phone (Settings - Developer Options - USB Debugging)

* Open the Android SDK/Platform-Tools folder

* Press and hold **Shift** and **Right click**

* Select “Open command window here”

* In the command prompt, type “**adb reboot bootloader**”

* Once your phone reboots, type “[**fastboot flash bootloader bootloader-toro-primelc03.img**](http://i.imgur.com/N6vv4.jpg)”

* Type ""[**fastboot reboot-bootloader**](http://i.imgur.com/uBl4U.jpg)""

* Once your phone has rebooted, type “[**fastboot flash radio radio-toro-i515.fg02.img**](http://i.imgur.com/h9mKz.jpg)”

* Type ""**fastboot reboot-bootloader**""

* Once your phone has rebooted, type “[**fastboot flash radio-cdma radio-cdma-toro-i515.ff02.img**](http://i.imgur.com/tL7Ud.jpg)”

* This step will take a little bit. It's normal; be patient.

* Type ""**fastboot reboot-bootloader**""

* Type “[**fastboot -w update image-mysid-jro03o.zip**](http://i.imgur.com/kSzbw.jpg)”

* This step will take the longest and many things will pop up in the command prompt

* Your phone will reboot when this process is finished. Unplug your phone when it restarts and wait for it to boot up

* Once your phone restarts and goes through the setup screens, turn on USB Debugging again (Settings – Developer Options – USB Debugging)

* Connect your phone. In the command prompt, type ""**adb reboot bootloader**""

* Once your phone boots into the bootloader, type ""**fastboot oem lock**""

**Your phone is now unrooted and locked and back to it's factory state!** These steps can restore your phone if it won't boot up or a number of other issues.

For reference, I'm running Paranoid Android 3.50 (May 5th, 2013 release) with Franco Kernel nightly r378 (~May 13th release).  My GNexus is the Verizon 32GB variant, and my phone has 6407MB free.  It may have hovered as low as ~4000MB free at one point or another.

In order to test SD card write speeds, I used [AndroBench](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andromeda.androbench2).  For method, I did a reboot, waited 5+ minutes, then ran AndroBench.  After another few minutes, I ran it again.  [Here are the screenshots of the ""before Lagfix"" benchmarks.](http://imgur.com/a/HbA4I)

I then ran Lagfix, rebooted, waited a few minutes, AndroBench again, waited some more, and ran it again.  [Here are the ""after Lagfix"" benchmarks.](http://imgur.com/a/Fe18B)

After each of the reboots, my phone was completely idle and in the same room, so no user apps/change in signal should have impacted the test.  Important numbers are:  

Before Lagfix

* Sequential Write - 6.95MB/s - 9.48MB/s 
* Random Write - 0.15MB/s - 0.19MB/s

After Lagfix

* Sequential Write - 7.04MB/s - 7.22MB/s 
* Random Write - 0.16MB/s - 0.19MB/s

The phone feels just as laggy under certain circumstances, and I see no improvement in numbers.  Notice that the before numbers varied greatly despite there being no particular reason.  The screenshots I saw on the XDA thread might have only tested once before and once after, which could lead you to believe it either made an improvement or screwed things up.  Maybe there's a better app for benchmarking this sort of thing, but my phone is no longer a good test of it since I've already run Lagfix.

As a lot of you have done I installed the Modaco's google wallet apk, found [HERE](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1365360).

Wallet worked fine and i use it to make purchases anytime a shop has paypass.  

Naturally I wanted the new version.  So I did the trick where you go to [wallet.google.com](http://wallet.google.com) and you click **sign up** (even if you already have wallet set up).  If you scroll the the bottom there is a dowload link.  Touch that and launch it with Play Store.  It should bring the wallet app's play store page up and have an update option.  

I pressed update and it downloaded the new version.  Then launch wallet and accept the next update prompt.  It takes a minute or two so be patient.  Then hit agree, and voila! Brand new wallet version.

It even sees my existing credit card that was stored in wallet (not the app) that i use in the play store.  Haven't made any purchases, as I just did it this second (and I'm at work).

First off, I am in NO WAY affiliated with ANY company related to NFC, Credit Cards, Google, etc.  I am not being paid for this, this is purely so that other people who don't know about googlewallet can try it out. So, without further ado...


ATTN: I HAVE BEEN TOLD THE $10 PROMOTION ONLY WORKS IN THE UNITED STATES.

about Google Wallet: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsaJMhcLm_A

Last night, after being reluctant to try Gwallet, I gave it a shot and everything worked GREAT!  Within 15 minutes of opening wallet for the first time, I had already bought a soda at 7/11.  Paying with my phone completely blew the mind of the cashier.  So here's the tutorial.



PREFACE:  If you are using any GSM version of the Galaxy Nexus, skip to step 2.  If you are using a Verizon Gnex, then start from the beginning.

1. For whatever reason, verizon did not include google wallet on the Gnex.  If you are using a custom rom, odds are you already have wallet installed.  If not, download the following apk and install it.  At first, I believed that root access was required, but people have told me this is not the case.

http://www.mediafire.com/?k6hwy353z2i2fe8

2. If you are using the maguro version of the Gnex, Gwallet should come pre-installed.  If not, download from the app store.  No root or custom rom is required, however, I will be continuing this guide assuming the phone is rooted.  Don't worry, this doesn't change anything.  EDIT:  Someone told me that some GSM versions do not support google wallet and are unable to download through the playstore.  If this describes your phone, use the mediafire download link above.  EDIT:  Sadly, this doesn't work everywhere in the world.  Dutch user FeikoW, reported the following when opening the wallet app.  http://imgur.com/Ff97D.  Still, the entire process takes less than 15 minutes, so don't give up before trying.

3. Firstly, start up the Gwallet app. It will prompt you to create a pin number, so do it.  Now the app has some things to set up, so let it do its thing.  During this process, An attention (!) sign will appear in your notification bar, it's google wallet asking for account permissions.  Accept.  When I did this part, after accepting the permissions, Gwallet froze, so I had to force stop from the settings-&gt;app menu and then re-launch Gwallet.  Once it's done, and after hitting a few 'accept' buttons, you should be greeted with [this](http://i.imgur.com/xwLdq.png) screen.

4. You may notice a yellow banner that says unsupported device.  Don't worry about that.  Everything will work just fine.  It is merely a word of caution about using wallet while rooted.  I will explain at the end.

5. Now here's where it all comes together.  Swipe to the left to uncover 'add google prepaid card'.  tap it and wait ~3 minutes.  Don't force stop, just wait it out.  There is a lot going on in the background.

6. You should now see ""$10.00 remaining"" listed under the google prepaid card you just activated!  You can easily add more cash by tapping the card and selecting 'add funds'.

YOU NOW HAVE GOOGLE WALLET FULLY SET UP AND READY TO GO!  Wasn't that easy?  Didn't even have to enter any personal information.  Now, in order to buy something with your phone, a store needs to have an NFC credit card reader like [THIS](http://dondodge.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341bf9da53ef015432ad9783970c-320wi).  Bring something to the register, and when you are ready to pay, simply tap the NFC reader with your galaxy nexus (the part with the green light), this will open the Google Wallet app.  It will prompt you for your pin.  Enter it and tap the NFC reader again to compete payment.  Now look at the face of the cashier as you just paid for something with a telephone.

MSG FOR ROOTED GWALLET USERS:  The reason google displays 'unsupported device' when using a rooted Gnex is because of the security issues associated with root.  When you give an app root access, that app has access to your entire phone and therefore your card/pin numbers.  Just be careful and don't install any suspicious third party apps that require root.

Thanks for reading and hopefully some people will see and use this to their advantage.  Feel free to reply with any questions you may have.  I'm no Gwallet expert, but I will try and help out.

So after writing my [Guide on how to root and install a custom ROM](http://redd.it/txs87) and realized just how easy it really is I was curious as to which ROM ACTUALLY performed best. With that in mind I grabbed every benchmarking tool I could find off of the App Store and installed them. I wiped my phone and systematically installed Stock, AOKP, CM9, Slim ICS, and LiquidSmooth.

I was in the hot tub, waist deep. It was hella cold, so I was rushing to push the lid off onto the ground so it would be completely open. Then I though ""Aw fuck, I left my phone inside""......""Wait no I didn't it's in my pocket FUUUUUCCCCCK""

Rushed out of the hot tub. Popped the battery out and threw it in a bag of rice. I waited 16 hours before opening that bag again. Don't open that bag during this process. 

After this I decided to try out the phone at work before lunch break. Threw the battery in. The screen is a wonky colour, it struggled to boot up, and the touch screen did not work at all. Failure.

Out goes the battery. On my lunch break I used tools at a local scuba diving store where I  work on the side to open the phone up (we have watch tools and an airgun). First, all of the screws in the battery compartment came out. Then simply pressure and maybe using a tool to pry out of the bezel popped the whole bugger out. There's tutorials online to do this. There doesn't seem to be much risk.

**Status after rice for 16ish hours?** Now that I could see the internals...

1) Water droplets inside still. 16 hours is not long enough to dry. I airgunned that out.

2) Connections in there are especially still wet. BAD BAD BAD. I popped off connectors, airgunned them out.

3) It still doesn't work properly with the touchscreen. 

I left it in pieces like this, grabbed desiccant packs, threw it in a ziplock bag and didn't open the bag for another 24 hours.

During this time I researched. Turns out the reason the touch screen probably doesn't work is because any bit of water will make it constantly think it's being touched. Which means none of your presses will register.

**Lesson here is it NEEDS FUCKING TIIIIIME to dry out.** You can accelerate this process by opening it up but that doesn't seem necessary. Borrow a friends phone or some shit for the time being. Let it dry for a goddamn week if you really want to be safe. It took me a day, and it still wasn't dry + an airgun and the touch screen still wasn't dry. **Two days later I'm STARTING to see functionality and it's been in a ziploc bag with heavy duty brand new desiccant packs after being dried with an airgun and I have not opened the bag at all during this time.** I think you need a lot of time to really get the phone back to completely dry. 

The touch screen is still sketchy but I bet that'll continue get better with a little time, and I haven't got a SIM card back in it yet to test the remaining functionality but after taking it apart it's quite clear that replacing bits like the microphone, camera, speaker are very easy. I'm not really worried too much anymore.

I'll update this post again to report whether I get full functionality or not. I'm also going to take pictures of where I found the water remained. I'm going to try to restore full functionality and if I need to replace parts I'll document that too.

And when someone else posts about what to do, or searches about water, wet, galaxy nexus, and repair maybe they'll get this post. 

Edit: 

Both cameras and the power button are trivial to detach. The power button was being nearly non-functional on me, so I got so far as to pop the mobo right out (leaving the vibrator thingy intact)

1349456286.0,31,self.GalaxyNexus,1100d4,Flashing new ROMs while using Device Encryption,sequentious,45,14,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/1100d4/flashing_new_roms_while_using_device_encryption/,"This might not be of interest to most folks, but I've recently discovered that encryption &amp; custom roms are significantly easier to manage than I had previously thought. Nothing here is of particularly secret or arcane knowledge, but I was sufficiently surprised to see how easy it is that I thought I'd pass the word on.

I'm a somewhat security concerned person. I'd prefer to have my phone encrypted. However, I didn't get the Galaxy Nexus just to leave it with the stock ROM. Unfortunately, those two desires were somewhat at odds, as CWM couldn't flash a new ROM since the internal storage was encrypted and thus you couldn't get the .zip. I'm somewhat familiar with dm-crypt, after having used it on my laptop for years. But unfortunately, CWM just doesn't include the proper support.

Previously, there were workarounds using [adb to stick the ROM on the cache partition while in recovery](http://0xfeedface.org/blog/lattera/2012-06-04/installing-cm9-encrypted-android-tablet), but it seems like a lot of work. It might be worthwhile if you run a 'stable' rom without frequent updates.

Another option may be to use a USB-OTG dongle with a small USB drive. Still, a bit of a hassle if you run nightly builds. I never tested this.

However, there is another recovery option available: [TWRP2](http://teamw.in/project/twrp2). I had previously tried it out, but dismissed it as it didn't offer anything significantly better than CWM. But it seems that in the last two updates, they've added the necessary bits to decrypt your data partition. An added bonus is that it is [open source](https://github.com/TeamWin/Team-Win-Recovery-Project).

So, I backed up (then backed up my backup), and enabled the device encryption though the android settings. An hour or so later, my phone rebooted and asked for my decryption PIN. Great! Paired with something like Cerberus, it will allow me to remotely reboot my phone rather than wipe it if I think I'll get the device back, while staying fairly confident that my data is safe.

Additionally, there is a limitation of standard android device encryption in that the PIN to decrypt the device is the same pin you enter 1000 times per day to unlock the device, which means it probably isn't complex (and probably not a password). [Nikolay Elenkov](http://nelenkov.blogspot.ca/2012/08/changing-androids-disk-encryption.html) explains the issue pretty well, and has written a [utility to change the encryption passphrase](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nick.cryptfs.passwdmanager), so you can have a stronger password to decrypt the device on boot than you need to unlock it once booted.

In a nutshell:

0. Backup
1. Install the current TWRP2 recovery (if you use goo-manager, apparently it can do it for you)
2. Set a lock PIN
3. Enable encryption
4. Wait
5. Use ""Cryptfs passwd"" to change your encryption PIN to a better password

1367100171.0,31,self.GalaxyNexus,1d8lhp,About the dalvik.vm.heap stuff to fix lag,ickboblikescheese,40,9,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/1d8lhp/about_the_dalvikvmheap_stuff_to_fix_lag/,"There has been much discussion lately about the following lines in build.prop:

    dalvik.vm.heapgrowthlimit=96m

and

    dalvik.vm.heapsize=256m

It was suggested that you change it to 64 and 384 respectively. However, osm0sis on XDA posted the following in the Franco Kernel thread: 

&gt;I compared all the build props for the Nexus S, Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 7, Nexus 4 and Nexus 10.
&gt;
&gt;The guy was definitely wrong about the second value, it's always been 256 on the GN, not 384 as on the N7. And the first value became 96 only with 4.2 because the dalvik.vm.heap clearly became more complex, and has gradually over time: heapstartsize and heapgrowthlimit were introduced with Android 4.0; and heaptargetutilization, heapminfree and heapmaxfree were introduced with Android 4.2. Probably the dynamic control Google was talking about in the link above.
&gt;
&gt;So what the guy was talking about was only half the story.
&gt;
&gt;It actually went from (takju-imm76i and takju-jzo54k):
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapstartsize=8m
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapgrowthlimit=64m
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapsize=256m
&gt;
&gt;To (takju-jdq39):
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapstartsize=8m
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapgrowthlimit=96m
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapsize=256m
&gt;dalvik.vm.heaptargetutilization=0.75
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapminfree=512k
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapmaxfree=8m
&gt;
&gt;Which makes perfect sense if the actual size is something like a function of the targetutilization and the growthlimit. 0.75 * 96m = 72m. And following from that, the actual size would only be increased by 8m, to 72m from 64m, but now in Android 4.2 it has a further margin to expand if required where it didn't before. Probably a good thing. Programmatically buffers are better than hard limits.
&gt;
&gt;If that is the case then setting it to 64 is not the same as reverting to the 4.0-4.1 values, it's actually lowering it to 0.75 * 64 = 48m. He does have a point that they stayed the same on nakasi between 4.0-4.1 and 4.2, but who knows, maybe the N7 is the one that it should have been increased on and the GN is correct. The N4 and N10 both have growth at 192m, and size at 512m, so the N7 is more the odd-one-out now.
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, I'm just guessing there, but I know these values are fairly different on each device, clearly depending on how much memory the specific device has available, so I don't think they're worth the headache to accommodate or our time to tune when Google clearly knows better than the guy who filed the issue. 

and

&gt;Follow-up: The N7 is definitely the odd one out.
&gt;
&gt;These are the values for the N4 and N10:
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapgrowthlimit=192m
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapsize=512m
&gt;dalvik.vm.heaptargetutilization=0.75
&gt;
&gt;0.75 / 2 = 0.375 * 512 = 192.
&gt;
&gt;GN:
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapgrowthlimit=96m
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapsize=256m
&gt;dalvik.vm.heaptargetutilization=0.75
&gt;
&gt;0.75 / 2 = 0.375 * 256 = 96.
&gt;
&gt;N7:
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapgrowthlimit=64m &lt;=
&gt;dalvik.vm.heapsize=384m
&gt;dalvik.vm.heaptargetutilization=0.75
&gt;
&gt;0.75 / 2 = 0.375 * 384 = 144.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Three devices makes a pattern. So however the new implementation of dalvik heapsize works, I think GN people can safely relax because the math for our device at least matches; Google likely got it right. The N7 on the other hand.. 
&gt;
&gt;Gotta do your homework before taking it to The Man! 

Links: [First post](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=40753047&amp;postcount=41327), [second post](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=40753766&amp;postcount=41329).

If you skipped over it, I recommend you go back and read it again. Tl;dr is that there's more to the dalvik heap than those two values, and the 4.2 system works differently from the 4.1 system, so directly replicating the 4.1 values might not work. However, Google's numbers might not be the best, either. 

If you checked his formula, it appears that the N4/10 both divide 0.75 by 2. Here's some more stuff:

&gt;Nah that post was just a guess - I wouldn't use it to try and figure anything out, since I don't know if that's how it actually works. We'd have to look at the code. I was just trying to make the point that with the added variables (like target, etc) in JB4.2, raising it to 96m, in practice, might not actually be that far off of the old dalvik heap's 64m.
&gt;
&gt;I'd go more by what Google's math actually seems to be, which is they want growthlimit at half of targetutil * heapsize.
&gt;
&gt;So you were potentially more correct with 64/256/0.5 since 0.5 / 2 = 0.25 * 256 = 64. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;To assume Google has that wrong, you could also just go ahead and divide targetutil by 3 and come up with what the guy in the heap issue thread unknowingly did, which is 0.75 / 3 = 0.25 * 256 = 64. That math is (target/3) what I'm trying on my N7 right now.

&gt;     hs=`getprop dalvik.vm.heapsize | cut -dm -f1`;
    htu=`getprop dalvik.vm.heaptargetutilization`;
    hgl=`awk -v htu=$htu -v hs=$hs 'BEGIN { print (htu / 2) * hs }'`;
    setprop dalvik.vm.heapgrowthlimit $hgl'm';

&gt;This init.d script snippet takes the build.prop numbers and calculates/sets the heapgrowthlimit by Google's current formula. As is, it works on the N7 to bring it in line with the other Nexus devices with 144/384/0.75 and will leave the others the same. Or you could change the 2 to a 3 like I said above to see how 64/256/0.75 works on the GN. That gives 96/384/0.75 on the N7. If you want to get crazy with changing the target you could #comment out the htu line and add htu=0.5 or something instead.
&gt;
&gt;As always, no build.prop edits required. 

[Link](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=40781369&amp;postcount=41359).

This might mean something, as **assuming Google is right for the Nexus 7**, then perhaps they did it intentionally. After all, the GN and N7 aren't exactly the same as N4 and N10 as they each have 2GB RAM while we have 1GB. Perhaps dividing by 3 is the way to go? Feel free to try it out, divide by 2 or 3. One thing is for sure, and that **dalvik.vm.heapsize** is 256. It's been like that for as long as the GNex existed, and it shall remain as that. Play with **dalvik.vm.heaptargetutilization** and divide by either 2 or 3 to generate **dalvik.vm.heapgrowthlimit**. 

Here's some other info: 

* What I'm using: 64/256/0.5, dividing by 2.

* The TW 4.1.2 ROMs for the Skyrocket use the ""new"" method of dalvik heap, with **dalvik.vm.heaptargetutilization** being 0.75. 

* You can check values without flashing the ROM by downloading the zip, extracting /system/build.prop, open it with VIM or Notepad++, and checking the mentioned lines. 

* 4.1.1: old system, with heapgrowthlimit=64m and heapsize=256m. 

* 4.2.2_r1.2 is the same as 4.2.2.

Sorry for the lengthy post, but play around with the numbers, and see if you can find a sweet spot. Perhaps, like kernel settings, this sweet spot is unique to each device. Or, it could apply to everyone. Anyways, please share your results.

EDIT: While the value of these might not matter, there is a value that is definitely wrong. For **dalvik.vm.heapminfree**, in 4.2, 4.2.1, and 4.2.2_r1.2, it's set at 512k. Only in 4.2.2 is it 2m.

This is the guide I used. It was extremely helpful. He also shows you where to purchase replacement parts (you can always just check Amazon or eBay)
[How to Replace a Charging Port in a Galaxy Nexus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AzUM6_HwWk)

One piece of advice I would give when purchasing your replacement piece is to make sure you are purchasing for your model. For example, I almost purchased a i9250 charging port when I really needed the i515 version. It would have been a waste of time and money. You can typically find this information underneath the battery.

My replacement part cost $7. I bought a tool kit (mini screw driver, spudger, etc.) for $10. The total fix took less than 15 minutes. 

If you have any questions I'd be happy to answer and I'm sure some people with more experience than me would be willing to share as well. I owe it to this community for helping me find the guide and the confidence to find a fix myself.

This is just a post about things I love about the gnex, so if you don't wanna read just skip it ;) 

In August I was using a borrowed LG Optimus L9. I really wanted to get the Nexus 4 but it wasn't coming out until November. I had the option to keep the L9 and pay for it, or return it and get something else. I was unable to root the L9 so I started looking for a used phone to get. I decided to jump on the nexus wagon since thats where I was headed and I wanted to have the community behind it for rooting and ROMs. I went on craigslist for a couple of days until I found a good deal. I bought a used Galaxy Nexus (GSM) for $260 bucks in really good condition, with its original box, charger, and rooted. I started playing with ROMs and tweaking it to my liking, it was a huge jump from the L9 and I immediately fell in love with my used-new-to-me gnex. 

Fast forward to December... I placed an order and received my Nexus 4. I was so excited, I mean this phone is so beautiful. But, as soon as I turned it on the first thing I noticed was ""wow this screen is pale and magenta."" I installed all the essential apps and rooted my N4 and now I use it as my main phone. I was unsure if I was going to keep my gnex, or sell it. Everyday after I came home from work my gnex would be on my desk, and I would grab it just to play with it and I would fall in love with it again, it sort of became like my tablet. I don't own a tablet but this was my goto device when I was home. I used it for browsing or chatting while I sat and watched TV and occasionally played some games. I know a lot of people prefer the IPS screen on the N4 to the AMOLED screen of the Samsung devices but I have to disagree. All this arguments about ""flat colors are more real"" is bullshit to me. I don't care if the colors aren't ""realistic"". When I am playing a game like Dead Space, which has nothing realistic about it, I want the saturated red bright blood to pop on the screen, and I want the deep black shadows to be... the deepest possible black... like I would imagine they are in space, true darkness, something that in ""reality"" I will never experience.

The N4 is built really well, physically speaking I like it much more than the gnex. But there seem to be some little things about the gnex, that to me make it feel like a superior phone. For example the haptic feedback on the gnex feels so different from any other phone I've used, it just feels... ""right"" I don't know how to describe it, but it feels very different from the N4. 

During Christmas my mother came to visit me, she was kind of fed up with her iPhone, so I let her use my gnex while she was here. Well, she too fell in love with it and decided to keep it. I was happy she changed to Android, especially to a Nexus... but I was a bit sad that I wasn't going to have my gnex around anymore. It's been a couple of weeks since she left and it has really made me miss my gnex, so I have decided to buy another one. My top reasons: 

1. The screen, I love it. I will use this as a gaming device/tablet.
2. I will also probably root it again and flash some roms including Ubuntu
3. When work is slow I used to hook up the HDMI to my monitor and watch netflix. Can't do that anymore with my N4.
4. It's nice to have an unlocked GSM device for when I travel. Maybe somedays I'll leave the N4 at home and take this baby out.
5. Because its probably one of the best phones I have owned.

What would I change if I could? Make it a quadcore. I mean the gnex is fast, but compared with the N4 it lags. Also I would add an HSPA+ 42mbps. But thats probably it. I really like it the way it is. I really hope Samsung gets to do another Nexus. I know a lot of people have a problem with Samsung because they focused more on their own Galaxy SIII line, but I think that can change. We all saw what happened with the release of the Nexus 4. It sold out worldwide within minutes. It was a clusterfuck, but that is great news for phone makers. The Nexus brand is becoming an important product. I'm sure phone makers are going to be begging to be part of the next nexus. Samsung (to me) makes the best devices and it has the pipeline to deliver more phones on launch date than LG.

So as soon as I get my new gnex, I'm probably going to root it and put Ubuntu. Happy gnexing everyone ;)",,False,,t5_2sypj,False,,,True,t3_169t58,http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/169t58/got_a_nexus_4_last_month_and_i_just_bought_my/,

* goddamn my screen is huge. i'm used to running 1920x1080 off my laptop on my 23"" screen, and having the 1280x720 GNex makes everything look enormous. EDIT - switched to Paranoid Android (was AOKPm5), screen real estate is much better.

* multitasking - a staple of corporate productivity - can be ranked as ""adequate"". Alt+Tab works to show the Recents window, which allows quick switching between the last 8 apps, and the Task Switcher is always available top-right (MHL forces landscape).

* email/calendar is more than adequate for corporate needs, as long as you're only doing the basics.

* RDP - I'm using PocketCloud Free for RDP access, since we use a proprietary application that is Windows-only. The Free version does everything I need it to do, although it takes some getting used to - for instance, I use lots of keyboard shortcuts in Outlook (like Ctrl+Shift+V to move items), and I've noticed that Ctrl is a ""StickyKey"", meaning it works more like Caps Lock (click once to activate, once to disable), which is taking some getting used to. Also, there appears to be a delay when typing, if the phone is pulling email or gTalk data simultaneously, which leads to omissions like ""I'm going to the store"" ends up as ""I'm gohestre"". Not a huge deal, just more ""getting used to"".

* HEAT. Since MHL is essentially just mirroring the GNex screen, the phone screen is on the entire time, which causes the phone to heat up fairly significantly. To mitigate this, I've resorted to dropping the screen brightness all the way down, and to reduce burn-in on the Nav bar I've reduced it to 24px (AOKP lets you do this). I'm a little concerned about the notification bar, however, since that is not hidden while in most apps (I've got it hidden on the home screen via Apex).

* Remote file access - haven't had any need for this, since I've got RDP access, but I may decide to investigate functionality/usefulness in the future.

UPDATES:

5/15 13:00EST - Switched to Paranoid Android (from AOKPm5). IT'S GLORIOUS!

5/16 10:45EST - Last night, I realised PA was almost useless in Phone mode, so switched back to AOKPm5. I had some video issues this morning, with intense flickering and aspect ratio issues, but they seem to have resolved themselves after a reboot. Have to type up a blog post and do some spreadsheet work today, so I'm going to give OfficeSuite a run through and see how it holds up. If the reviews are any indication, it should be good to go.

5/17 11:15EST - So both the word processing and spreadsheet apps worked great - spreadsheets aren't quite as robust as Excel (as expected), but it sufficed for my needs.  I'm on GTalk quite a bit, and switching between it, Email, and PocketCloud RDP is excellent.  This morning I tried using my iPad in place of the GNex (hooked it up to a monitor, BT keyboard and mouse) and the experience was nowhere near as fulfilling.  Over the past few days, I've grown accustomed to the workflow on the GNex, and the iPad would take some getting used to, I think.  I've decided that I'm going to get an Android tablet in the future, simply because i find the workflow to be much better than the iOS (I have never been a Mac user, so I'm not really comfortable with some of the limitations and layout of iOS) - the only hard part is deciding on the one that I want.  The Galaxy Tab 2 looks unimpressive, and I refuse to buy Asus or Toshiba based on prior experience, so that limits me to pretty much either a Xoom or Acer.",,False,,t5_2sypj,1337267916.0,,,True,t3_tobhx,http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/tobhx/gnex_as_a_laptop_replacement_in_a_corporate/,

I had to get it replaced last month, and as soon as I got my replacement, the first thing I noticed was just how _smooth_ the OS felt.  However, there were too many features from custom ROMs and Kernels that I wanted, so I flashed away.  Today, however, I decided that my phone was just too freaking slow and I didn't care about any of the features, so I flashed back to stock, un rooted.  It's liquid smooth.  Before today, I tried every ROM I could find and every kernel (and every variation of every kernel) that people mentioned.  No matter what I did, my phone always ended up being dreadfully slow after about a week.  I want to keep the butter of COMPLETELY stock with the ability to Fast Charge (which I need so dearly in my car)

I saw this [hilarious tweet](https://twitter.com/_ShitNobodySays/status/239432231981043713) today, and it reminded me of how glad I am that the Galaxy Nexus has user-swappable batteries. 

My last phone was an iPhone, and there were so many times I knew I'd be running out of power before I could get a chance to recharge my mobile. It was incredibly irritating.

Extra batteries: $4x2 External Charger: $2.50

No more running out of power for me! I think I'm set!

Edit: I've been using these batteries, two months later, no fires or explosions yet.

Edit2: I tried using NFC with one of these batteries - NFC turns on, but I wasn't able to get it to work. I swapped my regular battery back in there, it worked fine. This could be purely observation bias, but life on these batteries seems to be a bit less than what I get from my factory battery. I think these batteries are not authentic Samsung batteries.

1342112869.0,30,self.GalaxyNexus,wg7ng,I want to update my Verizon GNexus to Jelly Bean. Is there some sort of newbie guide out there for people who are completely clueless with all these abbreviations and jargon?,SpeedbirdTK1,48,18,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/wg7ng/i_want_to_update_my_verizon_gnexus_to_jelly_bean/,"I'm really trying to search and research around on my own but it seems like anything regarding JB is completely unfriendly towards people new to rooting. I'm just overwhelmed at all the things I need to know. There's so many different versions of JB ROMs with so many different abbreviations that I feel like I'm reading some sort of patent document. I mean, I find really really newbie-friendly guides on how to install AOKP or CM9 for new users but I can't find ANYTHING at all for Jelly Bean.

First of all, I have a Verizon Galaxy Nexus. I understand that there's different variants of the phone, from GSM, HSPA, CDMA, LTE, etc. Looking at [this](http://wiki.rootzwiki.com/Samsung_Galaxy_Nexus) link, this makes my phone the CDME and/or the LTE version. I read that Verizon will take a very long time to get the JB update out, which is the motive for all this.

Second, I know that your phone needs to be rooted in order to manually install the JB update. There seems to be a LOT of different versions. I have read that that JB versions prior to a day or two ago are based on a leaked build and the ones after are the 'official' ones from Google being pushed out to unlocked phones. 

I don't even know where to start because when I go to somewhere like the [xda forums for the GNexus](http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php?f=1339), I have no idea what the fuck people are talking about.

Lastly, I'd like to ask this question. Does updating to the 'official' Jelly Bean guarantee full functionality of my phone? I'm looking through topics of the different released JB ROMs and some of them have a list of things that would/wouldn't work such as camera, GPS, etc. I have read that Jelly Bean doesn't support Lite Flow yet, which is kind of a must-have for me right now but I'm not completely sure on that.

**tl;dr: I need a guide, a place to start, to hand-hold a new user to update my phone to Jelly Bean, assuming it's worth it.**

I ordered 2 Black cases for a friend and I and it should be a little bit over a week before I receive them.

1342830574.0,25,self.GalaxyNexus,wwhbr,First impressions moving from the LTE to HSPA+ Galaxy Nexus,e40,37,12,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/wwhbr/first_impressions_moving_from_the_lte_to_hspa/,"I got my LTE GN on launch day.  I was second in line at my local Verizon store.  I've been happy with the device and have had very few problems.  I have had a problem with Verizon service, where at home in my office about 25% of the time my phone didn't have a signal.

The wife, still using a OD Droid, needed an upgrade badly.  The prospect of being locked into Verizon for another 2 years.... it was too much.  I had a friend that got a GSM GN and he came over and I had good EDGE service in my office, so I made the jump.  Here are my initial impressions.

* First thing I noticed was I could update to 4.1 immediately.  Ahhhhhhhhhh.  That felt good.

* The GSM version goes from Wifi/airplane mode to EDGE/HSPA+ **very quickly** compared to my LTE GN.  This is a godsend, IMO.  I really hated waiting for the damn switch over.

* The power button on the new GN is much better.  I can't really describe it, but I don't fail to turn on the phone as often as I would with my old phone.  It just feels better.  I'm guessing I either had a defective one or they fixed it.

* I'm on the TMO $30/mo, 100 voice, unlimited text and data (only 5G of ""4G"" data, though).  I can't tell you how nice it feels to not pay close to $80/mo.

The downsides to TMO:

* The pre-paid website sucks balls and barely works (I had to use IE Tab in Chrome to get anywhere).  I had to use the phone to add time to my son's new (feature) phone (which I got on ebay for $40).  He has a $15/mo plan with unlimited text, no data, and $0.10/min voice.

* Since it's considered pre-paid, if you don't refill your balance by the renew date, your phone gets turned off.  Not a biggie for me, so I'll throw a CC on the account and setup auto-renew (if the damn website will work!!).

* The speeds of HSPA+ when I have full bars is about 3Mbps.  My LTE GN was a good deal faster than that, perhaps 5x.  For me, this is not a big deal.  I spend 99% of my time at work or home where I have Wifi turned on.  EDIT: as people have pointed out in the comments, HSPA+ isn't really true 4G.   TMO does call it that, though, so I'm using their terminology.

* 100 minutes goes fast, even if you don't talk much.  That's' 100 5 second conversations.  So, I'll be using an VoIP for most calls.  Android 4.x makes this easy, though.  I didn't realize it until recently that you can add a SIP account to the settings in the Phone app and tell it to make VoIP calls all the time (or ask).  Between my work and home I have a strong 4G connection (it starts about 1 block from my house... grrrrr), and I tested it today talking all the way.  I have to say, it sounded better than my old VZ GN on the ""best network in the country.""

Overall I am very happy I made the switch.  I did a spreadsheet and I'll come out about $200 ahead over 18 months I won't be with Verizon.  After that, I'll save about $70/mo (for 3 phones, 2 of them smartphones), which adds up fast.

I just hope TMO doesn't do away with the plan I'm on.  They sure make it hard to find and sign up for, so I'm not that sure it's here to stay.",,False,,t5_2sypj,1342876875.0,,,True,t3_wwhbr,http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/wwhbr/first_impressions_moving_from_the_lte_to_hspa/,

The reason is that the performance of MTP is much, much better and can handle larger file sizes (HD Movies, videos, etc.).  Well, during Christmas break, I figured out how to do this.  Basically I followed the two guides listed below:

* [How to Properly Mount Android 4.0+ Devices In Ubuntu Using Go-mtpfs - Web Upd8](http://www.webupd8.org/2012/12/how-to-mount-android-40-ubuntu-go-mtpfs.html)
* [UBUNTU - AUTOMOUNT NEXUS 7 IN MTP MODE](http://bernaerts.dyndns.org/linux/247-ubuntu-automount-nexus7-mtp)

My instructions are a combination of the two guides.  When finished, you will only have to plug your phone in and unplug your phone.  No right clicking icons in the launcher, no adding repositories, no compiling of anything, etc.  I hope this works for anyone who tries it.  It seems long, but it's actually quite simple.  I mostly put this here to bookmark it for myself and I figured that I can't be the only one who might reference this.

**2. Install Packages**

    cd {PATH TO DOWNLOADED FILES} &amp;&amp; sudo dpkg -i *.deb

    

**3. Configure FUSE**

    sudo chmod a+r /etc/fuse.conf
    sudo gedit /etc/fuse.conf

Uncomment (remove the '#' symbol before) the following line:

    user_allow_other

Save the file and exit Gedit.

    

**4. Create Mount Point**

    sudo mkdir /media/MyAndroid
    sudo chmod 777 /media/MyAndroid

    

**5. Capture UDEV Details**

Next, we need to capture the device properties of your Android device.

Now, on your phone, disable USB Debugging, turn on MTP.

In Ubuntu, enter in the following command:

     udevadm monitor --environment --udev &gt;&gt; ~/Desktop/udev_no_debugging.txt

Plug in your Android device, wait a few seconds, unplug the device, then hit CTRL+C.

Back to your phone, enable USB Debugging, make sure MTP is still on.

Now, back in Ubuntu, enter in the following command:

     udevadm monitor --environment --udev &gt;&gt; ~/Desktop/udev_with_debugging.txt

Plug in your Android device, wait a few seconds, unplug the device, then hit CTRL+C.

Now, run this command and enter your password:

     gedit ~/Desktop/udev_no_debugging.txt ~/Desktop/udev_with_debugging.txt &amp;&amp; sudo gedit /etc/udev/rules.d/99-android.rules

You should have one gedit window as root with the 99-android.rules file and another gedit windows NOT as root with two tabs open.  The first tab is what we'll call the ""Debugging Off"" device data, the other is the ""Debugging On"" device data.

    

**6. Create UDEV Rules** (Note, these values will be different for Android 4.1.x and 4.2.x)

Copy and paste everything between the ""____"" below into the gedit window with 99-android.rules opened currently.

-----
    # Android MTP
    SUBSYSTEM==""usb"", ATTR{idVendor}==""{YOUR_ID_VENDOR_ID}"", ATTR{idProduct}==""{YOUR_ID_MODEL_ID}"", MODE=""0666""	# Debugging off
    SUBSYSTEM==""usb"", ATTR{idVendor}==""{YOUR_ID_VENDOR_ID}"", ATTR{idProduct}==""{YOUR_ID_MODEL_ID}"", MODE=""0666""	# Debugging on

    # Commands for mounting
    ENV{ID_MODEL}==""{YOUR_ID_MODEL}"", ENV{ID_MODEL_ID}==""{YOUR_ID_MODEL_ID}"", ACTION==""add"", RUN+=""/usr/bin/sudo -u {YOUR_USER_ID_HERE} /usr/bin/go-mtpfs-unity mount""	# Debugging off
    ENV{ID_MODEL}==""{YOUR_ID_MODEL}"", ENV{ID_MODEL_ID}==""{YOUR_ID_MODEL_ID}"", ACTION==""add"", RUN+=""/usr/bin/sudo -u {YOUR_USER_ID_HERE} /usr/bin/go-mtpfs-unity mount""	# Debugging on

    # Commands for unmounting
    ENV{ID_MODEL}==""{YOUR_ID_MODEL}"", ENV{ID_MODEL_ID}==""{YOUR_ID_MODEL_ID}"", ACTION==""remove"", RUN+=""/usr/bin/sudo -u {YOUR_USER_ID_HERE} /usr/bin/go-mtpfs-unity unmount""	# Debugging off
    ENV{ID_MODEL}==""{YOUR_ID_MODEL}"", ENV{ID_MODEL_ID}==""{YOUR_ID_MODEL_ID}"", ACTION==""remove"", RUN+=""/usr/bin/sudo -u {YOUR_USER_ID_HERE} /usr/bin/go-mtpfs-unity unmount""	# Debugging on

-----

Using the data from the ""Debugging Off"" file, change the appropriate values on the lines with ""Debugging off"" in the 99-android.rules file: 

 - replace {YOUR_ID_VENDOR_ID} with what the value after the '=' shows on the line that starts with, ""ID_VENDOR_ID""

 - replace {YOUR_ID_MODEL} with what the value after the '=' shows on the line that starts with, ""ID_MODEL""

 - replace {YOUR_ID_MODEL_ID} with what the value after the '=' shows on the line that starts with, ""ID_MODEL_ID""


Using the data from the ""Debugging On"" file, change the appropriate values on the lines with ""Debugging on"" in the 99-android.rules file: 

 - replace {YOUR_ID_VENDOR_ID} with what the value after the '=' shows on the line that starts with, ""ID_VENDOR_ID""

 - replace {YOUR_ID_MODEL} with what the value after the '=' shows on the line that starts with, ""ID_MODEL""

 - replace {YOUR_ID_MODEL_ID} with what the value after the '=' shows on the line that starts with, ""ID_MODEL_ID""


Replace {YOUR_USER_ID_HERE} with your Ubuntu user ID.

Save the file and close all Gedit windows.

    

**7. FSTAB Declaration**

In order to be able to ""Safely Remove"" or unmount your Android device, you will need to add a declaration into FSTAB for it.

Connect your device and run the following command:

    /usr/bin/go-mtpfs-unity mount

Now run the following command:

    mount

You should see a listing that starts with, ""DeviceFS"".  For example, here is mine:

    DeviceFs(Galaxy Nexu on /media/GalaxyNexus type fuse.DeviceFs(Galaxy Nexu (rw,nosuid,nodev,user=towens)

We are interested in the following 2 chunks:

    DeviceFs(Galaxy Nexu                            fuse.DeviceFs(Galaxy Nexu

Now, run the following command:

    sudo gedit /etc/fstab

Copy and paste everything between '____' to the end of your FSTAB file:



-----
    # My Android Device
    DeviceFs({DEVICE}) /media/MyAndroid fuse.DeviceFs({DEVICE}) allow_other,rw,user,noauto 0 0

-----


- Replace ""DeviceFs({DEVICE})"" with the first of the 2 chunks from the mount command earlier.  If you have a space, then you will need to use \040 in place of the space like so:

        DeviceFS(Galaxy\040Nexu

Note: Your device listed when you ran the ""mount"" command may not have the completing (right) paranthesis ')' or even have the name of the device completed.  As you can see from my examples above, mine did not.  This is normal.  So for mine, I took the first chunk that was displayed in the mount command, ""DeviceFS(Galaxy Nexu"", and edited my FSTAB file with ""DeviceFs(Galaxy\040Nexu""

- Replace ""fuse.DeviceFs({DEVICE})"" with the 2nd of the 2 chunks from the mount command earlier.  Same thing applies here if your device name is not complete or if it has a space.  So mine looked like this:


        # My Android Device
        DeviceFs(Galaxy\040Nexu /media/MyAndroid fuse.DeviceFs(Galaxy\040Nexu allow_other,rw,user,noauto 0 0


When done, save the file and exit gedit.

    

**8. Reboot and Enjoy**

Lastly, reboot your computer.  After reboot, login and test.  You should be able to plug in your Android device, then see a listing for ""MyAndroid"" under devices in Nautilus.  Click on MyAndroid and browse away.

* Can't see files!

* My nandroid backups are gone!

* My TiBu/RTP app backups are gone!

* Various other problems related to missing files.

With CM10.1 being released for maguro today, and toro very soon, I expect a lot more people jumping to Android 4.2. This means a lot more people asking ""where did my files go?"" and ""CWM can't see my backups!"". If this does happen to you, follow this guide and everything will be back to normal. [Original post in AndroidQuestions](http://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/14z5ar/howtoget_your_files_back_after_flashing_a_42_rom/).

1. Use a root-enabled file explorer and browse to /sdcard. 

2. Do you see a ""0"" folder? If you do, skip to step 4. If you don't, continue on with step 3.

3. Go to /data/media. All your files are here, right? If not, perform step 2 for this folder. This time, you should definitely see a ""0"" folder if all your files aren't in /data/media.

4. Move everything to /sdcard. Feel free to delete the ""0"" folder. ***DO NOT*** delete /data/media. /data/media/0 should be ok though. 

5. Update your recovery to either the [latest CWM](http://www.clockworkmod.com/rommanager) or the [latest TWRP](http://goo.im/devs/openrecovery). Flash that through fastboot. This will prevent ""your files going missing"" in the future. Note that you can't restore backups made by CWM with TWRP, and vice versa, so flash the one you were originally using.

Now boot into recovery, and you should be able to see your backups!",,False,,t5_2sypj,1355885519.0,,,True,t3_14z5qb,http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/14z5qb/howtoget_your_files_back_after_flashing_a_42_rom/,

Recently I spilled some candlewax on my gnex and the charging usb plug. Like a damn fool I plugged it in without fully getting all the wax off(apparently) and fowled up the hardware in the USB port of my phone.  My phone thought it was charging 100% of the time and it was ruining my battery life. I tried compressed air, toothpick, etc to get all the junk out but was unsuccessful.

I almost sent my phone into verizon and would have gotten a replacement, however I realized that the damage to the USB wouldn't have been covered under warranty and I would have been forced to pay 300bucks for a new phone.

So I bought a new USB flex cable online and replaced it using [this guide](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5fZzZANLC4)

Now my gnex is working swimmingly!

So if you have any parts of your phone that aren't working...camera, radio, power button, volume rocker etc...all these parts can be found online and this guide is very easy to follow.

So I ask those of you who have chosen something else, like Codename, Gummy or BlackIce: Why? What are the specific features that made you choose this ROM over the heavyweights?

1) It's not an app holding wakelock. I've checked.

2) Seriously really, it's not an app.

3) Read #1 and 2.

Now that we have that out of the way, let's talk about the bug:

Using GSam Battery Monitor (formerly Badass Battery Monitor), I was able to ascertain that the Android System process was exhibiting unusually high battery consumption. Digging into it, GBM reported that the magnetic field sensor was being left on.

So, I uninstalled everything on the phone that utilized the magnetometer on the GNex. Still the same issue.

One day I decided not to enable auto-rotate, and I got 1% per hour over night. As soon as I enabled the feature, then turned it back off mid-day, the magnetometer was back to being stuck on. The only way to fix it was to reboot the phone and not enable auto-rotate.

So, to reproduce: boot the phone and enable auto-rotate, do stuff with your phone, then turn rotate off. Et voila, the magnetometer should be stuck on. To be very specific, I utilize the toggle provided in the notification shade.

Interestingly enough, Better Battery Stats doesn't report this at all. One of the many reasons why I have stopped using that application.

I took today to do a battery test on my VZW GNex with an OEM 2100 mAh battery.  I didn't do anything real intensive.  Text, Hangouts messaging, FB messaging, a couple of short phone calls, and a whole bunch of redditing (reddit is fun app); which included viewing pics and videos.  This is pretty normal for when I have nothing to do and I have recorded around 5 hours of screen on time before doing this on 4.2.2.  This was with WiFi on the whole time, auto brightness, mobile data, GPS, bla bla.

[So, here are the results:](http://imgur.com/a/Yc1XO)

* 12h 13m 55s uptime

* 7h 5m 50s screen on time

I don't have Greenify or anything like that but I have disabled location for Facebook through the stock ""App Ops"" settings.  I'm using whatever kernel the Shiny ROM came with and no changes have been made to clock speed or voltage.  Other than root and some root apps (TiBu, ES, AdAway, Cerberus), everything is how the Shiny ROM comes.  All of my fellow VZW GNex users feel my pain in the battery life department.  With stock battery and stock ROM, I'd be lucky to get 2hrs screen on time.  I haven't done a comparison test with the stock battery but it did seem to hold up a lot longer at work than on 4.2.2.

* Now, disconnect Wi-Fi if it is connected.
* Make sure you have a decent signal either on 3G or 4G.
* Install the downloaded VerizonLogonClient.apk
* Start your Verizon app (such as MyVerizon)
* Log in like normal if it prompts you.
* That's it.

The reason you are having this issue is the VerizonLogonClient app is either missing or has the incorrect permissions.  It is a system app so it gets treated differently.  Reinstalling it usually resolves the issue.

The other reason you are having this issue is because the first time you attempt to connect to Verizon with one of their apps, you MUST BE ON 3G OR 4G.  It will not work via Wi-Fi.  After the initial sign in to any Verizon app, it will work on Wi-Fi from now on just fine.

Hope this helps.  ~~This is in my DropBox, so if anyone can mirror it, it may be useful.~~  Updated link.  **Thanks  Mispey!**

My question would be, is it still a good phone to get for a 2 year contract? (I'm with Verizon btw) I was considering purchasing the phones via amazon wireless because 100 dollars for the phone is a really good deal. So my question is, is it a phone that will last for the 2 years and still stay decent, or is it slowly disappointing you? Are most of the common problems fixed if you unlock+root the device?

To clarify, this is the issue with GSM models where the phone would not be able to re-establish a data connection on the mobile network once you left a wifi AP you were connected to, and either required a toggle on/off of airplane mode or a reboot to fix.

In digging around from the problem, I came upon the issue of RILs (Radio Interface Layers).  On official updates, the RIL is optimized for the OS and the radio firmware, but with ROMing, people are using different combinations of radio firmware and OS.

I used an app from the play store called GetRIL and it installed the correct RIL for my radio firmware.  Since then, no more data drops.  I can leave the house away from my Wifi, and the phone automatically switches to my mobile data network.  It has been working flawlessly for a little over a week now, since I installed it.

Not claiming this will be a magic bullet for everyone with the problem, to be honest I don't entirely understand the mechanics of the RIL and the impact it can have between the radio firmware and the kernel, but I can testify to the fact that it seems to have cleared up the issue for my particular handset.  Just wanted to post this for anyone else that is trying to figure out a way around the problem as another possible fix to try.  

For reference:

My network: Rogers

My kernel:  Franco M4

My OS: AOKP b38

My Radio:  UGLC1


No promises implied, just wanted to throw this out there as an FYI.

**Edit:**  Wanted to add that it is possible to install RILs yourself if you can locate the correct one, you can do some digging on xda- or rootzwiki to do so, I was simply just too lazy so went with the app method since I had seen it mentioned several times.",,False,,t5_2sypj,1340173216.0,,,True,t3_vbfhj,http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/vbfhj/fixed_my_data_drop_issues_on_aokp_your_mileage/,

I purchased this case from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=diztronic+galaxy+nexus&amp;x=0&amp;y=0), I got the Translucent smoke.  It comes with a screen protector as well, but I have not yet opted to put it on.

[Link to album with comparison pictures](http://imgur.com/a/nEwQW#0)

This is the first case I have purchased for my Gnex, So I cannot comment on any other cases.  The case has a ""soft"" feel, not like silicone soft, but plastic soft.  It is flexible and the phone ""snaps"" into the case very easily.  I do not have the extended battery in, but will have it in a few days.  (It is half off ($25) at verizon right now [LINK](http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store/accessory?action=accessoryDetails&amp;archetypeId=12917&amp;accessoryId=49870) it shows up 49.99 on product page, add to cart and hit checkout, shows $24.99) and I think the case will still work as there are some pictures floating around that show that the extended battery does not really add much thickness. (I'll update this post then).

It has a nice feel to it and I don't think it really adds much thickness (or weight).  My last phone was the OG droid and I never used a case on that, but the gnex does not feel as robust - I feel I could have thrown my OG droid at a wall and nothing would happen, the gnex, not so much.  I like the translucent smoke as I think it fits more along the lines of the original color pattern of the Gnex, but there are other colors available.  

As far as protection factor goes, I definitely feel much safer, if I drop it lightly on my desk, it does bounce a little, and the thud isn't quite so harsh, but I still wouldn't drop it on purpose.  

I also chose this case over some others because on product pages, it showed the bottom of the phone (where the charger and headphone jack are) as almost fully exposed, and by murphy's law, the phone will definitely land on this unprotected area.

The only negative I have about this is that the volume rocker area is NOT cut out, so you don't quite get that noticeable click anymore.  I may try and solve this myself in the future but for now, I am going to leave it.

As such, at unpredictable times I may have the screen on and Bluetooth data for 45 minutes to an hour, far from a charger. If it dies before I am done it would be a major problem, so I was constantly worrying about the state of charge, and planning how and when I was going to be able to recharge it. 

When the ZeroLemon battery popped up on Reddit, I wasn't interested, until I remembered I had a motorcycle camping trip coming up. Three days with uncertain access to charging. I had the stock battery, and the official extended battery, but with a 3rd battery I could make it for sure. I bought the ZeroLemon and started working through the recommended 6 full charge discharge cycles. That was actually pretty hard, because a charge would last me through a full day and well into the next day, unless I took steps to kill the battery early. 

By the end of the 6th discharge, I realized I was no longer worrying about the state of charge. That is when I recognized how much of my time had been spent on managing the other batteries. It sounded very similar to the range anxiety that electric car owners are reported to have, hence the title of the post. 

The physical size of the battery is annoying, but for me, not a deal breaker. I have a work related walkie-talkie type app that already had an issue with low volume levels, and the battery seems to make that a little worse. For me, since my usage is so unpredictable, my battery life varies hugely, but even on the highest usage days it lasts at least 16 hours.

Pre-ordered this thing over a month ago, and it came in today. Though they changed the design from completely clear to having a black border, this thing is virtually undetectable when applied. It's a dry application; there's adhesive on the black border, none on the field, or screen part. 

Maybe because of this lack of adhesive on the screen, I am noticing some missed touches, especially when typing quickly. It's not enough to drive me crazy just yet, and maybe I'll just adjust to it after a day or two. 

Only major problem was that I had reduced the size of the nav bar, and the buttons weren't registering touches very well at all. I turned them back up to default size, and they work fine now. Maybe it was the reboot that fixed it, maybe it was the protector. Not sure. 

Supposedly this has an oleophobic coating, and it does seem to smudge less than the naked screen. 

Anyway, it's really nice. I'm coming from a Ghost Armor, and I'm really liking the feeling of glass, without worrying about jacking up the actual screen. I'd recommend it.

Update: I can no longer recommend this thing. I had it on for three or four days before taking it off. The reduced screen sensitivity drove me crazy. Sometimes the nav bar buttons would just totally stop registering touches until I turned the screen off and on again. I also didn't realize how much I'd liked having the notification light being invisible until it's turned on. There's a very visible cutout on the protector. 

Also, this glass must be softer than what the phone comes with. I started to notice some scratches.

* Inability to easily manage favorite locations or frequent locations
* Inconsistency in text input (some instances don't give you assistance in typing at all, some instances provide the very helpful arrow to pop a suggestion up into the text field for further editing)
* Volume adjustment bars stay up too long, obscuring content.
* Notification lights don't get turned off by a notification being swiped away.

I am a beta tester for a very popular ROM so it is not stock 4.0.4 but the exact same features from the ROM, just on a 4.0.4 base. I am using an Imoseyon LeanKernel, not the official 4.0.4 kernel. I have only been playing with it for a few hours so if I missed something, cut me some slack and feel free to comment with anything I missed. I came from a 4.0.3 ROM and barely used 4.0.2 at all. So there may be features from 4.0.3 that will appear new to those of you that have only run 4.0.2.
So far..it is great!! Worth the wait certainly.

What I have noticed....

* This is mostly bugfixes and things of that nature, no new features.
* The keyboard lag issue is fixed(yes!!)
* The screen turns on and phone unlocks faster(instantly)
* The ""recent apps"" button opens faster
* 4.0.4 MMS has some nice changes(could be my custom ROM) like custom vibration, timestamp and vibrate on call.
* New Google Play update(man that sounds weird), nothing revolutionary
* Battery life is great so far, certainly not worse than 4.0.3, likely better but I need to test more
* The infamous ""High Android OS"" in Battery options is fixed. Mine is reading at 3% right now.

I have been very very satisfied with mine, and don't really need anything else for maybe even an year. I'll see. Here's what I'm using:

1. SuperNova 2.0 ROM. Nothing wrong with it asides from a few audio issues such as safe headset volume set too low, etc. Nothing big, will be fixed in a day or two.

2. NovaKernel. Made by the devs of SuperNova. Smooth, battery efficient, and has all the customizations you'd expect including OTG while charging, something important to me.

3. OEM Extended battery. I'm not willing to trust 3rd party batteries, even though I'm 99% sure they're ok. Not willing to risk it though, I'll stick with Samsung ones. Gives me a bit of extra boost, and I can swap on the go if I want since the stock one is quite small I can fit it in my backpack or pocket, wherever. 

4. Nova launcher prime. The novas are purely coincidental, but hey, they work. I don't have a heavy theme, just a few icons on homescreen, clock, ""covers"" (better than what Action Launcher does, IMO), Google Now widget, music widget. Simple stuff. 

5. Misc stuff: I have about 60 user apps. No Greenify, I don't find any difference with that or not. Purely placebo, at least for me. I don't have any apps that run in the background anyways. I only have Tasker on, but no Tasker profiles, just using it as an advanced NFC profile system currently. Also most of my usage is in RedReader, Tapatalk, and G+, with occasional Feedly. Also Hangouts. Those are basically all the apps I use. 

With these, my phone is generally smooth. Sure, a few occasional stutters here and there, and not as smooth as my friend's HTC One, but still amazing. Almost as fast, if not as fast, as a Nexus 4 I'd say in daily usage. I'm also not a very heavy user so I'm extremely satisfied.

**Anyways**, One of the reasons I decided to get the GN on launch day instead of getting an iPhone was the ability to use keyboards like Swype or Swiftkey, as well as my wanting something fresh and not-Apple. Anyhow, I could not be happier with my decision. Apart from being one of the better looking phones on the market (definitely when it launched, it's still up there), having all the specs I wanted, that huge, gorgeous display (I was blessed/cursed with big fingers that don't play nice with small screens) and of course, Ice Cream Sandwich, I was in heaven. I picked up Swiftkey X and Swype (which I preferred) right away, and even tried to teach myself how to use 8pen ( an interesting, but rather short-lived venture), and every time I picked up my phone I was just blown away by the ease and fluidity of Swype, and how intelligent the damn thing was. I loved it. Recently, however, for one reason or another, I grew bored with Swype, or always using one hand, or I wanted to be able to easily type in the landscape orientation, I turned Swype off and went keyboard hunting. I realized during this hunt that the keyboard I was using, the stock ICS one, was performing beautifully. It never lagged behind my typing (I type fairly quickly), the prediction was good, and it looks great. What really blows me away though is the keyboard software's ability to deal with multitouch input. For example, sometimes, I'll get to the end of a text and press the send button, and realize that I've spelled something wrong and think ""shit!"" but I learned that I can simply reach out with my left thumb (right one's on the send button) and tap the offending word into correction through the predictive text. Now, this doesn't work 100 percent of the time, but when it does, I remember that I live in the future and carry a computer that's something like 600x more powerful than the computer that took humanity to the moon. That's a very cool feeling. It's yet another very cool, very subtle feature that makes me love Android so very much.

**TL;DR:** Had GN since launch day, loved it and all the keyboards, predominantly Swype, but have recently come to love the stock keyboard because of it's excellent capabilities and subtle features.",,False,,t5_2sypj,False,,,True,t3_uq0nz,http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/uq0nz/raving_about_the_galaxy_nexus_mostly_about_the/,

We took my 2yr old son for a swim in the pool. After about 15 minutes, I realized my nexus was in my back pocket of my trunks.   I freaked out, ripped it out of it's otterbox and pulled the battery.   

After letting it sit open for 24 hours, I started shaking it around, seeing if I could get any water to come out of it, nothing came out.  It refused to power on.   Figuring the warranty was out the window anyway, I pulled it apart.  They're very simply configured inside. I pulled out the main board, found white crust (chlorine i suppose) on the back.   I used rubbing alcohol and qtips on it until it looked clean, went over all the connections and anywhere else that was reachable.  Plugged it back in and it booted. Everything worked fine but LTE and earphone.  Stripped it again, cleaned it again,  made sure all the connectors were nice and tight, earphone worked.  The next morning, I was going to clean it again to see if i could get the LTE working and noticed that the LTE antenna was on the inside of the back of the case. (I had not recased it yet)  Put the case back on and bam, the only thing to this point is the down volume button is a little finicky. Probably just need another pull down, but that's not enough to warrant me pulling it apart again.

Since there's no toolkit available like there is for Windows users, I decided to throw something something together that's relatively easy to use that partially automates the process so people don't have to follow the [long, boring instructions](http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/1dk3nr/how_to_get_cyanogenmod_or_paranoid_android_on_my/c9r5i58).

Features:

* /sdcard partition backup/restore

* bootloader unlock/relock

* flash custom recovery image

* flash custom ROMs and Google Apps

Screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/iSlYVn0.png

Note: I have zero programming experience so the script is messy/disgusting/awful and has no error-handling capabilities so it may or may not break at random. This won't backup the contents of your /data partition, nor will it backup your text messages (see below for workarounds).

**Make sure to check that the contents of your /sdcard partition have been properly backed up to the computer before unlocking the bootloader**.

Download: [gnexkit_v01.zip](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20263/_public/junk/gnexkit_v01.zip) (sha1: 49effdf9deea4cf1742db3f8bce27b2a2970a2ac). The archive contains the binaries for both adb and fastboot so you don't have to install the full Android SDK.

Usage:

0. enable ""Android debugging"" in [settings] -&gt; developer options

1. unzip archive to the desktop

2. open Terminal.app (located in /Applications/Utilities)

3. type: cd ~/Desktop/gnexkit_v01/

4. type: chmod +x ./gnexkit.sh

5. type: ./gnexkit.sh

Feedback is welcome, especially from users running Android 4.2. I'm still running 4.1 because of Bluetooth problems with 4.2.

Known bugs:

* doesn't backup /data partition (""adb backup"" is too unreliable/buggy, currently investigating other methods)

* doesn't back up text messages, use [SMS Backup+](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zegoggles.smssync&amp;hl=en)

* doesn't automatically download files for your device (coming soon?)

* doesn't allow you to flash the stock factory image or individual radio images (also coming soon?)

Today I was experimenting with NFC and android beam but cannot get them to work at all. 

I know to hold the ""samsung"" logo on the back of the Gnex to the big Nexus logo on the back of the N7, that seems to be the ""right"" spot, and I can get the Gnex to vibrate and make the ""android beam"" screen come up (using pictures, browser, and youtube videos) but then a split second later it will stop being  in ""touch to beam mode"" but then vibrate again and have the ""touch to beam"" screen come on. Then it will just repeatedly do that and I don't get a chance to tap the screen. When I do, it starts shrinking but, you guessed it, it disappears as if lost the connection. Now on the N7, it does absolutely nothing. I don't know if it's supposed to do anything when on the ""receiving"" end, but trying to send something from the N7, nothing happens at all, but the Gnex (the receiver) will vibrate now and then, as if its constantly seeing the NFC for the first time

If I turn off NFC on the N7, the Gnex stops detecting it and wont vibrate when bringing them close together. So I don't know if it's hardware or software. Of course, I know no one or or any places that have those NFC checkout scanners that you can use Google Wallet on, so I don't know if the Gnex is an issue, or if it's the N7, or both. 

Anyway, below are the relevant software stuff. I haven't been able to find any related issues online. I do not get any error messages. I figure I could try reflashing the rom (if I knew how) and last resort RMA'ing both back to google. I appreciate the help.

To me, (I may be dead wrong), but it seems like the disadvantages really out-weigh the advantages when it comes to the screen's design. Of course this could just be nitpicking, but what is the real reason behind the curved screen?


Advantages:
* Apparently supposed to 'fit your face better' when speaking on the phone.


I don't exactly see how a very, very small curve (almost imperceptive at certain angles) is supposed to make your phone feel more natural. The curve is especially hard to notice if you put a case on. 


Disadvantages:
* From what I've heard because of the curved design Gorilla glass cannot be implemented on the Nexus.
* Screen protectors and cases may not fit perfectly, or may be harder to be designed. 
* Phone doesn't lay flat when facing down (though only a disadvantage based on opinion).",,False,,t5_2sypj,True,,,True,t3_q1x9r,http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/q1x9r/what_advantages_does_the_nexus_curved_screen/,

Everyone has their preferred keyboard, mine being [Swiftkey](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.touchtype.swiftkey).

However, picture the scene... you're walking down the street and want to quickly type a message or search, you just need one hand, the other is holding a bag, or if you're from the UK... an umbrella.

Anyway - for one hand typing you'd be better suited using a keyboard such as Swype (or the newly released 4.2 keyboard - [**link**](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1964663)).

It's relatively easy to implement a widget to switch the input method but I was looking for a more elegant, sleek solution.

I thought I'd share it with /r/Android :

**http://i.imgur.com/Q04lM.png**


***What you'll need:***

* [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm)
* [Secure Settings](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intangibleobject.securesettings.plugin)
* A rooted phone
* A ROM that supports lock screen editing e.g. [CM10](http://www.cyanogenmod.org/) or [WidgetLocker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.widgetlocker)

	
Pictural guide: **http://imgur.com/a/CnUv7#0**


***The process:***

	1) Install Tasker and Secure Settings
	2) Create a new profile on Tasker: event &gt; display &gt; display off
	3) For the context of the profile, select: plugin &gt; Secure Settings &gt; Input Method &gt; Select your 'primary keyboard'
	
    At this point it may ask you to install the Secure Settings helper, select yes.

	The purpose of this profile and task is to 'reset' your keyboard each time the screen is locked.
	
	Now to assign your 1-handed keyboard!
	
	4) Settings &gt; lock screen &gt; slider shortcuts &gt; drag to a position &gt; select 'Task Cut'
	5) Tasker should open up and create a new task, in the same way you did before, this time selecting your other keyboard choice
	6) Assign a nice icon. 

I made this 'S', taken from the Swype logo which fits in nicely with the other icons -  [**link**](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1066570/swype-s-white-small.png?dl=1)
	
	Done!

Just disassembled &amp; cleaned my waterlogged GNEX...and it works!,AugmentedFourth,19,3,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/v8c3o/wow_just_disassembled_cleaned_my_waterlogged/,"So I accidentally soaked my GNEX this past weekend while working on my sprinkler system. I didn't catch it before it had a chance to short out and power-down. So I did the standard remove-battery, throw in Tupperware with rice/desiccant for 24hrs routine. 

The next day I was able to boot, connect to wifi &amp; LTE...pretty much everything *except* 3G; phone calls, text or data. So back to the drawing board. BTW, I'm a Verizon customer with no phone insurance, still on contract and an electrical engineer. So there was no way I was gonna just lie down and accept the idea of buying a brand-new device off-contract without a fight.

So anyway...I was completely surprised and relieved by how easy it was to disassemble the Nexus. Way to go Samsung! Seriously, the layout of the connectors, placement of flex-circuits and snap-on shielding/heatsinking (usually stuff like this is cobbled together with adhesive) made the device so much easier to work with compared to other consumer tech I've torn apart over the years.

In the end I was able to thoroughly clean all of the areas with water intrusion under a microscope using isopropyl. I was positive that I had smoked parts because there was one section that had some minor burn marks in addition to the deposits from the water. But so far everything looks back online! I wish they sold some kind of conformal coating in a spray can that you could put on aftermarket...I would love to have that added bit of protection.

Just in case I'm getting ahead of myself and I do have a failure in the next few days, does anyone have experience with replacement smart-phones on Verizon. If you don't have warranty are you stuck buying a full price one? If you get a new phone now, do they use it to bump you out of unlimited data? (Hopefully this is a moot point!)

I tried out custom kernels not too much later, most recently wobbling between LeanKernel and Franco via Franco's app.

One thing that kept frustrating me about the phone for the last couple months is how sometimes it would just inexplicably get laggy and slow as hell again to the point where I would reboot it. Isn't this why I bought a new phone to replace my G2?

Anyways, I follow Ricardo Cerqueira on G+ and read one of his posts awhile back mocking kernel wizards' use of ridiculously-named I/O schedulers, screen off limits, etc in order to try to stretch battery life and improve performance. It kind of stuck in the back of my head.

Long story short, I stuck with the stock CM kernel the last few times I flashed from their delta app, but today I completely uninstalled Franco's app so it wouldn't muddy around with any settings at all.

Results? My phone is responsive all the damn day. Doesn't matter what I've done. Text input doesn't lag up on me by half a dozen words, Chrome Beta loads pages retarded fast - it's what I paid for. And my battery life is still about the same.

Think about it - CM's team knows what they're doing. If Franco's or Imoseyon's or whomever's ideas were any good, why aren't they incorporating them into source? It took me awhile to remember these aren't some guys wanking zipaligns and themes into an xda thread.

If you're running CM and a non-CM kernel and helper app, try uninstalling the app and leaving the kernel alone the next time you update a delta.

PGM Nexus I can't do without. Also, AMOLED!

I can get one for $290 new from a store at the local mall here, and the Nexus 4 is 500-600 from what I can tell on Craigslist, which I think is way too much for a replacement.

I can't get swype to work anymore. I updated to 4.1.2 yesterday and swype worked fine. I just received an update to swype this afternoon and the keyboard cannot be set as default. Every time I set it as default in settings it is replaced by the android keyboard as default. 

When I'm in an app such as gmail, long pressing spacebar and switching to swype lets the keyboard pop up. Unfortunately, it closes and is replaced by the stock android keyboard about a second later.

I read somewhere that deleting or moving the latin IME apk and odex files helps but I do not have root access to make the changes.

Has anyone else had this problem? Does anyone have a solution?

clear data, cache and force stop the swype .apk

Hi all, I was wondering what to do about a problem I'm having with Samsung not honoring a warranty repair on my GN. I am suffering from the [infamous USB charging issue](http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=23789) (specifically, continual toggling of the charge status etc...). I sent the phone (which I bought sim-free, no carrier involved) in for repair, and Samsung have replied saying that the warranty has been invalidated due to water damage. They're happy to perform the repair for a fee of ~£50.

Now, people are going to have to take my word for this, but my phone has not had A SINGLE DROP of water anywhere near it. I am the most anal person I know about looking after my phones, so much so that both my GN and my old Nexus One are still 'mint' condition. I keep the GN in a neoprene sleeve, and refuse to use it whenever it is raining. Therefore, whatever they are claiming as water damage is in fact due to using the phone in normal atmospheric conditions only.

I asked for proof of the water damage (along with proof that it is indeed *my* phone), to which they replied by sending me [this photo](http://imgur.com/nqiI3). The photo is a highly magnified view of a metallic object, with a slight tinge of discoloration. However, no scale is provided. My job is an electrical engineer for the design of submersible ROVs, so I have seen my fair share of water damaged objects. I believe that the image does not constitute sufficient evidence that water damage has occurred, and that any discoloration caused is due to use within normal atmospheric conditions.

I have tried talking to a representative on the phone for hours, and they are adamant that water damage has occurred. Specifically, if the service center claim there's water damage, then there's water damage. I asked whether there is anyway for me to prove otherwise (which is almost impossible, see [Evidence of absence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_absence)), and was told to get an independent review of the phone. However, doing so would void my warranty.

I was also told that the damage may not have been caused by me, and could have already been present when I bought the phone. I was then informed that I should have returned the phone immediately. However, there is absolutely **no way** I could find the tainting which they have supposedly identified, and it would be unreasonable for any customer to perform this check. Overall, it seems the repair center is playing the 'water damage' card, which in this case has not happened. Overall, my experience with representatives has been awful, with all sorts of wild explanations and reasons being thrown around.

I was wondering if anyone had any ideas on how to progress with this matter? At the moment my only realistic option seems to be to pay the £50 and get the phone repaired. This would be a travesty of justice in my eyes, especially as how much effort I put in to caring for my phone. If Samsung honestly think this is acceptable, then I will refuse to buy any further products from them. Unfortunately, Samsung are such a giant compared to me, that I feel powerless to do anything else...

Mediaserver and wifi wakelocks.,HittingSmoke,16,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/t1ypo/a_couple_of_battery_tips_mediaserver_and_wifi/,"The first one comes from [this thread](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=980575) over at XDA.

If Mediaserver is consistently at the top of your battery usage list while you're not using A2DP BT audio, then you've got a bit of a problem.  On my stock Sprint G Nexus it was pinned just under Screen at a constant 10-25% battery usage.

The solution was a heavy use of .nomedia files stopped throughout the internal storage. I've littered my internal storage with .nomedia files save for my pictures, camera and videos folder. If you go into your Gallery or Music app and see folders that don't belong there, find them and drop .nomedia files in those folders. It will keep the OS from monitoring them and sucking up power. This trick dropped Mediaserver from a constant 10-25% battery usage down to 3-5% while idle. It pops up to about 30% while listening to podcasts on my bluetooth headset but promptly drops back down after I'm done.

The second pertains to wifi wakelocks. If you're using a dynamic IP address at home, work or another place you're regularly connected to wifi chances are it's causing a huge battery drain by preventing the phone from going into deep sleep. If you have access to your router settings, just assign the MAC address for your phone a static IP and adjust the advanced network settings on the phone to use a static IP. This trick knocked my most common wakelock off the list and lets my phone sleep much more often when at home.

I did not take note of what radio I was using at the time, (pretty sure it was the DVKK6 or the XXKK6).
I am using a GSM Samsung Galaxy Nexus phone.   
I live in Australia.   
When my phone is 100% charged and left on standby/idle it takes almost 2.5 hours to lose 1%.      

**4.0.4 Update** I manually flashed to 4.0.4 IMM76D (the OTA update didn't come for me even when using the clearing cache from google services framework trick MANY times) using the fastboot commands from [this site](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1391881). I also flashed the radio that came with the zip file(XXLA02). I then noticed that my battery lost 1% about every hour.   
I was not a happy camper. I've heard praise about how the 4.0.4 update improves battery performance, but it seemed to cut mine by HALF. So I tried flashing to a different radio (XXKK6).   
**My battery now loses 1% every 5 hours on standby/idle.**   
   
**Update:** I just received an OTA update. My phone is now the 4.0.4 IMM76I build. Am hoping that this doesn't affect my battery in a negative way.   
   
**Update 2**  My phone now loses 1% every 3 hours while on standby.

In some instances, this is not enough power to keep the phone charged (i.e. running navigation, music, etc). 

My question is this: I have a USB car adapter that is rated to output up to 2A, but because my phone recognizes it as USB Power, it only pulls 0.5A. Is it possible to force my phone to pull a full 1A to stay charged while running Navigation, Music, Bluetooth, etc?

As a self-proclaimed newb, though, I'm not going to be digging deep into the inner workings of the phone or messing with anything advanced, I just want a few little tweaks the stock experience doesn't give me.

I've also heard of people rooting but keeping stock OS. What's the benefit, what's the security risk? I've heard on malware apps that've been taken off the market because they secretly root your phone and then run themselves as a backround process. Am I just opening myself up to being effed by all that as a rooted newb?

And then there's the time commitment of figuring all this out that kind of offsets any benefit to the little tweaks I'd enjoy having.

Here's my review.,BigRick90,15,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/yalt5/just_applied_the_xgear_fantom_tempered_glass/,"Here is [the product](http://www.xgearlive.com/products/android/samsung/fantom)  
  
* Application: very easy, no bubbles to get rid of like with other screen protectors (since it's rigid).  
  
* Look: You do get a sense of the thickness of the product, not when looking at the phone normally, but when looking at the screen, you can definitely see a difference. Especially if comparing it side by side to a GNex without it. You can also see some grid-dots on the product when the screen is off.  
  
*  Use: I have been seeing decreased sensitivity to touches near the bottom of the screen (aka, the back, home, and switch apps buttons). Definitely more touches that aren't recognized. Also, it seems to mess with the ambient light sensor on the phone, when it's on, it reads the ambient light as darker and so it dims the screen more than it should.
  
* Cleaning: It's advertised as ""easier to clean"" than the stock screen and I agree. A quick wipe on the shorts/pants seems to get rid of most fingerprints and grime.  
  
*  Overall: Not totally thrilled with the product. I am getting used to the drawbacks and I could live with them, however, if any scratches start to show up, I taking this thing off.

I was concerned that I might have gotten moisture into the device from applying a wet screen protector, so I used a hair dryer and put the phone in rice for a couple hours... but the problem persists.  I opened up the device to inspect the circuitry and there doesn't appear to be any obvious injury to the internals.  So this is where there the strange part comes in....

The really bizarre part is that the button seems to work 100% of the time in certain contextual situations.  For example, the power button always works while navigating within the bootloader.  Upon restarting the device however, the power button will only work once before losing it's function.  After a few minutes and waking the device with a usb cable, the power button will often work once more before refusing to function again.  

Since this began to sound like a software issue, I've restored the device to stock and even locked the bootloader.  Yet after these efforts, the power button is still acting strangely.

I'll be sending the Galaxy Nexus in for warranty repairs on Monday, because I'd like to have the USB port looked at and the volume buttons adjusted as well, but I was curious if anyone else has had this problem.

I'm hoping that if there are a couple issues with my device, they might just give me a refurbished model... as I have a tiny crack on the screen above the camera :p",,False,,t5_2sypj,1339890789.0,,,True,t3_v5ngu,http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/v5ngu/strange_power_button_issue/,

**UPDATE**  I cancelled my entire order.  They corrected the information about the navigation mount on their website based on our earlier conversation and emailed to inform me of the correction.  I replied and cancelled my entire order, based on avrus's comment below.  Obviously, the model numbers do not match.

For one item, they have the wrong description and the right picture.  For another, they have the wrong picture but the right description.  I know I'm never doing business with them again.

They're riding that fine line between ignorance and deceit, and I fell for it.  I hope I was the only one, and I apologize to anyone who ordered from them based on my earlier post. :(

**tl;dr**  They're selling the same worthless Vehicle Navigation Mount as Verizon **EDIT** and apparently the non-3-pin charging, portrait HDMI dock, rather than the one pictured on their site.

What follows is a transcript of my chat conversation with Fommy customer support.

    Hello mortodestructo

1:09:00 PM: mortodestructo:
    Hi there.

1:09:26 PM: mortodestructo:
    I have a few quick questions about items in my order.

1:09:50 PM: Agent 1:
    let me check this for you

1:10:25 PM: mortodestructo:
    First off, my ship date has been pushed back twice now.

1:10:51 PM: mortodestructo:
    I notice several discrepancies now, with each item, that I did not notice at the time I placed my order.

1:12:03 PM: Agent 1:
    We are expecting the items in stock by tomorrow

1:12:14 PM: mortodestructo:
    First off, the Samsung® (OEM) Multimedia Desktop Dock that is pictured at http://www.fommy.com/view-full-page.php?skuno=93055 seems to be a landscape-style dock.

1:12:24 PM: Agent 1:
    we will ship your order by tomorrow

1:12:51 PM: mortodestructo:
    I would like to verify that I am receiving the items I'm expecting before the order ships, if that's okay.

1:13:29 PM: mortodestructo:
    The description of the dock, however, indicates that it may be the portrait-style dock.

1:13:54 PM: mortodestructo:
    ""The right side of the cradle features an HDMI female port"" - this part in particular.

1:14:13 PM: mortodestructo:
    The landscape-style dock does not feature an HDMI port.

1:14:34 PM: mortodestructo:
    I pre-ordered the item expecting the item pictured on the web page above.

1:15:24 PM: mortodestructo:
    Can you tell me with any certainty whether this dock is actually the landscape-style dock?  I do not wish to purchase the portrait-style one.

1:15:45 PM: Agent 1:
    Please wait I am checking

1:17:53 PM: Agent 1:
    This is an OEM product from Samsung

1:18:04 PM: Agent 1:
    &amp; it will be exactly as pictured on our website

1:18:52 PM: mortodestructo:
    I assume the same answer will apply to my next question about the Samsung® (OEM) Vehicle Navigation Mount.

1:19:30 PM: Agent 1:
    yes

1:20:44 PM: mortodestructo:
    Why are there discrepancies between the items pictured and the product descriptions?

1:21:12 PM: mortodestructo:
    This is very confusing.

1:21:41 PM: Agent 1:
    which line in the product desc is wrong, please let me know

1:23:07 PM: mortodestructo:
    The HDMI line on the Multimedia Dock.

1:23:31 PM: mortodestructo:
    Also, the item pictured for the Vehicle Navigation Mount is the same as the one Verizon Wireless sells.

1:24:11 PM: mortodestructo:
    Verizon Wireless' model does not charge the device or route audio.

1:24:49 PM: Agent 1:
    can you please show me that link

1:24:58 PM: mortodestructo:
    http://www.fommy.com/view-full-page.php?skuno=93056

1:25:21 PM: Agent 1:
    not this one

1:25:28 PM: Agent 1:
    the verizon one

1:26:20 PM: mortodestructo:
    http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store/accessory?&amp;action=accessoryDetails&amp;accessoryId=49882

1:26:31 PM: Agent 1:
    okay! let me see please

1:26:51 PM: mortodestructo:
    When you're done, compare to the item featured on http://www.expansys-usa.com/samsung-google-galaxy-nexus-vehicle-mount-225505/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=shopping&amp;utm_campaign=base

1:27:08 PM: mortodestructo:
    It has a USB port and audio out jack pictured on the base of the device.

1:27:57 PM: Agent 1:
    let me see please

1:31:16 PM: mortodestructo:
    Now, I'm not trusting Expansys to be correct on everything, either.  However, I notice that on their website, the Multimedia Dock is the portrait-style model (http://www.expansys-usa.com/samsung-google-galaxy-nexus-multimedia-dock-225460/) and the landscape-style model is called the Desk Stand (http://www.expansys-usa.com/samsung-google-galaxy-nexus-desk-stand-226695/).

1:31:33 PM: mortodestructo:
    This is what has me concerned.

1:32:08 PM: mortodestructo:
    I'm afraid that I'm purchasing an item I already have (the same navigation mount that Verizon sells) and an item I don't want (the portrait-style Multimedia Dock).

1:32:42 PM: Agent 1:
    let me see pleaseI am still in process fo checking it

1:32:55 PM: Agent 1:
    let me see pleaseI am still in process *of checking it

1:32:57 PM: mortodestructo:

1:33:21 PM: mortodestructo:
    *i am stepping away from my desk for approximately 30 seconds.  i'll be right back.

1:34:05 PM: Agent 1:
    If you see the verizon one, its exactly same as our one. cannot say about the expansys one

1:34:46 PM: mortodestructo:
    That's what I was afraid of.  Can you take that off my order and process a refund of that portion of the order?

1:35:20 PM: Agent 1:
    one minute please

1:35:37 PM: Agent 1:
    okay! we are cancelling your order

1:36:04 PM: mortodestructo:
    Also, do you still say that the Multimedia Dock that you will be shipping is exactly as pictured at http://www.expansys-usa.com/samsung-google-galaxy-nexus-desk-stand-226695/?

1:36:53 PM: Agent 1:
    we can say about the product which is shown on our website

1:36:57 PM: Agent 1:
    not about any other

1:37:33 PM: mortodestructo:
    They appear to be exactly the same.  I just wanted to confirm that it is not this item: http://www.expansys-usa.com/samsung-google-galaxy-nexus-multimedia-dock-225460/

1:38:15 PM: Agent 1:
    Again I am saying mortodestructo, it will be exactly as pictured on our website

1:38:26 PM: Agent 1:
    So, please let me know your choice

1:38:51 PM: mortodestructo:
    Excellent.

1:38:55 PM: mortodestructo:
    I want this:  http://www.fommy.com/view-full-page.php?skuno=93055

1:39:20 PM: mortodestructo:
    I already own this, so cancel this part of the order:  http://www.fommy.com/view-full-page.php?skuno=93056

1:39:40 PM: Agent 1:
    one min please

1:40:14 PM: Agent 1:
    SKU 93055 is costlier than SKU 93056

1:40:26 PM: mortodestructo:
    I am aware of this.

1:41:24 PM: Agent 1:
    okay! i have a suggestion here - how about we cancel your present order for 93055 &amp; refund on it

1:41:38 PM: Agent 1:
    &amp; after the arrival of product you can check your query with us

1:41:51 PM: Agent 1:
    thus you will be getting the correct product

1:42:11 PM: Agent 1:
    please let me know your opinion

1:42:34 PM: mortodestructo:
    I would like to cancel the order for 93056.

1:42:40 PM: Agent 1:
    ok

1:42:49 PM: mortodestructo:
    I still want 93055 as long as it is as pictured on your website.

1:44:02 PM: Agent 1:
    so, you will be re-ordering for 93055 after its arrival in stock...or else ?

1:44:42 PM: mortodestructo:
    Did you cancel my order for 93055?

1:44:51 PM: Agent 1:
    no

1:44:53 PM: Agent 1:
    hey

1:44:54 PM: mortodestructo:
    Oh, good.

1:45:12 PM: Agent 1:
    I think we are going to receive both 93055 &amp; 93056 by today

1:45:20 PM: Agent 1:
    in next few hrs

1:45:40 PM: Agent 1:
    So, its better for you to please wait fr few more hrs

1:45:54 PM: Agent 1:
    you can contact us after 1 hr

1:46:32 PM: mortodestructo:
    Do you have a preferred method that I contact you?  An exact time, maybe?

1:46:57 PM: Agent 1:
    after 1 hr

1:47:03 PM: Agent 1:
    93056 - we have recd. it

1:47:40 PM: Agent 1:
    can you please repeat your query regarding 93056

1:47:41 PM: Agent 1:
    ?

1:47:42 PM: mortodestructo:
    Really?  Does it have the USB &amp; Audio ports on the side of the base?

1:47:50 PM: Agent 1:
    ok let me see

1:47:59 PM: Agent 1:
    please be online with me

1:48:19 PM: Agent 1:

1:48:49 PM: Agent 1:
    okay

1:51:23 PM: mortodestructo:
    The USB &amp; Audio ports are visible on the base of the mount, as pictured here: http://i2.expansys.com/img/b/225505/samsung-google-galaxy-nexus-vehicle-mount.jpg

1:51:26 PM: mortodestructo:
    If that helps.

1:51:57 PM: Agent 1:
    ok

1:52:00 PM: Agent 1:
    1 min please

1:52:47 PM: Agent 1:
    I am in process of checking it

1:54:39 PM: Agent 1:
    ok I am back

1:54:51 PM: Agent 1:
    No it does not have these as image sent
    
     this is the product exactly - 
     http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/cell-phones-accessories/ECS-K1F8BEGSTA

1:54:57 PM: Agent 1:
    you still have access to charging and audio on phone

1:55:13 PM: mortodestructo:
    On phone, but not on the dock itself.

1:55:38 PM: mortodestructo:
    I see.  Thank you, but cancel my order for 93056.

1:55:54 PM: mortodestructo:
    Are you still expecting 93055 today?

1:56:16 PM: Agent 1:
    yes! but after 1 hr we can expect it

According to Diztronic's main page they're stopping Rev. 3 Nexus case orders for the next 24 hours to prepare for CES.  Amazon will still work though.  But you should probably order direct, since although it's a dollar cheaper on Amazon, Amazon is charging shipping which is nearly $2.85, making it more expensive.  Shipping is free if you order direct.  

I'd assume there's a window between 24 hours from now and Friday (when they go to CES for over a week and won't be accepting orders on their site) when you should be able to order Rev. 3's again directly from their site.

I'm currently running CM 10.1 RC2 and it works fine, but there have been plenty of newer versions and I wanted to update.  The issue is that anytime I try to update to a new one, I repeatedly get the error message ""unfortunately gapps has unexpectedly stopped working.""   If I close the message, a new one instantly pops up to take its place, essentially rendering my phone useless.  The only way to stop this is to slowly navigate to ROM manager in between closures of that error message and restore my recovery.

I've updated my phone's ROM many times in the past with no issues, so what have I been doing wrong these past few times?  I use ROM manager to download and install my ROMs.  Any one have any ideas?",,False,,t5_2sypj,False,,,True,t3_1fxu6g,http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/1fxu6g/gapps_has_unexpectedly_stopped_working/,

It's most evident in the new All Access music, but anytime I start off a streaming service in a 4G area and then cross over into a 3G area and then back to 4G, my service stays at 3G unless I either completely exit the stream or pause and manually change preferred radio mode to CDMA only and then back to LTE/CDMA.

I just wanted to see if anyone else has run into this issue, and if so, have you been able to find a better solution?",,False,,t5_2sypj,False,,,True,t3_1f57s7,http://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNexus/comments/1f57s7/radio_bug/,
