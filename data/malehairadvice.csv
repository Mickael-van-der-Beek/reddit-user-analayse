I know it might be an unpopular opinion around here, but I think we need to stop censoring our faces. I get it, that we are trying to protect our privacy, but you won't get the best results by censoring. 

For one, every face is unique and different, and hair should be meant to compliment our face. Therefore, we can't judge how well your new haircut looks without seeing your face. You very well may indeed have a nice haircut, but it does no good if it doesn't compliment your facial features.

I know I am nobody to speak, but just an opinion that I wish could catch on around here.

Thanks

First of you need to find one of those really fancy drop in ""hairstylist""-studios(I know it's sounds expensive but wait i will explain later). Then one day when buisness is low go down there and look for the absolutely hottest hairstylist around and schedule an appointment.

the reason why you should go to one of these fancy smacy ""hairstylists"" is because they know exactly which haircut who works with your features and conditions. Anyway, when she/he asks questions like ""do you use products?"" answer completely honest because then she/he will give you a haircut which will suit your features and needs perfectly.

When you're done and pleased with your haircut take a shit load of pictures of it from all possible angles. Then in the future you can go the the cheapest and shittiest place you want and show them all the pictures of your hair and they will reassemble your haircut once more.

1345281171.0,70,self.malehairadvice,yf7x3,The Thorough Guide to Hairstyling: Part 2: Types of Products,Snake_N_Bake,92,22,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/yf7x3/the_thorough_guide_to_hairstyling_part_2_types_of/,"**Overview of product types and their (typical) hold, shine, and texture properties.**

* **Gel**: High hold, high shine, dry/hard texture. Will lock your hair in place once it dries, giving a very firm-holding wet look. Your hair, however, will be rather on the brittle-feeling side, kind of crunchy, even with high-quality gels. Works well for very sleek and controlled looks, but I personally find the texture problematic, especially for my fine strands of hair. Can also be brushed or combed out to maintain the hold without the hard look, but I’ve had limited success with this myself. **Glue** is a stronger variant of gel, often used for spiking or extreme styles such as Mohawks, and offers a ridiculously, superbly strong hold, and oftentimes with less shine than gel (though sometimes even more, always check the label). Worth exploring if you’re a big fan of very vertical hairstyles, or other sorts of alternative, extreme hairstyles.

* **Old-Style Pomade**: High to super-high hold, medium to high shine, greasy, beeswaxy texture but remains somewhat pliable. Old-style Pomades includes stuff like Murray’s, Mr. Ducktail, and about a million others. There’s really a whole culture around all the different kinds, and each offers something a little bit different, so the typical traits of a pomade can vary enormously, and some even offer a matte finish. Generally, though, they are excellent for very sleek, stylish looks, and offer a bit more malleability throughout the day than a gel, which will lose many of its properties if you rough it up. Also allows for the creation of some very striking styles, like pompadours and rockabilly styles. Very hard to wash out, however, and can stay in your hair for days or weeks at a time depending on the brand you use. I want to re-emphasize, though, that there is a ridiculous amount of variety in these products. If you wish to delve further into pomade, and especially the greaser/rockabilly culture surrounding it, I’d recommend [The Rebel Rouser’s blog](http://therebelrouser.wordpress.com/pomade-reviews/) for the most comprehensive source of information and some highly detailed product reviews and some solid styling lessons.

* **New Pomade**: High shine, Low-medium hold, slightly greasy feel with some smoothness. These are the pomades marketed by very modern brands like American Crew, Axe, Hanz De Fuko, etc., and are pretty much universally water-based and water-soluble. These are meant to emulate the malleable-texture and high-shine properties of traditional pomades, but without the at times overwhelming greasiness and the tendency to be impossible to wash out. They lose something in the process, however, and often end up providing a much lower level of hold, and are therefore not really suitable for the rockabilly styles of traditional pomades. What they are useful for is adding shine to a look that doesn’t need much hold at all, or cocktailing with other products to produce some interesting effects.

* **Cream**: Medium hold and Shine, smooth and controlled but malleable and light texture. Typically a good ‘beginner’ styling product because it strikes a good balance between messy looks and highly-styled looks, creams tend to be vastly underrated, largely because it might seem like they aren’t doing anything depending on the amount you use and your hair type. And for certain very product-resistant hairtypes, creams can indeed end up ineffective, or you’ll end up having to use tons to have any effect. For the hair types that benefit from a cream, though, you can expect to add thickness, a smooth and fairly natural texture, a healthy-looking shine, and some level of control. They also provide a good amount of moisture retention, making them excellent for allowing curly and wavy hair-types to do their thing. I also personally find that creams distribute into and are absorbed by my hair much more easily than almost any other product, making them good for quick styling and for just playing around with the style throughout the day.

* **Wax**: High hold, low shine or matte finish, stiffer texture but still considerably more malleable than a gel, and often with a dry feel. Generally used to achieve styles with a dry look and fairly natural texture but a more styled shape. Offers a lot of control while remaining adjustable throughout the day. Only real issue is that some waxes can be very hard and difficult to evenly distribute on your hands and into  your hair, so if you plan to use wax be extra careful that you’ve emulsified it on your hands properly before putting it in your hair. The last thing worth noting is that waxes also come in stick form, which allows you to apply it to your hair much like using a glue stick. I don’t really have much experience with these, and don’t really intend to gain any more at the moment, but their primary use is in applying wax to long hairstyles more easily.

* **Hairspray**: Typically high hold, variable shine, slightly crunchy texture. Hairspray is pretty much a tool for sealing a hairstyle that’s already done, kind of like a lacquer for your hair. In my experience it offers relatively little in the way of styling versatility in shorter hair (which is most men’s hair), and I personally do not have experience using it in longer hair. Mostly useful for when you’re using something like a light cream and you want to maintain the natural look the cream provides while making the hairstyle more durable and long-lasting.

* **Mousse**: Variable shine but typically low, low-medium hold, lots of volume and a fairly soft texture (once it’s dried and you’ve combed it through). This is primarily what I would refer to as a prepping tool, something you add to your hair while it’s wet to enhance its basic qualities without actually styling it. A typical way to use mouse is to get some in your hands and then rub it into your wet hair and scalp, making sure to apply it evenly to the roots and strands of your hair, then blow-drying to achieve a look with a lot of volume but otherwise natural properties. Better for long hair than short hair, but useful in both.

* **Powder**: An interesting little oddity in the hairstyling world, powder typically does not offer typically offer any hold or shine, but rather works to drastically increase the volume and lift of your hair, allowing you to achieve natural-looking vertical styles without the hardness or locked-in nature of a gel or glue. Very good as a prepping product to add some character and size to your hair before styling with other products, and a lot of fun to play around with.

* **Grooming Spray, Tonic, Serum**: Essentially, any liquid product you put into your hair that is not traditional hairspray. These are typically used like leave-in conditioners, and will provide moisture, a small bit of healthy shine, protection when blow-drying or straightening, and lubrication for helping heavier styling products to adhere evenly. They can also work very well on their own for natural looks. A good example, since this category is a bit vaguer, is Bumble and Bumble’s Prep, which works as described above. Some of these products do offer more hold and shine, however, or may be specifically formulated to bring out the natural qualities of curly hair, so be sure to read the description as well as some reviews so as to be sure of what exactly you’ll be getting.

* **Clay**: Basically, as far as product performance is concerned, clay is a marketing synonym for wax. Seriously, that’s about it. Yes, it often does include actual clay, but it performs just like a wax in nine cases out of ten. It’s typically a term to denote wax-type products which are even higher hold and will provide a low-medium shine rather than a matte finish, but this is not always the case, so do your research before buying. These can be very, very hard and dry, and depending on your hair type can be very difficult to work into your hair. There are some excellent products labeled ‘clay’, however, so it’s worth your consideration if you want to basically take a waxed look and make it even firmer and more controlled.

* **Mud**: Same deal as ‘clay’ in terms of naming, only with a far more meaningless buzzword. Check out this bit from a description of Sebastian Molding Mud: “Fiber-fused mud molds uncombed-looking style for drop-dead groovy locks”. Absolutely, 100% meaningless drivel that tells you nothing about what this product will actually do for your hair. That’s not to say that these products won’t be high quality or worth using, and I can’t evaluate the Sebastian product because I haven’t used it, but you really have no idea what you’re getting in terms of hold, shine, or texture, and so it’s a big gamble for you as a consumer. If you’re willing to risk it, go ahead, as long as you don’t mind being surprised. Sometimes you’ll get lucky, however, and find a product like Alterna’s Hemp Organics Styling Mud, which I have not personally used, but which is described in mostly practical and useful detail on their website. And all that in spite of a ridiculously hippie-friendly name that seems designed to be sold to, well, hippies. Sometimes it’s nice to be surprised.

* **Anything Else**: If you come across any other products that don’t have one of these names, chances are they are either very unique (and I’d like to hear about them!) or they actually are one of these products, but that fact is buried under marketing. If you have questions about a specific product I have not yet reviewed, let me know and I’ll try to find out what I can about its actual properties, and I may even try it out myself if it sounds interesting enough. Good stuff!

- Bioton tablets to help hair growth
- rubbing castor oil on my eye brows
- making sure to eat well taking multivitamins

**Introduction and my philosophy**

This thread is meant to be a general introduction to hair products and styling, based on my own personal experience, and is an attempt to answer many of the questions I had when I first started out styling my hair, and which I see pop-up on this reddit regularly. I will also review, and in some cases recommend, the products that I have used, as well as talk about the way each product affects my own hair type (Fine strands, slightly curly with some poofiness, and in great abundance). 

I’ll also talk briefly about my overall way of thinking about styling, which may or may not be helpful and/or interesting, but I feel is worth putting out there for those who might gain from it. My observation is that, when it comes to styling their hair, the first thing most men do is look at celebrities, and decide whose hair they’d like to imitate, and I feel like that’s a fundamentally flawed way of going about styling. Styling is about taking an honest look at yourself and your own hair, figuring out what will actually work for you, and what your hair is capable of. 

It’s about exploration, building up a confidence with yourself and what you’ve been given, and not getting frustrated at not having what others have. You can always look at models and celebrities for inspiration and basic techniques, but do try to not get dead-set on a single specific style you simply may never be able to pull off. It won’t help you look better, it won’t do your confidence any good, and it’s just no fun. :) Which leads me to…
	
What I will not do in this guide:

* Talk about shampoo and conditioner, because this is something which is very different for everybody, and I can’t give you any better advice than you can give yourself.

* Tell you how you can achieve a Ryan Gosling or David Beckham or any other celebrity’s hairstyle, as that depends too much on your own hair-type for me to tell you how to do it. Go see a stylist and figure out if your hair type will even work for it, first things first.

* Review products by request or allow products to be sent to me for review, unless you are somehow the inventor of a line of products. If someone recommends a product and I do some research and become curious, I will try it and eventually probably review it, but this will remain my choice.

What I might do in this thread later on:

* Post pictures of my hair if people are really, really curious, but otherwise, I don’t think that’s the point of this thread. This is about teaching you the basics so that you can play around with your own hair and explore what works for you. And besides, right now I’m in the process of growing my hair out after an unfortunately disastrous cut, so it’s not really at its best. :P

* Post videos of how I apply various products, if I feel there is a serious need for a more visual demonstration of how to use different products. But really, it’s usually pretty simple, and there is already an abundance of hair styling videos on Youtube.

* Try out a new type of product (but not a specific brand) if I have somehow omitted what enough people feel is a significant category.

* Give you specific product recommendations based on what you’re looking for. I’d rather not get in the habit of doing this, since I hope to put enough information in the main guide to give you all you need to know, but if you’re totally stumped on what kind of product would fit your needs you can try asking me.

**What Products Actually DO (it’s all about Hold, Shine, and Texture)**

Very briefly, I’ll outline the general varieties of products available, what they’re typically used to achieve.

First, though, it’s important to understand that all the different names products come with is often, simply put, marketing. Hanz de Fuko is guilty of this with product names like Quicksand and Spongewax, bumble and bumble does it with their sumotech, and American Crew gets into it with their Fiber, their molding clay, grooming vs forming creams, etc., and this overblown marketing jargon is a big reason why getting into hair products can be so intimidating, since you have no idea what does what, exactly.

When it comes to products, there are really only three things you need to know about them, two of which are easy enough to figure out before you buy: 

* **Hold**:

Quite simply the ability of the product to hold hair in a certain configuration. Medium hold is generally for looser, more casual styles, and allows more movement of the hair in a natural way. High hold is generally for more elaborate styles that you need to retain their shape for longer periods of time, and can easily cause your hair to give the impression of being over-styled if you’re not careful. It’s worth nothing, however, that these statements of hold are not strictly enforced, and **your mileage will absolutely vary**, especially from one line’s products to the next. What for some companies is high hold can sometimes be more like a high-medium, or even a flat-out medium, for other brands, so there will be variation within the categories. Also, there is generally no low-hold, at least not on the brands own labeling. Low-hold hair-product isn’t something most consumers will choose to buy, although there are many products that I personally think fit that description, and benefit from their looser hold. But, more on that later.

	
* **Shine**: 

This aspect has a wider range than hold, coming in low, medium, and high varieties. High shine is your basic gel or old-style pomade, Mad Men (or in some unfortunate cases, Jersey Shore) hair, very sleek and styled. This can be a very striking look, but if you can’t pull it off your hair will come off as over-styled, and you WILL look silly at best, sleazy at worst, so be cautious about high-shine products. That’s not to say they have no place, as they often cocktail well with other products (more on that later) or work exceptionally for formal occasions.
	
Medium shine is more versatile, allowing you to give your hair a healthy-looking sheen or, if you add a bit more (but not too much), a semi-formal look that isn’t as overwhelming as a high-shine look has the potential to become. The main factor to keep in mind with medium-shine products is that the level of shine you get tends to depend more heavily on how much product you use than a high-shine or low-shine product, which tend to stick more closely to the label. You can get a surprisingly high shine out of medium-shine products if you really glob it on, and you can also achieve a low-shine look if you use only a little. This means that with medium shine products, experimentation is key, so that you can get a feel for how much product to use for the level of shine you want.
	
Finally, we come to low-shine products. Low-shine is typically used to achieve looks which seem unstyled, natural, and subdued. This is also where things get a bit tricky, because there is a lot of overlap between products marketed as low-shine and products marketed as **matte**. Matte is, essentially, a dry look with as little shine as possible, meant to be even closer to a natural look. Matte is also very popular at the moment, as it can work in a variety of settings ranging from casual to formal, and there’s been a big boom for products that can achieve this look, such as American Crew Fiber, possibly the most oft-recommend product on this subreddit (but, more on that later). The problem is that most matte-marketed products aren’t matte – they’re just very low-shine, but there is still some shine present. Now, there’s nothing wrong with a low-shine product, and for some this is a trivial difference. But if you’re absolutely set on a no-shine, matte look, you need to be aware of this so that you don’t end up inadvertently buying a low shine product. If you want pure matte products, I do have some recommendations, which I will outline later in my **review and recommendation** section.
	
* **Texture**:

The third major aspect of a product's effects.This is, quite simply, the way the product feels and the type (but not strength, necessarily) of hold it provides. This is relatively under-discussed, and most product brands will have clear labels for shine and hold, but little if anything for texture (and what is there is often marketing fluff, like ‘provides luscious texture!’ etc.). There is some good reason for this, however, as the exact **visual** texture that a product will create depends greatly upon your own hair, so there really isn’t any way to guarantee that a product will produce a given texture in your hair. What is a bit easier to identify, however, is the **tactile texture** of the product, which is simply how it feels in your hair, especially when you run your fingers through it. There’s an enormous range of textures, from greasy and slick to gummy, to waxy, to gritty and sandlike, to smooth and pliable. I’ll go over texture in more depth in my specific product reviews, but the main point I want to get across here is that the texture of your hair is just as important as the appearance, especially if you or your lady friends decide to run their fingers through your hair. :)",,False,self,t5_2s1me,1345285950.0,,,True,t3_yf7ne,http://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/yf7ne/the_thorough_guide_to_hairstyling_part_1_intro/,

Most of the time, the answers can be found by [looking at veroz's compilation of hairstyles](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/mugj2/a_guide_to_finding_a_hairstyle/) or asking this subreddit. There's also a great primer on hair products and their applications, found in the sidebar.

What I haven't seen is a specific guide aimed at finding, styling and maintaining a solid bangs up or textured top hair style that will last throughout the day, which I hope this guide will do.

Often times when leaving the house, you'll have your hair up like [this](http://i.imgur.com/L4bt6yo.jpg).

But in only a few hours, minutes even, your hair has fallen flat and now looks like [this.](http://i.imgur.com/SqojNrE.jpg)

You've tried a whole lot of products, but nothing seems to be working. Apply product with dry hair, falls flat. Apply product with wet hair, still falls flat. Try a different product, mix two products together... everything you've tried ends up with your hair falling flat in a few hours.

Wouldn't it be nice to have great hold throughout the day and even when you wake up the next morning?

Here's how to do it in three simple steps.

**Step One: Find the proper cut that you like.**

It's important you find something that YOU like. After all it's your hair, not your mother's, significant other's or MFA's hair.

[Here's the bangs up album.](http://imgur.com/a/hxK1U)

[And the textured tops album.](http://imgur.com/a/KhZGa)

*Find three hairstyles* in those albums with a model who closely resembles your own face shape. A lot of people get too carried away with what haircut goes with what face shape, but a look at the albums shows every face shape is covered.

*Save those pictures* by either printing them, saving them to your phone, bookmarking on a mobile browser, any method that will let you show it to your stylist or barber. I prefer going to a stylist for a textured look; most barbers I go to only have razors, buzzers and regular shears, no texturing shears. Your experiences may vary.

*Ask your stylist* which of the three looks he or she thinks will work best for you. Don't worry about the specifics of the cut, like having a #2 length here or it needs to be one inch there. Let your stylist determine the right length to achieve that look you're going for. After all, isn't that why you've chosen them?

**Step Two: Styling Your Hair**

Now that you have the right cut, it's time to style your hair.

*Wash your hair* in your usual manner. Personally, I use conditioner only with no shampoo but how you choose to wash your hair is up to you. Towel dry as best as you can.

[Hair has been towel dried. Note that my hair is still a little wet and the way it falls flat on my head.](http://i.imgur.com/alnsK3J.jpg)

The next step is the key to having great hold throughout the day: *blow dry your hair*. This may take a few extra minutes, but this is how you will be able to lock in your hair throughout the day.

A lot of people keep looking for the product with the most hold, trying out clay, waxes, mud, paste, pomade, cream, gel, whatever, and still end up with flat hair several hours into the day. Those products are meant to be the dessert to a meal, not the main dish, which is the blow dryer.
 
Style your hair the way you want with one hand while blow drying with the other. Push it up, to the side, fauxhawk, whatever. Use a comb or a brush if you need to. [A concentrator attachment](http://i.imgur.com/yG25XRO.png) on your blow dryer to help direct airflow will definitely help in this area. Use the highest heat that you can handle. Don't worry about damaging your hair; if you're getting your hair cut every month, every two months, even every six months your hair won't get damaged before it's cut anyway.

[*Keep drying your hair until it's molded the way you want*.](http://i.imgur.com/GIQz22d.jpg) If done right, you can ruffle your fingers through your hair, try to part it or smash it with your hand but you'll see that your hair goes right back to the way you styled it. By simply blow drying your hair, you've already achieved more lock than you did trying all the different products on their own.

**Step Three: Adding Product**

Here's where adding product comes into play. The cake and ice cream after the steak and lobster. The styling guide mentioned earlier discussed how to [either cocktail or layer your products](http://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/yf85q/the_thorough_guide_to_hairstyling_part_3_applying/). What you choose is up to you, but for this guide I'll be layering my products.

The products that I use post-blow drying are [Lanza's Texturizing Powder](http://www.amazon.com/Lanza-Healing-Powder-Texturizer-Unisex/dp/B002CXPO7W) and [Gatsby Wild Shake Moving Rubber](http://www.amazon.com/GATSBY-MOVING-RUBBER-SHAKE-2-8oz/dp/B000V2ACHI).

A lot of people use American Crew products, like [Fiber](http://www.amazon.com/American-Pliable-Molding-Styling-Creams/dp/B0008IV7BU), [Cream](http://www.amazon.com/American-Crew-Forming-Cream-Ounce/dp/B000KEIPC6) or [Clay](http://www.amazon.com/American-Crew-Molding-Clay-3-0/dp/B000R41QDY). Those are fine too. Anything that is on the thick side will work. A matte or glossy finish is up to you, but I prefer the matte look.

The texturizing powder helps to give hair a rougher, more volumized feeling, especially for those with fine, straight Asian hair like me. A few sprinkles is usually enough. Massage the powder into the hair and use it to reinforce your style.

From here, I use a dab of Gatsby and use it to lock my hair to get the finished look. Gatsby has some of the best hold for my Asian hair that I've experienced; often times I wake up the next morning and my hair is still styled the way it was the night before. The nice thing about already having your hair in place is that you don't have to use as much product as you did before. Just use enough to spread evenly throughout your hair from back to front.

[Hair is done and good to go.](http://i.imgur.com/sPRiy5k.jpg)

**Step Four: Ready, Set, Go!**

Now that you have your hair styled and set, head out and have some fun! Your hair will stay locked into place longer than before without having to worry about touchups every hour. Just a few extra steps and minutes added to preparing your hair properly will save you a lot of time, effort and worry later in the day.

**First, a foreword. Skip past this if you’re not interested in my opinions, but I’ve put them here for a reason!** As I said at the beginning, I will not be teaching you how to style your hair like a celebrity, or like any models or pictures you see, for that matter. Your hair is yours, it’s not like anybody else’s, and you will only do yourself a disservice and become frustrated if you try to make your hair into something it simply cannot be. 

If you do want advice about that, post a thread on this board, and you’ll find people willing to help you, which is all fine and good and that’s how most people start out. But I think that it’s important to take advantage of the natural features of your hair, and work with its quirks and oddities, because that is what will allow you to create a unique look that is truly all your own. 

Sure, celebrities have great hair, but if you get that hair you’ll look like you just stuck it on your head, it’s uncreative, and it’ll show that you don’t have confidence in your own ability to find a style that works for you. 

So I encourage you, find some products that sound appealing to you, buy them or find samples of them, and play around. Start with a little bit, make sure you distribute it evenly, and just poke and prod, shove it around, try different things, and have fun with your hair. It’s liberating, it’s exhilarating, and you’ll discover exactly what your hair is capable of, and much quicker than if you ask somebody on the internet to figure it out for you.

**Now, onto the actual styling.**

First things first, you’ll want to wash your hair before styling, especially if you’ve just woken up, because otherwise your hair just won’t cooperate as well and you simply will not get the proper control over your hair or be able to really figure out what the product is capable of. Once your hair is clean, you’ve got a few options on how you want to apply your products. I’ll start from the most simple, beginner-friendly methods, and later go up to something a little bit more advanced for those who want some more room to experiment with.

For those who are new to hair products, I recommend making sure that your hair is dry before applying product, so that you can see a clear before-and-after of exactly what the product is doing to your hair. Do note, however, that a product’s exact effects depend on how wet or dry your hair is when you put them in, so feel free to experiment day-to-day with different levels of moisture once you’re more comfortable. 

Besides that, always start slow with product, add a bit more if you’re curious, but don’t be afraid to rinse your hair out and re-dry it if you accidentally add too much. I recommend starting with a pea-sized amount of most products, especially if you have very short hair, and then working your way up until you find your preferred amount.

* **For Beginners:**

In terms of actually styling your hair, the most important thing when you’re starting out is to work with the natural properties of your hair. Yes, if you want to you can someday use flat-irons, curling irons, three kinds of combs and half a dozen different products to make a giant tower of hair, but now’s really not the time for that. Just spread a pea-sized amount of product evenly on your palms and fingers, and then just run your fingers through your hair as thoroughly as possible, your goal being to make sure the roots and strands each get their fair share of product.

During this stage, I recommend that you do not look at yourself in a mirror, and furthermore that you start by applying the product to the back of your head or your crown, and working toward the front and sides. This is because it’s very common when you’re starting out to only think about how the front of your hair looks, and just obsess and obsess about it, not realizing that the rest of your head is totally neglected. This is also why most people end up using way too much product, they start at the front and just glob it on, and they can’t get it to distribute properly. 

Think of it like shampooing: you want to make sure the product is thoroughly distributed, and not just globbed all on the front of your hair. So turn away from your mirror, run your hands and fingers through your hair like crazy to distribute the product, and then turn around and see what you’ve ended up with.

This is usually a pretty good indication of what your hair is naturally going to want to do, and you can tinker with it a bit from here (flattening the sides with your palms, pushing the top back or up, etc.) while being confident that your hair will hold its shape because you’re not forcing it to do what it doesn’t really want to.

* **For The Slightly More Advanced:**

Two of the most important techniques if you want to get a bit fancier with your hairstyling are **layering your products and cocktailing your products**. These are fairly similar concepts, in that they involve the combination of multiple products in order to achieve a look you simply can’t manage with one product alone. Where they differ is that **layering** involves putting on the products in a specific order, whereas **cocktailing** involves mixing the two products together in your hands and applying this new mixture all at once.

* **Cocktailing** is really the simpler of the two, since it doesn’t change the way you actually apply product to your hair. It’s also quite fun to play around with, so I suggest just picking a couple of your favorite products and seeing that they do together. 

One lesson, though, is that it’s best to pair products that do different things – for example, pair a firmer-holding wax with just a small amount of cream or new-style pomade to add a healthy shine to a more controlled hairstyle. This can also be fun because the texturizing effects of the two products will combine, leading to some really interesting stuff. 

As an example, when I cocktail American Crew’s pomade and forming cream, the greasiness of the pomade and the very slight stickiness of the cream come together to make something very volumizing, soft, and pliable, and I have yet to find any single product which gives me quite the same feel.

* **Layering** is a bit more complex, because you will be styling your hair in stages, and you’ll need to make sure you do the right thing each step of the way or risk messing up the whole style. The advantage, however, is that you can likewise achieve more complex styles, and you will have vastly more control over your hair. At a basic level, it just goes like this: add one product to achieve one effect, then add another on top that you feel complements it (but might not work in a cocktail).
 
For example, using a lighter product like mousse, Bumble and Bumble Prep/Tonic, that sort of thing, to provide volume or moisture then following it up with a stronger hold product. You wouldn’t be able to cocktail mousse or the B&amp;B products because they’re so different in terms of application method from standard ‘puck’ products.  

Same thing with a hairspray, since you couldn’t exactly spray it on your hands and mix it with another product (well, you could, but it wouldn’t get the effect you want in all likelihood). There really isn’t a specific order you have to use products in when layering, however, so there’s a lot of freedom here, though it can take a while to learn what works for you. 

Another subset of layering that you’ll see more often in Rockabilly styles and pompadours is the use of a “topcoat”, which essentially means applying a stronger-hold product evenly throughout your hair to give it shape, then applying a second product (usually one with higher shine) to the surface of your hair only, typically by just moving your hands flatly across your head front-to-back.

That's about all there is to basic styling, if you want to know more about specific styles, try a youtube search, and you can find more detailed advice.",,False,self,t5_2s1me,1345282583.0,,,True,t3_yf85q,http://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/yf85q/the_thorough_guide_to_hairstyling_part_3_applying/,

[My face](http://i.imgur.com/w2SyuRf.jpg)

Well personally I think my face shape is either oval or round, so [google will surely help me determine](https://www.google.com/search?q=difference+between+oblong+and+round+face+shape&amp;hl=en) this! Results:

[[1] “What’s my faceshape?” A quick guide to face shapes](http://musicreviewunsigned.com/2013/04/24/whats-my-faceshape-a-quick-guide-to-face-shapes/)

-Hey, from first picture it clearly seems my face is round! Let me scroll to see what is under ""round"" category: 

*""Round:
If you have a round face, your cheekbones are the widest part of your face and your jaw will be curved. Think of a square face, but with softer angles.'*

-That's true, my jaw is curved and my cheekbones are widest part of my face. Ok, I'm done this was easy, my shape is **round**. But let me be sure and check next link in google.

[[2] The Make-up Chair: Face Shape!](http://themakeupchair.blogspot.sk/2012/09/face-shape.html)

-Hmm, make-up, so this is female website then but whatever, face shape is unisex right? Let me skip to round shape:

""*The easiest way to describe a round face is take a oval and pull it outwards.*"" -Yeah? U don't say... say by how much!

""*The face is the same full across as its length is down.* "" - Maybe I don't know english so well, but is this sentence saying my face should be as long as it is wide? Well then [my face can't have round shape](http://i.imgur.com/UlBVjt1.jpg). But let me finish reading this. ""*People mistake round face shape as fat but that's not true, even thin people can have round faces.*"". -Well I'm sure I'm not fat so I could have round face, but probability is less right? ""*As you can see here on Kirsten Dunst - her cheeks are the same fullness from her round forehead to her jawline creating an almost prefect circle.*"" -M'kay let me verify this statement. - [Yup, it's true](http://i.imgur.com/y5Fhbad.jpg), let me compare it with me. - [Nope](http://i.imgur.com/IPyLHPN.jpg). Ok, so my face shape isn't round after all :( Let me see other options:

- Oval - ""*Oval Faces are known for their symmetrical balanced features because of this oval (or egg shape) has became the most sort after shape.*"" -My jaw is certainly more pointy than top of my head so it's not symmetrical so then I'm not oval.

- Oblong/Long - ""*Both shapes are elongated ovals, just take an oval and make it longer then it is wide.*"" -No, if I elongate shape of egg (oval shape) it would be too narrow for my head so it can't be it.

- Square ""*chin is flat*"" - certainly not me. It's not flat, neither pointy.

- Rectangle - ""*rectangle is longer then it is wide but still the forehead is flat on top and squares off, the chin is flat and square upwards at the jaw. (Just like a square)*"" - No, my forehead neither chin is flat.

- Heart Shaped, Inverted Triangle  - ""*The main characteristics of a heart shaped face is a pixie like tapered jaw and a rounded forehead creating a heart shape. 
They can also have a widows peek but most a rounded forehead is what sets is apart from an inverted triangle.*"" - I'm not sure what they mean with pixie like tapered jaw, but if [this](http://m5.paperblog.com/i/33/337106/fairy-hobmother-sent-me-lilpink-pixie-dusts-L-iRzzLJ.png) or [this](http://www.marbleinspiration.co.uk/webupload/MARBLE/CUSTOM/MYTHICAL/LARGE/pierre-1lg.jpg), then I don't have neither of those shapes - my jaw is not so pointy and has also more meat on it than second pixie picture or woman in photo.

- Triangle/Pear - ""*face is much fuller at the jawline then the forehead*"" - Nope, my jawline is not fuller than forehead, my cheeks are.

- Diamond - ""*Another unusually shape and often mistaken for oval. Diamond is fullest at the cheeks and tapered above and below. Creating a diamond shape. The fullest can be across the cheeks or across the cheekbone, high or low its still a diamond shape. The jaw can be similar to an oval, heart or square while the forehead is similar to a pear.*"" Hey description works for me! **Diamond** it is then! Let me confirm with next Google result:

[\[3\] How To: Find Your Face Shape](http://www.herstyleblog.com/post/18136037982/how-to-find-your-face-shape) - Holy shit, woman on left in Oval section is same as woman in Diamond section in previous result! Let me see what is there:

- Oval - ""*shape is proportional in length and width (about 1.5 times longer than it is wide), will have a curvilinear shape like an egg, and a chin that is very slightly narrower than the forehead.*"" - [Let me measure it.](http://i.imgur.com/GTaVz42.jpg)  - Okay, it's 10 vs 7 units, I guess we can consider it as about 1.5 rate - and it's just in photo, in real I have pretty big nose, so it adds to length! And if my chin is slightly narrower than forehead? Yeah sure it is baby! Let me check diamond shape and if it's description would not describe my shape, we have new winner! Also that drawing looks like my shape! ... wait a minute? B-b-but drawing of oval shape is much different than [drawing in first result](http://musicreviewunsigned.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/xaXz7Yra8j1BCQ0SOLoDErbz-300x243.jpeg)! ... [WTF!?](http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/desk-flip-240x180.png) OKAY, let's try to preserve logic. This drawing looks most like round shape in first result and according it's description in first result my shape IS round. Also, woman in photo on left is same as woman in photo under diamond shape in previous result. SO, this article must be bullshit! YEAH, THAT IT IS and even description of diamond shape in this article is not mine (my forehead and chin are NOT contrastingly narrow), so let me skip to next result. For now, my shape is **either round or diamond**.

[[4] Beauty School: Finding Your Face Shape](http://michellephan.com/blog/post/beauty-school-finding-your-face-shape) - Hey, this article uses same sketches as first result what a coincidence! Wait a minute, descriptions are same... yeah this is copy &amp; paste, next result.

[\[5\] How to Determine Your Face Shape](http://makeupandbeauty.com/face-shape/) - Hmm, this looks familiar... I remember! I forgot to tell you guys that I was also searching previously, but I did not find enough information so I changed search keywords to more generic terms (before it was ""how to find face shape"" or something like that). I saw it on [wikihow](http://www.wikihow.com/Determine-Your-Face-Shape) and I burnt with it as hell because i spent plenty time measuring attributes of my face and then I found out that article DID NOT TELL YOU WHAT TO DO WITH THESE NUMBERS. And same it is in this article. Also, many people [burnt on wikihow like me](http://www.wikihow.com/Discussion:Determine-Your-Face-Shape) and one of them also found same it is on [ehow](http://www.ehow.com/how_1000376_determine-face-shape.html#page=0).

*[Fixing your hair, back to black etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/d31xf/fixing_a_butchered_hair_coloring_job/c0x8eor?context=3)

Hello, like I promised. I will write a guide on how to style your hair with higher success rate than before after reading. Please bear with me, but before you begin... Please take the following with you as it is essential for hairstyling:

* **Perseverance** *if you fail, try again, if you fail again, try it another way*

* **Patience** *results don't appear overnight*

* **Playfulness** *don't be scared to experiment, what might be 'ugly' or 'unpleasant' to you just because it is new doesn't mean it's bad.*

I am an asian, so my hairtype may/may not suit you. What you see in this is totally made up from my experience and feelings, they do not convey into absolute truths. Hairtype and Length aside, general hairstyling rules apply.


1 - Basic Hairstyling Implements

* [Gel](http://imgur.com/mc3Zu) 

* [Wax](http://imgur.com/fpEmc)

* [Clay](http://imgur.com/g5nxp)

* [Spray](http://i.imgur.com/U1EFc.jpg)

2 - Advanced Hairstyling Implements

* Hair Iron(image to be uploaded)

* Hair Straightener(image to be uploaded)

* Comb

Let's get straight to the point now. I will be brief and update this post from time to time if it need be.


Gel

&gt;Short, Corporate/Formal/Office, 'slick-look'
Provide a quick fix and look neat and smart


Wax

&gt;Short, Medium Length, Just above shoulder
Allow more 'fun' in your styles, such as volume and intricate styles


Hard Clay

&gt;Medium Length
Use for 'enhancing' the style you want, sharpening edges and spikes


Molding Clay

&gt;Medium to Long hair
Acts pretty much like wax, just stronger


Spray

&gt;All hair lengths
This little thing is really good as it acts as a finisher for everything. Sets the style for long-lasting effects.


GENERAL QUESTIONS:
Q: How to remove hairstyling implements from your hair after more than 12 hours of activities without hairwash?
&gt;A: Wet your hair, apply conditioner all over portions you want, wash. Afterwhich, proceed with your shampooing.
 
Will update soon! Really tired. Will provide pictures and more information from time to time! Meanwhile, throw in some questions or some guidelines you guys want and I'll add them to the guide slowly. Styling of hair is not listed yet, will do it real soon!

This section is pretty straight-forward, I will be reviewing the products I’ve used in the past, as well as talking briefly about how I used them. I will start with a brief description of the product by the company which produces it, usually taken from the jar itself or their website, to provide context for my own experience with the product. 

Following that, I’ll give my own opinions on its hold, shine, texturizing effects, and smell. I should make it clear right now that I have NOT been paid by any brands or companies to endorse their products. None of my products were received for free, I either bought them myself or my family members bought them for me at some point. I am not against receiving promotional product samples, but I doubt any companies even know I exist, so I won’t hold my breath. :P EDIT: For reference, my hair is moderately curly/wavy, fine-medium strands and abundant.

One last thing before I begin: there are many good lines of products, and I haven’t always had the chance to use them enough to give a detailed review but I’ve had them used on me at salons/barbershops enough to vouch for them. These include **Redken, Bumble &amp; Bumble (I do review one of their products, but it’s more of a hair care product than a styling product), Moroccanoil, KMS California, Johnny B., and Kevin Murphy.** Generally speaking, you will find quality products in these lines, though I haven’t had the chance to sample enough of the line in enough detail to provide full reviews. But if your local salon/barbershop uses them, don’t be afraid that they’re not as good as what I’m reviewing here. Anyways, on with the reviews!

**American Crew Pomade:**

Brand Description: “Medium hold with high shine. Works well for curly hair and provides a modern, flexible alternative to styling gels. Use it to create classic, slicked-back looks or for control in any hair type”.

My ratings:

Hold: Low

Shine: High

Texture: Greasy, wet, good for separation and messier looks if used on its own.

Smell: Musky, masculine, a bit like a cologne, but not overpowering. As long as you’re not using too much of it, a very nice smell.

My overall thoughts: Well, well, well…the first hair product I ever used, and still one I keep in my cabinet now. A good example of modern-style pomades, this product gives you a tremendous amount of shine and a very wet, soft look. It feels a little bit greasy, but it washes out quite easily, and won’t leave any undesired residue in your hair. All in all, it is a quality product. I do, however, have my gripes with it. It says medium hold, but I honestly feel like it has hardly any hold at all. And I’m not even a fan of super strong-hold products…but this stuff just feels weak on its own. This makes it nice for curly hair and messy looks, as it won’t do much more than help lock-in moisture, but if you really want to set a style in place you’ll need to cocktail this with something else or use hairspray. Overall, I recommend it, as it actually works rather excellently in cocktails with almost any other product you can think of, but on its own it’s not worth nearly as much.

How I use it: I usually prefer to apply this to dry or very slightly moist hair, as if my hair is still completely wet it tends to have trouble adhering evenly. I generally just mess my hair around a bit, letting it accentuate my curls, which it does a rather good job of. I won’t typically finish with any hairsprays, since if I’m using the pomade on its own I want a light-hold style, and hairspray would undo that.  If I want something a bit more interesting, I’ll cocktail the pomade with Hanz de Fuko Quicksand or American Crew Forming Cream to provide more hold and thickness, which the pomade lacks. 

**American Crew Forming Cream:**

Brand Description: “Medium hold with medium shine. Easy to use styling cream works well for all hair types. Forming cream provides hold, excellent pliability, and a natural shine. This product also helps hair look thicker and is ideal for easing new users into the potential of styling jar products.”
My ratings/Experience:

Hold: medium-high (can become surprisingly firm if you use a lot, it’s very tacky/sticky at first)

Shine: Medium, fairly natural shine.

Texture: A bit sticky at first, feels kind of like glue in your hands, but isn’t sticky once it’s been in your hair for a few minutes. Feels very light in the hair unless you use a ton, really. Leaves a nice smooth texture in the hair, very pliable.

Smell: Coconuty and a bit medicinal. Less conventionally masculine than the AC Pomade, but pleasant.

My overall thoughts: An excellent product, probably my favorite Crew product that I’ve used to date. A little bit will add some lovely thickness, moisture, and control to your hair, it applies evenly without much hassle, and will last most of the day. You can also add quite a bit more and really strengthen the hold, and I would argue that this actually holds better than the Fiber if you use enough, because it sticks to your hair much more firmly. This stuff is really just great, and the description by Crew themselves is quite accurate, as its excellent for beginners.

How I use it: Apply to slightly damp hair, usually just towel-dried till it’s about half-dry. I don’t like applying it to dry hair as much, as the stickiness of the product can make it difficult to distribute evenly. Do note, however, that this stickyness isn’t a problem once the product has sat in your hair for just a little while, so it’s only really an issue if you’re trying to get this into dry hair. It will, however, still work with dry hair, so feel free to try it; damp hair is just my preference. Finally, this is another excellent cocktailing product, and works very well in combination with the AC Pomade, as well as being useful to add after a firmer wax to provide just a tad more shine without as much as the Pomade would. Only word of warning, if you have fine hair, too much of this can weigh the hair down somewhat, so use it sparingly until you find the right amount.

**American Crew Fiber:**

Brand Description: “High hold with low shine. Fiber-like, resinous product helps thicken, texturize and increase fullness to hair. Provides a strong, pliable hold with a matte finish. Works well in shorter hair, 1-3 inches in length.”

My Ratings/Experience:

Hold: Medium

Shine: Low, and fairly matte after it settles in.

Texture: Hard and dry, but softens quickly after you work it in your hands for a bit.

Smell: Super-citrusy, a bit artificial, but not unpleasant. I’ve actually gotten compliments on the smell. Fades quickly, though.

My Overall Thoughts: 
Really more of a medium hold, in my experience, in spite of being marketed as high-hold. It’s a bit of a peculiar hold, however. It starts of quite strong, when first applying, and can actually be a little bit difficult to apply at times because of this. Once it sits in your hair for 5-10 minutes, however, the product softens up tremendously, and your hair becomes very soft and moveable. It will stay held where it is, though, for the most part, unless you move it again yourself. Word of warning, though, if you live in a hotter, more humid climate, this product tends to have some endurance issues throughout the day.
In terms of shine, it’s true to its word: low shine, with the potential to make a matte finish. If you want the matte finish, though, you should apply the product to dry hair. If you apply it to wet hair, you’ll lock in some of the moisture, giving a slight amount of shine.
In terms of texture effects, I find that this leaves my hair a bit fuller and thicker, as advertised, but this isn’t really a selling point for this product as other products can do the same things better. Still, not a bad feature, and if you’d rather stick to only one product it comes in handy.

How I Use It: Apply to completely dried hair, then just mess it around with my fingers. This isn’t a product you should really be getting a slicked back sort of look with, since it has no shine, so I just use it for more unstructured, casual looks.

**American Crew Firm Hold Styling Gel:**

Brand Description: “Non-flaking formula. Firm Hold Styling Gel, the ultimate in holding power, is enriched with natural extracts like Vitamin B5 to help hair look thicker with added shine. This alcohol-free gel is superior in hold and shine and has a low pH to prevent drying of the scalp.”

My Ratings/Experience:

Hold: High

Shine: Medium/High

Texture: Typical gel “wet-look.” For my hair, it seems to make it appear thinner rather than thicker.

Smell: Subtle, kind of woodsy/piney. Probably the mildest of the Crew products I’ve used.

My Overall Thoughts:
A mixed product. If you want a gel look, it’s perfect, and it is indeed non-flaking. But I just never found it that good with my hair. It made my already fine strands seem even finer if I went for the wet look, and if I applied the gel to dry hair it seemed to make my hair frizz out without providing any real hold. There’s no denying that this is a quality product, but it just does not work for me or what I like when it comes to my hair.

How I Use It: I tried the typical slicked-back looks, and the gel dried fairly quickly and ended up with a typical gel crustiness. Love it or hate it, really, depending what kind of feel you want. It’s not really my thing, but it does what it does well.

The one method I did enjoy was slicking my hair back while wet, letting it dry, then playing with it with my hands or combing it through to get rid of the crusty gel feel. I could make my curly hair very straight and malleable once I did this, and once all the crustiness was combed out my hair was excellent to play with. But most mornings I simply don’t have time to wait and have my hair air-dry and then re-style it before I leave. And for some reason, blow-drying instead of air-drying always got rid of the straightening/malleable effect I liked and went back to frizzy.",,False,self,t5_2s1me,1345340151.0,,,True,t3_yf90n,http://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/yf90n/the_thorough_guide_to_hairstyling_part_4_product/,

Brand Description: “This nutrient-rich detangler reveals texture, enhances the performance of styling products and refreshes already styled hair.”

My Ratings/Experience:

Hold: None

Shine: None

Texture: Helps make my hair super smooth and soft, removes basically any sort of tangle.

Smell: Mild herbal/medicinal smell, fades completely by the time you’re done styling with any products.

My Overall Thoughts:
A soft-spoken essential for me. Makes my hair wonderfully smooth and controlled without doing anything that would mess up styling later. Just a note, this stuff is very similar to Bumble &amp; Bumble’s Tonic. Tonic is just better if your hair is coarse/damaged or colored, while Prep is better for hair that is relatively healthy, but could use a little extra detangling and moisture.

How I Use It:
I usually use it when my hair is damp, usually a bit after I’ve gotten out of the shower and have already towel-dried slightly. Then I comb my hair into place, which this stuff helps you do very easily, and then style with whatever products I would use normally.

**Keune Man Matte Effect:**

Brand Description: “Matte &amp; dry clay for strong definition in short to medium hair.”

My Ratings/Experience: 

Hold: High.

Shine: Low, very low. A product for pretty close to a truly matte look.

Texture: Excellent, really separates and thickens quite well and gives hair a nice, controlled look.

Smell: Sharp and masculine, hard to describe. Somewhat herbal/medicinal, but a bit of cologne too, and some minty/menthol kick. Great stuff.

My Overall Thoughts:
An excellent product in almost every sense. It does what it says it will, and it does it well. The only problem is it’s price and availability, it’s somewhat hard to find and probably the most expensive product I’ve purchased as of this review. A standard puck will be $20-25, not horrendous, but a bit higher than I think most would be willing to pay.
	
One note on the fact that it’s a “clay” – this is one clay that is actually fairly different from most of the waxes I’ve used. It’s much more solid, being somewhat difficult to get out of its puck, and if you don’t spread it in your palms properly it can be a bit tricky to distribute. With this comes some amazing texture, though, and only a little bit of stickiness to hold it all together.

How I Use It:
Same way as Fiber, really, though it should be used quite sparingly. If you start with too much, it’ll be difficult to distribute it evenly and could make your hair quite difficult to work with due to its high hold, so apply it in stages and take your time. This stuff has some fiercely good hold while remaining malleable, possibly the highest hold I’ve found in a malleable wax/clay, so it works well for styles with a good amount of height. Only problem is that its texture makes it trickier to apply to longer hair (anything above 5-6 inches), so if your hair is that long I’d recommend using it as a topcoat or cocktailing it with something like a cream or a lighter wax to make applying it easier.

**Hanz de Fuko Scheme Cream:**

**Important note: this review is of the old Scheme Cream formula, HdF recently changed it, and I have not used the new formula yet.**

Brand Description: “Ingenious, hassle - free hair grip with ultimate versatility. Provides light shine minus the weight or oiliness associated with other forming creams. Great for creating pliable styles with natural texture.”

My Ratings/Experience:

Hold: Light/medium

Shine: Low/natural, not matte, but a very healthy looking level of shine. Great for those with dry or curly hair.

Texture: Seems to help define curls quite well, and if I’m wearing my hair on the straighter side it provides some excellent smoothing.

Smell: Light and sweet, quite nice and very mild. Kind of like peaches and vanilla, fades relatively quickly.

My Overall Thoughts: 
Superb, superb, superb. This is the one hair product I’ve found that I can describe as truly weightless, so if you’ve got fine hair, especially curly hair, this stuff is a miracle. Even on the hottest, muggiest days, this stuff doesn’t make my hair droop at all, and it always lets my scalp breathe quite well.

How I Use It: 
There are two primary ways I use it. Method one is to apply a fingertip to damp hair, then ruffle it around while blow-drying it slowly to bring out the curl in my hair. This works as well as most curl serums/curl creams I’ve tried, and with a very natural feeling once it has set.
	
Method two involves blow-drying the hair first to give it some good volume, then applying the crème to the dry hair to keep it neat and smooth. Works great for a sort of casual, slightly messy pompadour style in my hair. This is good controlling hair that is generally good on its own, but needs a bit of moisture and hold to be at its best. Kind of works like a leave-in conditioner, in a way.

**Hand de Fuko Quicksand:**

Brand Description: “Revolutionary! Add volume, absorb excessive oil and add texture with zero weight! Provides great lift for second day hair and for creating textured styles that defy gravity”

My Ratings/Experience:

Hold: High, surprisingly so. Up there with Keune’s Matt Effect, if not higher.

Shine: Non-existent. This is pure matte, and the most matte product I have ever used, there is simply nothing better at getting that dry look.

Texture: Wow, is all I can say. This stuff is possibly the best volumizer I have ever used, it thickens and lifts like nobody’s business. Lacks slightly when it comes to separation, but you can always cocktail to get that, and this is probably the most cocktail-able product there is. It does leave your hair with a gritty feeling, kind of like you’ve just been swimming in the ocean, but it remains malleable all the same, and I actually kind of like it.

Smell: Dusty, earthy, clay smell with a slight maltiness to it. Lingers for a while, but stays relatively mild.

My Overall Thoughts:
This is the one product on this list that I will say absolutely everybody with an interest in styling their hair should try. Simply the most unique product I have ever used, and it can solve so many problems of volume/limpness/thickness that many people struggle with. It isn’t perfect, as it really works best when cocktailed, and some may not like the feel. But this product is one-of-a-kind, so it’s worth a try at least once. As a plus, it's a powder-in-cream product, so the cream side of it helps it distribute really, really easily.

How I Use It:
If I want a lot of thickness, I apply it to my hair when it’s damp then blow-dry. If I want more in the way of lift and volume, I apply it to dry hair. This stuff also cocktails amazingly, and the cocktail of this + AC Pomade is possibly my favorite thing for my hair. Definitely worth a try, and you can adjust the ratio of Quicksand to Pomade depending on how much shine you want. Also cocktails quite well with Hanz de Fuko Sponge Wax. As a side note, my girlfriend also loves using this for shagging out her hair, so if you’re interested in that, this is a good choice.

**Hanz de Fuko Hybridized Wax:**

Brand Description: “Wildly Inventive! Water based styling wax with custom blended polymers to provide maximum separation, texture and control with iridescent mica for shine.”

My Ratings/Experience:

Hold: Medium-high

Shine: Medium

Texture: Super-smooth, not “slick” per se but very controlled. Some nice separation, too.

Smell: Smells like eucalyptus. Weird, yeah? But nice, and extremely mild. Fades almost immediately.

My Overall Thoughts:
A fun and under-rated product. Most HdF buzz focuses on Quicksand, Sponge Wax, and Scheme Cream, but this product is quite remarkable. It’s extremely lightweight, much like Scheme Cream, but provides a good level of shine. And honestly, at least for my hair (light brown with notes of red and blond), this stuff has the perfect level of shine. Enough to make my hair a bit more interesting, but never enough to make it look greasy.

How I Use It: 
I like to apply this to dry hair, as the lightweight nature of the product lets me take advantage of the volume I get after blowdrying. After adding the product I’ll sometimes blow-dry my hair with the dryer on the cool setting a bit more just to liven things up. This is a pretty straightforward product, but it’s quite nice, overall, especially since most products that give shine tend to be a lot heavier or greasier.

**Hanz de Fuko Sponge Wax:**

Brand Description: “The best wax formulation for achieving the perfect balance of flexibility and firmness with a great matte finish. Unique ingredients combine for limitless styling creativity with long-lasting, pliable hold.”

My Ratings/Experience:

Hold: High, but very malleable

Shine: Low. Not quite matte, but close. Seems to provide a very healthy shine, somewhat like Scheme Cream but a little bit less.

Texture: Great texturizer, gives some nice separation and smoothness. Really kind of buttery smooth, a surprise for a wax.
Smell: Scheme Cream without the peaches, sort of a mild vanilla scent.

My Overall Thoughts:
Top-notch wax, an upgrade from AC Fiber. Not as strong-holding as Keune Matt Effect, but more lightweight and easy to work with. Gives some good hold all the same, but remains very malleable, so you can use this stuff to get your hair in a style that’ll hold through wind and heat, but adjust easily if you want to re-style it yourself.
How I Use It:
	
I prefer to use this stuff on dry hair on its own, in the same way as the HdF Hybridized Wax, or on wet hair in a cocktail with Quicksand (usually 2 parts Sponge Wax to 1 part Quicksand). The wax distributes very easily throughout the hair, so I can style in a few seconds flat and get a very nice look. Super easy to use, so this is a good beginning hair product.",,False,self,t5_2s1me,False,,,True,t3_yf9de,http://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/yf9de/the_thorough_guide_to_hairstyling_part_45_product/,

Why? What makes your identity so top secret that you *need* to put a box over your entire face?

There's me on a pretty messy hair day. Sorry that this is the most recent picture I have of the length lol. Here's the deal: Been growing it out for about 6 months. I hate short hair in general, but I especially hate short hair on me. It just doesn't look good on me. I love hair. I love the character that it gives people and what you can do with it. I'm very set on having hair, so please, MHA, don't give me your typical ""buzz cut"" advice. It's not happening.

These are hairstyles that appeal to me:

http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lpzcbwCJyy1qhq4ab.jpg

I'm using Lost characters as examples because I've been watching a ton of Lost lately and I noticed I see a lot of hair that I like lol.

Anyways, I don't really understand how I make the front of my hair look like the pictures, and the back of my hair isn't long enough the match the pictures yet either.

Anyways, advice would be appreciated on how to grow this out. Thanks!",,False,self,t5_2s1me,False,,,True,t3_mscds,http://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/mscds/long_hair_is_what_i_want/,

1) Question: how hair is naturally (straight/curly, greasy/dry, aprox length, how it was cut etc). 
Answer: It's straight and rather dry. Length is what you see in the pictures (so, just below eyebrows). Sometimes, there is a bit of frizzy hair near the part in my hair.

2) Question: daily hair care routine (how often shower, shampoo, condition, use product, etc.) 
Answer: I shampoo once every 3 days. I occassionally tried to use ""Bed Head For Men, Matte Separation Workable Wax"" (http://www.walmart.com/ip/Tigi-Bed-Head-For-Men-Matte-Separation-Workable-Wax-2.65-Oz/14711054) to get a Neal Caffrey type of look (http://www.theurbangent.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/neal-caffrey-style-tug-white-collar-2.jpg), but honestly, who can look that debonair? 

3) Question: actual process of styling (hair iron, comb, brush etc. and how to use them etc etc etc make a youtube video if you really wanna be badass etc)
Answer: After I step out of the shower, I dry my hair. I comb my hair all the way down straight (I like to think it gets rid of any frizz(?)) and then I put a pinky-sized wax ball in my hand and brush it through my hair with my hands to try and get desired look. Maybe comb the part extra special. 

So, ALAS! It doesn't work. I'm asking for your help. No restrictions, the hairstyle does not have to be clean, crisp, or professional. Also, I have a VERY small amount of stubble in these photos, it's late, and I haven't shaved today (I realize it's not a lot, but i'm trying to say I usually shave on a daily basis). Any type of hairstyle, no restriction on length of hair. I'm hoping you can suggest a hairstyle that matches my facial style (I'm not even sure what that means). Whatever has the most upvotes I'll do, simple as that.

Thank you for your time.

It's usually not a great idea to go in clueless and pick a random hair style out of the (usually) one men's hairstyle book they have. One of the best and easiest ways to get good results is to bring in a picture as an example of what you'd like to have done with your hair. Try to figure out what [shape your face](http://thepageantplanet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Face-Shapes-11.jpg) falls under. You can use that to help you find a style that will suit you, whether it's a celebrity with a similar face shape or an example from one of the websites linked in the sidebar. If you just don't know what to do with it you can let the stylist suggest something for you, but that is usually a gamble and not something I'd personally do unless I trusted the stylist. 

Whether you are going to a hair salon or a barber stay away from the $10 haircut joints (Supercuts, Fantastic Sams, etc). Going to Great Clips for a good haircut is like going to McDonalds for a nice dinner. 

I like to keep a conversation going with the person cutting my hair. Don't be an awkward penguin. Holding a conversation with your stylist is nice because this could be a person you come back to for repeated haircuts, assuming you like the way they cut it. If you like the way the person cuts your hair don't be afraid to give a tip. 

Pay attention to what's going on while your hair is in the process of being cut.  If you feel like something isn't right don't be afraid to speak up. Likewise if the stylist has finished don't be afraid to say something if you don't like it. Oftentimes she can modify or fix something what's bothering you, sometimes not but it's better to speak up and have the chance of salvaging your hair than being stuck with a bad cut for a few weeks.

- hide protruding ears,

- draw attention away from large nose,

Firstly, here is the cut I walked out with, I'm not sure exactly how I'm gonna comb it on a dat to day basis, but it was more or less what I was looking for:

The thing I really liked about the whole thing was that with the experienced cutter talking him through the whole thing and discussing everything, I really learned a lot about haircuts, and will really know how to ask for specific things going forward. I always feel I have a hard time communicating, and this was a tremendous learning experience for me as much as him. The obviously talented mentor guy ended up doing about half the cut as demonstration and it is clearly not perfect, but is way way better than the $20 haircut I consider to be more in my price range.

Usually, I prefer to use that old-fashioned grease from Murray's, Dax, and Royal Crown...because, well, they've been doing this for decades (some nearing a century). I don't feel the need or ever intend revive a dead age/culture or refer to myself as a rockabilly at all...I simply appreciate an earlier age when men were clean cut &amp; combed, straight razors from barbers were a standard, and women had not yet defined the ideal man in the 'fashion' world. E.g. [me(right) &amp; homie (left)](http://i.imgur.com/EzuCw.jpg).

I'm typically an adamant user of oil-based pomades...but honestly, each hair product has its time and place. This is my [small away-from-home hair product stash](http://i.imgur.com/DtTXZ.jpg). I'm currently away from my hometown and university to work that 8am - 5pm. So for that reason, I brought a different set of pomades and hair dressings with me. It just really sucks sitting at my desk for 8-9 hours and feel that greasy grease rub all up on my neck. Then when I get home, it's like 'Fuhhhh...dis shits all over my shirt collar'. 

So, this is why I got myself [Suavecito Pomade - Firme Hold](http://i.imgur.com/OMsFh.jpg) and I'll stop anecdote-ing start the review. This shit weirded me out the first time I saw it. When you held it and flicked the side, it rang like jell-o in a jar...but the smell. OH MAN! The smell is amazing. I don't know how else to describe it but as cologne and coca-cola. Sounds weird but it's nice as fuhhh. Scooping it out, it had the consistency of grape jelly and was pretty sticky. 

Before I continue, lemme tell you about my hair. I got thin and very straight hair (as you can probably tell from the picture). If about one inch, that shit won't sit down on my hair and will just fuzz out. My sides are about two inches or so...wheres the top/middle is like...I don't even know. I think it's about six inches or so and reaches a centimeter past my nose tip just free-resting -- not pulled. 

As for using the product itself, its 'dryness' of application and as I combed it through reminds me of wax. It has very little sheen (the shine you see if the picture is just me and my natural black hair). But its lift-to-weight ratio is very very impressive. It is very much what I was looking for thus far...a pomade that I can use stand-alone, stays in my hair and off my clothes during the day, and water-based so I can wash it off at night and save some pillow cases. The only two things I don't like...it doesn't have any shine which was something I really liked about grease. And it doesn't have that slick sticky-ness that keeps ALL stray hairs perfectly together. But all-in-all, I'm happy with it.

Also, if any of you were wondering, here are my [tools](http://i.imgur.com/svxlP.jpg). Handmade Kent combs, a cheap boar brush, and Suavecito. Sidenote: water-based pomades in general are much more expensive than traditional oil-based pomades because they use a lot more non-standard chemicals. Essentially, you can make grease pomade at home (I intend to do that soon). 

Just let me know if you guys wanna know anything else.

The thing is, I actually like my hair the way it is (longish, a little messy) but my job requires me to wear a suit all the time and my hair can't be all over the place. Also, I've never really had a ""new haircut"" so a style change could be very refreshing! 

[This is me!](http://imgur.com/a/ppUA2)

When I want to look clean and professional, I just usually put my hair behind my ears like [this](http://i.imgur.com/3r9BRfe.jpg), which looks kinda stupid. Something needs to be done :D

What kind of a haircut should I go for? I have a really hard time trying to imagine any hairstyle on my head. I would still like to keep the hair medium-long and be able to carry the hair with pride with a suit on. Should I keep the same style, cut it a bit shorter and/or learn how to shape it? Something completely different?

One cool cut I stumbled on in this subreddit is the asymmetrical undercut done on [this video](http://youtu.be/mkFWCaUma4g?t=9m30s), but it might not suit me due to my lighter hair color and more-back [hairline](http://i.imgur.com/zDshCEQ.jpg)?

I'm 19 and I can tell I'm already starting to bald (it's not obvious, but I'm thinning out on top and if I don't style it the right way, you can tell), and I was wondering if there was anything I could do to stop it, or even reverse it.

My background is that on my dad's side, he was bald on top, and so was his dad. So I think balding is a trait on my dads side. My mom is adopted, so I don't know much about her side. I also used to wear hats A LOT, which I've heard that it could possibly contribute to hair loss.

What I'm doing now to try to prevent it from getting worse is not wearing hats as much, trying to reduce any stress I might have, and taking protein (I read that it can help regrow hair and strengthen it? I dunno, I'm kinda desperate to stop it :L).

Anywhore, any additional advice you guys could give would be greatly appreciated.",,False,self,t5_2s1me,False,,,True,t3_v6l77,http://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/v6l77/ways_to_slow_balding_or_even_reverse_it_at_a/,

First up is the beard:

I've had a goatee for a long time, but decided to grow a full beard. Mostly just to do it, or see if I can. The style was like #4 in this picture:

Does a full beard work for me? Is it utterly horrendous? Where should the neck line be? (I'll go to a barber for help and advice when time, but just want to have an idea of where I should have it shaved)

Now, the hair. I usually keep it short. It has always been thin hair (diameter of hair), but now it's thinning too (growth-wise).

and it is smashed down in the middle of my already unfortunately shaped skull because I wear this at night:

so... advice? Shave it all off? High-n-tight? (was Army for 10 years, used to it) or just give up?

I know I'm not exactly handsome ;) I would, however, like to get a little tiny bit of style going on. I ended an 18 year marriage semi-recently (almost 2 years ago, so, ok, not recently) and just about have my life squared away. So I'm trying to up my chances at actually finding a nice woman. 


Fortunately, I don't have any serious confidence problems and have learned to rely on my demeanor and humor when it comes to the fairer sex. So, let's be honest here. Thanks :)

Personally, I have tried:

* *Paul Mitchell Dry **Wax***

* *American Crew **Pomade***

I have pretty curly/frizzy/jewfro hair that I keep very short in order to gain a ""sharp"" look, as my hair appears straight at such a short length.  My go-to hairstyle is to just throw a little product in and use my hands to rake the hair sideways - as it grows longer in between cuts, I'll part it a bit.


I have found that the *John Frieda Balm* works best for the above mentioned styling method just because it makes my hairs shinier, and doesn't cause my hair to curl slightly (as is the case with many other products; when they add moisture to my hair, it starts to curl)

I have recently decided to grow my hair out.  When I wash and condition my hair I have this huge messy frizzy poof on the top of my head.  I wake up with terrible bed head and it is just one big mess.  However this past weekend I didn't wash my hair for 3 days and it was amazing.  It laid flat, no frizz, it was styled the way I wanted it with no products and the best part is there was no bedhead in the morning.  So now I ask you /r/malehairadvice what can I do to maintain this.  Is there a shampoo that strips less of the grease from my hair? Or possibly is there a product which I can use to add some grease back into my hair? I appreciate any and all help in the matter.
Thanks in advance,

1349752225.0,15,self.malehairadvice,116dn4,Guide for dry/wavy/medium length hair.,MisunderstoodPenguin,17,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/116dn4/guide_for_drywavymedium_length_hair/,"Alrighty so, I've been doing a lot with my hair over the past couple of years and I thought I'd post some tips for people with my hair type.  I have medium length (2-3 inch) brown, dry, frizzy, wavy hair.  I also have problems with dandruff.  Now, for my normal shampoo, I always pick a Garnier Fructis fortifying shampoo for dry/damaged hair. The trick for dry hair is to pick a shampoo with no sulfates, because sulfates dry out your hair.  Next I use Suave Naturals triple moisturizing conditioner.  It's super cheap (like 1$ for a giant bottle that lasts like 4-5 months) and smells nice.  I use conditioner every day when I shower, and I shampoo every other day.  Now, as I said before, I have dandruff.  For that, I use Head and Shoulders citrus breeze.  Unfortunately, as most dandruff shampoos do, it strips the moisture and natural oils right out of my skull, so I only use this shampoo on the weekends, usually saturday in the morning (nice wake up shower).  

Now for products, I use 4 separate things: Hanz de Fuko Sponge Wax (available on amazon for about 14$), Moroccan argan oil (about 6$ at my fred meyers), Moroccan blow out cream (about 7 dollars at fred meyers BUT i usually spring for some Bumble and Bumble Grooming creme which is much more expensive, usually like 29$ online) and finally, I use a hand moisturizer Equate (you can get it at walmart, it's just as good as cetaphil).  After I shower, I towel off my hair until it's about 70% dry (that means only 30% moisture remaining).  I then apply about a dime sized amount of the hand moisturizer and spread very thoroughly through my hair.  After that, i use about a nickle sized amount of the Hanz de Fuko sponge wax (i love this stuff, it's fantastic), and I spread that as well through my hair, shaping however I please.  If you want a little more shine, you can use a dollop of the blowout cream, or the grooming creme, then use the wax.  On the days when I use the dandruff shampoo, I once again towel off my head to about 70% dry, then this time I use the Argan oil.  About a dim sized about makes it through my super dry/frizzy hair with a little to spare, and then I use the hand moisturizer, and if Im going out, I'll style with the cream, not the wax.  

Summary of products:
Garniet Fructis Fortifying Shampoo: 3$ GIANT bottle, lasts forever
Suave Naturals: 1$ Big bottle, lasts 4-5
Head and Shoulders: 2$ lasts for a LONG time especially when used sparingly.
Hanz de Fuko: 14$ main styling product, lasts about 1.5-2 months
Hand Moisturizer: Big bottle, lasts for forever
Argan Oil: 6$ lasts for a long time, a little goes a very long way
Moroccan Blowout cream: 7$ lasts for a long time OR the alt Bumble and Bumble Grooming Creme: 29$ lasts for a LONG time (most expensive product, but does last for about 6 months give or take depending on user frequency).

I hope you all found this helpful, becuase it took me forever to write this and just as long to find all of these products and techniques.  Have a good rest of the day/evening.  Cheers.

I have noticed a common request, ""How can I have hair like [something like Stalin](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ltydkfFy1v1qeest9o1_400.jpg), or [random male model.](http://i.imgur.com/EFRcE.jpg)""


I replied to a thread in MFA asking for similar styling advice, and thought some may find it useful here. 

I am going to paste the bulk of that here. 

[Here I am.](http://i.imgur.com/agWr4.jpg) I just got back from the beach, and was sweaty and gross for hours, but I can push my hair around and it looks good again. That is the nice part. Here is the hard part.

It is a ton of work. More than you expect, I promise. 

It is way way longer than it looks, at least 8 inches on the top. My hair is insanely thick, way above normal. Maybe it took a year to grow? I'm not sure. Also, my hair stylist is dope. He is awesome at knowing what I want. The hardest part is finding someone skilled enough to not mess it up. It is kind of a weird cut, you would have to really know what you are doing. 


For example- the very middle of my hair is long, the sides are medium, but some areas are shorter.



In the shower I use shampoo maybe once every 10 days, if that. I just scrub my hair and scalp with just water very hard every morning. 


Then I blowdry my hair. Then I put Paul Mitchell Extra Body Mousse in. Then I blowdry it again. Then I use Aveda Grooming Clay. Then Aussi Instant Freeze Hairspray. This adds up. Including hair cuts I am sure I average $60 a month on my hair.

The whole day my hair is slowly falling down, so I am pushing it up, and fixing it every hour or so. 

I also slept with my hair slicked back and a beanie on for quite a while until it got long enough.


Even though some days(and weeks) I crave having a shaved head I always end up keeping my hair.

Hopefully this was helpful, and not too confusing. Let me know if you have any questions!",,True,nsfw,t5_2s1me,1344570670.0,,,True,t3_xz8zu,http://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/xz8zu/the_secret_to_thick_luxurious_hair/,

I would usually just buzz it super short, let it grow out till the back and sides were so long it looked odd, then buzz it again.  


Today I had them shorten up the back and sides, but leave some length on top.  I put some hair stuff in there and messed around and came up with this combover thing and I like it.  


If I were to do it again I would have had them leave the top even longer in front and taper it off to about the length it is in the back, so that the comb over would be more apparent and look less like just my bangs combed over and more like all my hair in the front doing that.  If there wasn't any product in it the hair, the right would just fall down flat and the left side would stick up, so I almost just made the opposite of what it normally looks like, but pushed all my hair to the left as well.  What do you guys think?

Here are some pics: [back](http://imgur.com/aHhbs) and [profile.](http://i.imgur.com/QVNt3.jpg)

At first the guy hadn't buzzed the back at all, and seemed surprised that I wanted it buzzed, but said he'd do it. So then he buzzed just the sides of the back, and made it into a sort of V shape, looking like some sort of mullet updated for the hypebeast generation. I told him it was supposed to be round at the back, so he did that. Then I asked him to buzz it a bit higher up, and he said he couldn't because it would look strange. He said he shouldn't go any higher than he had it. I didn't have any pictures with me showing an undercut from behind so I took his word even though I was really skeptical. 

I came home, googled ""undercut,"" and it seems to me that the classic undercut is buzzed up a lot higher than mine. Like [here](http://i.imgur.com/j92mM.jpg) for instance.

So, my question is am I just crazy or should my hair have been buzzed a lot higher than it was, and if so does it look weird enough that I ought to get if fixed asap?

I've tried shampoo/conditioner designed for thin hair, thick hair, dry hair, oily hair, curly hair, colored hair, but they are all the same.  I've also tried many types of products like pomade, wax, gel, hairspray, etc., and none work.

Are there any brands of shampoo/conditioner that would moisturize/smooth my hair enough every morning right away?  I don't care if it would make it too greasy for day 2, since I'd wash everyday.  Or, any particular brands of product that will make my hair smooth and shiny without making it crusty or greasy.

I see people posting zac efron/model hair cuts where the hair wouldn't even come out that far on the persons head so the haircut isn't possible and would look ridiculous.

look for hair which is similar to the posters and see what they do with their hair to make it look good.

Most of my life, I've worn it long, simply because when I cut it short I end up with that extra spiky asian hair that starts like [this](http://imgur.com/botwu) and ends up like [this](http://imgur.com/kXPpj). The inherent problem with those hairstyles on me is that I have a face like [this](http://imgur.com/oG9Bl), albeit with thicker, darker eyebrows and less color in the face - I'm pretty pale lol.

So my entire life I've been this half-asian white kid with asian hair and a white face - people don't recognize me as asian at all until I tell them my name, and even then they're hard pressed to see the resemblance. During High School and the preceding years, I was always able to wear medium-length hair with bangs and stuff to a decent degree, but now that I'm in college I'm having some serious problems finding a hairstyle that will suit me and not look ridiculous.

Here are some pics, outlining my hair as it is right now - it's been about a month since I got it cut, and when it got cut it looked extremely similar to the first picture I linked, [the short asian hair](http://imgur.com/botwu).

[Front](http://imgur.com/EjKp0)

[Side](http://imgur.com/jD5ZK)

One of the biggest problems with growing my hair out initially is that the back gets really thick and long, while the rest struggles to catch up. In effect, my hair forms itself into this awful asian mullet thing, and getting rid of it is a pain, and I don't know how to deal with it.

Anyways, I want to get a haircut soon, but I'm tired of being the white guy with asian hair that doesn't fit on his head. If you have any advice for someone in my situation, whether it's different haircuts, styling products and advice, or just tips in general, you'd be helping me more than you can imagine. 

Also, I wear rounded rectangular glasses and have a wider heart-shaped face, if that helps any. Thanks again!",,False,self,t5_2s1me,False,,,True,t3_p6dzo,http://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/p6dzo/20_halfwhite_halfasian_guy_with_weirdass_hair/,

This is what it looks like with nothing in it. My whites are EXTREMELY prevalent (dye or no? what colour?) and everything is generally just messy.

Normally I get a #1 or #2 fade on the side with clippers, then have whomever is cutting my hair use scissors to take all but 1-2 inches off. From there, I normally through got2b glue in my hair and make messy spikes. I guess I have an affinity for naturally spiked hair, as it will not go flat forward or flat back =/.
