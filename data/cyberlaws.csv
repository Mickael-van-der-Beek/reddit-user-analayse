I write this only because I do not want to wait for that person to write this. I cannot wait anymore. I really hope you could help us now.

Timeline:

1. RH Bill is introduced due to overpopulation and high crime rate in the Philippines
2. Religious sectors against it. Calling it abortion. Condoms and contraception is abortion.
3. Senator Sotto writes/copies melodramatic biased speech against the bill. He a powerful voice of the Religious sector.
4. People call him out for plagiarism and melodrama.
5. He denies
6. In his embarrassment, he pushes the libel clause to the Cybercrime law to ""Level the playing field against social media critics""
7. The Law passes
8. Alleged PNP Facebook account uses new law to threaten people for criticizing them

Here's the link to the threat:

http://www.rappler.com/nation/13410-pnp-warns-against-using-foul-word-vs-officers-online

The police are denying that it's their account.

All of this started because we're trying to get the RH Bill passed. A law that will allow people to have access to contraception and birth control. A law that our Roman Catholic, overpopulated, and high crime rate country refuses to pass as it considers it abortion.

A Senator against the bill plagiarized a blogger when he wrote a speech against the bill. The whole country confronted him for lying online and he cried ""Cyber bullying"" and inserted libel into the Cyber crime law so no one could criticize him anymore. Now, most people think the police are abusing the libel clause in the bill.

We are not like you America. We are afraid. We cannot protest the same way you do because you can go to jail here without any formal charges. The police and the government are in control. We are a people who just goes about our lives not really concerned with all the death, crime, and religious propaganda. As long as it doesn't affect us, we don't care. Well God damnit I DO! I'm sure a lot of people do too!

What can we do? Can you help us spread the word like you did for SOPA, PIPA, CISPA and ACTA?

------------------------------

EDIT: I need to be clear about this. I am not ordering, condoning, instructing, or accepting any online threats made to our official Police accounts and government sites. This also applies to hacking. I am only here to create awareness. What people do after reading the points I make in this post is their discretion but I am in no way influencing them to do anything illegal or might irritate our police. I refuse to answer any questions when people ask me ""What is the Police's official site? We can email them hate messages from here in the U.S."" I do not want you to email them hate messages or hack them. That is illegal. I am here to raise awareness and ask for ideas of legal ways of peaceful protest.

People are going to protest in front of the Supreme Court at 10am Manila time. Massive online black outs of social media sites and websites. Lots of ""Where can I buy a Guy Fawkes mask?"" questions on my Facebook news feed. :)

This is his reply, presented without comment.",i_flip_sides,88,12,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/cyberlaws/comments/tktum/a_while_ago_i_sent_an_email_to_my_representative/,"Dear i_flip_sides:

Thank you for contacting me to express your opposition to H.R. 3523, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA).  I appreciate hearing from you on this matter.

As you may know, with my support, CISPA passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 248-168 and is currently awaiting consideration in the Senate. I understand your concerns with regarding strong privacy protections for personal information online and open access to the internet. In fact, I share your passion for these protections and have defended free and open Internet access for all since elected. As you may know, I vehemently opposed H.R. 3261, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), as it threatened to shut down the free exchange of ideas over the Internet and restrict online access. I continue to uphold these principles, and my support for CISPA is in keeping with a staunch defense of the 1st Amendment and our precious personal protections and privacy laws.

First, to be clear, CISPA has nothing to do with SOPA. CISPA's subject matter and intent have absolutely no correlation with the goals of SOPA. Unfortunately, there has been a great deal of misinformation regarding CISPA which as caused some baseless hysteria as a result of both rumor and inaccurate analysis of the legislation. 

The fact is that the Internet, while it is an incredible tool with many advantages and positive potential, can be used as a very powerful weapon against the United States and its citizens. This is the reality of the world in which we live as technology advances and online access becomes even more important to daily life. A blind refusal to accept this truth and to forego the sharing of information regarding threats and risks is not only irresponsible, it is dangerous. We all know someone who has been the victim of stolen identity, credit card fraud, or data theft because his or her personal information was stolen online. Oftentimes these are petty criminals looking for quick financial gain, but these same methods are now beginning to be used by belligerent nations and non-state actors for data-mining, civil and state system disruption, and terrorism. In a hyper-globalized and interconnected world in which most of the systems we depend on for our daily needs, business ventures, access to information, and protection are online, we must have systems in place that allow for open communication regarding potential threats between the federal government and the private sector.

CISPA will empower the private sector to defend their own networks and join with the federal government in a voluntary, cooperative mission to share specifically defined types of information in order to prevent a variety of dangerous cyber attacks. Through the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), the U.S. government will have the ability to share cyber threat intelligence with properly certified private entities in order to help protect U.S. national security. Stringent provisions to prevent unauthorized disclosure of intelligence accompany the bill's information sharing agreement. Regulations are included to protect shared information from being used to gain a competitive advantage, and any information the federal government receives is exempt from public disclosure. Furthermore, no legal action will result from anyone, acting in good faith, that either shares information or chooses not to act on shared information.

While I certainly understand initial reservations about these information sharing goals, the protection of personal privacy is at the heart of this bill and its provisions are in keeping with current U.S. law governing surveillance of private electronic communications. The purpose of this bill is to allow the federal government to share its classified threat information with the private sector, not collect information on Americans citizens. Through a highly regulated partnership with the federal government, the private sector will have the tools to take the lead in defending private systems and networks, thereby ensuring that the federal government does not have to monitor and guard those same networks.

Unlike SOPA, CISPA would not filter content or force websites to shut down. Importantly, CISPA is entirely voluntary. CISPA doesn't require service providers to do anything. CISPA mandates that private parties can only gather information relating to their own rights and property. The bill protects privacy by prohibiting the government from requiring private sector entities to provide information to the government, and by encouraging the private sector to ""anonymize"" any information shared. In addition, the bill requires an independent Inspector General audit of any voluntary information sharing with the government.

Finally, CISPA does not allow for government surveillance, the government to monitor communications, or the government to read private emails. CISPA contains strict provisions forbidding the government from data-mining and only allows the government to use shared cybersecurity information for a cybersecurity purpose, for a national security purpose, to prevent death or serious bodily harm, or to protect minors from sexual exploitation, kidnapping, and trafficking. This is in addition to other protections against the improper use of data.

Foreign and domestic cyber attacks on the federal government, private businesses, banks, law enforcement and private citizens are on the rise and represent an emerging and permanent threat facing this nation. CISPA is a responsible step forward in ensuring that this nation and its citizens are doing all that is possible to defend and preserve our security and way of life against these attacks.

Thank you again for taking the time to contact me.  Having the benefit of your views is important, and I appreciate you sharing them with me.

I remain respectfully,

For all of us who take serious issue with the MPAA's [ratings system](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTL3XMDwY0c) and their corrupting lobbying influence in Washington to pass draconian, self-serving laws, we have just made one of the most powerful allies possible.  Now would be the time to start a twitter campaign to get people to speak out against the MPAA, to either reform or to form a replacement group.  Twitter has been embraced by  celebrities, creating the strongest bridge I know of between the web and Hollywood, and thus real change is possible through that community.  Fixing the MPAA is rather simple:

Step 1. Replace their broken ratings system with one that works.  [Here's my suggestion.](http://i.imgur.com/OzM4A.gif)

Step 2. Demand that they stop lying about piracy, suing their customers, and corrupting Washington with their lobbyists, self-serving legislation, &amp; money.

And the way to do that is to encourage all the smaller and independent studios (Lionsgate, MGM, etc...) to stand by Harvey Weinstein and also threaten to leave the MPAA and form their own trade group.  The independent studios' films are more strictly rated and have the most to gain, while the big six studios basically **ARE** the MPAA.  There's even precedence for this - when [ASCAP was supplanted by BMI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCAP_boycott) - so this is not unheard of or overly idealistic.

TL;DR - Want to fight back against the MPAA? Send messages to celebs on twitter asking them to join Harvey Weinstein in speaking out against them.",,False,,t5_2qxyy,False,,,True,t3_q55z4,http://www.reddit.com/r/cyberlaws/comments/q55z4/want_to_stop_the_mpaa_now_is_the_time_to_act/,
