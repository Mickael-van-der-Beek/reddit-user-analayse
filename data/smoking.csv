Just over 1 year ago I messaged the creator of this sub, and asked him if it was still active.  He turned it over to me, and I turned it from a tobacco sub to a food smoking sub.  You guys have been amazing at posting relevant content, links, pictures, and recipes.  You guys have been helping each other out with advice, feedback, and assistance.  I think we've made great community here.

Over the last 12 months traffic here has more than doubled.  I think we've established ourselves as one of the go to food subs on Reddit.

What else can I do to make this a better place for you guys?  I'm s simple guy.  I don't know CSS (or CCS) or fancy things like that.  I'd still like to get our own personalizes alien at the top.  Does the sidebar need changing?

I'd ask that if you see any non-food related smoking posts, e-cigarette posts, nicotine posts, etc, please flag them. The filter catches most, and even more get flagged, but I still find some occasionally that made it through.  If you see it, flag it.  I'll get rid of it ASAP.

I bought the maverick dual probe thermo, some apple and pecan wood chunks, a couple bags of kingsford, and dedicated this weekend to figuring how to make the damned thing do my delicious bidding. 

I.fucking.love.it. 

I named her Charo. 

I ran it twice on the weekend without food just to get the feel for how to bring it up to temp and keep it where I wanted. Playing with the vents, etc. my clothes smelled like camping all weekend. Awesome! I had never cooked with charcoal before, and was pleasantly surprised with how simple the chimney was to use. Had no problems. 

I invited some friends over tonight and made bacon wrapped dates stuffed with blue cheese, bacon wrapped cream cheese stuffed jalapeños, a couple racks of baby backs, and a butterflied chicken. I brined the chicken. Made some cornbread and coleslaw along side. 

Everything turned out so great! I used methods described on amazing ribs and virtual weber bullet as a guide line, focusing on temperature rather than time. The ribs truly were better than anything I have ever put out using a variety of other methods. Life changing ribs. They had a great smokey flavour and pulled clean from the bone without being mushy. My husband and friends descended on them like starving vultures. The chicken was great too. The only thing that wasn't amazing were the dates, but I think they could have been much better with half the time on the grill. I will try again. 

Anyhow, my mind is whirring with what I'm going to smoke next. I think turkey drum sticks. I didn't take any pictures because I was too excited and forgot. Next time :)

They were dry cured for 7 or 8 hours, then rinsed and rested for 7 more hours in the fridge.  Seasoning is garlic pepper and coarse black pepper. Using a Big Chief box smoker, the first pan of wood was 80% alder and 20% hickory.  Next two pans were small amounts of hickory.  There is a light mist of olive oil for the shine coat.

It's nice to see that people like coming to discuss topics specific to smoking foods, be it meat, cheese, spices, or other.  

I was really impressed with some of the answers that pointed out that BBQ always requires smoke, but smoking does not always require BBQ.  For that reason, I'm keeping r/smoking it's own sub.  I alos feel like questions about smoking salt or spices could get lost in another sub.  

I took this sub over from its creator who originally intended it to be a tobacco smoking sub.  And i did so because I wanted to have a place to specifically discuss smoking foods.  And I'm glad that I found a bunch of like minded folks who want the same.

I encourage cross posting anything that fits in either sub, and will continue to pimp their sub on the sidebar, and direct people there if they have a BBQ specific question.

The biggest challenge with this sub is still the insane amount of inhalant smoking spam that gets posted.  I delete electronic cigarette, online shisha, recreational drug use, and quitting smoking aid posts on the daily.  To make my life a little easier I did some reading and added AutoModerator.  As of immediate the words **""cigarettes, cigarette, cigar, cigars, tobacco, weed, bong, hookah, shisha, vapor, vaporizing, patch, pill""** will get a post automatically removed. 

This list was kinda tricky.  I couldn't include things like Electronic, Trees, Pipe, etc since those seem like they could be brought up in legitimate culinary smoking discussion.  

If anyone sees spam pop up and has a key word for me to add, or you think one of the words I added is too restrictive (""I love to smoke my salmon with weeds from my garden!"") please let me know. I'm hoping some fine tuning will make this sub more on topic most of the time.

On a side note, I can't believe we're over 5200 subscribers already!! I love what we have here. You guys inspire me to try more stuff at home, and I love seeing what you're all making.  Keep the posts coming!

I was thinking about facilitating a Spice Rub Exchange if enough people are interested.  If I get flooded, I'll contact redditgifts about it.  I've hosted home made jam exchanges in the past, and always have a blast.  Comment if you're interested in that.

After pulling, the pork looked like [this](http://i.imgur.com/E01xP).  I then tossed it with a reserved cup of the marinade, threw some cracklins on top, a little salt, and it's ready to go!  

Really delicious, and different than the typical BBQ-sauce pulled pork (which of course, i love too).  It's not my favorite recipe from APL, but it's damn good, and i felt like making it today.

I realize this is not charcoal.  I much prefer charcoal to gas.  I would recommend if you are serious to forget my information and buy a WSM or a Weber Kettle grill.  It is superior frankly.  But if you don't here's an alternative.  So for the guys who are going to post ""Just buy a WSM"" or whateves - I know, I know - that's clearly the first choice isn't it?

**Gas grill smoking:**

Here's how I've done it.  I've been smoking with a gas grill for a while myself and it can produce a pretty good result!

Take off one of the end grills and 'flavor plate' (or whatever they call them) that sits on top of the actual burner/venturi.  You know, [these things](http://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/meoirMwmE65_WLdPiP-lEnA.jpg)...whatever they call them.

I have replaced my 'flavor plate' thing with an actual steel grill from an older BBQ cut to fit.  I have it set so I can adjust it's height (creative modifications).   This way I can adjust how close to the flame the smoker box is if it's catching on fire, or not smoking at all, etc.  I just move it with the tongs and find the 'sweet spot' for the best smoke.  Depending on the weather outside this helps alot!  Then when it's burned it's wood off, I take it off and toss another pre-loaded smoke box to continue the smoke.  I find each box lasts about 30-40 mins.  I have 3 or 4 boxes.  I like [these](http://imgur.com/k0ss654).  I use anywhere from 3 to 5 per smoke.  I get smoke rings on my ribs and pork butt just fine.  Flavor is there too (not as nice as charcoal mind you-but sufficiently awesome nonetheless!)

My ribs take about 4-5 hrs like this.  Butts ...well of course they vary and are done when *they* decide they're done (10 hrs?)

Use the other 2/3 of space that still has the grill plates for cooking.   

Use only the burner/venturi where you've removed the top grill for heat and smoke.

[My gas setup](http://imgur.com/pedjHgl)  note: I was done - just blazing the green stuff (what's that?) at the end.

Practice heating the BBQ up to a steady 200-250 degrees.  

When you're sure of that, get it up to the desired temperature at the same time getting the smoke box smoking.   When it's at temp, and smoking - add your ribs or butt, or whatever.

Now all you have to do is watch the temperature (NOT THE STUPID LID GAUGE (junk)!!!!!  GET A GOOD THERMOMETER - LOTS OF INFO ON THIS AROUND!)  and the smoke.

Now here's another thing I don't necessarily recommend **because it can be dangerous.**  Hear ye, Hear ye!  **YOU CAN BURN YOUR HOME DOWN WITH THIS IF YOU ARE NOT CAREFUL OR TAKE YOUR FACE OFF WHEN YOU LIFT THE LID!**

The back of the grill between the lid and the actual grill usually has a long space for venting out the back.   This creates a lot of air flow through (and smoke).   I have taken *thick* fiberglass rope used for sealing wood-stove doors and run it along that space.  I've attached it with long sheet metal screws with washers at the head and with the screw running *through* the rope and into the lid to keep it in place.   I did this and immediately found DANGER!  HOLY CRAP DANGER!  These grills are *clearly* designed to *vent* the heat.  I was getting my BBQ up to 800 degrees FAST!!!!   I pretty much could have melted the damn thing in, *literally!* 10 minutes or less it heated so fast!   

So I wound up cutting out about 7"" of that seal so there was *some* venting of the heat (and smoke).  I did this on the far side away from where I put the smoke boxes so the smoke will travel *across* the meat.   This helped, but if I leave my BBQ unattended with more than one burner running...well I'll get to climb on a firetruck that night!    

As dangerous as this modification is - it *does* help maintain a more constant temperature with a very low flame on one burner (saves gas too!).  I don't worry about it when it's running like this because it's just not enough heat to melt my deck.

So it's a cautious modification, but it did help seal things up, concentrate the smoke a bit, maintain temp, etc.   You don't need to do this though if you're antsy about safety (or warranty ...MAJOR VOID!).

My ribs and butts work just fine.  They are [tasty](http://imgur.com/bgZ6YPj) and I have no problems finding people to help eat them (or anything I smoke really).

Also, I have a grill still available for quick burgers, dog, steaks etc.   The nice thing for steaks though is I *let* it crank up to that 700-800 degrees danger zone (carefully monitoring it!!!!) and cook my steaks over that intense heat (watch your face opening the lid).  I get a really good Maillard reaction on the outside and juicy sweetness of red and pink on the inside!  Much like Amazing Ribs has described with his super hot steak cooking methods.   Again, gotta babysit that grill the WHOLE TIME!

That's my info.

Edit: I commented on the gas usage below in one of the threads.  I have to say I simply don't see the kind of major propane use people seem to talk about when I do a day of smoking.  I did 10 hrs on these pork butts on Saturday.  [Here](http://imgur.com/u9xOxOc) they are at about the 7 hr mark.  The bone just pulled out beautifully when they were done at about 195 degrees-ish.  I used a tank that I did ribs on 2 weeks prior to that and in between cooked steaks and dogs, etc.  

More grill porn from that setup: [another batch of ribs](http://imgur.com/cawCi1x)

The idea is that it replaces the notebook many of use to track our cooks, but it tracks more information and makes it more social.

It helps you track multiple cookers and foods, cooker and food temps (as well as drawing temp graphs to see patterns), changes to the cook, cook and rest times, and you can post photos throughout the cook as well as of the end product. It also includes KCBS-style competition scoring for your cooks, and integrated discussion and social media so you can get feedback, suggestions and more.

We built this for the BBQ community, so it is completely free to use. Check out my recent sample cook at http://www.bbqpad.com/4/ to see how I used it to smoke a brisket - because we want the community to find this useful, we are really open to ideas and suggestions for improvements and refinements so it is as awesome as possible. Thanks!

I don't have much experience making rubs, so I'm interested in whatever secret ingredients you folks have that I should consider throwing in as well.

I have chunks of mesquite, red oak, and walnut wood - which would you folks recommend for the brisket?

Other than that, I know the key is to keep the smoker temp around 225F, and cook the meat to an internal temp of 185F.  I've heard recommendations to take the meat out once it hits 175F, wrap it in foil and let it stand to finish heating up internally to 185F - is this in general good advice?

Finally, what's the word on the water pan?  Just water, or water and apple cider vinegar, or some other mixture?

Basically I'm trying to figure out what smoker I should buy for fathers day. I've looked around for various reviews but I'm still having troubles settling on the right smoker. 

Due to the way my dad is, ideally the smoker wouldn't require a ton of attention (I'm not really familiar with smokers  so this may be useful or not), it would also be ideally something reasonably priced (the lower the better of course but around $250-$500 would be good, obviously if I can't get anything worth a darn at that price I'll go for what you guys can recommend as a good deal). 

I'm not sure if it should be electric/propane/charcoal based, as I said i'm not too familiar with this but at the moment I don't know of any working outdoor outlets so it would be a little difficult having to run a cord outside with a door/window open. Although, if electric is better then of course I will go for it. Ideally I'd like the smoker to be good for whatever my dad feels like smoking, chicken/pork/beef, but again I'm just a beginner so I'd love some advice on that too.

This will be my first go at it, so I'm wondering if there's anything comparable that's not in the $300 range, or whether I should just go ahead and splurge on the Weber. The only downside to the WSM, as I understand it, is that's it more difficult to do low-temp things like fish, cheese, etc. I'd like to do those things from time to time, but I'd rather not sacrifice the quality of qood barbecue for the option of low-temp smoking. I think I want to avoid electric all together, but was also looking at the Smoke Hollow propane smoker, which seems reasonably priced and might be better for low-temp. I wish the Weber was a little cheaper, but I think I'd rather buy a product I'm completely satisfied with that will have a long life-span. 

Correct me if I'm wrong:
On the one hand I could make the best smoked bbq with the WSM at a higher cost and not really have the option of fish, cheese, etc.
On the other I could spend a little less and be able to do both, but the bbq probably won't stand up to the WSM. Also, the smoker would have a lesser life-span.

Went to the butcher and got a nice pork shoulder 6.25 lbs [http://i.imgur.com/9bkmY.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/9bkmY.jpg)

Took a whole clove of garlic slicing it into chunks that would fit inside [http://i.imgur.com/V61Dy.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/V61Dy.jpg)

Made a mixture of 1/2c olive oil and 1/2c white vinegar and whisked it together [http://i.imgur.com/50EqT.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/50EqT.jpg)

I made small cuts in the pork and push nearly all pieces of garlic inside the slits, them massaged the pork with the oil and vinegar mixture and rubbed it with adobo (the good shit) as my friend said, Goya [http://i.imgur.com/AQ11Z.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/AQ11Z.jpg)

I let it sit in the refrigerator for 18 or so hours. I was aiming for a 6p dinner and with a 6.25 cut, I estimated 1 hour out of the fridge, 11 hours cooking at 225, 1 hour rest in the cooler post cooking, and 30 minutes for ""crisping"", so I got up at 4a to start.

Now my mom got me a master forge smoker [http://i.imgur.com/Q6FBT.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Q6FBT.jpg), not a top of the line model, but I'm learning it's nuances. There is no top vent, which I plan of having installed, and one bottom air hole. I made one modification of installing a raised charcoal grate ala the [brinkmann modifications](http://home.comcast.net/~day_trippr/smoker_mods.htm). With the one bottom air hole, it was, during my first few smokes, a challenge to learn temperature control, but I've learned to, for now, use the door to raise and lower the temp along with my home made damper [http://imgur.com/v89Eg](http://imgur.com/v89Eg) which is the bottom of a soda can bolted to an extra curtain rod. It actually works great.

I used the Minion Method to light it up [http://i.imgur.com/gMMKF.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/gMMKF.jpg) and wood chips soaked and wrapped in foil (two handfuls cherry, one hickory) [http://i.imgur.com/sO3oV.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/sO3oV.jpg)

Assembled the cooker and let it go. I did have to add a little more charcoal 5 hours in, but it was good for the other 6.

After 8 hours
[http://i.imgur.com/QIJxS.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/QIJxS.jpg)

At the 9 and change hour mark I pushed up the heat a little and started spritzing the meat with a mixture of 3/4c vinegar and 1/2c oil with a dash of adobo.

I forgot to take a pic after I took it off, but it was foil wrapped and tossed in a cooler with a towel for an hour. Upon taking it out [http://i.imgur.com/87wW6.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/87wW6.jpg) The scent was heavenly.

I pulled it [http://i.imgur.com/czPnC.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/czPnC.jpg)

This was the smoke ring [http://i.imgur.com/nOskr.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/nOskr.jpg)

Now, my friends recipe calls for it to go back in the oven at 375 for 30 minutes, which I did follow, but will probably not next time, some pieces crisped too much, though it was still kick ass and my guests could not stop eating it. [http://i.imgur.com/eaV6y.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/eaV6y.jpg)

All in all, this was a great experience and I really got to know my smoker a lot better with this longer cook.

Since the start of the grilling season this year I have been posting photo's of my smoked meats on reddit.com/r/smoking and received a lot of positive feedback.  With every post though I would inevitably get asked about what my process was.  For most subreddits this would be the kind of thing that would go into it's FAQ or what not.  However everyones style of BBQ is different so I decided to write up a document that would give the basics of Texas style BBQ.

Around the world BBQ is more popular than ever.  My guess is that it serves as a connection to our past  and satisfies that primal urge of cooking raw meat over a flame.  Across the globe you will find many styles of BBQ.  From in-ground pit smoking, favored in more arctic regions, to open pit rotisserie, favored in tropical locales, to the backyard charcoal pits found all over the USA.  

The means and methods of BBQ are many and varied; however, here in Texas it means two things above all others: using an offset horizontal smoker, and absolutely, positively no sauce.  Now some folks will argue over the use of the offset smoker vs an upright, or even the newer ""egg"" styles.  However, no one will argue over the abstinence of sauce.  Sure BBQ joints all have a sauce, but that's mainly to placate out-of-towners who don't know any better.  Or, as I call them, heathens!  

I can hear the screams from people in the Carolinas now where sauce reigns supreme.  There's a reason for this though.  You see in Texas we want the meat to shine through.  If we, as cooks, do our job right then you should be able to taste the (hopefully) amazing flavor of the meat blended with whichever smoke we chose to use.  We feel that putting any sauce, no matter how good it is, on our meat has just masked any flavor the meat had.

This isn't to say saucing is always bad.  If I'm having a pulled pork or brisket sandwich I'm definitely putting some sauce on it.  But if I'm eating ribs?  All I want is a dry rub.

When I started writing all this down I didn't think it would be all that much.  Now it's been a week since I started writing and what I originally thought would be a quick 250 word post is now sitting at just under five thousand words!  I want to stress though that I am not a professional and this guide is not meant to take you on to be a BBQ cook-off champion.  It is simply meant to help you be a better cook in your own backyard.  

So let's dive in and find out what goes into making Texas BBQ.


**Chapter 1**: *The Cooker &amp; Other Supplies*

**The Pit**

There are numerous styles of BBQ pits, from inexpensive Weber Smoky Mountain (WSM) cookers to giant horizontal offsets that have to be pulled around on a trailer.  I usually recommend something in between.  Just a medium size horizontal offset is really all you need while still having enough room to cook a variety of meats at the same time.  

It's not uncommon to want to do a brisket, a rack of ribs and some sausages all at the same time.   While a WSM would be too small to cook all that, and a trailer rig would be over kill, a medium size horizontal offset will be perfect.  For a frame of reference, my smoker's cooking area is about 3 1/2' x 1 1/2' and I easily did 9 racks of ribs for a party recently (using 2 rib racks).

The single most important thing to look for when shopping for a smoker is the thickness of the steel.  The thinner the steel the more heat will escape.  A nice thick housing is best.  That said you will pay more for a thicker cooker so keep that in mind.  

Now, some purists will tell you, that an offset smoker will not provide optimal time of smoke on meat and that you should get an upright smoker.  I'm not going to lie to you, they are correct.  But guess who has the easier time moving their smoker around -- those with their standing upright, or me with my offset on wheels?  I'll take wheels every time; not to mention the vastly increased cooking area that the offsets provide.

So which one should you buy?  That's really for you to decide.  If all you can budget for is a WSM then get it!  If you have some money to burn then I've seen some at my local store in the four figure range!  Like I said though, the thicker the steel the smoother the cook so get the thickest steel housing that you can afford.

If you do decide to go the offset route I highly recommend modifying it.  Unfortunately, most offsets are designed with the firebox and chimney on opposite sides.  On the surface it may seem that's the way that it should be, but if designed properly they should both be on the same side.  Additionally, a tuning plate under the grill should be in place to force all the smoke to the other end before it can pop up and run back over the meat to the chimney mouth.

That said, it's easy enough to add the tuning plate ourselves and use a dryer hose to ""move"" the chimney mouth to the other end.  While welding the plate into place would be ideal, it's not absolutely needed and these modifications can easily be made with just a drill.

Grillinfools.com has a great pictorial on how to make these modifications.  http://grillinfools.com/blog/2009/03/16/offsethorizontal-smoker-modifications/

If your smoker did not come with a built in thermometer then the first thing you need to do is add one.  Since you're already adding one I recommend you add two!  You will want one on each side so that you can easily monitor both sides of the cooking area.  When you install them be sure to place them so that the sensors are at meat level otherwise they won't give you an accurate reading. 
Other Supplies

Aside from the cooking pit itself, there are a few more things you're going to need before you start cooking.  First up: a chimney starter.  These things are fantastic and can be picked up for less than $20.  Using a chimney starter is very easy and it means that you don't have to use any nasty lighter fluid.

The way they work is by simply wadding up a bunch of newspaper (I use my junk mail!) and shoving it into the bottom and then filling the top with wood chunks.  Then just light the paper on fire and in about 10 minutes you'll be ready to start.

Another item that you will need is a shovel.  Not necessarily a big one, just something big enough to put insert and remove hot coals.  For sanitary reasons you'll want to get some latex gloves (available in the pharmacy section) as well as a squirt bottle or basting mop (I prefer to use the squirt bottle as mops are mainly used when saucing).  The squirt bottle is used for spritzing, this will keep the meat moist so you will also need a liquid for that bottle.  Water is certainly ok, but I prefer to add the flavor of Apple Cider Vinegar.  You can also use a fruit juice if you prefer (Apple juice is very common).  

You will also need some clean dish towels and some bath towels (this may sound strange but you'll find out why a little while later - I promise!).  Finally most meats need to be wrapped at some point during the cook.  One popular wrap is foil, sometimes referred to as the Texas crutch, as it acts as an incubator and speeds up cook times.  I prefer to use basic parchment paper which is located in the same aisle as the foil.  The reason we want to use the parchment paper over foil is to avoid cooking to fast and give the meat time to tenderize.

The last thing I want to talk about before we get to the wood is a fire pit.  The single biggest mistake I made when starting out was to just add cold wood to the firebox as the temperature dropped below my target.  The problem with that method is that it can take to long for the new wood to ""catch up"" to where you need it to be.  For this reason I started using a fire pit.  Cold logs are added to the fire pit where they are turned to coals, which are then shoveled into the firebox on the smoker.

The added bonus of the fire pit is that it keeps me warm at 2am when I'm cooking a brisket for the next day!

Finally we get to the wood.  This is considered by some to be the most important thing when it comes to Texas BBQ, even more important than the smoker you cook in!  I personally prefer to use a mixture of three types.

For starting my fire I use hickory chunks, for the main fire I use aged post oak and every hour or so I will toss in some mesquite for flavor.  There is no one single best wood to use and a lot of people like to use apple wood or cherry wood for a sweeter taste.  This all comes down to personal preference so do some experimenting and see what you like. 

The important thing with wood is to get it aged.  That means you want wood that's been sitting in a nice dry place for 6+ months after being cut.  This will provide you with a nice long burn with plenty of flavorful smoke.
Prepping the Pit

The last thing that you need to do before you start cooking is to burn in your new smoker.  This means filling up the firebox and letting it go for a few hours to burn out all the oils that were applied to the metal during construction and shipping preparations.

The last thing you want is for those chemicals to get in to your food and make you sick.  Usually you can tell when the process is done because you won't smell any more nasty/funky smells coming from the pit.

While your doing this you can calibrate your pit by laying out slices of bread across the cooking area and seeing how dark each slice gets after 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes.  You can even run the test for longer than that if you'd like.  This will show you where your smoker is at it's hottest and coldest points.  Now you know where to center your meat for even cook times.

Once this is done you will want to put in a bowl for water (or another liquid of your choosing).  This bowl can go underneath the main grill and should be placed near the firebox to ensure that it boils off and releases it's steam to assist with keeping the meat moist.  When you're cooking make sure the bowl is always full of whatever liquid you chose to use.

Meat was one rack of beef ribs. Set up was as follows:

- Standard 22"" Weber Kettle
- Standard Kingsford briquettes, in various quantities. Set up for two-zone cooking.  
- Maverick dual digital temp probe. One beside the ribs, one in them.
- Large pan of water under the ribs.

The problem was that I was having a really hard time with temperature fluctuations. Am I correct in assuming that the amount of coals used is probably the most important factor in controlling temperature, followed by the positioning of the lower and upper vents?

Next question: Since it seems that I would have to use a relatively small amount of coals to keep a consistent 225F (my target), how does one ideally manage to maintain that temperature over a long period of time? Can you just add more unlit coals periodically or do you have to pre-light them? Any other tricks you guys use?

I have access to good quality Lazzari mesquite lump charcoal. Does this stuff burn longer?

Finally, the kettle I'm using is on the older side. The star-shaped vent cover on the bottom is bent up slightly and does not seal very well. Will this be an issue in controlling temperature (its position seemed to have very little effect on internal temp, although it could have also been because i was using too many briquettes)?

He stalked me for a while and found my new found love of smoking.  

Right before Xmas I got a package from [Law18](http://www.reddit.com/user/law18).  It included [3 store bought and 1 home made rub with a set of instructions](http://i.imgur.com/7wbjJ.jpg).

It's taken me 3 months of smoking other things to get up the courage to try ribs.  I decided it was long enough.  Law18 said ""What you need to do is cake the ribs in the rub. A little bit of rub on the ribs will not do the job, you need it to be really on there, my rule of thumb is, if it is not falling off, there is not enough on there.""  So I opened the ribs, rinsed them off, patted them dry, and began caking it on.  

I let that sit while I prepared my WSM.  20 minutes later, [they were on and I was ready](http://i.imgur.com/A0wMO.jpg).  I started with Apple wood chunks that I had left, and then the wife came home with a new bag of hickory.

About 7 hours later (I lost track, so it could have been anywhere from 6-9) [I had this waiting for me](http://i.imgur.com/A9tBK.jpg).  The meat was definitely done, but I couldn't slide the bones out.  Maybe I needed more time?  Not sure.

But them on the table and they [looked just fine to me](http://i.imgur.com/cey7i.jpg).  I cut in to them and put em on plates. The look and smell were amazing.  Served them up [with asparagus, zucchini, crook neck squash and some mashed acorn squash with maple syrup and cinnamon](http://i.imgur.com/UQr8H.jpg).

They were fantastic!  I'll be honest, the rub was much spicier than I imagined.  But my wife adores spicy foods.  I scraped most of the rub off, which left an amazing flavor and the smoke really stood out.

After about 4 hours I put it in a tin foil tub with some beef broth I had left over from the injection.  I covered it well and stuck it back on the smoker. I went with the crutch since it was my first time and I didn't want to risk having it taste like crap.  I like beef a lot more than pork and will most likely be doing these a lot more often.  

What I noticed was that it I didn't have a definite smoke ring.  I put in a probably (6) 2 oz chunks of hickory and a couple half burnt chunks from my last smoke.  The wood I am using I bought from a firewood lot and came as split logs.  I cut them down to smaller chunks myself. I guess it just seems like I am not generating much smoke.  Maybe it was that I ""braised"" the smoke ring out of the meat.  What do you think?  When you use the crutch do you guys add any liquid?

One of my favorite recipes from Serious barbecue (who knows if it's true or not, but Perry Lang says this recipe won him Grand Champion at the 2005 World Pork Expo, whatever that is).

Started off with a 7 1/4 lb bone-in [pork butt](http://i.imgur.com/XBcfH) (I usually go for a bit bigger butt, 9# or so, but this was the biggest the butcher had).

Injected it with a mixture of apple juice, brown sugar, salt, Worcestershire, soy and water.  Let it [soak it up](http://i.imgur.com/GDzEi) at room temp for 2 hours.

Patted her dry and then applied a [""mustard moisturizer""](http://i.imgur.com/f0yK1) -- yellow mustard, Worcestershire, apple cider vinegar, and water -- and sprinkled it with a [seasoning blend](http://i.imgur.com/uN0M4) -- Ancho chile powder, sweet paprika, dark brown sugar, dry mustard, garlic salt, black pepper, salt, old bay.

Now the good stuff.  6 hours at 250 degrees, spraying it with watered-down apple juice [half-way through](http://i.imgur.com/AOtwD) till it reached an internal temp of [160ish](http://i.imgur.com/xHTDO).

Uh oh, you're saying to yourself -- what the hell is that foil for?

At this point, I took the butt out of the Egg, placed it on foil in a disposable lasagna pan, and poured over the [""wrapping mixture""](http://i.imgur.com/xHTDO) -- honey, light brown sugar, mustard, water, and a little bit of butter.  Mmmmmmm.

[Back into the Egg](http://i.imgur.com/R2WWS) until 193 degrees (a little less than 3 hours).

Then it was naptime.  One hour rest, towel-wrapped in a [cooler](http://i.imgur.com/DoxoF).  (I did put the lid down.)

It emerged looking like [this](http://i.imgur.com/muInL) and VERY tender.

A more generous sprinkling of the seasoning blend and [back in the Egg](http://i.imgur.com/P4oiG) for a half hour.

Time for the sauce.  It's my homemade sauce with a bit more apple cider vinegar added as well as 1 cup of apple jelly, 1 TBS of crushed red pepper, and 1 peeled green apple grated on a Microplane grater.  Gave it a nice coating and [back in the egg](http://i.imgur.com/vHAbt) for 20 minutes to tighten it up.  I should have mentioned before -- you can see it's now on a cooling rack -- much easier to transport it around this way.

[After the final 20 minutes](http://i.imgur.com/P6TYH)

[After the pull](http://i.imgur.com/UTEbi)

[Thought it needed a bit more sauce](http://i.imgur.com/8YR3Q)

So, that was my Sunday.  It came out fantastic.  The crushed red pepper added to the sauce definitely gives it some heat, so if i ever make this for sensitive palates (not sure why the hell i would do that, though), i'd tone down that step by half or more.

I have a couple of grills (1 propane, 1 charcoal) and am really looking to get a smoker. I've used my Weber charcoal grill for this from time to time, but I feel that it isn't as good as a dedicated smoker for various reasons. 

I live in a suburb, with neighbours and houses close by. We try to be good neighbours, and never give anyone an opportunity to complain about us. (As you can tell by the spelling of Neighbour... Canadian.)

So maybe a stupid question, but do smokers emit a lot of smoke? I have my eye on some processes that would take 10 - 12 hours or more... would this smoke out our neighbours and cause complaints? Thanks for any advice!

Seasoning a pork shoulder with sea salt is no big deal, but the banana leaves seem pretty crucial to the overall flavor, and I have no idea of how I would incorporate them into the smoke.

He smoked garfish once and was hooked but outside of that he doesn't understand the possibilities...I used to work as a chef, we had a gas 'Hark' hot smoker and a 44 gallon drum with a burner and a sawdust bowl which we attached to an old, but working, steel fridge and used as a really cold smoker. As I was on the pastry section though, I'm really only familiar with the cold smoker, never used coals before so I'm just wondering where to go from here? We picked up some lump charcoal, some hickory chunks and a small propane blowtorch that you can just twist off then on to a new bottle, but if someone could please give me some ideas on seasoning it, maybe some websites for good recipes, I read that thread on thermometers and I havto get an A-Maze-N cold smoker...any Aussies on here? Particularly in Victoria? I live out in the sticks and only get to Melbourne once a month so can anyone recommend any good shops or websites that i can get that stuff from and that deliver? That would be awesome...I can repay you in pictures of short rib...mmm..short rib",,False,self,t5_2qkku,False,,,True,t3_14haq9,http://www.reddit.com/r/smoking/comments/14haq9/just_bought_a_weber_smokey_mountain_now_what/,

Edit 3: The only serious smoking I have done before this was a pork shoulder overnight (7 or 8 hours), that came out pretty damn good. Never have done a brisket, but I've been meaning to do it for over a year now.

Got your standard UDS setup, 55 gallon drum with a 26.5"" Weber grate about 4.5inches from the top.

I bought an 18pounder at a supply shop, and now realize this is quite a bit larger than what is usually used. Should I just trim the edges and triple a (5-6t pound) recipe? Cooking temp, cooking time?

Edit Thanks to all the helpful tips and links, I've trimmed and dry rubbed her. Just waiting til tomorrow night to fire up the UDS.:

It seems lately that there have been a lot of brisket-related questions popping up in /r/BBQ. I've answered one or two questions on my method when cooking brisket, and although I'm not the most experienced backyard cooker, I do have a hard-on for learning as much as I can from other people. I make it a point to pass on what I've learned when the opportunity presents itself, so below is some copypasta from my reply to a question regarding my methods for cooking this big slab of meat.

I know that this isn't the only way to prep and cook a brisket, and it might not even be the ""best"" method. Then again, ""best"" is a subjective evaluation. Anyway, here's how I do. What about you guys?

-=-

If you're a seasoned smoker, then many of the same rules apply to this low-and-slow hunk of muscle. For the sake of clarity (and not brevity), I'll go over some of the more important points of cooking a brisket.

**To brine or to rub?**

The rule of thumb when deciding whether to brine or rub is fairly simple. If you have lots of surface area but not a lot of volume (like with ribs), use a rub, and get cooking right away. If you've got tons of volume but not a lot of surface area (like with pork shoulder or, in this case, a brisket), use a brine and let it work its way through the meat over time. More specifically, introduce extra fluids to the meat. In this case, inject with a solution of your choice. With briskets, I let the meat do the flavoring for me, so I tend not to go overboard with spices and stuff. You can easily get by with a ""dalmatian"" rub of just salt and pepper.

**Rendering...**

The key ingredient to any well-smoked piece of meat is temperature. Three temperatures for brisket, to be exact. The first is your cooker temp. I prefer to cook at 225F since it's hot enough to get the meat up to temp in a reasonable amount of time, but cool enough to do it slowly and safely. It's a balance. Some folks will bump it up to as much as 275F, but that's too hot for my tastes.

The second and third temperatures are the point and the flat. These two muscles in the meat are marbled differently and will reach your target meat temperatures at different times and at different rates. I use the temperature probes that I bought with my [Rock's BBQ Stoker](https://www.rocksbarbque.com/) and keep tabs on both of the probe temps on my iPhone or iPad. 

Probe placement makes a difference, too. For the flat, I'll insert the probe near the center of the muscle along its longitudinal axis. Be careful not to punch through to the other side of the meat, or you'll get bum readings. For the point, I'll insert the probe near the center of the muscle, also orienting it along the longitudinal axis of the meat. Be mindful to not punch through the interstitial fat layer, since the fat will increase in temp much faster than the muscle, and you'll get bad readings there, also.

**Ssssssmokin!**

A common misconception with smoking is that visible white smoke is necessary to impart the smoke flavor and to give the meat a ""smoke ring."" The truth is that the flavor you seek does not require visible smoke as a carrier. In fact, visible smoke is actually soot, which carries carcinogens, and that's bad juju, boss. So long as your fire is hot enough (and oxygen scarce enough) to char your smoke wood, you're doing alright. Charring the wood produces nitrates which interact with the myoglobin in the meat, and that's what gives you the smoke ring and smoke flavor.

A note on the smoke ring is that it's easy to get a smoke ring by using sodium nitrite curing salt on the surface of the meat. The salt reacts with the myoglobin and voila, you've got a smoke ring, whether or not it's ""earned."" Not really a true indication of a well-smoked piece of meat.

Science!

**Quit yer stallin'!**

About 3 to 4 hours into the cook, you'll experience what's known as the ""stall."" The meat will reach 150F to 160F and stay there for quite some time - we're talking hours, here. What's happening is that the fat is beginning to render, and as it works its way to the surface and evaporates away, it draws heat away and cools the meat. This is the same as the effect that sweat has on the surface of your skin; that is, you're watching evaporative cooling taking place.

There are two schools of thought on what to do with the stall. The first is just to let it do its thing. Maintain your chamber temperature and monitor your meat temperatures, and have another beer. 

The second school of thought is...

**Crutch much?**

The ""Texas Crutch"" or, more simply, ""the crutch"" is the act of creating a hot, humid environment for your meat to cook in. You can achieve this by putting the whole durned thing into a covered aluminum pan with a cup of apple juice or some such fluid, or by double wrapping the brisket in aluminum foil with 1/4 cup of apple juice and putting it back in the cooker. Alternatively, you can just use butcher paper and wrap it like a burrito, but I've never done that, so I can't comment on its effectiveness. No matter how you crutch it, you'll see the internal temp bust right through the stall and start climbing to your target temps.

Two important things, however. The first is to leave your temperature probes in the meat for the crutch, or to reinsert them if you've removed them to wrap the meat. The second is to not use a steel pan with aluminum foil to cover it. Steel, aluminum, liquid, and heat get together for an orgy of science and electricity that will cause the aluminum to melt, welding (fusing?) it to the steel pan.

**Targeting...**

The target temperature for a brisket is debatable. Something we know for a fact, however, is that collagen renders at about 190F. This is the minimum target temperature you want to achieve before pulling the meat from the cooker. Other folks will swear by a temperature range of 203F to 206F. I pull at 195F for a happy medium, and haven't been displeased with my results.

**Rest and Relaxation**

At this point, you've rendered fat and collagen into liquid form inside the meat. These liquids exist in isolated pockets in the muscle tissue, and you'll need to allow the meat to rest so that the liquids redistribute into the interstitial spacing between the muscle fibers. This is how meat which is essentially overcooked can be both tender *and* moist.

What I do is line the bottom of an empty cooler with a towel, and then place the cooked brisket into the cooler - foil, probes, meat, and all. The towel doesn't act as an extra insulator to keep heat in the cooler, it's just something to keep from melting the bottom of the cooler. You do, however, want to close the lid to trap the radiating heat inside of the cooler.

I monitor the meat temperature during the rest, and when it drops to 165F, I'll begin serving the brisket.

**Aaaaand CUT!**

The two muscles in the brisket have grains in different orientations in relation to one another. The grain of the flat runs along the length of the brisket, so you can slice that guy along the width of the meat. 1/4"" thick slices should hold up, just fine. Slice the flat until you reach the point where the flat and the point meet. If the meat crumbles under the pressure of a sharp knife, then you've cooked too long. Try pulling the meat from the cooker at a lower target temp next time.

The grain of the point runs the width of the brisket, so you want to cut along the length of the brisket. Just turn the remaining cut ninety degrees in one direction and start slicing. This piece of meat is more marbled than the flat is, so you'll have to cut thicker than the 1/4"" cuts of the flat. 3/8"" to 1/2"" will do. Some folks will separate the flat from from the point on this remaining hunk of meat to trim the fat, but I just leave it be.

Serve the meat immediately upon slicing, because all of that rendered fat and collagen will evaporate pretty quickly, and reveal the meat for what it is: overcooked. Anything you don't cut should be wrapped in cellophane to prevent moisture loss.

* Beer oak - One of my local craft brewery barrel ages some of their beers (If you live on the east coast, you may be familiar with Weyerbacher Heresy, which is a barrel-aged version of their Old Heathen imperial stout, and Insanity, which is an aged version of their Blithering Idiot barleywine). I'd seen something on their site about how they sell the used barrels for something like $35 apiece.

I love it because he made it from scratch out of a metal garbage can (which makes it looks super white trash and is hilarious). It uses a hotplate burner as the heat source.

The only issue is that the walls are too thin to retain sufficient heat.

My initial attempt with the smoker ended up burning through the chips way too fast, as I attempted to compensate for heat losses by providing higher heat, but when I dialled back the heat it didn't seem like the chips were smoking properly.

The meat ended up absorbing a lot more of the smoke flavour than I expected but needed to be cooked still afterwards as the surface barely received enough heat to even effect the rub. The total time in the smoker was probably ~3 hours minus all the time messing around with changing the wood chips and messing with the temperature(at which point I decided to cut my losses and cook it because the temps weren't getting high enough).

**My questions for you guys are:**

* What temps should I be aiming at to provide sufficient smoke without burning through the chips too fast?

* Is there a time relation between cold vs hot smoking that I can use to calculate how long to cold smoke before I cook?

* Are there specific recipes that you could suggest that work better with cold smoking than hot?

I realize that I could insulate the smoker to raise the internal temperature but I thought I'd give cold smoking a shot.

Im a sheetmetal fabricator and a food lover that loves to try different things, which recently has been smoked food! Here in NZ smoking food isnt as big of a thing as it is in America, so i need a bit of advice from the pros.

The smoker that i have built sits on my BBQ where the grill would usually sit, all made from stainless steel with a removable rack and a temperature gauge. Measures around 350x550x200mm

The problem i seem to have is that when the gas is turned all the way down on the bbq, the coldest temperature i can get is around 200F with the lid open about 20mm/1 inch or about 240/250F with it closed.

This seems to be too hot to do salmon properly, because that white protein shit comes oozing out a tad. 

What is the temperature most people aim for when smoking? And do you have any suggestions on how to lower the temperature of my smoker? Im wanting to try some ribs but dont want to screw them up if its too hot.

Oh and what sized woodchips should i use? Currently im using smallish chips (can be seen at the bottom of smoker)

Or is my setup just shithouse and need to be completely redesigned?

[http://i.imgur.com/mP2RPsg.jpg](Coolabah Gas Smoker)

Day Before: ""Today""

1. Can you put on too much yellow mustard ?
2. Can you put on too much rub ?
3. My rub and mustard turned into thick brownish paint is this normal ? (Kind of worried as here in Australia this type of cooking is rare and I have never seasoned anything with more than a light sprinkle of spices before putting on what you Americans call a Grill and we call a BBQ).
4. 3.2kg / 7lb Boston Butt in the fridge wrapped in plastic with mustard + rub.

Day of the smoke: **(Is it acceptable to drill a small hole in the side of my smoker for my probe wires ? I will have no problem holding heat as I live in the sub tropics.)**

1. 6am start, I have a Redi check wireless thermometer with both Meat and BBQ probes, Hickory Chunks (Not chips), 9kg Gas + spare 9kg gas I use for my grill, Gas Smoker I seasoned the other day.

2. Temperature is fairly hot here during the day 30 C / 86 F My Smoker while seasoning was holding at around 130 C / 266 F in the afternoon on lowest setting. I would like to stay in the 225 / 250 F range but would 250 - 300 F still give me a good end product ?

3. Where do I place my meat probe ? Into the centre of the tubes ? To me the tubes seem to be the biggest part of the butt with no bone close by to put the temperature off. Am I thinking correctly here ?

4. How many chunks should I start with and how do I know to add more ? **&lt;---- This is really the only thing that is giving me a little bit of panic.**

4. I am ready for the stall, **I SHALT NOT PANIC AND LEAVE IT THE FUCK ALONE!!**

5. What temperature should I remove my butt ? I have read about this and every ones idea is different. I would like an easy juicey pull but would also like to carve the money muscle and tubes. Suggested temps please ?

6. I want to leave the smoker and meat alone as much as possible, will not basting (During the whole process) and not wrapping at the stall still leave me with a great result ?

7. I have foil, towels and a cooler ready for the resting period.

8. I have yet to buy beer for this mammoth undertaking, Am I leaving this too late in my preparations ?

We usually just do a cheese and crackers type of dinner, so I was thinking I would smoke the salmon and then cut it into very thin slices for the crackers.  I would imagine it would be better to cure/use a rub (I'm not sure if they're the same thing) rather than put it in a brine.  
If I do just cure it, how exactly does that work?  I just put it on the fish and rub int into the meat as best I can and leave it for a few hours, then wash off the excess salt?  I guess my confusion with a cure is because I find it hard to believe that doing that would penetrate flavour down into the meat and just just be on the surface of it.

But do you guys have any mixtures for a cure I could try out on this fish?  Is it better to give salmon lots of smoke or very little?  

Edit:  Many thanks for all the help guys!  I think I'm actually going to try a brine tonight and I'll smoke it tomorrow.

A quick note on using galvanized steel as a firebox:  I've heard the rumors and I've seen the smoker blogs.  I tried to run down the source but it goes back too far.  According to both OSHA and the FDA there's no problem using galvanized steel in this way.

Are there any charcoal rings that I could employ so I don't have to use so much charcoal to get a smoke?  It took an entire bag of briquettes just to fill it up halfway.

I used the Minion method and had to close every single vent, even the top one, to keep the temperature at or below the 250 mark for the first 2 hours or so.  After that I was able to open the top vent all the way and keep the WSM at temp, then towards the end I was finally able to crack only one of the dampers at the bottom.  Anything more and the heat would skyrocket.

In the end, though, the turkey legs and SL style ribs turned out excellent, and I am excited to own this product.  I noticed that the ribs were cooked perfectly in terms of smoke flavor, but that the smoke flavor/color did not permeate all the way through the turkey legs.  I imagine this has to do with the thickness of the meat, and that cooking meats with non-uniform thickness is not the best idea if you want a uniform smoke flavoring.

Sparked by following this subreddit I bit the bullet on a WSM and Maverick Thermo setup.  2 tasty weekends in:

* 1 Pork butt
* Chix breasts
* Italian Sausages

**weekend 2 (hickory):**
* 1 brisket
* 2 x chix drumsticks
* pork belly
* st. louis style dry ribs

I've gotten a bit better at keeping the temperature in the 200-225 range but still improving my technique.  However, both weekends I ended up having the finish the ""big"" meats in the oven because they were taking so long!  I was expecting cook times based on recipes in the ""smoke and spice"" book. First weekend was 4lb pork butt that would not go above 150* even after 7-8hrs.  I wrapped it in foil and it shot up to much higher temp but still was tough.  I ended up putting it into the oven at 250 for another 3-4 hours before it would pull.  This last weekend was the brisket and the ribs which after about 7 hours in the smoker at 200-225 still needed another 3-4 hours in the oven. What gives? One thing I thought of was that my thermos, which I generally placed at the edge of the grate, were giving artificially high temperatures and should have been placed closer to the meat. Regarding wood chips, I noticed that they were burning rather fast and I had to open the small window to add some more often then I would have liked.  Would it help to soak them longer? I figured that would add cook time but since I got the thermos back to the 225 range rather quickly I didn't think it would add THAT much time.Thanks for the help in advance!

1. Meathead recommends you drill the hole for the Party-Q between the cooking grate and the charcoal grate [like so...](http://amazingribs.com/images/accessories/partyq_and_smokenator.jpg) Anyone have experiences that say otherwise?  

2. Have any of you tried using it with the Smokenator versus a bare charcoal method like the Minion Method?  

3. Meathead recommends a 1"" hole for the Party-Q but I have seen other places recommend a 7/8"" hole. Thoughts?  

4. Did you also drill a smaller hole for the probe or do you just run it under the lid?  

5. What about the vents? From your playing around have you found a vent setting that seems to work the best?

My question is: What is your typical setup? Do you all have 2 thermometers (one surface, one meat) in at all times? Do you just have one on the surface and stab the meat with a separate one occasionally?

I bought a Brinkmann knock off from Canadian Tire, on sale. 

**The question I have is:** How much does the amount of water affect the desired internal temperature of the smoker, in relation to the amount of coals burning? 

*Example:* For my 1st experimental smoke, I used roughly 1.5 scoops of charcoal from my charcoal lighter. The max temp I was able to achieve was roughly 150 degrees. I desired about 175-200 degrees. I put maybe 1.5 - 2 Litres of water in the water bowl. I shook the coal bowl to dissipate the ash, periodically. I played around with the damper, too. 

This vertical smoker is *way* different than my regular charcoal bbq. 

My sausages, lamb chops, and veggies came out better than expected, but took longer than I desired.

I'm in ATX, so finding post oak is not a problem.  I'm about to buy a quarter cord of post oak for smoking a brisket on my modified-COS.  I hope to get 2-4 smokes out of it.  I'll be smoking a packer brisket each time (plus add-ons due to the size of the smoking area.  I plan to set a pit fire and just shovel coals into the smoke-box.

on to the questions!:

1. Is a 1/4 cord enough for 2-4 smokes?  they sell other quantities.

2. How different is doing an all-wood smoke relative to charcoal (i've used briquettes and lump).  More maintenance? less?

3. is there anything else i should be aware of?  How consistent is the smoke flavor across multiple smokes?  I generally use briquettes and wrap pecan chunks in foil to smolder slowly.

as always, thanks for you comments, in advance.

oh! this is a test run for the *important* smoke.

UPDATE:  The smoke went very well this sunday.  It took some time to get the fire going.  What I really needed to realize was that it takes a bit of wood to sustain some coals, but once I did that it went smoothly.  I had it on the smoker for about 10 hours (finished in the oven) and went through about 1/3 of the 1/4 cord.  I found the temperature to be MUCH more steady relative to adding unlit briquettes (lit briquettes would be about the same I suppose.   I think if the whole operation was performed on the smoker there would be the right amount of smoke flavor, but to compensate, i put one full log on that had not fully turned to coals, i think two would have been better.

I picked up a 4lb bone in butt from the local butcher. I am using a Weber kettle, so I banked about 50 coals against one side, and put about 14 lit coals on top of that. I situated the vents, so my temperature at the dome was right around 300 (figured it would be lower at the grate) - Everything started off great. I put the butt on at 12:00 PM - Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worst. After about hour number 5, my fire started trying to die down, so I had to bring it back up. Last night around 9:30, the temperature of the meat was at 180, and the dome temp on the grill was about 200 degrees. We ended up having to finish it in the oven, and finally ended up eating dinner at 10:30 last night. :(

I think my mistake here may have been that I was removing the lid pretty much every hour to add water to my water pan, and add some wood.

Time to figure out a plan of attack.,nstutsman,9,4,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/smoking/comments/1c5x0e/prepping_to_host_a_bbq_this_weekend_for_coworkers/,"I decided to host a BBQ for my co workers and their families this weekend.  I'm handling the meats, they all BYOB and a picnic side to share.

For my part, I decided to smoke a pork shoulder, smoke chicken wings, ABT's (Atomic Buffalo Turds), Smoked Garlic Bacon Meatballs, and some hot dogs for the kids and whiney folk.

The shoulder is close to 10lbs -- Dammit.  Never really smoked one more than about 5.5lbs ever.  This thing is a beast!  Definitely better start early.  Also have about 10lbs of chicken wings. Planning on 48 +/- Turds, and never done the Meatballs before, so whatever I can get out of 2 lbs.

I have a 18.5"" WSM and a 22.5"" Weber Performer at my disposal.  Also, a Weber Q220, but that is mostly useless for smoking other than keeping things warm.  I figure I can prolly finish the dogs off on that for the kids.

One thing I'm definitely not sure on is how long the WSM will hold heat.  I realize I'm gonna need to start it at least by midnight the night before.  Not a big deal for me as I have a remote Thermometer and it's loud enough to wake me.  I bought the WSM used last fall, and have maybe smoked with it 6 times, but they were always shoulders less than 5 lbs, or things that didn't take more than four hours.  The shoulders I did have to add fuel after about 5-6 hours I think, so maybe I should just use that as my gauge.

My plan is to use WSM for the shoulder and the turds, and utilize the performer for the wings and the meatballs.  Both of those items seem like they would survive well in a crock-pot environment or oven if need be depending on finishing times.

Chamber 1 would hold the electric smokers. Standard sealing door on the front, for front loading--like a refridgerator, almost. Air flow would be from the vents or I guess dampers on the side, up through Chamber 1, exhaust to Chamber 2 and then on out the roof. Chamber 2 would be for cold smoking.

Hot mode:

* Chamber 1 hot mode: hot smoke on the MBES and standard Big Chief usage. 
* Chamber 2 hot mode: just passes the smoke through.

Cold mode:

* Chamber 1 cold mode: just uses the Big Chief slightly open to generate smoke.
* Chamber 2 cold mode: food goes here, hopefully all the heat is retained inside the Big Chief and Chamber 1, so primarily smoke comes though here. Thinking maybe adding some vents up here for temperature control.

I'm having a hard time keeping it right around 220. The thermo only goes up to 220 on the scale, but the dial will continue to rise, so I'm estimating it gets up to 260, but when the charcoal gets low it will drop down to about 200. I'm using hickory charcoal and hickory wood on top of that. I just watch the temp and the smoke to determine when to add wood or charcoal. For the past hour I've managed to keep it right at 220 by adding just a coal or two at a time. This is gonna take some practice. 

Will the variation in temperature cause problems?

Also, does it matter if sometimes the smoke gets low? Seems like the temperature is the most important part. I try to keep the smoke maximized the whole time, but it's a bit tedious to check this thing every 5-10 mins for 10 hours.

Also, I believe it's about 5 pounds, with bone in, skin on, so should 8 hours be enough? When should I check the inside temperature of the meat?

About the skin being on. I couldn't exactly trim the skin off, and I marinated it with the skin on after scoring it. My knife isn't the sharpest knife, even after sharpening it, because I'm kinda cheap, but the marinade seems to have taken, the skin is nice and brown.

Over the weekend I won a Char Griller Trio.  It's a grill that does LP, charcoal and has a side fire box.  I'm already working on modding it (baffle, extending chimney, thermometers) and I'm preparing for the first smoke, hopefully this weekend.  

I want to make sure I'm going to do this correctly.  I'm planning on doing a pork loin as it was recommended for beginners.  Does this sound right?

Night before: make dry rub and apply to meat, let sit in fridge for 12 hours or more.

Day of: take meat out of fridge to come to room temp.  start full chimney of chunk charcoal and put in side fire box.  take a handful of wood chunks and place on the charcoal.  Wait for temps to get to 225* or so and throw on the pork loin.  Check temps every 30 mins or so and adjust vents as needed.  Cook loin to 155* and then foil it and pull.  Let it sit 20-30 mins and slice and enjoy!!

Am I missing anything?  Do I need to soak the wood chips?  Any flavor recommendations for pork?  Do I need a water pan where the smoke enters the cooking chamber?  Do I need to put the charcoal from the starter onto more unburned charcoal or will I be ok with one starter full since this won't take very long?  Sorry for all the questions, just wanna make sure I got this.  Thanks!!

**EDIT 1**: Thanks for all the help.  I'm going to pull the meat closer to 145* now and foil it and let carryover take it the rest of the way.  

I have a couple other questions though.  My firebox has the charcoal tray and it also has grates.  The charcoal tray has a bottom and grates on it as well.  See pic [here](http://www.chargriller.com/components/com_virtuemart/shop_image/product/Ashpan_Fire_Grat_4cb401ca68104.jpg).  Do I put the charcoal on the charcoal tray grates or do I put it in the tray itself?  And should I remove the cooking grates in the firebox when smoking?

It wasn't canned, through pressure. It couldn't have been, she was very poor, and the jar had wax paper covering the lid.

* How many charcoal briquettes for my first tests? 

* I've been trying to figure out what 'blue smoke' is? How to achieve it, what to look for when I've got it, how to correct when I don't. I've heard that to much smoke is bad so I want to learn from the experts. 

* I understand that smoking meats with propane is a 'no no' cause the byproduct of burning propane is water that doesn't mix well with the smoke. So why the water pan in so many pictures of smokers?

* Do I really need a rib rack or do you have some suggestions of alternatives?

* I've got a few meat thermometers and I'm not sure they're any good. Is there a simple cheap way of testing / calibrating them?

Fast forward 7.5 hrs the 2 chickens I put in tasted FANFUCKINGTASTIC! Though I had 2 problems that I'd like some advice on before trying again.

Unfortunately due to the days events I didn't get started till mid afternoon. I figured it would take 6 hrs tops for  2 - 3.5 pound chickens. It took over 7.5 hours. 

I think I may have had issues with my temperature gauge. I was trying to smoke at 220 but ended up turning it up to 250 for the last 1.5 hours. I used approx 100 charcoals, 4 mesquites and got it going with a charcoal chimney. Had to re-stoke and add more charcoals for the last 1.5 hours. I'm pretty sure that If I hadn't bumped it up to 250 the birds would have sat there all night. 

My question is, how inaccurate are the factory temp gauges? I thought 220 was the proper temp to smoke chicken. Am I wrong or should I get an aftermarket temp gauge? 

Second (and more serious) problem: Black soot like substance on the birds. The top chicken had more soot on it than the bottom chicken. What can I do to prevent this? I suspect it is a venting problem. I was playing around with the vent covers to keep my temp where I wanted it. I alternated all of the vent covers including the top one on the lid from fully open to 1/2 open depending on the heat. 

We were able to wipe off most of the soot and the chickens were incredible tasting (even though we didn't eat till nearly 11:00). Well worth the wait and I'm sold on smoking!

It's been a little chilly lately and I've been too busy so this past weekend was the first time I was able to give it a go.  

**Setup**: The PartyQ was super easy to install. All I needed to do was drill a 7/8"" hole in the side of my kettle. I ended up going with [Meathead's](http://amazingribs.com/tips_and_technique/smokenator_tips.html) suggestion and drilling the hole next to the Smokenator and slightly below the cooking grate. After that you just pop the PartyQ into the hole and screw it in place with a supplied wing nut. (Incidentally, I really love what the PartyQ did with their temperature probe by putting an alligator clip on the end of it. It makes it so easy to keep the probe in place when you're adding coals, etc.)  

**Brisket Prep**: I bought a 10 lb brisket from a local meat market ([Bichelmeyer Meats](http://bichelmeyermeatskc.com/). If you live anywhere near Kansas City, go there, it's amazing.) I decided to rub it with mustard this time instead of olive oil like I usually do. The rub was one given to me by a neighbor who makes his own rubs (of course, the ingredients are a trade secret.)  

**The Cook**: I fired up the grill at about 7:00 AM. I packed the Smokenator with Kingsford Competition Briquets and apple chips (I thought I had enough chunks but I was sadly mistaken and ended up having to settle for chips.) I used about 10 lit coals which is more than I usually do but it was fairly chilly and windy in KC on Saturday so I wanted to make sure I had enough heat.  

Once the Smokenator was loaded up it took about 30 minutes to get up to temp. The PartyQ manual said there could be some overshoot with the temp when firing up but I found that it brought it right up to 225^o and held it there. 

The PartyQ held the temp at 225^o all freaking morning like a champ. For about three hours I watched it like a hawk but it hardly fluctuated more than five degrees in either direction. At one point my wife and I left for about an hour and a half to get coffee and groceries and when I came back it was still pumping along at the perfect temp.  

**I Done Went and Fucked Up:** After lunch I started playing with my son and then he fell asleep with me on the couch watching basketball. During that time I neglected to keep an eye on the fuel and as a result, the fuel nearly burned out and the temp of the grill was reduced to 130^o. I quickly added more charcoal and tried to get it going again but my brisket temp started to drop so I ended up foiling it and putting it in the oven. At that point the brisket temp was about 135^o (down from 143^o right before I fell asleep.)  

I was afraid I'd fucked it up but after finishing it in the oven to a final internal temp of 205^o and then letting it rest in a cooler for a couple hours until dinner time it actually turned out very tasty and the moisture level was just right. And this cook was the first time in five briskets that I got a really good smoke ring. I'm not sure if it was because I used mustard instead of olive oil to coat the brisket but that was the only thing I could think of that I did significantly different from my previous cooks.  

Overall, I would give the PartyQ a shining review. The thing worked perfectly with a minimal amount of effort on my part. I can't wait till the spring/summer when the weather will be more conducive to holding a nice even temperature without me having to add a bunch of fuel to keep things going.  

Next time I do a smoke on a chilly day I might just try using a stack of charcoal against one side of the smoker plus a water pan so I can use more charcoal from the beginning.

For the last 4 Thanksgivings, i've smoked a whole turkey in my BGE. The first year it came out absolutely perfect but while the last 3 turkeys had great-tasting meat, the skin was essentially inedible, like rawhide.

I am determined to get it right this year -- so my question is: what is it that makes skin turn out that way, and how can i avoid it? is it caused by the composition of the brine or the amount of time in the brine or the temperature in the smoker or the length of time in the smoker, or something else?

Thanks for any advice!

So, I started to prep it like I would any other large pork cut, and rubbed it down with yellow mustard and then my home made rub.

Now my questions are: Will it be ok to smoke it with the skin on or do I really need to remove it? Will smoking it with the skin on add more time to the process? Should I smoke it skin side up or down? Should I allow for about an hour and a half per pound as I would with a boston butt? If I smoke it skin side down can I keep my temps a little higher (260-275) as the skin will protect the meat?

Last night I won about $300 bucks on the poker machine, so I've decided this money is going to get spent on myself.  From what I've read, charcoal is going to give you the best flavor, and for that I'm probably looking at a Weber Smokey Mountain.  However, I've never tasted anything that came from a propane or electric smoker, and I really like the idea of not having to get up in the middle of the night every few hours to check temperatures.  Especially if the taste is negligible.

So, my question to you, dear /r/smoking members, is the WSM the one to get, or is the convenience of a propane or electric smoker the way to go despite it not having the same taste?  Thanks!

I recently asked you for advice about buying a smoker in europe and got a lot of support and advice. I ended up not going for the Weber Smokey Mountain, but instead went for a lowbudget product: [Tepro Wichita](http://www.grill.edingershops.de/BBQ-Smoker+Grill+Zubehoer/BBQ-Smoker+Barbeque-Grill/Tepro-Barbeque-Smoker-Grill-Holzkohlegrill-Wichita-BBQ::91149045.html)

It arrived on Thursday, so I decided to try my very first smoke today. The goal was pulled pork with coleslaw (inspired by the recent amazing post in r/cooking!) I got myself a 1.6kg (~3 pound) pork shoulder (without bone) and used amazingribs.com as main guideline.

I smoked the meat for 7 hours, but it never reached an inner Temp of more than 150°F. Mainly because I was too curious and not patient enough, checked the smoker every 15 minutes. But also because my charcoal management was lacking. At 10pm I pulled the meat out because me and my dad were starving. The meat wasn't rare anymore but also miles away from ""beeing able to be pulled"" (from what I could tell). Also it had an extreme smoke taste (not sure if that's how pulled pork is supposed to taste, but I highly doubt it). It kinda tasted similar to when you grill something on a big campfire, just in an extremer way. There was a very nice smokering though, so in terms of smoking I'd say it wasn't a complete disaster :D

**Problems/flaws** I'm aware of (but often can't tell if they are important and a big factor in why my smoke didn't go as planned):

* not knowing how to handle a smoker (specially the different airways, led to simply wild guessing most of the times)

* had to open the lid to messure the inner temperature every time I wanted to check it (which was way too often)

* The taste of the meat was very strong, specially towards the crust

* no idea how to handle the exhaust fume cap, does this need to stay just a little bit open? I had it open around 1cm so fume/smoke could exit at all times. I feel like this might be where the mistake about the strong taste has its roots.

I'm looking for general advice and am glad for every hint/answer I can get from you guys!

PS: I'm still very much looking forward to my next smoke, but feel a little bit discouraged, after the meat looked so perfect and will most likely continue with smaller pieces of meet. And the coleslaw was fantastic! ;)

Would a low temperature smoke for 45 - 60 minute smoke actually season this ? Or should I do something else ?

I wanted to run my plan by you guys and see if it is sound as well as ask a couple questions.
The night before I will do a thin coat of mustard on the brisket and then put the rub on.  I'll wrap it and put it in the fridge over night.  In the smoker at 225 and cooking for 1 hour and 15 minutes per pound with the fat side up.  Spray every 45 minutes with cider and cooking oil.  Wrap at 160, let it get up to 180 and then unwrap and cool to about 140.  Cut against the grain.
Questions: Does anyone have a good brisket rub recipe or a recommended mustard to use? At 160 when I wrap it should I have anything in the foil like butter or cider to moisten it up some more? Lastly I read somewhere that after 5 or so hours brisket won't absord any smoke and you can foil and finish it in the oven at 225.  This would be nice as my propane smoker needs quite a bit of babysitting to stay at a constant temp but I don't want to do it if I'm sacrificing any flavor.",,False,self,t5_2qkku,False,,,True,t3_w2tnb,http://www.reddit.com/r/smoking/comments/w2tnb/first_time_smoking_brisket_questions/,

2) There is a decent amount of room in the fire pit, should I smoke my meat in there, or should I build a housing around the flue giving me more room?

I am in no way affiliated with the manufacture, marketing or sales of this product. I am just a very pleased user and am promoting something American Made 

I have used a soldering iron in a soup can, made a contraption for the top of my Big Chief... But this thing is well.......amazing. I ordered it a couple weeks ago after seeing it on a new-to-me meat smoking forum. I used it yesterday in my Big Chief to cold smoke 13 lbs of buckboard bacon. The outside temps were in the mid 40's with a light breeze and my smoker never got above 55 degrees. With one load of pellets (about 3 cups) I got 11 hours of good solid smoke. One of the cool things about this is that you can fill it with different kids of wood, light it and leave it. I'm smoking three different cheeses right now with a combo of apple and cherry.

You can also use this in a gas or charcoal grill to get smoke flavor on whatever you are cooking. You can use as much or as little pellets as you want as long as there is enough to keep them lit.

Those with the skills, equipment and materials will be able to make one of these of the same or different design with little effort. The concept is extremely simple. Heck.... you could probably do the same thing with some tin foil with some success. But this thing is constructed from stainless, so it will probably last forever. However, if you lack the materials, skills, equipment and/or time..... it is well worth the money. It will use any pellet, chip or dust sold for smokers.

I am going sailing in a remote area and plan on doing some fishing. The boat doesn't have a lot of space for storing fish cold (small icebox). So I was thinking about smoking the fish to preserve it. My understanding is to preserve fish you need to cold smoke which I take means keeping the internal temperature of the fish below 30 deg C as you smoke the fish.

Using electric smokers is out because there will be no access to electricity. A wood smoker might work but the issues I have are it would be bulky, I would not want to use it on the boat and hauling a smoker to and from shore in a small dinghy would be a pain.

The solution I have and would like you guys to comment on the feasibility of is as follows: I would build a criss-cross of driftwood that looks like a log cabin. Part way up I would build a ""shelf"" to smoke the fish on and then continue the walls up further. I would then cover the whole thing with a tarp and then get my fire going in the middle of the ""cabin"". I would leave an opening near the bottom so the fire can breathe. The walls would be far enough away to not light on fire.

Since I'm sure it's somewhat easier to look at a picture [here is a sketch I made up](http://imgur.com/9QtT1N3).

I guess the fire would need to be more embers than fire? From what I can read slow cooking is a slow process and can take a few days? How often will the fire need to be tended? Is this even a reasonable idea?

[Here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Arbroath_Smokies_-_geograph.org.uk_-_481678.jpg) is an image of smoking of fish done and it seems they aren't even enclosed, is this something to consider?

Open to criticism and suggestions.  

I got a [MasterBuilt SmokeMaster \(electric\)](http://www.homedepot.com/p/t/202461863?productId=202461863&amp;storeId=10051&amp;langId=-1&amp;catalogId=10053&amp;MERCH=REC-_-nosearch3-5-_-NA-_-202461863-_-N#.Ue1YbI21F8E) for Father's day and finally got around to trying it out.  I got a 5 lb bone-in cut of pork butt from the local butcher, and did a simple dry-rub with a number of seasonings (Von Hansen's Special Spice rub).  I let the meat sweat it out for about an hour after the rub, then put it in the smoker at 210*.  I added Jack Daniel's Oak Barrel chips about every hour through the side of the unit, so I didn't open the main door at all.  I used the MB internal temp gauge that shot the temp to my remote control.

I cooked at 210* for about 4 hours, then I second guessed myself and turned the temp up to 225* for the final 4 hours.  I was reading the pulled [pork recipe from AmazingRibs](http://www.amazingribs.com/recipes/porknography/perfect_pulled_pork.html) and made the move to the higher temp.

Internal temp smoothly moved up, went past the expected 150-160* stall, and stuck at 176-177 for about an hour+ from about 6.5 hours and on.  I was shooting for internal temp of 190-195  (per AmazingRibs' suggestion).  The internal temp kept teetering between 176 and 177, but wouldn't go any higher.  

I ended up pulling the butt out at about 8 hours when it was still at 177, then I wrapped it in tinfoil and let it rest for about an hour.  

I cut it up and it was delicious - especially the end pieces with the crust (bark?) on it.  The pork cut a lot more like a pork tenderloin than pulled pork though.  Have at me, I'm open to suggestions so I can improve.  And I know, I know, I would get better results if i ditched the electric.  This is my introduction / lazy man's approach to getting into smoking.

A couple of questions:

1)  When smoking, do you want the vent at the top of the smoker to be open or sealed?  I went sealed, with the thought that I wanted to keep the smokey goodness inside.  

2) How do you get the ""pulled"" cut to the pork.  It came out looking a lot more like a pork loin than the typical ""pulled"" pork.

3) Was I just stuck in the stall at a little higher temp than I expected (at the 176-177)?

Yesterday, I smoked two racks of ribs that were rubbed with [this](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/who-loves-ya-baby-back-recipe/index.html) rub.  I did cut the salt for this in half.  As well as a whole chicken per [this](http://bbq.about.com/od/chickenrecipes/r/bl70510e.htm) and some wings that were coated in the stuffing.  
I set the smoker for 180f and the timer for seven hours.  I used Bradley bisquettes as instructed, alternating mesquite, apple and hickory.
Everything came out fully cooked (for the last hour I turned the heat up to 220f to cook the chicken)
Here's what I need to know:
Is it possible to over smoke something?  To me, it tasted too smoky.  BBQ experts say the longer, the better, but wow.
Does smoke approximate saltiness?  I have used the rib recipe many times in the oven with no problems, but this time it was way saltier.
Is it possibly my choice of smoke flavours?  I know mesquite is pretty aromatic, should I go with a milder wood?

Eggs-Following this (http://www.susanminor.org/forums/showthread.php?47-Smoked-Chicken-To-Quail-Eggs&amp;p=58#post58) recipe for the prep. 3 hrs for the hen eggs, 1-1.5 for the quail. Is that too little or too much?

Sausages-I got a few cocktail franks and kielbasas to smoke. I chose only those with nitrates added. Is this a necessary precaution? How long should these be left on? 

Cheese-Bought some cheddar, gouda, string cheeses and Babybels. Just gonna throw 'em on and leave 'em for about 3 hrs. I was thinking about cutting the cheese (ha) to increase surface area, but I'm worried this might dry out the cheese. Thoughts?

Nuts-I got some raw almonds and cashews and was just going to spread them out over cheese cloth and stir every so often. Any suggestions on how long they should be smoked for? Any spices that could/should be added? Also, I've read somewhere that they should be soaked in water prior to smoking, is this necessary? 

We are also planning on smoking some kosher salt just 'cause. (1-2 hrs in an aluminum pan, stirring every so often.) We will be cold smoking apple pellets with the AMNTS on a (cold) gas grill with the hood closed. Outside temp will be mid-30s.

I wanted to try it for myself this year only to find out that my little gas grill wouldn't have fit this bird. I quickly found this smoker on craigslist for $70 and picked it up.

http://imgur.com/a/Isaww

Being my first time with a real smoker, there were a few set backs, but overall it was a success. Turkey came out late, but great, and everyone was happy.

Now that that's over, I'd love to do more with this smoker. The thermometer says New Braunfels, but I can't find a specific model number/type anywhere. It doesn't look like the ones I see online, as it has the warming plate on the fire box, the prep table is wire instead of wood, and the legs are bolted on to the body, instead of being that rolled tube structure with wheels I've seen otherwise. Can anyone ID this smoker?

Also, some basic questions

1) (unrelated to this smoker) How do vertical smokers like the WSM work? I thought that if the meat was over the coals/heat source, then it would be cooking with direct heat, which you don't want?

2) All the grates were missing on this smoker, so I stole the grate from my gas grill for this job. I want to replace the grates, but not sure where to start. I see bolts that are probably used as pegs to hold the grates, but they're halfway up the body of the smoker, isn't that high? It seems like you waste a lot of space this way and wouldn't be able to fit things like turkeys in there otherwise.

3) How does a gas conversion work? I seem to understand that you can replace the charcoal with a gas burner and lava rocks, then put your smoke wood chips on that, is it that simple?

4) I went through two 5lb bags of wood chips in smoking this turkey. Based on what I've read, that seems to be too much. It's what I needed to keep the smoke going for the whole cook time. If you're not supposed to make smoke the whole time, when are you supposed to do it?

5) Do you want to add thermal mass to the smoker body? I bake a lot of bread and have a 40lb marble slab in the oven which helps out a lot. Do you want the same kind of thing in the smoker, or would it create a source of direct heat that you don't want?

Maybe a lot of my questions are better answered in other places, so if you could point me in the right direction for starting with an offset smoker, that would be great!

if theres any other advice you would like to add, id be glad to hear it. Btw im interested smoking ribs, pulled pork, sausage/brats, chicken, maybe try some hot wings, tri-tip, and basically anything else that would turn out better on a smoker lol.

Making this quick. 

Father bought me a smoker a while back and I never opened it because I was about to move. And it's a big fucking smoker. A Brinkmann side car. I'd never had experience with it and he said if he had one it would be that one. I was grateful... but I think it's too much.

I've used it about 6 times now and each time I find I can't keep the smoke coming, and I can't regulate the temp. It's either too hot or too cool. I use the vent on the sidecar and the chimney vent and it seems to do nothing. I bought the 2 probe Maverick. It helps me know the right temp, but it doesnt change the fact that the temp never stays the same for more than 5 minutes or 10 (drastic 30 degree changes that conitnue to climb or fall). After two times of smoking for 3-4- hours and never being able to rest, I've gotten fed up and thrown butt, chicken, and salmon in the fucking oven with the results deeming little smoke. Which isn't that bad for chicken, but I can never get pork butt to smoke long enough and I hate using the oven for it because it isn't **smokey** even after 4 hours of smoke... I was using small butts by the way (one was 2 lbs and the other was 5)

I feel like I rarely see smoke coming out. Only after putting some wood on the briquettes and letting it go for about 10 minutes, then it dies down. I've tried soaked and dried wood.

I was using store bought chips at first (tiny 3 inch tips). I decided to buy some cherry, pecan, and hickory locally. I don't have a chainsaw. I have a dull axe that I've been ""using"" to chip off bits. I need a chainsaw or something to cut nice chunks.

I have a brisket here and I don't have the balls to pop it in the smoker if I haven't had ideal results with everything thus far. I think the fucker is just too big, but Im sure Im doing something wrong... It's starting make me feel pretty shitty.

Can anyone run me through what I need to do for alot of smoke and maintaining temp for long times? Ive put alot of money into this and Im still fucking this up.

I'll start off by saying that my questions below are not me trying to be a troll, I genuinely am not sure about the intro cooking process for smoking and any help would be appreciated.

I have a MasterBuilt gas smoker, shown [here](http://www.amazon.com/Masterbuilt-20051311-2-Door-Propane-Smoker/dp/B004W4NDPY/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1370057375&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=masterbuilt+smoker), which utilizes propane gas as a heat source.

The interior contains several cooking racks, a drip tray below that, and a wood box below the drip tray. The wood box is directly above the burner, which is what is connected to the propane tank to provide the flame.

My question is as follows:

For my fire box, do I just place soaked wood chips in there? Is that my only heat source? Should I also place coals in there? 

Also when I built my smoker, the thermometer attaches through the front door of the smoker with a wingnut. When I tightened the wingnut the indicator on the thermometer spun around and now it's reading the completely wrong temperature. Has anyone ever ""reset"" one of these before, or have a suggested fix? I think I may have broken it.

(Description inside.),grimfel,2,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/smoking/comments/1h9opc/is_my_friends_electric_vertical_bulletstyle/,"So this Saturday I'm supposed to get together with my buddy to do some smoking on his vertical smoker. It's something he picked up used and he doesn't have much in-depth experience with smoking. All my experience is on a Weber grill, so I'm unfamiliar with the equipment he's using.

After taking a look at the setup, it left me with the feeling that he's missing a piece of hardware. I wasn't able to take pics, so here's my best attempt to describe it:

The bottom of the smoker is where the power in and I'm assuming where all the heat is generated. Above that, by about a foot, is where a metal pan, in a bowl shape, rests. Another foot, maybe more, above that, is where the rack for food goes, and then the lid goes on top from there.

He's been using the container/bowl to hold his wood chips, which he soaks. It seems to me like that *should be* a water pan, exclusively (give or take maybe adding some herbs or something to it), and that there should be another container *below* that bowl, but above the heating area, that should be dedicated to wood chips/chunks.

So is it reasonable to assume this smoker is missing a dedicated container for the wood? If so, what kind of workaround might there be, if any, to get it to function the way it should?",,False,self,t5_2qkku,False,,,True,t3_1h9opc,http://www.reddit.com/r/smoking/comments/1h9opc/is_my_friends_electric_vertical_bulletstyle/,

Its looking like it will be a full day, but I have a few questions:

1. Should I attempt to seal the door before, or after I have seasoned the smoker? I'm thinking of using some high-temp silicone auto sealant on the upper door. This stuff is rated to 500F, so it should survive the seasoning process, but something tells me this would be a bad idea. Any suggestions?

2. For actually smoking something, is there anything that is especially easy/rewarding for beginners? I heard chicken thighs were pretty simple.

3. This smoker has the option to use charcoal as well as gas. I've heard some people use a combination, where they start the charcoal with the propane, then let the charcoal do its thing with the gas off. Anyone use a combo method like this?

I have made a cold smoking unit that pumps the smoke into a chamber, the problem is that the smoke seems to be very white and 'heavy'. I have an adjustable tap on the airline, so even when the air is turned all the way down the smoke still says thick. Now i have heard that this white smoke is not what i am after as it leaves that crappy numbing taste in your mouth, which i have experienced before and sucks.

Would drilling more holes in the unit itself for drawing oxygen to fuel the woodchips create a cleaner burn? and thus the nice blueish smoke?

Also, do i need a good amount of extraction so the smoke doesn't pool as much inside the smoker?

I am thinking about building an electric UDS. I learned about UDS here and did many google searches but have yet to see anyone showing instructions on how to build thoroughly.

I never owned a smoker before, nor smoked anything. But I love the flavor of it and enjoy building stuff...

I would like to go with an electric smoker as I think it'll be easier for me to set it and forget it while I'm at work. I have a PID temperature controller that I'll be using for building my homebrewing equipment as well. 

So it looks like I need a barrel (which I can find with a lid for $35 locally apparently). Thinking about an oven heating element which can be purchased at around 15 to 20 bucks. 

I know that I need a tray for drip pan, nuts and bolts, a case for wood chips and a water bowl, and of course something to put the meat on. 

Now while building it, what is the trick for locating these items vertically? I looked at the manuals of some masterbuilt ones and looks like the drip tray is at the bottom, then the heating element, wood chips and lastly the water bowl. Is this the order I should be following? Or should it be more like: Heating element at the bottom, wood chip bowl next, and water bowl to also use as drip pan etc?

Also what about the horizontal order of these things like what has to be or shouldn't be directly above/below of each other? I'll be going to home depot to find one of these things assembled and check out how it is but considering I really haven't seen any before I'm thinking I might not be able to find one to investigate.

I use my Weber kettle grill. I have the Aussie as a spare grill. Just for the hell of it, I set it up for smoking last weekend.

On the BBQ grill I placed a roasting pan with 1/4 inch of water, and on the pan's grill I had a plump roasting chicken. No rub or anything, just plain bird.

I had thought that it would heat up too quickly or not be particularly steady and I'd be fooling around with it every 10 minutes.

I had to start closing down the vents later in the smoke after 1/2 the charcoal was burned down, which is attributable to the fact that there was a trail of still-warm coals after two hours.

So I've been reading around online and I still have some questions:

* Should the chips be on one side (indirect heat) or spread over the whole surface of the tray?

* I've seen some suggestions that I soak my chips in water for an hour or two and other arguments that it doesn't make a difference either way. What say y'all? Are we soakers here?

* Is 225 the magic temperature for my pseudo-smoker? How closely do I need to adhere to this number?

* Is there anything obvious that I'm missing or not thinking of?


Thanks, folks!

I'm wanting to take the cold smoking to a higher level for cheeses, eggs and the like.  Maybe try some fruits, veggies, etc.

I know commercial smoked cheeses are smoked at 40-50 degrees.  Unless we're in the middle of a record breaking cold spell, I can't get my smoker that cold.  So I'm thinking of this....

With a small dorm type refrigerator, a Johnson control, some 4"" metal tubing and a external smoke source, I could keep the fridge at 45-50 deg F and apply smoke for any number of hours, any month of the year.  


Anybody see any issue with this?  I think I could do it for less than 200 bucks and if it didn't work, I'd have a target at the local shooting range (landfill) that would last for a few months.
