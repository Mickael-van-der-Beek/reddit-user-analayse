###PENS

The most popular beginner pen around here is the [Lamy Safari](http://www.lamyusa.com/fountain_main_safari.php). It's cheap ($20-$30), made of durable ABS (think Lego), and writes great. The grip is shaped in a way that makes holding it the right way natural. I write several pages with mine daily and I love it. Alternatives include the [Lamy AL-Star](http://www.lamyusa.com/fountain_main_alstar.php), an aluminum safari, or the [Lamy Vista](http://www.lamyusa.com/lamy_fountain_L12_vista.php), the see-through version. (This is what I use).

A brand-new one that's been popular recently is the [Pilot Metropolitan](http://www.gouletpens.com/Pilot_Metropolitan_Fountain_Pens_s/1336.htm). I've never used one, but I haven't heard any complaints about it yet. This one runs for $15, but many places have been selling out.

Other inexpensive, well-liked pens include:

* [Parker Urban](http://www.parkerpen.com/#/en/collection/Urban-Standard/Muted-Black/Chromed-Trims/Fountain-Pen), made by fountain pen legend Parker ($20-30)

* [Kaweco Sport](http://i.imgur.com/UX5Ty.gif ""Can't directly link to website"") A compact pen, with no clip. ($20-30)

* [Platinum Preppy](http://platinumpenusa.com/preppy-fountain-pen/) One of the least expensive FP's out there. ($3-$5)

* [TWSBI Diamond 580](http://i.imgur.com/6LRxP.jpg) High quality, high capacity, medium price. ($40-$60)

* [Parker 51](http://i.imgur.com/yO3Lz.jpg) Unarguably the most popular vintage pen. Hasn't been in production for four decades, but is known to perform as well as or better than modern pens. For more, see the [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_51).

* I'll add additional suggestions from the comments here.

###INK

Now, Ink. By default, all of the pens above use [cartridges](http://minus.com/lQUZJBgIcqYgB), which are disposable things full of ink that you pop in the pen and write with. They're convenient, but pricey ($25-$35 per oz of ink). All of the pens above except the Sport, use proprietary ink cartridges. For other pens, an ""international standard"" cartridge exists.

The (recommended) alternative is to what's called a [converter](http://minus.com/lhBcgR0fLxWBr). This is a small, syringe-like device that inserts into the pen where the cartridge goes, allowing you to fill the pen with bottled ink. ($4-$10 per oz, up to $16 for specialty inks). These are normally sold separately, for about $5.

Higher-end pens may use other filling mechanisms.

If you use a converter you can use hundreds of different inks, instead of the handful you'd be limited to with cartridges. ""Hundreds"" is no hyperbole, [this site has 600-700 choices](http://www.gouletpens.com/Fountain_Pen_Ink_Samples_s/851.htm). This allows to write in whatever color you'd like. Different brands of ink have different properties. You can pick up a ton of different styles, to see which kind you like the best. Most people on here prefer Noodler's inks because of their [many colors and special properties](http://noodlersink.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/103012_noodlers-ink-properties.pdf), but so far, my favorite has been Private Reserve DC Supershow Blue. If you want to write in hot pink, invisible, whiskey-scented, fraud-proof, or multicolor ink, now you can. The link above goes to a shop where you can buy 2ml ink samples, so you can test out an ink before you commit to buying an entire bottle.
One option is to use a syringe (preferably an [ink syringe](http://www.gouletpens.com/Goulet_5ml_Ink_Syringe_Set_p/inksyringe.htm)) to fill up your cartridges/converters. It's a nice accessory to have, since it also lets you get every drop of ink out of a bottle (especially a sample vial.)

Warning: Only use fountain pen inks. Other inks can clog up your pen.

###NIBS

Finally, nib choices. The nib is the little metal thing at the end where the ink comes out. When you buy the pen, you'll be able to choose different nib sizes, which, along with the ink you use, determine the thickness of the lines you write. Stock nib sizes normally range from EF (extra fine), to B (broad), but outliers exist ([0.004""](http://www.richardspens.com/?page=pens/nibs.htm) to [6mm](http://www.gouletpens.com/Pilot_Parallel_Fountain_Pen_6_0mm_Blue_p/pn90053.htm).) I'd recommend either fine or extra fine to start with, which will produce something about as wide as your standard ballpoint pen. Some brands use interchangeable nibs, allowing you to quickly change sizes.

For specialty nibs, [this](http://www.richardspens.com/?page=ref/nibs/beyond.htm) is an incredible reference, and will have to do for now because my browser crashed while filling this out. This is a must read, if you're looking to write beautifully, like [this](http://imgur.com/UxTtp.jpg) (italic nib) or [this](http://imgur.com/QUz8C.jpg) (flex nib). A cheap italic pen is the [Pilot Plumix](http://www.pilotpen.us/ProductGroup/56-Plumix.aspx?ProductId=168), and an inexpensive flex pen, is [Noodler's Ahab](http://noodlersink.com/whats-new/noodlers-new-ahab-is-almost-here/). If you'd like to compare different stock nib, Goulet Pens's [Nib Nook](http://www.gouletpens.com/Nib_Nook_s/1114.htm) is a great tool.

###PAPER
Unlike the popular ballpoint pen which uses a thick, greasy ink, fountain pens use thin, watery ink. On absorbent paper, this can cause a few problems:

* [Feathering](http://i.imgur.com/RKutP.jpg) when the ink spreads after writing.

* [Ghosting](http://i.imgur.com/mZOSm.jpg) when the ink can be seen through the paper.

* Bleed-Through - where the ink soaks through the paper.

Higher end papers are thicker and less absorbent, making them much more resistant to these effects, and will also provide a smoother writing experience. However, less-absorbent paper often means longer drying time for ink.

The most popular paper high quality brands around are [Rhodia](http://rhodiapads.com/) and [Clairefontaine](http://www.clairefontaine.com) (which I think are owned by the same company).

Now, I know that you don't always choose the paper you write on, especially at work or school. Your pen won't catch fire if you write on cheap paper, there might just be some of the aforementioned effects, and it happens with some inks more than others. Personally, I don't think you need to *start* with nice paper, but it's nice to pick some up when you're more in to the hobby.

###CAVEATS

There's a lot of valuable additional information in the comments.

Warning: this is an addictive hobby. I started with a cheap [Pilot Plumix](http://www.pilotpen.us/ProductGroup/56-Plumix.aspx?ProductId=168), and now I've been lusting after one of [these](http://www.montblanc.com/en-us/shop/writing-instruments/meisterstck/black-resin-gold/149-fountain-pen-10575.aspx).

Also, the paper you use does make a difference, but one that is not covered in this post. If you're thinking of picking up a pen, ink, converter, and paper, there's a [Lamy bundle](http://www.gouletpens.com/Lamy_Starter_Set_p/package-lamystarter.htm), along with [other bundles](http://www.gouletpens.com/Packages_s/35.htm) here.

If anyone has any questions/suggestions/corrections, please comment, and I'll update my post.

*More nib/paper info to come.*

I hope you people are happy with yourselves.,the_lemma,68,10,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/1jguvj/i_went_from_0_to_addict_in_24_hours_i_hope_you/,"I've always been one to like well-fitting, well-writing, balanced pens, and there has been some vague interest in fountain pens for a while. Yesterday I was browsing /r/fountainpens, and decided I'd get one and try it. I was also impatient, so I ran to the nearest non-chain office store for one. I couldn't find a pen from the Guide, but found a cheap [Zebra V-301](http://www.amazon.com/Zebra-Stainless-Fountain-Pen-48111/dp/B00563I4Y0) and decided to just get that instead. I've always liked Zebra's ballpoints, so I figured it was a safe-ish decision.

Got back and had varied and confused emotions. I really liked the way it felt to write with such a pen, but it put down way too much ink and would randomly stop inking in the middle of words. I looked online, turns out the nib they ship with is kinda crap. Well, shoot.

So I overnighted a Lamy Safari EF with Amazon Prime. Again, impatient. I got it this afternoon and loved it. But I started noticing things. I didn't like the ink color. The paper I was using was shit for fountain pens, because it'd just spread out and bleed. The shape of the pen was nice, but I wasn't a huge fan of the plastic. It felt too light and insubstantial.

After a little research, I used Prime again to overnight myself a bottle of Noodler's Bulletproof Black and a converter. Then I went to Staples and got a nice notebook with some heavy paper.

What I'm trying to say is, in 24 hours I went from ""lol wut is fountain pen"" to owning two, while being picky about:

* Pen behavior, weight, and balance
* Nib width and inking characteristics
* Paper
* Ink

So, I hope you're all happy with yourselves. At this rate I'll have 40 pens and be a paper/ink snob by next week.

In a nutshell, the pen skipped (ink didn't flow) on certain strokes, and sometimes just didn't write.  I'd fooled with it and tried everything I could think of, between the stock cartridge, converter, Faber-Castell ink, and medium nib.  I cleaned it, ran ink through it, tried to manipulate the nib, etc...

Except for the (understandable) backlash of criticism over my not liking the [Anello](http://www.amazon.com/Graf-Faber-Castell-Classic-Anello-Fountain/dp/B002B9L3AY/ref=sr_1_1?s=office-products&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1356474290&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=anello), or for even bringing it up in the first place, I got a load of good advice.

I ordered a [Lamy Fountain, Black Finish, Broad Nib](http://www.jetpens.com/Lamy-Fountain-Pen-Nib-Black-Finish-Broad/pd/3626) and a bottle of [Graphite Black Diamine Ink](http://www.jetpens.com/Diamine-Ink-for-Fountain-Pens-80-ml-Bottle-Graphite-Black/pd/7759) from JetPens.  I got this nib just because I like a fat line and two people (buildingbridges &amp; adiosgang... ironic) had suggested the Diamine.  

Well, I pulled the old nib (wrapping a piece of Scotch tape around it to make it easy - good trick) and slid on the new one.  The pen was already completely cleaned and free of any old ink, so I dipped the converter into the Diamine and twisted, filing the chamber.  After a couple of shakes, the ink started flowing and the first thing I did was sign my name.  Perfect.  I wrote some long sentences.  No skipping.  Everything looks great.  I wouldn't change a thing.

Maybe I got a bad nib or something, but I don't care.  This is great.

1360208524.0,41,self.fountainpens,181laq,Putting Noodler's Bulletproof Ink to the Test: An Experiment,RgyaGramShad,47,6,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/181laq/putting_noodlers_bulletproof_ink_to_the_test_an/,"I decided to see just how ""bulletproof"" Noodler's bulletproof ink is. I chose one I just got, EL Lawrence, inspired by T.E. Lawrence.

It's a nice black with hints of green (that unfortunately don't show in the scan.) It flows a little less readily than other Noodler's inks, but I like it so far.

Now, let's get to point of this post This ink is [Bulletproof.](http://noodlersink.com/noodlers-durable-ink-classification/) That means it should resist ""UV light, UV light wands, bleaches, alcohols, solvents, petrochemicals, oven cleaners, carpet cleaners, carpet stain lifters, and of course…they are also waterproof once permitted to dry upon cellulose paper.""

So, I tested this ink out with UV light and seven different chemicals on scraps of a Rhodia Dotpad. The ink was left to dry overnight, and then each chemical was put on a swab, and rubbed over the ink for a bit, then any residue was left to evaporate, or wiped off after 15 minutes.

http://i.imgur.com/IpDwqwr.jpg

So, in the first row, we have the name of the ink, and the control. Neither of these were treated in any abnormal way.

* UV: Ink was placed in a high-intensity UV curer for five minutes. No visible change.

* Chem1: Methanol. The ink lost some of its saturation, but with a good amount of staining and to the paper.

* Chem2: Acetone. Ink slightly lightened, less paper damage.

* Chem3: Isopropyl Alcohol. Only slightly affects ink.

* Chem4: Liquid Flux. It violently attacks metals, and apparently also this ink. It turned it from a dark green to a pale grey, with little damage to the paper.

* Chem5: White vinegar. Surprisingly effective, but with a good amount of damage to the paper.

* Chem6: Bleach. Most of the fading is from ink-bearing pieces of paper coming off during application. The left side should be a more accurate representation of its effects.

* Chem7: Oxidane, aka water. This ink is very water-resistant. Once again, the fading is mostly due to paper damage.

Caveat: This paper is very unabsorbent. If the ink were allowed to penetrate more, it may have been less affected by pieces of paper spalling off.

Edit: I just tried the flux on some ink on normal paper. Didn't even fade the ink. I guess that's the key with this ink, the ink being absorbed into and reacting with the cellulose in the paper.

So, there you have it. Looks like when you write something down with this ink, it stays down. I got some on my skin, and it came off pretty easily. I considered also testing this ink vs Hydrofluoric acid (think Breaking Bad) and Phosphoric Acid (Rust removing gel), but I value my health more than my curiosity.

Hope you guys found this informative.",,False,self,t5_2s0ew,1360333502.0,,format f33,True,t3_181laq,http://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/181laq/putting_noodlers_bulletproof_ink_to_the_test_an/,

It was my second week as an associate at a Manhattan law firm. At 6:30, my boss, a midlevel associate, calls me into a meeting with the managing partner about a case we're working on. On arrival, I realize I'm late -- the meeting started at 6, but no-one had bothered to tell me. I also realize that it's not *just* the managing partner. It's four of the highest-ranking partners in litigation. 

I start frantically taking notes with my trusty Mont Blanc Boheme Mini -- when the cartridge runs out. As many of you will know, Boheme Minis are awesome, but lack space for a spare cartridge. So I'm now officially penless in the most important meeting of my young career. 

Thankfully my boss is a fellow nerd/fan of all things old and classy. He sees my trouble, smiles, and passes over his spare ballpoint. Crisis averted, and few people noticed.

I used the pens included in the set and improved my handwriting, in doing so i figured i would purchase a pen of my own. The lamy safari gets a ton of praise on this sub, thus i decided to pull the plug on a Charcoal safari with a 1.5nib a broad nib and a fine nib, all with private reserve velvet black ink. I have to say the pen feels somewhat cheap, the broad nib is kind of pointless for note taking, it is more of a marker with it on, the fine nib is significantly better. The italic nib feels smoother compared to the Shaffer however it skips and provides very little feed back. A friend of mine purchased a newer improved shaffer set for $25 which includes 3 pens in various nib sizes and quite a few inks. I have to say for $30+$13 a nib the safari is anything but a bargain. 

I also purchased a $3 Hero and a $4 Wingsung, these pens are a bit more scratchy to write with but nothing significantly more than the lamy. 

Maybe it is the ink that i am using but i don't exactly feel like throwing more money at the problem. Just not happy with lamy at all. I felt like i should give the new twisbi 580 a go when it comes out, but in all honesty i am a little gun shy. This pen is not exactly worth $30.

The primary draw for me is that the pens can be refilled and used indefinitely as opposed to the disposable pens I use now. However, I'm a little worried how convenient they are to write with. How does writing with a fountain pen compare with a roller-ball pen (currently using a uni-ball vision)? Can they be used for note taking and day-to-day writing, or are they more appropriate for slow, ""recreational"" writing? How important is paper quality - i.e. will I be able to use a fountain pen on typical 8.5 by 11 inch paper, or are they only practical on heavier specialty paper?

So I went to Daiso today and picked up one of their [Riviere PTR 200](http://imgur.com/YqED9ey) fountain pens. After getting home and writing with it a bit I noticed that it is MUUUCH smoother and less skippy than my Lamy Vista. At first I chalked it up to maybe the Daiso pen being a ""medium"" and the Vista being a Fine, and that maybe I just prefer medium over fine. I started to compare the ""thickness"" of the lines that I could make with them and they are about the same. And I also remember reading that Japanese nibs are usually thinner than their Western counterpart.

Could this possibly mean that the cheap 1.50 Daiso pen has a better nib than my Vista or maybe my Vista's nib has just been messed up this entire time and never noticed it because it was my first fountain pen?

Hey r/fountainpens.
I started a blog about a month ago just to try something new. I've posted a few reviews here and there on forums, and I figured why not have a crack at it myself.

I found out a nice little stationary store not too far from me was going out of business (which is quite sad) and I thought I'd go check it out and grab and ink or two and some paper and maybe, maybe pick up another Safari (or something in that range) if there was a good deal. They had sold a lot of their pens, but they still had a few higher-end Lamys left. And it's just such an unsettlingly appealing pen, that I had been considering getting around too eventually. And as it was a bit over 50% off, I (with the help of the very kind clerk) talked myself into a purchase.

[The pen in question.](http://imgur.com/jtklGrj)       
(Excuse the handwriting, I was writing on a cramped desk. Also, the smearing: I'm left handed and the pen writes slightly wetter than the one I was using just before...forgot to compensate)

So, for $10, I went down to Hobby Lobby and bought a cheap box, stained and varnished it, then lined it with felt. I also bought three balsa wood sticks and cut them to fit horizontally and vertically, and can slip them in between the ink wells to ensure the glass doesn't break if I have to move everything around. The whole thing took maybe two hours stretched out over a weekend, and turned out a lot nicer than I thought it would, especially given I've never done anything like this before. 

Anyway, I thought maybe some of you on /r/fountainpens would like this, and maybe share your ink storage systems too!

I've seen a couple places turn into that type of place, but you guys seem to actually offer more advice, help, and questions of interest more than bragging about your recent purchase, like oh so many other item-based subreddits like /r/headphones, for example. 

Reddit has probably been one of the most useful websites I've ever encountered, and I have to admit that without it I'm not really sure what I would have done the last year. The best part was finding a fountain pen community on it, hands down. I know lots of you probably hang out on FPN, but for me that is simply too much work and I merely choose to lurk on the forums there. I've made an account there, but cannot be bothered to actually post because FPN simply does not feel as inviting as this subreddit does, IMO.

I imagine I'm not the only person out there with this opinion. This is one of the few communities where I feel a certain level of privilege and importance to being a part of, and I wouldn't trade it for anything. I've kind of tried out other hobbies, but I always find time for writing, and the hobby is as cheap or as expensive as you want it to be. For me, that's something really special. I restore fountain pens and haven't ever purchased a pen for over $150, but comparing that to other hobbies, I think that is cheap and intreresting, has a rich history, and is appreciated on a personal level for me. I do it for myself and nobody else. Buying a new pen for me is like a weekend vacation that I get to go on with all expenses included. For other hobbies I've done like cologne, razors, music, headphones, and the like, I was essentially limited to forking out at least $50+ on every one of my little indulgences. For you guys who don't know what I'm talking about, fountain pen collections are honestly one of the more reasonable hobbies out there, in terms of bang for buck, the size a collection takes up (usually no more than a large shoebox), and ease of expanding your collection in terms of paying what you want versus paying a rough minimum.

I honestly love you guys. I do more of the vintage fountain pen collecting so some of you may not know where I'm coming from or me on the same level as me. The only modern pens I've ever purchased were a $10 jinhao, 2 platinum preppies, and a noodler's Ahab. I guess maybe that makes me a bit sheltered, but the way I look at things I can restore a vintage pen for less than buying a twsbi vac or lamy safari or any other pen. There's a few I cant really compete with and will probably buy soon, but in all honesty I've basically avoided modern pens all together. For me, converters, pistons ,and other mechanisms just don't work as well for me as the lever, vac, button, and other filling mechanisms of the past. Does anyone else feel this way? What would you guys consider to be the advantage of modern over vintage pens, if cost was no option?

I hope you guys keep up the good work. You're the only subreddit I check on a daily basis besides my ""front page"", and you guys as a whole are an extremely helpful and friendly community. I know I may sound snarky at times, but I always try my best to give you my honest and full opinion on a matter as if it were my own.

Since I have both inked up now, I thought I would take some pictures to show people that are interested.

Here's the album:

http://imgur.com/a/3FZwA

I have a slightly heavy hand.  The Platinum can put down finer lines than the average in these pictures.

I used equal pressure to write both samples but the Platinum is a bit more sensitive to pressure.  The Platinum has a 14k nib.  My hand is a bit heavy so there is some variation in the Platinum samples.  If you have good control you can maintain ultra fine lines.

I think the nib tip profiles are really interesting.  The Lamy has a clear ball of tipping.  The Platinum has been ground down significantly.  (I haven't modified either of these.)  

I am just guessing but I imagine that since the cost of the Lamy is significantly cheaper, less attention is paid to the nib.  The Platinum is significantly more expensive so they pay more attention to the shape and grind.  My steel Pilot EFs have a ball of tipping material like the Lamy.

As usual, ignore the lousy handwriting.  Also the dust and paper fiber in the Lamy nib.  It is amazing what a super macro picks up.",,False,self,t5_2s0ew,False,,,True,t3_17uobt,http://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/17uobt/lamy_ef_vs_platinum_ef/,

They have a Midnight Madness email of specials that goes out weekly, if you're into that sort of thing.   
.  
For repairs and parts, I usually check out http://www.fountainpenhospital.com.  They've been around since the '40's.  They have new stuff, and inks too, I think.  I haven't actually had occasion to deal with them in a few years, but it was all good.  
.  
http://www.levenger.com/Pens---Refills-8/Fountain-Pens-831.aspx  has some decent pens, both their own and some other brands.  They also have tons of other things to lust for, notebooks, organizational stuff, furniture.  I had a 10 or 12 year old, monogrammed ""TrueWriter"" from them that had a problem.  They replaced it, and the new one had the monogram too.   
.  
I'm also a fan, here in Seattle, of the University of Washington Bookstore's main branch, which has a bunch of pens  inks, and they have a semi-annual FP sale.  I don't think they have a web presence, but if you're in town check them out.  
.  
Also here in Seattle, and with a bity more web presence, Silberman Brown: http://silbermanbrown.com/pens/  
.    
Again, I want to stress, I had a fine experience with Goulet, and will definitely shop there again.  However I see them mentioned here so often, I wanted to make sure folks were aware of some of my other favorite places to shop.

I have a basic understanding of the various types of fountain pens and all of the parts/accessories associated with a fountain pen (Steven Brown is awesome!) 
 

However, I could use some help with my first purchase:

I'm assuming that you can all agree that Goulet Pen Company is the place to buy from, yes?
 
What kind of pen (i.e. cartridge/converter, piston filled, or eyedropper) should I get to start? Also, pros and cons would help, so I can come to my own conclusions.
 
Any suggestions on a good ink? For this I want to try and balance quality and price. I don't want to spend an enormous amount of money, but I also realize fountain pens aren't necessarily inexpensive.
 
What else do I need to get? Anything I'm missing from the list, or even just accessories you found particularly useful.
 
I've also heard that there are left-handed nibs available, but most people who have used them say it is easier to write with a regular old nib. Are there any lefties that can help me out with this?

I'm a computer scientist by major and trade, so I'm diagramming and writing up numerical sequences and algorithms as much as I am writing actual words, so gridded paper is what I look for in my notebooks.  I'm looking at the larger books and the Rhodia and Clairfontaine pads you guys and others talk about a lot, but I also like to have a book in my back pocket all the time. 

I'm looking for something that's a good mix of cheap, durable, lays flat, and fits in the back pocket, but I'm inexperienced about paper for fountain pens.  I tend to do things like glue pockets or elastic or use existing pockets for a wallet too: I find I don't misplace the notebook as often as my wallet, and no one thinks to steal it.

Do you guy have any suggestions?

Background in case anyone has any further info, feel free to skip: I switched to pens last semester after finals put my hand into a major writer's cramp.  I tend to strangle my pencils and bear down on them like I'm trying to carve something into the opposite side of the desk.  Working with a nice flowing pen (a Pilot G2...I haven't found any other ballpoint I can tolerate) has forced me to loosen up.  My handwriting improved, and things don't hurt as much, so I find I'm more willing to write than type.  For all the programming I do, I like to surround myself with my work (and play), and keep a chalkboard in my room.

I have yet to find the pen I want though, and so I turn to you for advice.  Here's what I need...

1. This will be my everyday office pen.  I dont want something that is going to go boom if I drop it.  (I realize bad things happen if you drop it on the nib, I meant just in general.)

2. It needs to work on all sorts of paper.  When I order this pen, I am going to also order some rhodia tablets to see how they do, but I end up doing a lot of my writing on various printed sheets, or drawings for edit, or graph paper and I would rather find something that works well with everything.

3.  I write small, so it needs to be a fine, or extra fine, or at least write like one.  It would also be great if it could handle drawing shapes and sketches well.

4.  I would prefer to be able to use cartridges as well as a converter if possible, but I can go only bottle ink if needed.

5.  Since I am still getting into this I would prefer it be relativly affordable.  Say $50 or less.  Though I could pay more if it was exactly what I needed.

I currently have only two pens.  Both Lamy Safari, one Fine, one Extra Fine.  The Fine writes smoothly and I love it how smooth it writes, but it writes like a broad nib from the look of it.  Its thicker than any ballpoint I have in my office.  It also feather's ink quite a bit on printed sheets.  The EF is nice, but its very scratchy on regular paper and skips a bit during sketches.

I understand that ink can make a huge difference in this, I have been using Lamy Cartridges so far, but feel free to make a suggestion there if you think it applicable.

Any advice is appreciated, thank you.

**EDIT**

Wow.  I had really not expected quite so many responses.  Thank you all for the advice.  I think I am probably going to try the a Pilot, as well as order the converter for my Lamy alng with some noodlers.

So a large amount of people have the Pilot Parallel calligraphy pen. But it comes with a useless 'cleaning converter'. So we're forced to use cartridges, eyedropper conversion or even buying a new converter to supply the parallel with ink.

Today, I discovered (via a different post) that the cleaning converter unmodified does suck at being a converter through a pool of ink within the barrel. And sought a fix.

Anyway, here's how I modified the 'cleaning converter' to perform as well as the Con-20. More or less.
http://imgur.com/okivUEi,DbRnNMV#0

Things required:
http://imgur.com/DbRnNMV

a) Sandpaper, low grit. High grit optional.

b) Thin rod, I used a cut-off cotton bud. 

c) Sticky tape, not necessary but helpful for sticking the sandpaper onto the rod.

d) Pilot parallel section (barrel not required...)

e) Cleaning converter.

f) Needle or something similar. I used a mechanical pencil's fixed sleeve.

Steps:

1. Grab the needle or similar implement. Poke around the inside of the converter around the plastic area. You'll notice that Pilot has included a lip on the inside of the converter. This blocks the converter from actually sitting properly. We're here to grind the lip away.

2. Tear off a thin strip of sandpaper and wrap it around the rod. Or not, but the rod is helpful. Tape if around the rod if you wish. The rod and sand paper should fit within the opening of the converter.

3. Grind away the lip.... stop every once in awhile to check whether it is able to fit onto the section properly. If it's too tight (when it fits the nipple), grind away again. You can't un-grind it though, so go easy.

4. After grinding away the lip, you'll notice that the converter is quite scratched up. Duh. Use high grit sand paper to smooth it out, I don't think it matters though.

WARNINGS:
I'm not responsible for you breaking the converter. If you push the sandpaper too far down, you can grind away the actual ink sac itself. This modification is technically permanent damage to the converter. But it's pretty useless in its current state anyway and now it has a use.

It's also a little bit finer, despite being a medium (I've read it's on the fine side of a Japanese medium, which is already about the same size as a European fine).

And while this is entirely subjective, I like the look better than the Safari -- simple and elegant.

It lacks the contoured grip section of the Safari, the clip is probably not quite as robust, and the threading feels a bit cheaper -- but these are minor.

It comes with a cartridge and a sac converter, and also accepts a CON-50 piston converter if you prefer that.  And at nearly half the price of the Safari, it's a steal.

And by a bit I mean that I have to start ALL THE WAY OVER.  :D   It makes for good practice, even if it’s sometimes quite frustrating.  Here are a few examples of my goofs recently.

First, a group shot.  The yellow one in the middle is probably the 5th or 6th pen I ever made a year and a half ago.  I’ve come a long way.  :)   I use it now for inking and testing my #6 nibs.

[Group Shot](http://newtonpens.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/img_6082.jpg)

The black ebonite barrel in the back?  What could be wrong with that?  How bout this…

[Black Threads](http://newtonpens.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/img_6085.jpg)

While cutting the threads something went awry (I fixed it for the next barrel I made) and the thread cutting tool GOUGED into the barrel hard.  In hindsight I should have just trimmed the barrel back a bit and extended the threads farther up the barrel, but it was late and I was tired, so I cut the barrel off and started over.  :)   It’s okay, the new one is better.

But what about the blue pen?  Check it out….

[Blue Barrel End](http://newtonpens.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/img_6084.jpg)

Yeah, super goof.  I drilled the barrel out, threaded and shaped the barrel, and cut it away from the rest of the blank.  The problem?  I cut too close to the hole, and when shaping, I noticed how incredibly thin the end of the barrel was.  So I took a drill bit and shoved it through all the way, breaking the end away as you see in the picture above.  The end was so thin I could push it in with my thumb nail.  Now it serves as the tester pen for my #5 nibs.  :)

[Group Shot Two](http://newtonpens.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/img_6083.jpg)

And a picture of the replacement barrel, after some shaping.

Have been looking around for other pens, each for a certain purpose. 

My Lamy is great for work, and I'm not overly fussed if I lose it. I want a more expensive pen for general use outside of work, as I always carry a pen and a notepad with me just in case. I'm open to suggestions by the way, lol.

I've decided that the pen I want for special occasions is the Visconti Homo Sapiens. My fiance and I have decided that our wedding rings are going to be made out of palladium because it is, in my opinion, a more exclusive metal than gold, white gold, silver or even platinum. When we marry, I can't think of a better pen to use than the Visconti, especially because I love the fact it is made of a composite of lava! Very earthy, very nice to hold, very cool. And the brass finishing is great too, I love the patina you get on brass.

My partner and I decided that the Visconti will be an heirloom that should only be used for monumentus occasions: signing of marriage certificates, birth certificates, death certificates, etc. Jokingly, we've decided that it will also be used for the divorce certificate too!

so today I decided to go down to my local pen store (Laywines) intent on buying a Pelikan M200. I'd read about the parker 51 before but never was a fan of the hooded nib. After my uncle let me use his 45 flighter I reconsidered my stance on hooded nibs (for the better) anyway, this beauty got my eye and after testing out multiple pens I decided on the 51. Things took a turn for the worse when I got home (51 fans, don't worry everything turns out okay!). After flushing it and filling the massive aerometric filler with Diamine Presidential blue the pen flat out refused to write. I eventually managed to get it to write but it was drier than Death Valley and simply refused to do anything other than downstrokes. I flushed it again and tried it with Sheaffer skrip black (very runny ink that I love), still nothing. I was understandibly upset to the point where I almost went back to return it. But as luck would have it I compared my 51 to others online and found that my nib stuck out waaaay too far. After a firm push (cushioned by a cloth) I got the nib into the right position and BOOM! suddenly it wrote perfectly! I feel stupid now but whatever, a misaligned nib is nothing to cry over. Anyway, now that it was at the perfect wetness I started having lots of fun, I understand now why everyone hypes these pens so much!

some specs about the pen:

Year made: 1956 

Cap: 12K gold filed (whatever that means. I also have a vintage Cross century RB that says 14K gold filled aswell).

Nib: Fine, 14K gold (no flex due to the hood, doesn't bug me though).

Body: Black (india black or jet black, not sure the official name for the colour)

Mechanism: aerometric, sac is in perfect condition (restored by the dealer)

Rating: 9/10 (mark off because it's a tad bit long, perfect weight and balance though).

I don't know what started it but last week I had this deep desire to buy a fountain pen. I haven't used one for about 13 years, since I was at school really, when Parker pens were a sort of currency. They were at my school anyway.

So I went shopping and since I live in Korea the selection was reduced and everything was a good 40% more than you'd pay at home, so my options were limited. Nonetheless but I found a lovely looking Parker I.M premium which set me back a good 70 dollars with a bottle of blue Quink Ink.

I would have bought the Sonnet had they had the red laquered one but all they had was the silver and despite it writing like a dream I didn't fancy the looks of it much. I also tried the Pelikan M140 but it was really harsh and scratchy.

Aaanyway. i just wanted to say that I'm absolutely 100% addicted to FPs already and now I'm looking for my next pen. I just spoke to my mum and I think I have a couple of old parkers from about 18 years ago which she will have a root around for, so fingers crossed for that!

I've also been trying to learn cursive which has already improved my DREADFUL handwriting tremendously. 

Here's a pic of the pen and my attempt at cursive after a couple of days practice. Please ignore the spelling mistake.

I'm curious and have too much time on my hands, which hurt from fooling around with pens too much, why don't you tell me what got you into fountain pens? I'll start!


It started back in 3rd grade, I was born left handed, born into a muslim family, now in Islam, you're expected to use your right hand for everything, including writing, so, I was expected to conform to that policy, which I did. Que nasty handwriting, strain, and cramps. My grandfather, being devout, looked at my pen as the issue (it sorta was) It was a papermate erasable ballpoint pen, which he couldn't write with due to arthritis. He showed me one of his old fountain pens he used back in where he grew up, Bangladesh, it was a fountain pen, I don't recall what it was but I'm pretty sure it was the iconic Parker 51, he taught me how to use it, and thats how I started.


Fast forwards to 5th grade, some arse kid wants a fountain pen too, he gets some clone from eBay, and spills ink all over in class, this is in 2008, and fountain pens get *banned* from class. Heartbroken I write a letter to the teacher offering to instruct other who jumped the ""Bay"" for a fountain pen, and were making a mess of their clothes, as well as making a case for fountain pens, mentioning my left handedness. She declines instruction, but lifts her pen ban, the kid and his buddies never used fountain pens again, but I'm happily writing away with my new pen, a Jinhao, some cheap (but rather well performing brand from China) Made of celluloid, beautiful design, and razor thin gold trim that wore off in a month or two, I still have, and love that pen. My first own fp.


Boom, middle school now, the computer becomes my best friend, all the teachers want a typed report now, that and my struggle against puberty very much put the fountain pen out of use,



Now in 8-9th grade, I've been satisfying the boys and their toys stereotype with airsoft guns with my buddies. We all have a few, airsoft pistols, assault rifles, submachine guns, whew. Living in New York made this risky, as we have a ban on anything that looks like a real gun, most states accept the orange tip, New York State requires the entire gun to be painted a bright color, and of course, being teenagers, f*ck that right? Well one of my buddies gets randomly searched one day, and is arrested for carrying an imitation firearm, this coinciding with news from the NYTimes, which my family, including myself are avid readers of, a student was killed for threatening someone in school with an airsoft pistol over in Texas. My mothers response? Sell away the airsoft guns, all of them, I was pretty upset, but hey, what can you do? So I sold them, and my friends moved onto computer gaming, which I never got into. 


Now I have too much time in my hands, and I can't masturbate forever can I? Trust me I've tried, jk. Anyways, I needed something to do with my free time, my mother suggested getting back to my pen hobby, and with some cash from all those airsoft gun sales, why the hell not? Got myself and a Pelikan M600 White Tortoise, fell in love at the Fountain Pen Hospital in Manhattan. I'm starting 10th grade this September, and my collection has blown, I'm back baby! 



Some of you may question as to how a fifteen year old (seeing my other posts) has so much in pens, no I'm not rich, no I don't deal drugs, the airsoft guns gave me some good cash, with that, I've done restoration work, trades, reselling, and tutored kids, telling people you attend a good high school gets you twenty bucks an **hour**.

Thanks for your contributions, guys. I appreciate it. For this I paid $45, however I've also liked other French-made one which cost $100, so I didn't want to spend too much on a pen as it was my first one. It comes with two cartridges inside. One full, other empty (dunno why other empty). This one is German made, and I chose medium nib.

On a last note, I might have to head back to shop to get the dark blue ink cartridge. I currently don't like the current ink I have, as it seems too light blue.

This box was conspicuously missing black ink, though, which was an issue with taking notes. (I'm a notetaker for a class at my school, and as such am required to take notes in black for that class.) I also use pretty cheap recycled paper in my notebooks, so [my ink bled pretty terribly](http://i.imgur.com/M13Fc.png) for such a fine-tipped pen.

I ended up buying a bottle of Noodler's X-Feather Ink, and I am way too excited about it. I've been using it for everything: notes, homework, index cards. I've used it on all sorts of paper, from my cheap recycled paper to copy paper to index cards to relatively ink-resistant Moleskine paper. I have to be a little careful about smudging (particularly on the Moleskine), but it's really not that bad. It barely bleeds at all, even on the most porous paper!

It works well in my True Writer and also in my new Noodler's Flex Pen—no clogging or excessive flow.

All but one have met a tragic fate, but I still love them.",celloyouvegotabass,14,1,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/1jdaeo/ive_had_the_worst_luck_with_my_fountain_pens_all/,"Welcome to my 1st reddit submission!

http://imgur.com/a/Jmcfi

About 3 years ago I started working as a teller in a very busy bank.  I quickly realized that writing with a pen was a crucial part of the job.  Every day I had to sign my name on hundreds of important documents, logs, and large important checks, and also fill out hundreds of counter forms with huge chains of numbers, customer addresses, etc.  No matter how hard you try, doing all that with some ugly drug rep ballpoint just looks frantic and awful.

After a few months of surviving on the crappy promotional pens at work, I got my first fountain pen.  I was amazed at how much better everything looked.  Signature and numbers were bold, clear, and infinitely more legible.  And all without having to push down hard on the counter, or the little practice scribbles on the corner of the paper.  In fact, it seemed the lighter the better, which was great news for my tired achy wrist and hands.  I'm sure everybody here know that great feeling you get once you get used to it.  Instead of carving paper with a small stick, it was like I was actually writing with my mind.  The ink laid effortlessly on top of the paper with no friction, no scratching, no ruts, grooves, or scribbles.  I was hooked.  I got so good I could write a customer's name, address, phone #, email, and account # without looking down at my hands - exactly on the appropriate lines.

Even better than the satisfying performance was the reaction I got from customers when they noticed I was using a fountain pen.  Everyone was impressed.  It made my job easier. Cranky older people who were usually stern and grumpy became wistful and sentimental, recalling their childhoods, or even their parents' pens.  They always said ""That's all we had back then, I haven't seen a real pen in decades."" Or ""That's what we learned to write with in primary school."" or ""My father had a Waterman in the 1920s,"" etc.  They instantly respected me and bonded with me for it. A few people even brought their pens in to show me or talk shop.  Younger people were blown away ""Oh wow that's, like, a REAL pen!""  ""I didn't think they still made those,"" or ""Wow you must be, like, rich or something.""

Which brings me to my problem: Now, I'm not one of those guys that is always looking for his wallet/phone/keys.  I have never lost any of those things for more than a few minutes, except maybe leaving my phone in the car overnight (but I still knew where it was). I've had the same wallet since I was a teenager.  But for some reason, every pen I've had so far has been damaged/lost/stolen, except one.  And while I do treasure my 1981 Parker Arrow, it was nearly the cheapest fountain pen in my collection.  At this point I'm about to start putting them in my safe.

I created a gallery that shows my pens and a little bit about what happened to them, I'm still pretty sad about the one I got for my birthday, but I suppose it was only a matter of time.

Any advice on how to protect, or otherwise avoid losing fragile expensive pens?  I've seen pen cases, bags, etc. But I usually just carry one in a pocket.",,False,self,t5_2s0ew,False,,format f42,True,t3_1jdaeo,http://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/1jdaeo/ive_had_the_worst_luck_with_my_fountain_pens_all/,

My first foray into filling my new fountain pens tonight resulted in ... well, let's just say I hope that tablecloth is washable. Anyway, I'm clearly not doing it right because I don't think I'm supposed to wind up with ink all over my hands and the table.  So hopefully one of you pros can tell me what I'm doing wrong.

For reference, all of my pens use piston-type converters, such as the Pilot CON-50, where you have to dip the nib into the ink and then draw the ink up through the converter using the plunger/screw mechanism.  What happens is that when I put the nib into the ink and pull up on the plunger, I seem to get a bunch of air bubbles/pockets such that it looks like the converter isn't even filling up with ink.  But, when I turn the unit nib-side up and try to push out the extra air, all that happens is that I get ink coming through the nib/feed that gets all over my hands.   So while it doesn't look like the converter drew any ink, clearly ink is being drawn.  If I tap at the converter repeatedly, I can get some ink to drop down into the converter as well, but it never looks like the converter will actually fill up entirely due to the excess air in it.

What am I doing wrong?  I read online that I could just fill the converter itself with a syringe and then screw it into the nib unit, which I may try doing for the future.

Just happy to find like-minded fountain pen geeks like myself. I've been on Fountain Pen Network too, but reddit feels immediate.

Anyhoo, just got my [Pilot Cocoon](http://i.imgur.com/KA1isKU) yesterday. Doing some research, I discovered it's basically the Metropolitan, but for some reason is marketed in Japan as the Cocoon. The cost was $45 (compared to $15 for the Metropolitan). The main differences between the two pens, other than the price, are available colors (Cocoon has more options) and nib size (Cocoon comes in fine and medium, Metro only in medium).

I prefer my nibs fine, so the extra price was worth it.

* Is there any kind of maintenance I need to do to keep it nice?
* I've heard Lamy ink is bad. Should I get a converter? Is there a consensus among /r/fountainpens subscribers?

I just pulled it out now and have loved writing with it. I can write quickly and more legibly.

I wanted to buy more, but for practical, not collection use. I've been browsing around and I've heard people throw out the Sheaffer 100 and the Lamy safari.

Hence my question: Which pen is the best writer that can withstand everyday use, doesn't scream ""STEAL ME"" (this one can be ignored), and is decently priced for a student budget (less than 70, preferably less than 30). If I don't have to go out and guess which converter cartridge fits then that's a plus.

I currently am using a Sheaffer Black Quink Inkwell if that makes an impact on your decision.

I live in Toronto, so if anyone could recommend a shop I'd be grateful.

EDIT circa 20:11EST: If the nib is or can be replaced easily to a width of .5mm or less that's a big plus.

EDIT2 circa 19:13EST 18/04: I've decided to get both the TWSBI 540 Diamond Clear and the Lamy Studio Imperial Blue. I couldn't pick so I took the quick route out.

The line is also ever so slightly finer than I'd like. I was looking at either a Namiki Falcon or a Platinum 3776 Century, but I wanted to ask for advice on which would be better (of if there's another option).

* It'll be used daily for engineering school, so lots of writing on engineering paper, lab notebooks, math, index cards, math, math, etc.
* I'll probably stick with Bulletproof Black ink.
* I'm not sure which nib size to go with. I think a Platinum Maki-e in Medium would have worked out better for me over the Fine.
* I find the Maki-e a little small for my comfort. Not terribly noticeable, but it is on the smaller side.

I just received my Namiki Falcon which I ordered from Goulet, along with a bottle of Apache Sunset. I chose the cheapest shipping, which still amounted to $30 to the UK.

Upon receiving the package the standard rubberised Namiki box was absent and instead there was a only a little Pilot box the size of the pen and it appeared that all the leaflets and cartridge and stuff from the normal box was chucked in the brown shipping box (which happened to be slightly crushed in a corner but that can't have been them).

The pen works fine and I've spotted no damage yet, plus I'm pretty sure I still have everything that came with the normal box (except the box itself as shown in the Ink Noveau unboxing.) Nevertheless, I'm pretty disappointed that the shipping cost so much for what amounted to a couple of ounces of ink and what can't be more than 40g of pen and box (not including the large brown box) Is this normal?

One (a green one) was always filled with red ink and used to grade papers (Physics). The other was always filled with black ink and used for everything else. He wore them in his shirt pocket and ruined every shirt I ever saw him wear while growing up.

I thought you might like his response:
----------------------------------------------

I had two - both Lifetime - bought the black one in 1964 and used it every day for 35 years.  I gave the green one to your mother in 1966 but she rarely used it so I used it for about 30 years, then lost it.  I sent the black one back to the factory about four times for repairs and it never came back the same.  Only the engraved cap was the same - they changed the point every time and several times the cartridge mechanism.  I put the black one away when I retired - it seemed everything I had to sign needed a ballpoint (which I detest).  Since I no longer write lectures or grade papers  I now write with a Pentel P205 pencil.

I got my first ballpoint in 1948.  They were the latest thing back then.  My grandfather gave it to me - I think he won it somehow.  They cost $25  (about $250 in today's money) and it came standing vertically stuck in a circular metal base covered with a thick cylindrical transparent top.  Allegedly, it  would write underwater and in high flying aircraft.  It always skipped so I put it away.  

Are you not glad you asked?

I just had a few quick question about your experiences with Goulet Pens.

Firstly, how long did it take for your package to arrive? It's just that I'm becoming slightly worried about the pen and ink samples I ordered about two weeks ago that haven't arrived yet.

How much were the duties and such? How bad were the additional fees if any? Are the costs of shipping near equal to buying locally?

Would you trade the convenience of buying locally for the value of buying online? I really wanted to buy some more inks but I don't want to have to wait another 2 - 6 weeks for my next shipment. 

I should mention I'm a Torontonian.

Thanks a bunch!

1358374925.0,11,self.fountainpens,16pmfk,I sort of hate my Lamy Safari.,Triedd,18,7,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/16pmfk/i_sort_of_hate_my_lamy_safari/,"So, I had gotten a ""[Graf Von Faber-Castell Classic Anello Fountain Pen, Medium](http://www.amazon.com/Graf-Faber-Castell-Classic-Anello-Fountain/dp/B002B9L3AY/ref=sr_1_1?s=office-products&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1356474290&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=anello)"" for Christmas, but it was ugly.  I'm not a showy person and I really, really hated looking at it.  So, I did some research and asked you guys and came to the conclusion that I should make a Safari my first fountain pen.  With that, the Anello was returned.

Before returning the Anello, however, I did try it out.  I didn't like the metal ""grip,"" as my fingers sort of slid around on it, and I found that the cap made it top-heavy, but without it, the balance was perfect.  But the actual pen-to-paper part?  It was a dream.  I'm not even exaggerating - the nib slid over the paper with no perceptible resistance (I know some people like ""scratch,"" though) and the ink flowed beautifully.

Alright, so, the [Lamy Safari](http://www.jetpens.com/Lamy-Safari-Fountain-Pen-Medium-Nib-Charcoal-Black-Body-Black-Clip/pd/7011), being the workhorse missionary of the fountain world seemed like a reasonable decision.  I ordered it from [JetPens](http://www.jetpens.com/) (I recommend them, by the way), Charcoal with a medium nib.  I also ordered the [recommended converter](http://www.jetpens.com/Lamy-Fountain-Pen-Z-24-Converter/pd/1941).

The Safari is a great-looking pen.  It is light, but doesn't feel like it's trying to fly out of my hand.  I like the contoured grip, too.  Just, nothing about it is fussy.  I'd be proud to pocket this thing in any setting.

Oh, and the converter?  I was nervous about using it, because I had no idea how it worked, but it's entirely obvious.  Dip it in the ink and twist.  There are notches within the pen, and it slides in easily.

So, I knew there's be a break-in process.  I started with the cartridge (already in the pen) and started writing.  The nib didn't ""glide"" like the pen that cost 20 times more, but it was comfortable, in terms of stroking across the paper.  It's just that the ink would skip.  On a downstroke to the left, for instance, I might get no ink.  I shook the pen, dabbed it on the paper, tapped it, turned it upside down and dragged it - most of the 'fixes' worked, but lasted for a minute before the skipping started again.

So, after using the cartridge for a while, I pulled that out and went with the converter.  Same problem.  I ran ink through the nib a few times, hot (not boiling) water, etc...  Looked up all sorts of tricks, online.  Soaked it in some water and dish detergent.  Finally, I tried opening up the space in the nib with a razor blade (after watching an instructional video online).  

No matter the stroke, angle, pressure - I've tried everything - the ink does not flow.  The final straw was when my wife went to use the pen and asked for another, because it wouldn't write.  I tried to act like it's such an awesome pen and that she is doing it wrong.  She tried a bit longer and said she hated it.

Okay, so, I might've gotten a defective nib or something.  I don't know.  I'm not trying to turn anyone off of Safaris, because I know that 98% of the time, people love them.  This one just isn't working out for me.

The *last* thing I can think to do is buy a different brand of ink (Noodler's, I take it? - I'm averse because I don't like catfish 'cause of parasites and the worminess that is found in the flesh of many of them grosses me out - okay, I still eat fried catfish - the name, though, ""Noodler,"" was ill-advised... I know, I'm a freak).  Right now, I'm using Faber-Castell, but remember that these problems existed with the Lamy ink.

If this just doesn't work out for me, then I'll send it to someone who knows enough to fix or bury this pen, and would appreciate a Lamy, in case it works.  (Oh, and I don't want to fool with returning it to JetPens.  Again, they're great, but it'd be a bit of a hassle.)

Edit:  Grammar.

Update:  Hey, I appreciate all the feedback.  I'm going with a new nib.  I don't want to bother with asking for a free replacement, even if I can get it, just because I'd like a broad nib - the medium is good, but I think I'd like the broad.

So I was cleaning up my writing desk and found a box of unused 5 Lamy T10 cartridges in blue. Since I stopped using Lamy about a half decade ago, I figured who better to give it to than one lucky person here on this subreddit.

So... between now and 10pm PST, everyone gets a chance to guess one number between 1 and 198. I'm hoping you all with follow the honor system. How I'll choose the number. I will roll three six sided dice, multiply the faces, add all three faces and then subtract the multiple of the two lowest faces. If one of the lower faces is a two or less, I won't subtract the multiple but add it instead. So plenty of opportunities there.

Winner will be PM'd so good luck, if you want em.

EDIT: Hey everyone, I didn't realize I had to be out soon, thinking i'd stay a quiet night in. So before I go out running up a bar tab and signing the receipt with my Kaweco Dia, I'm going to push up the time to 830 PST. So final entries by then please. If I could i'd give each and every one of you a box of Lamy cartridges, but sadly, I am a college student with a box of cartridges that go to no pens and I can't afford the postage either.

EDIT2: (9pm PST) Hey, so the results are in, the lucky number was 32. Our closest number was 31 from trollforthelols who I will be shortly PM'ing. I rolled the dice earlier and tried shooting the video at the same time and fucked up my math royally so BrotherhoodoftheWolf will be also getting a little constellation prize for my big blunder. But thanks for playing guys, just maybe I'll have another lottery in the future.

Long time lurker of this sub, first post.  [This is my first pen](http://i.imgur.com/dfgGzi2.jpg?1), the Pilot Metropolitan.  I wanted to make sure I liked using a fountain pen (I suspected I would and I love it) so that's why I settled on this pen.  It was within my budget and so far I really like it all; has a good weight, cap that holds well, and apparently the cartridge bladder holds a lot of ink.  I wrote 6 letters, some several pages long, and didn't run out of ink until the end.  So the bladder holds a lot (I think I read 5 ml).

I like fine lines and the medium nib was fine enough for me.  I went with [Parker's Quink](http://www.gouletpens.com/Parker_Quink_Permanent_Black_p/pkr3001100.htm) in permanent black. I chose this because I have bad habits that introduce water (sweat) to the pages so I needed an ink that would not run whatsoever when wet.  Did some research and settled on it. This ink does the trick, and writes well even on really crappy notebook paper.

My question is, I have a two oz bottle of ink, right?  Well from the ink-refilling tutorial videos I've seen, the nib is entirely submerged...is that necessary?  Because then you'd have to buy another bottle of ink when the ink level was too low?  And how often do you clean your pen?

Also, is there really an advantage in having a fancy gold-plated nib?  Thanks!",,False,self,t5_2s0ew,False,,format f64,True,t3_1jppct,http://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/1jppct/my_first_pen_and_a_question/,

Some googling around revealed that they're notorious for needing a good cleaning before use, so I soaked the front part in water for a while, tried running water through it, tried soaking in a cup full of water with a drop of dish soap, drying it out and trying again repeatedly to no avail. 

My converter came in the mail today (though I still haven't received my Noodler's Black, so I'm only able to use the stock cartridge), and I tried another thorough cleaning, this time using the converter to flush. I did probably 30 flushes in soap water, then more than that in clean water, then let it soak in clean water for an hour, then let it dry for an hour, and still nothing.

I also read about the distance between tines and the distance between the nib and the feeder. Both seemed a bit tight and after some light pushing, I can slip a piece of notebook paper between both gaps. And yet I still must press down hard to get any sort of consistent writing. Lightly dragging it across the page will eventually get a consistent line going, but for writing words, it's hopeless. I have no idea what else might be wrong with it, do any of you?

Anyway, the former pen which I purchased for a special occasion spoiled me somewhat, so I was immediately looking for a high-end pen which is way above my pay grade, but everybody's got their thing and owning a fine pen is mine so I'm willing to sacrifice some things to be able to have that.


Realistically I could afford a Pelikan M200 or somewhere there about, standard M400s were already above what I've intended to spend. (I have a thing for Pelikan, you might have guessed). Ended up walking into some luxury design shop just to drool over GvFCs and casually asked about the price of their base models, only to find out they were giving 50% off on all models. So, I was able to get a princely platinum clad pen for a medium tier price. And I took the plunge.


ABOUT THE PEN:


First impression wasn't so much disappointment as much as it made me appreciate what amazing pens Pelikan truly are for the price. 


Weird balance at first, took a little getting used to - I'm used to holding the pen high and this one likes to be 'choked' a bit lower. Also, I was accustomed to writing with the pen posted, which I can't manage with this one (nor could anyone except Shaquille O'Neal perhaps), because the cap is too heavy and cantilevers over the palm.


The medium nib is gold and very smooth, not as wet as I'd perhaps like, but I'll try and tinker with that later. It uses cartridges which is a relief because I've often ended up with no ink mid sentence (as I'm quite prolific) and have developed anxiety issues because of it.


A few days later and I've grown more accustomed to the pen and am now starting to fall for it, experiencing it for what it is and not comparing it to the pen I used to own. The ebony shaft was the right choice, and I cannot overemphasize it. It just feels good, natural, warm and textured, it's not slick or slippery, moist, warm or cold. Just feels solid and dependable. For an object that is designed to be held, this really is the way to go. And also, I really like the way it looks, as I'm a slave to appearances. Sort of reminds me of a classical greek pillar (which is a bonus since I'm an architect), and the clip is beautifully designed.


Finally, I do think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. And a lengthy one, I hope.",,False,self,t5_2s0ew,1368981610.0,,format f58,True,t3_1emr64,http://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/1emr64/my_new_flagship_pen_graf_von_fabercastell_classic/,

     That would be absolutely amazing if you could do that for me. I highly appreciate your speedy response, and I will most certainly be buying your products in the future.
 PS: How did you know that that was my order even though I used a different email?

Hi Joseph,
    Yes, we can certainly accommodate your request! Just put a note in your order comments when you order, and we will do our best to give you 5 different colors. Or, would you like me to go ahead and add them to your order (Order ID # here) that you placed this evening, to save you separate shipping costs? 
 Thanks, 
Rachel Goulet

 Dear Mr. Goulet, or whomever it may concern,
     As of less than 2 hours of writing this e-mail, I ordered three products from your on line store: a pilot metropolitan (my first fountain pen), a bottle of Noodler's 54th Massachusetts, and a sample of Pilot's ""Kon-Peki"" in hopes that it would arrive in time for Christmas. As a student, I wish to acquire the best notebooks possible for a good price. I stumble upon this product on your website:
 http://www.gouletpens.com/Large_Lined_Clairefontaine_Wirebound_Notebook_p/c68145.htm
     I was wondering if i were to order five of these notebooks, if you would be so kind as to send me one of each color. It would be a tremendous help in organizing myself for the coming semester. Any response and cooperation would be extremely appreciated.
 Best Regards,
 (my name here)

I discovered through here the Goulet Pen Company and Noodler's and ordered a Konrad and some Bernanke black ink. They just arrived but I haven't been able to fiddle with it yet.

What I really liked was the note. I had asked for a drawing but the artist was on vacation. Brian Goulet wrote a nice note and drew a snowman in 54th Massachusetts ink (lovely color and shading). 

Thanks for bringing a smile to my face with it. I also got a lollipop out of the order!

I'll try to post some photos later.

Edit 1:

One of the first things I noticed about the pen was the size and weight. My Montblanc is heavy for the size, not too heavy but enough to feel it. The Konrad is lightweight. Very lightweight. That shocked me.

After removing the nib and feed (easiest thing ever) I scrubbed the feed with the rough side of a sponge and some soapy water. I inserted the nib and feed back and filled the pen with ink. I think because of the way I inserted the nib/feed I made the pen way too wet. But I like it since I always wanted something like that but being lefthanded made it difficult. Having the Bernanke Black there also helped made the experience enjoyable.

I did not have any problems with the pen, aside from normal railroading caused by my overzealousness in writing. I used Rhodia paper, so the experience was infinitely better if I had used some college notepad.

One thing is that if I use too much ink, really making it flex, it will cause feathering. I imagine it's because the ink was made to quick dry.

I already gave it a bit of an exercise, writing a letter to my penpal on the Rhodia. There was no issues with the pen, no skipping, and the ink was nice and wet with very thrilling line variations.

Now I will see if I can save enough to buy a pen case so I can carry it with no fear of the pen leaking in my pocket or breaking.",,False,self,t5_2s0ew,1355814790.0,,format noodlers,True,t3_150e56,http://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/150e56/just_got_a_new_pen/,

Also, it is hard to tell some blues, greens, and purples apart, especially when I am picking out colors on the computer and not in person.

I've been wanting to get a turquoise/teal/aqua (not really sure what the difference it) ink that is the color of the sea--something more on the greener side.  I picked up Noodler's Turquoise Eel recently, and while I like it, it looks just like a light blue to me with no hints of green.

Caran d'Ache Caribbean Sea looks like the color I'm looking for, though it is quite expensive.  Are there inks in similar color to this?  Or, if anybody has used this ink, how did they like it?

[Here's a writing sample](http://i.imgur.com/IP3BQ.jpg) (don't worry, it was an electronic patient whom I had to diagnose as a homework assignment, so no HIPAA violations). As you can see, it looks pretty normal. The only thing I've noticed in writing with it so far is that it's got a bit of an oblique cut. You can see that in the box I drew around the pt's temperature. The cross strokes are narrower than the vertical strokes. Is that subtle italic-ness the defining feature of a lefty nib? It's nearly imperceptible in normal writing.

choices? What should I know?",Captain-Lightning,11,0,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/11fjdv/im_new_to_fountain_pens_what_do_you_think_of_my/,"Heya. New guy here. I want to make the move to fountain pens because I've always hated the overly textured and ""grainy"" feel of pencils. Ticonderoga pencils are really nice, but they still have the whole dulling over time thing going on. Big fan of pens. Tried a gel pen for the first time years and years and years ago and *loved* it. The feel was perfect, and being able to glide across the paper and write smoothly / quickly is great. Nowadays though, I stick to ballpoint pens because I didn't like the bleed and how long it took to dry as well as for convenience reasons. I've had an occasional foray back into the gel pen crowd here and there, but I think it's time for something a bit more comfortable, bit more reliable, less willing to completely empty itself in two minutes, and a little less fragile / bleed-y.

My budget is ~25-125$ as I'm looking for something that'll last me forever and a day going about everyday tasks but isn't *too**dreadfully expensive. As a feelance web designer I'll be using it to make precise sketches of things here and there, but more likely it'll see major use in note-taking / worksheets on a semi-daily basis as a student.

So far I understand that as someone with thin and spidery handwriting I should be looking for Extra Fine (Fine, with Japanese pens, as they are much thinner than western pens) nubs that are either Iridium or Gold. I've also been told as someone with large hands (Palm a basketball large) I should avoid some of the smaller pens like the Pilot Cavalier, but I'm not too sure of that as I can write with the cheap and twiggish ballpoint pens out there pretty comfortably.

**TL;DR**
I've been considering the following:

* [Lamy Safari](http://www.jetpens.com/Lamy-Safari-Fountain-Pen-Extra-Fine-Nib-Charcoal-Black-Body-Black-Clip/pd/1937)
* Pilot Namiki Vanishing Point
* [Pilot Cavalier](http://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Cavalier-Fountain-Pen-Fine-Nib-Black-Body/pd/1532)

Which should I go with? Any negatives? Suggestions on Ink?

At $5, it is easily the best deal I've found for a fountain pen.  

The pen barrel is narrow, only 3/8"" in diameter.  Mine is black lacquer and has a surprising heft for its small size. It is a little short for my hands, but fits fine when the cap is posted.  The pen comes with a built-in piston converter that is friction fitted (no snap in like with the Lamy Safari) and uses a slider rather than a screw end, but I've had no problems with it.  The section is small, requiring a close grip from my large hands -- it has a triangular friction grip that is about 1/4"" in diameter.  But it is surprisingly comfortable for all that.  The nib is very smooth, with an immediate start and a soft, glossy ""wet"" feel that contrasts with the scratchy feel of my Lamy Al-Star EF -- even though, at 0.38mm, it is definitely within the EF range.  

I'm running Noodler's Nightshade ink.

On first load, the pen didn't write at all - there was apparently some oil or something on the nib from manufacturing, and I even filed an RMA with Amazon, because it simply wouldn't feed ink (though it worked as a dip pen out of the box...).  On a lark, I left the pen sitting overnight with the nib in a glass of water that had a few drops of dish soap in it, and the next morning it fed ink just fine.

I've been writing with it for about a week now, and the pen continues to grow on me.  The nib action is extraordinarily smooth and light.  I can't believe how inexpensive it was, it writes like a far more expensive pen.",,False,self,t5_2s0ew,True,,,True,t3_mfuro,http://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/mfuro/hero_713_038mm_hooded_pen_amazing/,

I'm new to the fountain pen world.  It started when I found a [Pilot Varsity disposable fountain pen](http://www.amazon.com/Varsity-Disposable-Fountain-Medium-PIL90010/dp/B001E6C1KQ).  I know it's one of the worst fountain pens out there, but it intrigued me.

They're a great size, but I have a few complaints about them and looking to try something new that might work better. 

Here is what I like and loath about the Cahier books:

Like:
-Small form factor, easily fits in my trouser pocket
-Available with blank pages or square gridded.
-Off white colour paper works well with sketches and looks good too.

Dislike:
-Milage varies, they don't hold up well in the outdoors.
-Left handed and therefor use the journal in reverse causing me to write on the detachable sheets first.
-Detachable sheets fall out over time and the book degrades quickly.
-Quality of paper is largely random and far too inconsistent for use with fountain pens.


So, I'm looking for just notebook for my pocket for quick notes/sketches. I've heard that Field Notes are good, but I was curious if anyone has any experience with them or any others I'm not aware of.

While I've noticed a general overall consensus on good inks, and even a suggested starter pen. I've not seen an attempt to consolidate this information into a FAQ. Or any sort of ""How to get into fountain pens - the FAQ"". I know writing, and choices of inks, pens, and papers are a pretty personal thing. But I was curious if the community would be open to offering up their personal selections so that we can draw a consensus of what's the most common cross selection. This would allow people new to fountain pens to have a good starting point, and possibly tips on technique for writing.

What I'd recommend as a format is (this is obviously intended as an example):

|Pen(Nib Size)|Ink|Paper|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Lamy Safari(F)|Noodler's Black|Printer Paper|


For those not familiar with tables in Reddit you separate the cells with | characters. The formatting actually kicks in when you define one line with :-- (or more dashes for ease of reading) the position of the colon changes the alignment of the subtext the example would align left, in the middle would align in the middle and on the right would align right. Then you go back to defining cells using | characters. I've copied the above table here in formatting for reference:


\|Pen(Nib Size)|Ink|Paper|

\|:--|:--|:--|

I haven't tried enough inks to really have picked a favorite at this point, but so far I've been using [Noodler's Lexington Gray](http://www.gouletpens.com/v/vspfiles/assets/images/swabshop/names/N-LexingtonGray.jpg) because it's a good shade of gray which looks nice and professional, but isn't extremely dark, so it can be used for a lot of different purposes.  Cons are that it isn't too dark, so I have to deal with that.

I'm not afraid to put a bit of money into the hobby.

1340512169.0,10,self.fountainpens,vigwz,Hello /r/fountainpens!,Talas,10,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/vigwz/hello_rfountainpens/,"Very recently, I decided that I would try my hand at writing with a fountain pen. Not wanting to go all in right away, I decided to buy a Bic disposable fountain pen and give it a go. Needless to say, but I'll say it anyway, I haven't stopped writing since I got it. Nothing fancy, just dribble and signatures, trying to get a feel for the pen itself.

I want to get your opinions if I may, on what my next step should be. I will begin teaching my first class this spring (go 8th grade humanities!) and I want to have a sturdy and refillable pen that I can afford to maintain, and lose if the worst occurs, on what little funds I will have. I'm enjoying the fine nib on the Bic, but I feel the ink is a little heavy, or perhaps my paper is a little thin. I also enjoy the weight of the pen, as it glides across the page. If anyone feels they have any solid recommendations, please feel free to reply!

Thank you for taking the time to read this, regardless of whether or not you post!

I've just had a pen explosion and I'm down to my spare and I thought it was about time to get a decent pen. So after a lurk on /r/fountainpens I've whittled it down to 3 pens; the Waterman Expert II, the TWSBI 540 Diamond (I'm not a fan of screw caps but I guess I can get used to it), and the Lamy Safari. (but I'm open to other suggestions as well). The Safari is by far my least favourite (I prefer the Studio) but I think the window will be too useful because I'm stuck if it runs out in the middle of a lecture.

Bearing in mind that I had no idea what a piston pen was until today, which would be better for every day use? I have no ink and no bottle (nor do I have have the adapter for the TWSBI) either. I do tend to press on the paper slightly and I prefer a medium nib. I am a student so my budget isn't unlimited (are the TWSBI bottles really £25 each?).

Also is there any maintainance required for piston pens? Is refilling a pen particularly messy?

PS: I'm amazed at how much cheaper bottled ink is compared to cartridges!

EDIT: Thank you to everyone for all of your suggestions. I bagged myself a TWSBI Diamond 540 for £32 on ebay! I also got some Pelikan Royal Blue ink (4001) for £7. The TWSBI bottle has gone on my birthday list for a months time because it's too gorgeous to say no to ;)",,False,self,t5_2s0ew,True,,,True,t3_t42x1,http://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/t42x1/questions_from_a_fountain_pen_noob/,

Can't wait to get it!

I've always written in cursive since I was taught it in 2nd grade (and apparently I was the only one, as virtually no one I know uses it now).  But, I would like to formalize my penmanship and learn a style that is both ""fancy"" and yet masculine, while still remaining legible to most people and that would be useable in professional settings as well as the occasional love note to the girlfriend........

I have used fountain pens before, but only for dinking around or the occasional journal writing, so I'd still call myself a fountain noob.

So, great minds of r/fountainpens, what would be a good style to learn, and where might I find a good resource or sytem to practice it?
