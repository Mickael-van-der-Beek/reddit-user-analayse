...OK so I know half of them have now retired, but never mind, it's still a cool milestone, may there be many more! Thank you all, for your posts, comments, votes, pageviews and other contributions that collectively make this subreddit what it is.

Welcome also to /u/rya11111, who joined the mod team a while back, and has been very helpful! And who can be found in /r/dailyprogrammer and various other locations.

I did try and cobble together some celebratory CSS - demo [here](/r/websites) - but I think it's a bit grim. My goal was to take some glare out of the white, but there's a line, and I think I crossed it. Suggestions?

Indeed, if you have any comments or ideas for us, on any topic, please add them below, or send us a modmail or PM, we're happy to hear, anytime!

Thanks also to jgs &amp; ejm97 for the ASCII. Found [here](http://www.chris.com/ascii/index.php?art=holiday/4th%20of%20july).

Also, I think the timestamp needed by Livestamp.js is a little simpler than the one needed by timeago. I've thought about supporting additional timestamp formats, but I haven't gotten to it yet.

So I work with support tickets via a web interface quite a bit. I was getting tired of copy/pasting canned responses into the textarea, then manually finding the sections that needed custom data (xxx anyone?), so I decided to try my hand at creating a plugin to fit my needs.

I'm really hoping to get some feedback on the code. What did I do horribly wrong? What did I do moderately wrong? Was there anything I did correctly? That type of stuff.

By a stroke of good luck, I recently became moderator of this subreddit, and having attended urgent matters (eg, spam filter), I thought I'd take a moment to say hello.

So... hello! :) May I compliment you on a great subreddit. My goals are basically to keep it running (eg, spam filter), work on the sidebar, do a bit of promotion... and maybe a little bit of CSS?

I'd also like to apologize for the previous moderator, who left a lot of stuff in the spam filter, which is now cleared. If your post was stuck in there - and some were there for 2 years or more - I'm really sorry. I'm using a script to manage the spam filter, and hope to give an improved performance.

Lastly - do you have some ideas for the sidebar? I'd like to link to some sites - preferably news/journal type sites where interesting news/articles about jQuery can be found - do you have a favorite? And, are there other things I might add, aside from links to other sites and subreddits?

If you have ideas or comments, on these or other topics, I'd be happy to hear them, please add below, or [send me a PM](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=Pi31415926) anytime.",,False,,t5_2qhs4,True,,,True,t3_qwc8f,http://www.reddit.com/r/jquery/comments/qwc8f/rjquery_has_a_new_moderator/,moderator

*$('.container h3').clone().appendTo($(this).closest('inner-section').find('.target'));*

But it doesn't seem to match anything. In fact, even if I change it to *appendTo($(this).parent());* it still doesn't match anything. Even if I change it to *appendTo($(this));* it doesn't match anything.

If I target a specific div by its id, then, predictably, all of my h3's end up inside it. So I suspect that *this* isn't targeting the h3's.

I want that whenever I click D, the gen-men hides and spec-men shows (spec-men has a button that makes it go away for gen-men to come back).  That is fine and I got it work perfectly.

When I click S, I want D to be deleted from the html (which I did and works fine).  The problem is it also triggers the hiding of gen-men and showing of spec-men as if the click on D is triggering before it realizes it is clicking S.  I tried to add a way to switch it back again in the on method for S but it did that first.  How can I change up the ordering (or make it not trigger the on D method in that specific case)?

I couple this with colour selector plugins to enable a ""live preview"" version of the site.

it is driven by data attributes, 

* selector: the jQuery Selector to use to apply the css setting to: defaults to the source element

* property: the css property to set: defaults to 'background-color'

* event: the jQuery event to trigger the change, defaults to 'change'

* after: a call back to execute after the property(ies) are applied


anyways, this is my first plugin, please let me know of anything i should change, or if you find this useful!

the plugin and small demo:
http://jsfiddle.net/CQaVJ/3/

**edit: made a few small changes: http://jsfiddle.net/CQaVJ/6/**

**edit: with your help and some bug fixes: http://jsfiddle.net/CQaVJ/10/**

has a property ""setSourceBG"" which enables toggling the input's bg within the event (true by default)
and ""runOnInit"" which runs the script once after it is loaded to configure set any default values (true by default)

now allows multiple properties to be set on the same selector (3rd box in demo)... had to re-arrange the way the data- attributes were stored

**clarification edit**
sure, sorry!

Just to clarify: it changes element css styles, it is just a shortcut for doing something like $(selector).css('color','red');
in the demo, 

* the first input box, typing in a css colour (red, #f00, rgb(255,0,0), rgba(255,0,0,0.5)) will change the background colour of the box itself (default behaviour) onChange (change the focus after entering colour)

* 2nd box is the same, but it also applies the change to the background-color of .prettyBox matched elements
 
* 3rd box is onKeyUp, and should change the height and witdth of the divs (though the width isn't changing, hrmm, working on it)

* 4th box, just demonstrates the callback, it fires the callback, and writes to the console

its just a tool to make css changes ""directly"" preview-able withouth having to write much jquery for each element

I started a prototype of the site using Knockout. And while I quickly feel in love with the two way binding, that love didn't last.

But this isn't about Knockout...

I started building out the Admin section and decided to switch gears. After doing some research I decided to give Backbone a try.
Everything was going fine. I created several sections within admin and I was pulling live data out of the database. I couldn't be happier with the way it was going.

Until I started testing Object creation, and then I noticed that nothing was saving to the database. The SlimPHP wasn't returning an error message, there wasn't a 404 message (which looking back on it there should have been). Simply nothing was happening.
I started looking at Chromes Network monitor, and noticed that my Save Model method was sending a PUT request, instead of a POST (for a new model). 
When i searched the tubes I found loads of stuff about sending POST when it should have been sending PUT, but absolutely nothing about my situation.

I must have gone back and forth with this problem for about 3 days off and on. I must have read and re-read the router (paragraph) docs a dozen times. 
It didn't make any sense. 
Another confusing issue I saw was that creating a new model, would add an id value of ""add"". 
I honestly couldn't discern where this was value coming from. At no point in my code or in Backbone, or in underscore, could I find any reference of an id being set to ""add"".

Last night I  built a sample backbone app, with just a single model, view.. to test this out. I quickly found that it was acting exactly like it was supposed to. 
I sat back and looked at my code again. I knew it had to be in the router (where the EditView was being called from). but where... And then it dawned on me...
... 
""links/add"": ""addLink"", 
""links/:id"": ""getLink"", 
... 

No where else in my route config did I have those two switched. Only in the Links section.
So I switched them around aaaaaaaand it worked.

Yep. 
Route order is very important... 

Lesson learned...

I don't know how (or if) this could be accomplished in jquery, but in video production, you typically have [a black and white video clip](http://www.pond5.com/stock-footage/285859/black-and-white-transition-geometry-background-11-hd.html) of the transition, and then tell the editing program to assign the starting video clip the black areas and the ending video clip to the white areas. I don't need to make it work this way, I'm just mentioning it as an example in case it sparks any clever ideas. If there's some other method, I'm all ears (or eyes, I guess).

Is something like this possible? If so, how might I go about doing it? Any resources you can point me to would be highly appreciated!

Basically, I have two images side by side, with an element above both (high z-index, absolute positioning). When users click on each image, it would then 'lift' just that image above both the central element &amp; the other image (as can be seen in the sample). Those elements (the opposite image and the central element) will then both fade out a bit as well.

However, there's also a catch. Each image has multiple DIV elements contained within it, that are carefully positioned. Those won't change, but will appear when the image has 'lifted'.

I first released [jquery.ellipsis](https://github.com/pboling/jquery.ellipsis) a few months ago to no fanfare, and today have released my latest work, [jquery.environment](https://github.com/pboling/jquery.environment).

I would appreciate any advice you can give me as a relatively fresh jQuery dev, and new to this subreddit (Hi, nice to meet you all!).

Edit: Apparently it wasn't clear to what **jquery.environment** allows you to do:

* Access global settings through `$.environment`

* Have a standard interface for accessing global settings across projects

* Have a standard way to set environment settings in javascript based on server side code (when the DOM is generated server-side)

    `&lt;body data-environment-configuration=""{verbose: 'true'}""&gt;)`

    then later...

    `if ($('body').environment('verbose' == 'true')) {log_something};`

* Make it clear that information is a global setting, without resorting to varaible_names_that_suck_this_is_global

A few questions:

1. I've noticed that the official jQuery plugins site is... erm... not exactly... so where do you all go to find the latest hot jQuery open source.  Is there a jQuery equivalent of RubyGems.org?

2. Did I commit any javascript or jQuery sins in my first two plugins?  Please let me know as I would like to avoid them in my next one [jquery.cacheableFlash](https://github.com/pboling/jquery.cacheableFlash).

3. Is there prior art?  Has a jquery.environments-like project been done before?  Coming from rails it seemed like the first thing I needed, and I wasn't able to find anything.

I hope someone can give me some advice.

Is something like this possible with jQuery?

1. User enters a URL in a top frame. The contents of the URL load in a bottom frame.
2. User clicks a ""fetch"" button in the top frame, and when he moves his mouse over dom objects in the bottom frame they are highlighted. If he clicks on one of the highlighted objects, the dom element is stored in the clipboard or pasted into a textarea in the top frame.
3. The user now has the dom details of the item he wants to scrape.
4. She then uses this item's dom details with phpdom or some other function to scrape the contents of the website in the future.

Is this possible using jQuery or would the frame / something else prevent this from being possible?

1368924412.0,6,self.jquery,1eltst,[HELP] JQuery - animation speed change only happens when I leave browser window and return,VickysAsleep,7,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/jquery/comments/1eltst/help_jquery_animation_speed_change_only_happens/,"I've been working on this all day as part of a much larger self-project and have come across a slight problem: http://jsfiddle.net/GYv22/2/


I am trying to change the speed of the ball on the fly using the faster/slower buttons. This used to remove the current CSS animation style (with the old speed), however I found it works as expected without doing this, and now just appends a new style (with the new speed) - the animation is using keyframes utilising the translate3D property. Not sure if this is the best way to do it, but I thought it was better suited than using classes as I am dynamically changing the animation speed constantly.


    function animate(x, y) {
        $('#xSpeed').html(x);
        $('#ySpeed').html(y);

        var horizontalCSS = 'updown ' + y + 's infinite linear';
        var ballCSS = 'leftright ' + x + 's infinite linear';

        $('#horizontal')
            .css('-webkit-animation', horizontalCSS) /* Chrome */
            .css('-moz-animation', horizontalCSS) /* Firefox */
            .css('animation', horizontalCSS); /* IE */

        $('#ball')
            .css('-webkit-animation', ballCSS)
            .css('-moz-animation', ballCSS)
            .css('animation', ballCSS);
    }

This works as expected in Firefox (albeit slightly jittery, but speed changes are in real-time i.e. when you click the buttons the ball gets faster/slower!), **in Chrome I have to leave the tab and return to see the speed change** (???), and in IE 10 the ball animation works, but there is no speed change at all, even when leaving/returning to the tab or in real time.

I think the issue is that the animation style is being appended to #horizontal, and I also want it to affect its child element, #ball. This is necessary for future styling changes I am adding, as I want to have other elements moving alongside the ball at the same speed, all moving within 'horizontal'. However, it seems that the child element is not being updated property e.g. until I leave the tab and return. In chrome if I use 'Inspect Element' to inspect the ball directly, the div outline which appears when hovering over the code for #ball is moving independently of the ball on screen!

My question is this: When viewing the timeline on a mobile device (not a tablet), the navbar changes so that you can jump to the previous or next decade by clicking one of the arrows. 

I'm concerned about the performance of the animation. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S3 (one of the most powerful Android phones out) but it's still extremely sluggish in both Chrome and Dolphin browser. How can I make it faster? The code that controls the jump and animation can be viewed here:

	$timeline.find("".dec-banner"").on(""click"", ""a"", function(event) { // bring user to previous or next decade if clicked on in the decade header
		var $navlink = $(this).attr(""href"");
		if ($(this).parent().hasClass(""decade-jump-prev"")) {
			$(""html,body"").stop(true, true).animate({scrollTop: $($navlink).offset().top-43},""fast"");

		if ($(this).parent().hasClass(""decade-jump-next"")) {
			$(""html,body"").stop(true, true).animate({scrollTop: $($navlink).offset().top},""fast"");
		}
		event.preventDefault();

Is this animation hardware accelerated? If not, can I somehow force it to be?

The task is, a scrollbar which only appear on mouseover and with rounded corners (like facebook). Well there are a few frameworks for it.

I'm making a preview site for responsive webdesigns for a customer.
So an picture/mockup get uploaded and shown in an ipad, iphone and desktop. 

Thats a pretty easy part with z-index, and overlapping divs and transparent ipad png's. 

But sometimes the mobile website is pretty long. So you need to scroll down. It's not that good looking with the css styled scrollbar. But the most jquery scrollbars, shrink the content down with javascript. So if javascript is disabled, the whole mobile website would be shown over the small iphone. Not very nice.

Thats why it should only show the fix width part, if js is disabled.

I have functionality in my application where I can replace a container with different forms based on what the user wants to do. Up to now (jQuery 1.8.3) I was performing an AJAX call retrieving the form which included at the end &lt;script&gt; tags containing the validation rules for that form. This was perfect for maintenance as the form and its validation rules were contained in the same file. 
What I noticed now with 1.9 is that a form will load, all the validation rules will be active but switching forms back and forth will cause the validation rules not to execute again.

So, in short, I'm replacing a container with something like this:

    &lt;form id=""..."" method=""post"" action=""...""&gt;
       &lt;input ...&gt;
       &lt;button ...&gt;

       jQuery(function($) {
          $(""form-id"").validate(...);
       });
    &lt;/script&gt;

Now, with 1.9 this is not allowed anymore as that script will execute only once. So, from a design or architectural point of view what should be the most efficient way to implement something like this? Should I just put a function in my main scripts for each form and return another field with my ajax response on what function to execute?

I'll appreciate any help...

A client of mine wanted an image to fadeIn when the page loaded. No prob right? I've done this before using this rough script wrapped in the normal $(document).ready():  
  
    $(mySelector).bind('load', function(){  
        $(mySelector).hide();  
        $(mySelector).fadeIn(3000);  
    })  
  
Worked in chrome, safari, ff, ie7-8 but not ie9. Weird.  
The .load(function()) wouldn't work in ie9 either.  
  
After staring at the wall for a bit, I decided to use the .ready() method instead:  
  
    $(mySelector).ready(function(){  
        $(mySelector).hide();  
        $(mySelector).fadeIn(3000);  
    })  
  
And that worked across the board. What's going on? Is there a bug with .bind('load', function()) in ie9? I don't feel that this script is right either (even though it works).

    Communication Mechanism
    The JSON messages are exchanged over a socket connection with the SDKâs TCP port.
    Best Practices
    â¢ As it is the nature of TCP to disassemble and reassemble packets, a NULL character
    (â\0â) is used to terminate each JSON message to guarantee the JSON message
    delivery. A SDK application should rely on the NULL character to separate one JSON
     message from the next.
    â¢ For a system with lots of groups and agents, the SDK can stream a large volume of data
    under load or busy conditions, which should be taken into account in any SDK
    application. A SDK application should drain available data as soon as possible from the
    socket following TCP/IP best practices. Also, there is no time out mechanism on TCP
    connections. So a SDK application should be careful about TCP connection leaks.
    â¢ Each TCP connection with the SDK is treated as a live session. A session ends when
    the TCP connection is closed or lost. In case of a server reboot, system failure, or
    LAN/WAN outage, TCP connections might be lost/terminated. It is the responsibility of
    the SDK application to detect the status of the TCP connection and reconnect and resubscribe
    as necessary.

(when the page loads, they see this: )

* **All**
* Industry 1
* Industry 2
* Industry 3

If they click on Industry 1, the other categories will disappear, and they will see this (the list also refines with each click)

* All
* **Industry 1**
   * Sub Industry 1
   * Sub Industry 2
   * Sub Industry 3

So, in the above, it's only listing sub industries of Industry 1.  Clicking ""All"" would revert back to the original list.  And if they click a Sub Industry, it wouldn't refine any further, but only ""bold"" the Sub Industry.

My (broken) code is this, so far.

    $('ul.list_child').hide();

    $('.list li').first().click(function(){
    	$('ul.list_child').hide('slow');
    	$(this).siblings().css('font-weight', 'normal');

    $('.list li').first().nextAll().click(function(){

    	$('ul.list_child', this).css('font-weight', 'normal');
    	$('ul.list_child', this).show('slow');
    });

And of course, you'll notice two things.  (1) I'm quite terrible with jQuery, and (2) it doesn't work properly.  Any tips or pointers?  I know I need to read up on selectors some more, but time is of the essence!

although I have little to no jQuery experience I somehow got assigned to finish the work of a coworker who quit. Long story short: I have to program jQuery stuff for our Dynamics CRM 2011.

Things get complicated when needing to refresh the page or change the sort order.

I've got a form for a website that is to submit registrant information upon successful completion of the form. If the form is not properly completed, then it is to display an error message.

My form action is... action=""&lt;?php echo $_server[php_self]; ?&gt;"" which then calls on the php I have above all my html markup - Which is:


&lt;?php

Like I said, I'm using JQuery slideToggle function to open and close accordion content, and this form lies in one of those accordions.

&lt;?php

&lt;?php } if($sent == true) { ?&gt;

After the form is submitted, I can't get it to leave the corresponding accordion open so that the user sees the error or thank you message.

In the 'change' area, I've got some code in to throw up some alerts - the new color value and the target div's existing b/g color value - then attempt to change that div b/g color - and then another alert with the new color/target div's b/g color.

No matter what, the div's b/g color switches to black (rgb(0,0,0) is what's reported). And after the attemp, I'm able to change the div's b/g color just fine, still within the Spectrum 'change' function pile.

The same thing happens when switching from b/g color to just 'color' to fiddle the color of the text within the div - it just goes to black.

What gives? The code is fine, the syntax is fine. I've tried passing the new color in as an RGB value instead of a hex - no luck.

**Edit:** Figured it out. Gotta throw a "".toString()"" off the end of the passed-in color variable to get it to work. Annoying.

I feel as if the reason that only the last row can be deleted is that the row suddenly becomes attached to the 'Submit' button, somehow, and only then, is the delete button able to be hit. After a new row is submitted, I think, it becomes unlinked, somehow, from the submit button, and is disabled.

However, if I pull the ""//Deletion of Line"" section out of the Submit button's brackets, then it doesn't work at -all-!

I found StickyPlugin, a great jQuery plugin ""that gives you the ability to
make any element on your page always stay visible."" (http://stickyjs.com/)  I'm using it to get a nav to stick to the top of the page on a site I'm building. (That is, it sticks once the nav reaches the top of the page.) 


Now. Inside the nav I have a -ul li a- list structure. The li's have a top and bottom padding on them of 35px. I want to make it so that when the sticky plugin activates, the padding on those li's change to 15px. (In effect, it gets narrower.) On line 56-58 of the JS, I tried adding css('padding-top', 15px); - but that adds padding to the nav itself, and I don't want that (it screws up my borders).

I tried to find an explanation on that from the internet but I've yet to find an answer. So I'm posting it here in hope someone can explain.

I have a jquery .live on all form#formId that basically do a .post of the form. Very basic jquery stuff. Everythign works as expected all all browser but chrome.

I tried different thing and it never worked out until I actualy put a print_r($_POST) as the very first line of the view containing the form. Then it worked. After a few test, I found out that just putting $myvariable; as the very first line of the view works as good. If I remove that line containing the empty variable, the .post just get a ""fail"" status in chrome developer tool.

Anyway know?

EDIT :  Code provided

So, here is the code. I'm not using the .on() handler over the .live() because the jquery library in the project isn't up to date to use the .on() and there is some other library dependancy in the project that would make it hell to update to the latest version of jquery.

    $('form#myEdit').live(""submit"", function(){
    var form = this;

    $(""input[type='submit']"", this).replaceWith(""&lt;img src='/library/images/preloader.gif'&gt;"");

     $.post(

      $(form).attr('action'), 

      $(form).serialize()+""&amp;xmlhttprequest=1"",

         function(html)

	 {

	    $(form).closest(""div#boxAddress"").replaceWith(html);

	    $('tbody tr').removeClass(""alt-row"");

	    $('tbody tr:even').addClass(""alt-row"");

         },

	 ""html""

       );

       return false;

     });

The view itself is a very standard Zend Framework view containing something along the line of this


    &lt;?php 
    // $chrome;     &lt;-- this is the line that makes it work, if I uncomment this, it work no problem.
    if ($this-&gt;row): ?&gt;
    Display the form

I'm building a mobile web app in my class, and unfortunately my professor is the least helpful resource ever. I'm fairly new at this stuff, so bear with me if I'm explaining something oddly.

Basically, I have this SQL database (of baseball players) hosted on my own server. Through a bunch of code, I've gotten it to connect successfully and pull some data from the columns within the tables within the database, and set them up as variables, via a separate process.php file. 

The goal is to be able to search for these variables in the database and generate a list. That part works. Now, I'd like each of the list items to be a link to another page, displaying the player's statistics, and using the unique, per-player ID as part of the URL. 

Each part of the list is generated as another variable, $results.

This is how I have it set up:

    $results .= ""&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href='#baseball"" . $playerID . ""'&gt; List Item Content &lt;a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;"";

Since we're in that separate .php file, this would just append baseball + the playerID to the URL, and it would go to that div as a page, as far as I understand. 

Here's how I'm generating the page.

    $playerpage .= ""&lt;div data-role='page' id='baseball"" . $playerID . ""'&gt;"";

Ideally, this would create that page to send the list item too... Right?

I'm using the jEditable plugin and the following code to toggle between ""On"" and ""Off"" for a series of settings on a page:

When the text ""On"" is clicked, it produces a dropdown menu with On and Off in it, which the user can then select. What I would prefer is that clicking the text not open a dropdown, but instead send the current text On or Off to the save.php file. I could then just write the save.php file to return the opposite value, so that clicking just toggles between the two without opening any kind of edit window. I tried the following code:

	$(document).ready(function() {
	$('.editable_select').editable('http://someexamplepage.com/save.php', { 
		indicator: '&lt;img src=""/images/spinner.gif""&gt;',

I'm working on a project in a cms that doesn't really allow complete control over output(without a lot of overhead). I'm trying to create a .js snipped that does the following.

www.jsbin.com/iquyuh/1/edit

As you can see, there are labels and divs. There is a fortunate commonality in that each label is unique to its child div. In the CMS, there is a whole bunch  of markup in between these elements. 


What I want to do, is when a user clicks on the label, it toggles the display of the div(shows/hides).

What I can't figure out is the most elegant way for jQuery to target the div based on class. Since this is in a cms, I'd like to keep the jQuery generic(no specific calls) so it can scale.

To summarize, a user clicks the label for foo_01. jQuery looks for an element who has the class foo_01, and toggles it.

I've been looking for DAYS for a simple slideshow that can accommodate both landscape and portrait images in a particular way, with no luck.  I've made a start on it but whilst I know my way around HTML/CSS, my Javascript/jQuery knowledge is fairly limited. I'll try to explain. 

The layout:
I'm after a jQuery slideshow (presuming that's the best way) that has a fixed container size of say 600x600. I then want to load landscape and portrait images (600px long edge, 400px short edge) into it. There should also be a container with thumbnails underneath (although I can't work out whether all thumbnails should be square or not).

The actions:
As per most slideshows... auto play, pause on hover, skip to a particular slide if you click on a thumbnail. 

The look:
This is where I got stuck. I ideally want the images to be centered in the container... screenshots included. 

http://baldandangry.com/gallery_test/test_port.jpg
http://baldandangry.com/gallery_test/test_land.jpg

The idea:
This is the only way I can see landscape and portrait images working in the same slideshow, without squashing aspect ratios of one orientation or moving the thumbnail container.

I HAVE started coding it, but got caught (just so you guys don't think I'm a complete slacker :P)

I can put down multiple markers on the map and they'll show up using their actual addresses, but only 11 of them. Then the rest wont' show up unless I geoencode the addresses first and use their lat/long instead of the address.

I've looked over the Google Maps API Documentation, and the GMap Documentation and can't find any mention of this limitation. Infact the limit on Google Maps API Documentation says it can do 2,500 geoencodes per day. Since I'm still building the site and no one but me is refreshing the page, I'm obviously not maxing this out.

To clarify, when I want to put a pin on the map I can use the easier address listing like this:

    address: ""123 Main St, Generictown, IN, USA"",
    address: ""345 Main St, Generictown, IN, USA"",
    address: ""456 Main St, Generictown, IN, USA"",
    address: ""789 Main St, Generictown, IN, USA"",

If I use this method for 20 pins on the map, only the first 11 of them will show up. If I remove one of the address lines and replace it with a lat/long line then an additional one will show up.

    latitude: -39.014389, longitude: 80.159938,
    latitude: -39.014389, longitude: 80.159938,
    latitude: -39.014389, longitude: 80.159938,
    latitude: -39.014389, longitude: 80.159938,

This site will ultimately have a hundreds of pages with maps and the addresses that will be displayed will be updated every month or so as the company gains and removes new and old properties for each location.  So I don't want to require the converting of address to lat/long unless there is no way around this limit. 11 seems like a really weird (and low) number for there to be a limit on this.

So I use jQuery UI tabs and I get content from an ajax page. I have also added the delegation of links to load them in the tab. When I click a couple of link in there, without reloading the whole page, the JavaScript in the page is being loaded every time, so if I execute some JavaScript that is present in the ajax page, it gets executed several times. Is there a way to ""unload"" the JavaScript easily? I think I can use iframes but it's not a very clean solution, I'm pretty sure there's a best practice somehow, but I don't know what to look for. Please note that I'm a self learner and I have no degree in programming whatsoever, I just enjoy it. Thank you in advance for your help.
So here's the main page

      $(""#itemTabs"").tabs({
       load: function(event, ui) {
        $(ui.panel).delegate('a.nojs', 'click', function(event) {
         event.preventDefault();
         $(ui.panel).load(this.href);
       });
      }
     });

In one of the tab, I have an ajax page with some links inside, those links are targeting the same ajax page. In that ajax page, I've got more javascript/jquery. So the code inside the ajax page is getting executed everytime I click on a link. For example, the following code returns several popups ""Are you sure?""

    $(""#addDate"").live('click',function(e) {
      e.preventDefault();

Hi, /r/jquery. I hope this is an acceptable place to ask this question; if not, I apologize!

I'm working on a game, and I have a form with some radio buttons and some selects. Essentially, there's a set of three radio buttons (named ""primary"", with values ""attack"", ""skill"", and ""item"") determining whether you want to attack, use a skill, or use an item; and there's a select for which skill you want to use (named ""skill""), if you're using a skill; and there's a select for which item you want to use, if you're using an item (named ""item""). So it looks more or less like this:

    ( )  Attack

    ( )  Use skill:  [ Select a skill ]

    ( )  Use item:  [ Select an item ]

So, that's all well and good, and it works great. The problem is this: I want to set it up so that selecting an option from the skill dropdown changes that radio button to checked (and unchecks the others), and the same for the item dropdown. Essentially, I don't want people to have to select something from the menu *and* click the radio button, in part because that's slightly more of a pain and in part because due to the way the script needs to be set up it'll fail to work if you don't remember, and you'll end up just attacking (which is obviously not what you wanted to do, and frustrating).

I've tried looking into how I can use jQuery to update the radio buttons with an onclick or onchange for the selects, but I can't get it to work. What probably almost ridiculously simple thing should I be doing to accomplish this? (Please feel free to respond in very short sentences, as though speaking to a five-year-old, as apparently I'm too dumb to figure this out.)

Then under the chart will be another button that the user will click to open up a new form to enter personal info and to request a quote.

I'm trying to achieve something I haven't really seen out there and I'm looking for pointers on where to start or how I should try to tackle it and I feel like jquery could give me what I need.

So this is a page I'm testing with http://ianmurchison.com/test/work.html (note the code's a mess as I play around with many different options) ([screenshot](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3098576/Screen%20Shot%202013-06-05%20at%209.47.03%20PM.png))

There are 3 main areas to tackle on this page:

1. So when the user is on this page, they can see all of the projects, but they also have the option to look at just a specific category as well (house ware or lighting for example). I'm just wondering about the proper way to hide/show/organize these projects once a category is selected. Assigning a class to each category seemed to make sense, but I'm not really sure how to handle it.

2. When a user clicks on one of the small images, I would like that image to actually expand. As if there was a mask on the image and the mask moves away, while at the same time moving the surrounding content to allow for this new larger image. Example, if I clicked on a smaller image [it would become this.](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3098576/site3%205.jpg)  
This I'm really stuck on and haven't found anything that can do this.

3. After clicking on the smaller image and having it reveal itself and be larger, it actually becomes a carousel or gallery of sorts. There are plenty of jquery types things I can use, but the implementation of this may be hindered or limited by what happens in #2.

This moves the cards i have in the midle of the page to the side with hover over the main card and returns them on click. But the problem is i can only do this one time (only one time hover and click....after that it does nothing). How can i make the code so i will be able to repeat this actions? And how can i adept jQuery on all screen sizes, so the cards will be always on the corners of the screen no mather his size?

I have an image that i use as a trigger for a sliding drawer - onhover, the drawer slides out containing a list of links. the drawer slides from the side of the page to meet the image element, so that they slightly overlap each other.

Currently, when i mouse away from the image, the drawer closes. 

What i'm attempting to do is set it so that, the drawer opens by mousing over the image (what it currently does) but stays open if the drawer is hovered over as well.  Since the drawer and the image are in contact / slightly over lapping each other - this effect should be achievable - but i'm not quite sure how.

I am super new to coding and have a question for you.

How do I turn that functionality back on if the pair is not correct? I have tried running .on() in a few different ways and it has amounted to nothing so far.

I hope this is the appropriate place to look for help. Please tell me if I should be looking elsewhere. I'm new to both Reddit and all things code-wise, so please be gentle!

I'm developing an iPad book app for my Masters and I just want it to be in landscape orientation. I spoke with my supervisor yesterday and he was helping me with setting my device and computer up with a developer license so that I could deploy to my ipad for testing. However, my iPad is too new for the version of Xcode (I think it was 4.2) I was running and it couldn't handle iOS 6. So he told me to go home and update to the latest Xcode, which is 4.5.2.

I did that, and then ran the project in the simulator, changing it for iOS 6. So the simulator runs in landscape mode but the app is literally on it's side. I wouldn't say it's oriented in portrait because I'm looking at the text, graphics and buttons at a 90 degree angle.

I've tried a few things but to no avail. I think it might be to do with JQuery orientationing but I have no idea where to begin. Any help here would be greatly appreciated!!

PS It looks fine in Dreamweaver still, so if you think my problem is other than Phonegap, then I'll look elsewhere. Many thanks :-)",,False,,t5_2qhs4,False,,,True,t3_13bca4,http://www.reddit.com/r/jquery/comments/13bca4/question_about_ipad_orientation_for_phonegap_app/,

I'm using jquery 1.8.2 &amp; sheepIt 1.0.1

I have a working page set up which uses data: [{ ... }] to inject data (using the constructor) into a series of cloned text fields.  This code (obviously) runs in $(document).ready(function){ ... }

When I convert these text fields into textareas, everything works, except the data injection part. There are no javascript errors - but the textareas do not populate with data at all. You are still able to clone the textareas and submit the form, and all of that works fine, but it just won't populate with data.

I tried upgrading sheepIt to 1.1.1, but that gives me a strange TypeError: aA is undefined error

I'm at a loss.  I have started going through the sheepIt.js file, and it does appear to have support for textareas.  Can anyone let me know if this is a sheepIt limitation or if something else could be at play here?

I'm just..  stuck.  If this is a sheepIt limitation then I want to know because..  then I can move on.

I have a script that looks at a page's element to determine the chosen language. Based on that choice, the page should either do nothing or hide a div and translate a few things.

It's running on Zendesk, a support software framework, inside of a ""Javascript Widget"".

Here's the script: [http://pastebin.com/h8GCTjMB](http://pastebin.com/h8GCTjMB)

I'm using the bind('load') so that the scripts don't run until the page finishes rendering and generating variables. It won't work otherwise (no ID/class for the target element(s)). 

$language and $generatedAlt always get set properly, but the if statements won't execute properly, especially if the page is reloaded in succession. I used a variable to see if the functions were iterating...the variable got set within the function, but I don't see the effects in the html.

Does anyone see a reason why this should work ~80% of the time and fail every once in a while? It also seems like the initial page visit under a certain language messes up.

Do I need to unbind at some point?

I am creating a simple developer website with various ""Projects"". Each project has a download count. What attracted me to jQuery in the first place was the ability to change content on the page without reloading or redirecting to another page. So, in the past, I would have done something like:

    &lt;a href=""download.php?id=5""&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;

And then on download.php I would query the database with something like:

    UPDATE projects SET downloads=theCurrentNumberOfDownloadsPlusOne WHERE id=$_GET['id']

(obvious after escaping/stripping slashes etc)

Instead, (and the **TL;DR**), can I make it so the user clicks the Download link, and it tells download.php to update the download count, then redirects the user to the file? (all without changing the page)

I know I'll have to use AJAX to submit the request, but I think I can use
 [this tutorial](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/submit-a-form-without-page-refresh-using-jquery/) for that, and I can use location.replace(newURL) to redirect to the file. 

Thanks for any help, or any suggestions on how to do this.
    

**EDIT:** I think my phrasing was a little off. In the mean time, I figured out what to do. What I did instead was create a JavaScript function, that I could call with the id of the ""Project"" that needed to be updated and the download count: 

    function download(id, downloads) {
		    var newdown = downloads+1;
		    var set = 'projectid='+id+'&amp;downloads='+newdown;
		    $.ajax({  
      type: ""POST"",  
      url: ""bin/process.php"",  
      data: set,  
      success: function() {
    	    alert(""Done: projectid=""+id+"" new downloads=""+newdown);
      }  
    });  
    return false;  
    }

Everytime I echo a new ""Project"" from the database, I add a download link, that looks like this:

(php)

    echo ""&lt;a onclick='download("".$row['id']."", "".$row['downloads']."")'&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;

So when you click the link, it calls the function download() which receives a Project id and CURRENT download count.

It adds one download, then uses AJAX to query the database:

    $id = $_POST['projectid'];
    $downloads = $_POST['downloads'];

    $query = ""UPDATE projects SET downloads=:downloads WHERE id=:id"";
    $stmt = $conn-&gt;prepare($query);
    $stmt-&gt;execute(array("":downloads"" =&gt; $downloads, "":id"" =&gt; $id));

Now, the only thing left to do is swap out my little temporary alert(""Done""... shenanigans with what [cliveholloway suggested](http://www.reddit.com/r/jquery/comments/xwyx0/hey_reddit_quick_question_i_hope/c5qcleq).

[Also,](http://www.reddit.com/r/jquery/comments/xwyx0/hey_reddit_quick_question_i_hope/c5qc6iv) when I redirect from say, /index.php to /some_file.zip, won't it just trigger a download for some_file.zip and keep me on /index.php?

[And,](http://www.reddit.com/r/jquery/comments/xwyx0/hey_reddit_quick_question_i_hope/c5qd4vr) I think we are saying the same thing, I just sucked at explaining it, and I'd prefer to use a JavaScript/jQuery redirerect rather than HTTP.

I'm almost certain the solution is way easier than what I'm coming up with. 


Abstract:

I'm working on creating a menu that changes the layout of elements on a page. When a user clicks a link that has the class 'orderizer', it will add its name attribute to the elements that are to be rearranged. 


Problem:

What I can't figure out is how to remove the menu's sibling classes that have already been added. So, if a user clicks a link and adds class ""foo"" and then clicks a link and adds class ""bar"", bar should replace ""foo"". Instead, they are both remaining.

I was hoping someone would be able to recommend a good background image, slideshow plugin. I'm currently using using the Cycle Plugin with a combination of z-index's to put different content div's layering over the top of it. With the images fading in and out after each other.

First off, I'm not sure that doing that is the correct process to use when building the site, and secondly, I've found that the slideshow will freeze up on a slide. It's pretty random and to restart the slideshow a refresh of the page is needed.

All I need it to do is have a selection of say, 10 images, slide in from right to left in the background while the navigation buttons/bar for the rest of the site are overlayed on top. Everything works nearly as intended so far, (apart from the random image freezing and the transition) I just thought you fine people might know a better way to do it!

How to wait for changes to the DOM before calling a function (not using .ready()).,7fb2adfb45bafcc01c80,4,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/jquery/comments/ujgmd/help_noob_question_how_to_wait_for_changes_to_the/,"Let me preface this by saying that although I'm an experienced programmer in C, Assembly, and Perl, I just started messing around with JavaScript and jQuery a few weeks ago.  I may have done something stupid, so be kind.  :)

I'm trying to pull some data down through AJAX, format it into HTML that gets stuck into a DIV, and then call a plugin (galleryview) which looks at the formatted HTML and does magic to it.

Unfortunately, it looks like my changes to the DIV aren't happening fast enough, so galleryview is called before everything's ready.  If I insert a delay of 200ms or make another call during that time things are great, but any delay less than 200ms results in a blank screen.  

Here's some sample code, if it helps:

    function loadPhotos(plantcode) {
       $.getJSON(""/perl/ajax/imagelist/"" + plantcode, function(data) {
          var string = '&lt;ul id=""photos"" class=""photolist""&gt;';
          for (photoid in data) {
             string = string + '&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src=""' +  ""/images/gallery/jpg-wm/"" + data[photoid].filename + '""/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;';
          }
          string = string + ""&lt;/ul&gt;"";
          $('#summaryimages').append(string);
       });
       $.ajaxSetup({ cache: false });

    //  IF I PUT A 200ms DELAY IN HERE IT WORKS IF CACHING HAS BEEN SET TO TRUE

       $.getScript(""/ajax/libs/GalleryView/js/jquery.galleryview-3.0-dev.js"", function() {
          $('#photos').galleryView();
       });
    }
            
    function resetImages() {
       $(""#summaryimages"").children().remove();
            
       plantcode = ""002W.000"" + Math.floor((Math.random()*9)+1);
       loadPhotos(plantcode);
    }  

In this case, I wanted to cache the code that's downloaded.  If I turn off the cache, it works.  If I turn it on, the delay isn't long enough and it fails.

resetImages() is called via a button press or whatever.

So how can I get the .getScript() call to wait until the earlier .append() call is complete?  Is using setTimeout() really the best workaround?  And if so, how do you choose your timeout?  Is it consistent across most systems?

I don't want to send preformatted HTML via AJAX and use .load() either, although that would probably work.  I'd rather work with JSON  because there's other information sent across that needs to be dealt with such as EXIF values, copyrights/attributions, etc.

Just starting to learn JQuery, and glad it looks like it'll come in handy for a project I just started.  I am rebuilding the site [IBCakes.com](http://www.ibcakes.com) for a friend of mine --- the site is currently in Flash and I'm building it into a custom Wordpress theme.  

There are a couple flash effects that I'm trying to mimic exactly in HTML/CSS/JQuery, and the first one I'm hung up on is on the left hand navigation menu.  I need to have the little bee icon appear next to the right of the menu links.  I tried doing this in CSS by doing the following:

#menu li a:hover {background-image:(""bee.jpg""); background-position:right center; background-repeat:no-repeat}

This CSS works great when the text is aligned left.  The small bee image appears (unanimated, obviously, bc it's a jpg) along the right hand side.  However, in doing that, I cannot then have the text align right in the menu, otherwise the last few letters of the text is obscured by the bee.  The client wants it to appear exactly as it does in the flash version.

I'm having an issue with an autocorrect plugin at work right now and figured I'd give this subreddit a try. I'll post the markup and error message I'm getting.

Here's the jQuery that does the magic.

			showResult: function(value, data) {
				return value;	
			},
			onItemSelect: function(item) {
				validContact = true;
				var selectedContactID = item.data;
				$('input[name=ContactID]').val(selectedContactID);

    YOLANDA PHILLIPS at PHILCO INTERNATIONAL|67942
    Philip McDonald at Magnified Promotions Inc.|68063
    Phillip Simson at Capital Promotion Partners|68077    

So how it works is when you type the plugin calls the web service, grabs the text dump, breaks it up by ""|"" and displays the first part and puts the 2nd part into a hidden input behind the scenes.

Here's the error when the plugin fires.

      &lt;div id=""content""&gt;*read some html content, including links, pics and all the   good stuff*&lt;/div&gt;

      	hijackLinks();   
      });

      	} else {   
	   	
   		   $('#container').load(url + ' #content', hijackLinks);

  I have a Wordpress site that uses WPSHOWERS Sight theme. There's a slideshow on top on the opening page that I presume uses the cycle js, which I would like to make responsive to touch (so you can swipe from one slide to another). Here is the theme on [github](https://github.com/wpshower/sight) and [here is the sample site.](http://sight.wpshower.com/)

From what I see online, it seems the simplest way would be to utilize [jquery.touchwipe.](http://www.netcu.de/jquery-touchwipe-iphone-ipad-library)

However, knowing as little as I do about web architecture, it's at that point that I'm stumped; I've obviously copied over the jquery.touchwipe.min.js file over to Sight's js folder, and i also tried to put it in the header.php of the theme with wp_enqueue_script (whether that's correct or not, I'm not sure.) I presume what I'm missing is somehow establishing a relationship between cycle and touchwipe, ah but how? By editing the cycle js, script js, within any of the other phps and or a combination thereof?

Anyhow, if there's a kind soul who'd like to give me advice, or even point me to some learning tools for such matters, it'd be much appreciated.

I'm building a simple image viewer, and when someone clicks 'next' or 'previous', I use jquery to fetch the appropriate image, and replace the current image with the new one. It works great!

My issue is probably common, and that the new image might take a few seconds to load, and in the meantime, nothing happens. I'd simply like to put an overlay ontop of the image to darken it (not completely), and add a 'waiting.gif' image that acts like a ticker. 

I already have the gif, so what I really need is a command to darken the img, and then insert the image on top of it. 

This way, the image gets darker and has a 'waiting' image to show that the request has been made, and as soon as the new image is retrieved, it will appear.

one way is to define a random number and add it to the class name. this is sort of random, but you end up toggling numbers and randomly untoggling them (since you'll rarely get the same random number twice).

the other way is defining the random number on page load... so it's only ""random"" each time you load the page.

is there a way to do this each time you hover? so say my random number is ""5"" -- toggle just 5, not 5 and then another random number...

hey /r/jquery! Ok so the problem I'm having is that after events, there is at times 2-3 second delay this doesn't happen every time but more often than I like. It annoys the hell out of me!

it happens on firefox v16.0.1, chrome v23.0.1271.40 beta-m, and IE9
I looked around for another solution (onBlur, addlistenerevent, .change()) but it all happens.
the way I see it is its not detecting the change event and if so what ways can I change it so I wont have this delay?
sometimes it works just fine, I refresh the page then it has a delay!

When it's time to set who the customer is there's a dropdown with all my customer names in it. If it's a new customer users click a link which opens another window where they can input the new customer info into the database. Once they've done that the new window closes. Now they still need to find the customer in the dropdown and instead of having them hit F5 to refresh the page (and the dropdown), which potentially loses all the info they've added thus far, I've setup AJAX to re-query the database when the user clicks the dropdown. 

Everything works great with Firefox &amp; Chrome, and IE tries to refresh the data, but comes back blank. Here are pictures: [Firefox initial dropdown](http://imgur.com/a/0kd1f#AtWC8), [Firefox with pop-up to add customer data](http://imgur.com/a/0kd1f#u37KM), [Firefox after customer data saved](http://imgur.com/a/0kd1f#q3iwX). [Internet explorer briefly shows data but then goes blank](http://imgur.com/a/0kd1f#etqln).

**Here's my initial code:**

    &lt;select id=""customers"" name=""customer""&gt;
        &lt;option value=""0""&gt;  &lt;/option&gt;
        &lt;? foreach ($customers as $customer): ?&gt;

        &lt;? endforeach; ?&gt;
    &lt;/select&gt;


**Here's my script at the bottom of my code (because of php includes I can't put in the head):**

    $.ajaxSetup ({  
        cache: false  
    });  
		
    $(document).ready(function(){ // When the document is ready
        $(""#customers"").change(function(){ 
            $.post(""ajax/ajax.php"", { func : ""partcust"",  customer_id : $(""#customers"").val() }, function(response){
                $(""#customers"").html(response);
            },
            ""html""
        );
        return false;
        });
    });


I'm using a switch statement in ajax.php to I can have a bunch of ajax functions on one page. The func variable above determines where to jump into the switch statement. The customer_id variable is passed so that the name is saved after you click an option. 

**Here's the relevant bit of ajax.php:**

    $result = mysql_query(""SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY COALESCE(NULLIF(company, ''), name) ASC"");

    $customers = mysql_fetch_assoc($result);
			
    ?&gt;
        &lt;select id=""customers"" name=""customer""&gt;

            &lt;? foreach ($customers as $customer): ?&gt;
                &lt;option value=""&lt;?=$customer['cust_id']?&gt;"" &lt;?=($customer['cust_id'] == $customer_id) ? ""selected"" : """"?&gt;&gt;&lt;?=($customer['company'] != """") ? $customer['company'] . "" - "" . $customer['name'] : $customer['name']?&gt;&lt;/option&gt;

So using $.ajax I believe that I should just append the ""url"" property with jsonp=xxx. What i'm wondering is when it asks for the name of my callback... exactly what am I putting there? I struggle with the idea of what a callback is, exactly, and so I am having trouble figuring this one out.

My first attempt was to pass a timestamp through an ajax request and prepend a table with the returned html table rows. I did get this feature working but in my short bout of testing I found it unreliable on anything quicker than 30 seconds. I've attached the first attempt to give an understanding of what I'm trying to do. 

Here's what I have: 

    &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
      function geteldata(eltimestamp) {
        $.ajax({
          url: ""eventlog/eldata?elstr=""+eltimestamp,
          cache: false,
          success: function(html){
            $(html).prependTo('#eventlog'); 
          }
        });
      }
      function getneweldata(eltimestamp) {
        $.ajax({
          url: ""eventlog/eldata?elstr=""+eltimestamp,
          cache: false,
          success: function(html){
            $(html).hide().prependTo('#eventlog').fadeIn(2500); 
          }
        });
      }
      $(document).ready(function() {
        var eltimestamp = jQuery.now();
        geteldata(eltimestamp);
        setInterval(function(){ getneweldata(eltimestamp); eltimestamp = jQuery.now(); }, 10000);
      });
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;table id=""eventlog"" cellpadding=""5"" cellspacing=""0"" border=""1"" align=""center"" width=""100%""&gt;
      &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Time&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;User&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Text&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Actions&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

The ""eldata"" document returns new data in this form and prepends it to the table: 

    &lt;tr id=""elid1""&gt;&lt;td&gt;May 15, 2012 4:42 pm&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Administrator&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;This is a test&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;-&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

The next idea was to pass the databases row id through the returned html table row selector and use the highest value to check against the new data. This, to me, seemed like a more accurate method than a timestamp but has proven to be much more difficult to accomplish. I attempted to grab the :first attr('id') on the returned html so I can parse the databases row id from the tr to check new rows in future requests but all I got is an ""undefined"" error. I tried several other things but haven't yet got close to accomplishing my goal. Other ideas were to use one single JSON string with a key of the highest row id returned and the HTML in the value but seemes to be difficult itself. 

If anyone can offer any sort of ideas and/or assistance to get this accomplished I would appreciate it. ",,False,,t5_2qhs4,False,,,True,t3_tq8e9,http://www.reddit.com/r/jquery/comments/tq8e9/help_retrieving_fresh_table_data_using_ajax/,

Input appreciated.,zclip,2,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/jquery/comments/sx13s/thought_this_scrollerthing_would_be_easier_to_do/,"So I was trying to create an image scroller that would basically take x amount of logo-sized images (like 4 or 5) and simply move them from right to left, with a small gap between each, and do it continuously meaning that after the last image came into view on the right there would be the same gap as before and then we'd restart with image 1. I've tried doing a number of things with .each + delay (i * number), eq. and even in the best result, after the first run through the images would start appearing totally out of sequence.

I've also tried using setInterval to call a function to animate each element individually but that didn't work very well.

Basically I'm trying to get a handle on how to time events in jQuery. 

Is this way more complicated than I think it is? Do I need to calculate how long long each elements spends inside visible div, how long of a pause there needs to be between each, etc?

If anyone can point me to some code that would be awesome but I mostly just want to know what degree of difficulty I'm looking at here.

I'm fairly new to javascript/ajax. I have a PHP script where it makes multiple api calls, and each one takes some time to process. So instead of having a longer initial load time, I'm hoping to externalize each api call by running a script each time a new &lt;div&gt; is created in the for loop. 

So each loop generates a &lt;div class=""item""&gt;&lt;/div&gt; -and my guess is that I need to run a jquery script within each element that makes a request.php?id=x   where it then waits for the data to appear. 

I'm thinking of something along the lines of this:

    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;script&gt;

Hopefully i'm on the right track... But this doesn't work, and I think it has something to do with misunderstanding ""this"" and js in general

I'm working on a project for work and am running into issues figuring out how best to handle a clients request.

Here's what I'm looking at:
http://puu.sh/40eZL.png

Given the above picture, it's fairly obvious what I'm trying to accomplish. The users will click the left/right arrows to cycle through the various food options that they have to choose from.

Issues I'm running into, and why no jQuery plugins seem to be able to accomplish what I need:

- The images need to be smaller to the left / right, and slowly increase in size towards the middle
- The images need to ""slide"" left/right, increasing+decreasing in size as they become more centered
- The center image (whichever food happens to be slid to the middle position) actually has a different image src than the rest; whichever one is in the middle has an ""active"" image which gives it a white outline as you can see by the picture.

So I need to make this selection slider from scratch and don't even know where to begin given the constraints listed above.

**NOTE:** I've looked at a dozen 'jQuery slider' plugins - even ones with the mac-like ""dock"" effect (elements not in the middle are smaller) - but none allow me to do position the elements like they are in the above picture (in an every-so-slight curve downwards towards the middle). 

Also none of them allow me to ""detect which image is the middle image"" so I can't change its src attribute to the active version of the food image.

Stuck and hoping some JavaScript ninja out there would be willing to help me / point me in the right direction,

Cheers

I would rather not have fifteen+ pages of fairy similar HTML and have each link point to a different HTML page that is why I looked into this method. 

I currently have the page, About Us, with the sidebar and content areas. I have the page AboutUsInfo.html with the information for each link that I would like to appear in the Content area. This page is in the same folder on the server. I copied my code below.

Also - the next stage of this is auto selecting the loser in the .looser field (I'm aware, this is someone else's code I'm modifying, and the db is like that, so I'm leaving it looser).  So if you know how I would get the other option into another select, that would be awesome.  I will most likely end up making it a variable for ease, but think it would be cool to do.

Thanks again if you have any input.

I'm using the ""isotope"" jquery plugin to filter a bunch of stuff.

Here is the filter link:

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="""" data-filter="".$""&gt;$&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

The thing to be filtered has a class of "".$"" as well.

Here is the filter code:

    $('#sortmenu a').click(function(){
		var selector = $(this).attr('data-filter');
		$container.isotope({
			filter: selector,
			animationOptions: {
				duration: 750,
				easing: 'linear',
				queue: false
			}
		});
		return false;

In Mozilla's debug console, it is indeed showing that the selector is set to "".$"", but then nothing happens. Side information, I did the same sort with an HTML star(â), and it works fine.

I tried reading about escapes and I tried a bunch of different things, and I'm not sure if I improperly implemented these escapes every time, or if I'm trying to do something that's impossible.

I'm using Revolution slider right now and I need to add a pause/play button. It's supposedly possible using their API. I asked for help via their support forum and got this information:

&gt;Perhaps you need to change the revapi4 to the one you see in your slider settings, and you need to add the myplaybutton / mypausebutton somewhere to your site.

&gt;it can be also event based so far.""

All makes sense, but I don't know how or where to add ""myplaybutton/ mypausebutton"" into the slider.

It works pretty well but I have one nasty bug I can't figure out how to fix; My script is basically a button that has a fixed position on the top of the page. When you click it, a div (100% wide and 350px high) that is hidden flies out from the top. I also included code so that if the user has scrolled down the page and you click the button, it scrolls the page to the top before it shows the div.

Here's where it gets tricky, if the user doesn't toggle to hide the div, the button still has a fixed position. So when you scroll down, the button is in the middle of the page.

Here's my script on jsFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/rHXra/12/

So, how would you guys fix this? Is there a better way to do it?
Maybe when the div is toggled open, the button would stick to the div instead of having a fixed position... what would I need to do that?",,False,,t5_2qhs4,False,,,True,t3_1ba6hm,http://www.reddit.com/r/jquery/comments/1ba6hm/help_me_fix_a_bug_in_my_script_noob/,

I can do it on my own through the same route, but my company offers me $$ to go spend and get 'proper' training, so I'd like to take advantage.

I looked at my local college (NC State) and they don't offer a class specific to jQuery.  I have other options like the local technical school, I suppose, for adult education courses (Wake Technical school).  

I considered a subscription to Lynda.com or something, which will work just fine too, but hey, I've got money to burn for this.  I don't want to buy just books.  I can do that (and likely will) on my own.  :)

I'm currently trying to transition a bit of Prototype code over to work with jQuery. I'm making some progress but hitting a wall.

Long story short, I have a JS function that gets called to swap a set of form field values with another set of form field values (up or down). The first function receives the positions of the two sets of form fields (i.e. 2,3 or 7,6), and then calls a second function several times, passing in the various form field names with the position values appended (i.e. 'field_2', 'field_3', or 'field_7, field_6').

With Prototype, I could just reference the two fields passed in as $(field1) and $(field2). But jQuery doesn't seem to work this way.

I've found how to reference a form field value directly - $('#fieldname').val - but $(fieldname).val (to reference a variable declared in the function) isn't working.

What's the trick? I've been googling around but I'm finding a lot of unrelated info - I haven't hit upon the proper set of search terms. All the tutorials I'm finding are all using field IDs and not variables containing field IDs.

**[fadeInOut](http://untamed.co.uk/jqueryplugins/fadeInOut/)**: Ajax approach to navigating HTM pages - they fade in and out, with the main screen never re-loading. It's actually fast! I've borrowed the background - it's also big, and takes ages to download, be patient! I had next to no time to implement this, when I can I'll swop the background out with one of my own.

**[slideHorizontally](http://untamed.co.uk/jqueryplugins/slideHorizontally/)**: A nice little slide out menu using just ONE div tag in your code - with a changeable menu background, and click button. You put what you want in the DIV - tables, DIV's, images, jQuery buttons and things...

The reason I made this, was there was no SIMPLE slide in/out menu... they all had a selection of buttons, rather than one main one.
As usual - it doesn't squish things up when the menu slides in-out.
Sadly - it's not nestable - I'd have to re-code it to manipulate the DOM, rather than a simple HTML replace...

**[slideVertically](http://untamed.co.uk/jqueryplugins/slideVertically/)**: This is a content-box (I had a hard time finding pages online that had anything like this! What would I search for?). It slides up and down - and **doesn't** change the height of the sliding div, so your content doesn't get smooshed up during the animation.

I have a script that I wrote that basically will show a main div, and when you hover over any of the other divs, they trigger the main div to fade out and the respective div of the ID you are hovering over to fade in.  On mouseleave, the main ""landing"" div fades back in.  I have the basic functionality going, but there are a few bugs:

1) The animation still queues when entering and leaving one of the triggers (but not within the triggers).  

2) The main ""landing"" div doesn't always fade back in for some reason, especially if you move over the triggers quickly.  I suspect this has to do with where I've placed the .stop(), but I am unsure where else to place them to ensure the animation does not queue

I'm having difficulty with getting ScrollTo to work on a Wordpress site (currently local, or I'd provide a link).

This is what I have before my &lt;/head&gt;:

    &lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""&lt;?php bloginfo('url'); ?&gt;/wp-content/themes/caribou_theme/js/jquery.tweet.js""&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;

    &lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""&lt;?php bloginfo('url'); ?&gt;/wp-content/themes/caribou_theme/js/jquery.scrollTo-1.4.2-min.js""&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;

    &lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""&lt;?php bloginfo('url'); ?&gt;/wp-content/themes/caribou_theme/js/jquery.easing.js""&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;

    &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;

    jQuery(document).on('click', '#nav a', function(){
        var hash = this.hash;
            jQuery.scrollTo(hash,2000,{
                onAfter: function(){ window.location.hash = hash; }
        });
        return false;
    }); 

       jQuery(function($){
            $("".tweet"").tweet({
                username: ""accountname"",
                count: 1,
                loading_text: ""loading tweets...""
            });
        });

    &lt;/script&gt;

The Twitter function is working flawlessly, and I'm receiving no errors on the console related to the jQuery.

To describe further what's happening: when any `&lt;a href=""#anchor""&gt;` is clicked within `#nav`, there's a delay that matches the value defined by `jQuery.scrollTo(hash,2000,{`, after which it immediately jumps to the anchor link without an animation. This behavior is present in FF, Safari, and Chrome.

Additionally, when I've tried to use a simpler method that doesn't use ScrollTo, such as:

    function goToByScroll(id){
            $('html,body').animate({scrollTop: $(""#""+id).offset().top},'slow');
    }

it only works in Firefox, and not Safari or Chrome (I assume it's related to Webkit).

I've taken all of this code and used it within a static html/php page, where it works flawlessly in any browser, so my assumption is that there's some kind of conflict related to Wordpress itself, but I can't figure out what that would be.

1337997826.0,1,self.jquery,u5fd0,[help] unexpected behaviour from moving div via .removeClass and .addClass,inthrees,1,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/jquery/comments/u5fd0/help_unexpected_behaviour_from_moving_div_via/,"**SOLVED** - Turns out a different function was conflicting with this little flipper function and setting right: 0px behind this one's removal of same.

The background: position: relative; container holds a vimeo iframe and two absolutely positioned divs - one is for subtitles and the other is a nav panel that is top:0 right:0 via css class.

Originally I attempted to use .css to change the values of right to 'auto', '', 'null', 'inherit', etc, and the left to 5, and vice-versa, to make a simple click toggle to move the navpanel from the right side to the left side, or vice-versa.

Unsetting a position property seems to not be possible, though, so I changed it to get that property from a dedicated class, conveniently called .right or .left.

So it works now, hooray!

**But here is the problem:**

The div containing the nav elements has an rgba(0,0,0,0.3) property to help contrast the elements from the video behind it. 

Upon page load and the firing of the resizing script to scale the video to the viewport, you see the the div in the upper right corner in all its barely-any-opacity glory.

However, when you click the ""&amp;raquo; Move Panel &amp;laquo;"" button, it leaves a smear of alpha black 0.3 across the top of the video. Suddenly instead of being 215 pixels wide, it's video-wide.

Any ideas?

    function moveNavPanel() {
    if($('#largeplayernav').hasClass('right')) {
        $('#largeplayernav').removeClass('right');
        $('#largeplayernav').addClass('left');
        $('#largeplayernav').css('width', 'auto');
    }
    else {
        $('#largeplayernav').removeClass('left');
        $('#largeplayernav').addClass('right');
        $('#largeplayernav').css('width', 'auto');
    }
        //(I tried to reset the width after the function fires to see if that helped - it didn't.)
    } //end func def

And then:

    &lt;div relative position&gt; //i'm the container
    
    &lt;iframe&gt;&lt;/frame&gt;
    
    &lt;div absolute, class=left or right, alpha 0 0 0 0.3&gt;
    I'm a navpanel
    &lt;/div&gt; //navpanel
    
    &lt;div absolute, bottom=10% margin=0 auto   alpha 0 0 0 0.3&gt;
    I'm subtitles.
    &lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;/div&gt; //container

And then in my phpcss file:

    .left {left: 0px;}
    .right {right: 0px;}

**Solved!**

Something seems to go wrong when your input button has a name of submit. I found this at [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8672914/jquery-form-submit-doesnt-work-in-v1-7-1) after seeing this bug report on [jQuery.com](http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10574)

I simply changed the name of my submit input field (which, regrettably, never should have been in their in the first place (i essentially had two submit buttons!)!) from submit to send and everything went as expected.

Essentially the user fills in a form which is picked up on the server through a webservice. Nothing too difficult there.

The problem is I'm having is the website is on www.domain.com and the webservice is on service.domain.com. This is causing all sorts of cross domain problems. Just use a JSONP callback? I have for the other webservice calls but this form includes a comment box which means I cant use GET and have to use POST (so JSONP is out). 

I did the usual googling and came across a cross domain iFrame solution. Seems to do the trick. (Create a blank iframe, and a new form with the iframe as the target). Code tid-bit below:

    crossDomainPost : function(urlValue, callback) {
    // Add the iframe with a unique name
        $variables.urlValue = urlValue;
        var returnData = '', iframe = $('&lt; iframe /&gt;', {
            name: 'mtfPostFrame',
            id:   'mtfPostFrame' 
        }).appendTo('body');
    $(iframe).css({'display' : 'none'});
    		
    var crossForm = $('&lt; form /&gt;', {
        id : 'trickPostForm',
        target : 'mtfPostFrame',
        action : $variables.urlValue,
        method : ""POST""
    });
    		
    $(crossForm).appendTo('body');
    		
    $(""#trickPostForm"").live('submit', function() {
        $.ajax({
            type: 'POST',
            url: $variables.urlValue,
            success: function(data) {
                return false;
            },
             error:  function(t,s,x) {
               alert(""Apologies there was an error with your submission"");
            },
            asynch: false
        });
        return false;
    });
    		
    $(""#trickPostForm"").submit();
    
    }

This solution works perfectly in Firefox, chrome and safari. Only IE remains (no real surprises). In IE, after the form submits, the server sends back a response (which is a set of JSON results, which isn't needed by the website) this is picked up by the browser and it offers the user a dialog to download it - which is the problem.

I tried adding a     return false to stop that behaviour but that ends up stopping the form submission all together.

To re-open the overlay. However - it re-loads the same item id, regardless of which droppable is used. The droppable function sees the new id, but the .overlay call does not.

Anyone know how I can make the overlay either a) see the new id, or b) reset the overlay to start again?

I hope that makes sense.

// The Code ----- //

    &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    jQuery(document).ready(function() {
    
    $(document).ready(function() {
    $("".clientdetails"").hide();

    $("".clientheading"").click(function()
    {
    $(this).next("".clientdetails"").slideToggle(500);
    });



    $("".reportingdetails"").hide();
    $("".reportingheading"").click(function()
    {
    $(this).next("".reportingdetails"").slideToggle(500);
    });
    });  

    &lt;/script&gt;

---- html ----

    &lt;div class=""clientheading""&gt; Heading Item &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""clientdetails""&gt; 
            -- Details of clients --

           &lt;div class=""reportingheading""&gt; Reporting Heading Item &lt;/div&gt;
            -- Reporting Heading Info --
           &lt;div class=""reportingdetails""&gt;
            -- Reporting Details Info
           &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;


// The End of Code ---- //

I would guess that my lack of knowledge is probably the cause of ""Reporting Heading Item"" not triggering the ""Reporting Details Info"" slide. The Client heading slide works fine though.

    $(this).next("".reportingdetails"").slideToggle(500);

This is probably the problem and I don't know how to fix it. I could most certainly be wrong.

Hope you guys can help.

$('#id').html(data);

I do this every (1 second + time it takes to do $.get()). In all browsers, no issues, except for IE8.

The data that it's loading contains it's own javascript bindings, and there are several $.live() bindings on the page itself.

I tried replacing .html() with a basic call to document.getElementById().innerHTML, and while that stops IE8 from consuming all my CPU, memory usage is still going up, albeit much much more slowly.

I opted to use .html(), because I'm updating a list of tasks, a list that can grow to 50-100, with three numbers to update live each. I figured hotswapping the HTML would be better than iterating over a list of 300 numbers, but maybe I was wrong about that.

But since this problem only exists on this one page (while timer-based polling exists elsewhere in the webapp with .live() bindings and other bindings in the data returned from ajax) and only exists in IE8 and the deadline is tomorrow, I was hoping just to fix this leak and be done with it.

Any ideas what else I should be looking at, or what I can use to debug this problem? IE8's ""developer console"" sucks.",,False,,t5_2qhs4,False,,,True,t3_kgp82,http://www.reddit.com/r/jquery/comments/kgp82/jquery_memory_leak_trying_to_solve_maybe_i_went/,

I'm having a conflict with jquery on my wordpress blog due to what I think are multiple instances which is preventing everything from functioning together, however I can't seem to figure out what to do. Would appreciate some help!

This is my source code http://pastebin.com/YtxZ4RUq

This is the functions.php that is calling some of the jquery actions http://pastebin.com/50wkHjkq

I'm in the process of integrating a thumbsup system that calls this bit here from functions...

&lt;script src=""http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.3/jquery.min.js"" type=""text/javascript""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script src=""http://mywebsiteurlhere.com/thumbsup/init.min.js.php""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

When this already exists on the page for other reasons here...

&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='http://mywebsiteurlhere.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.6.1'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

If I remove the first instance, it prevents my thumbsup system from functioning properly, and if I remove the second it breaks everything associated with it (login box, comment form, search bar etc).
