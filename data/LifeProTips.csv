Parents (or anyone who watches a toddler) understand that when you ask a toddler to do the simplest task it can become a major ordeal.  So instead of telling them what to do, give them two options instead.

Children love knowing they have some control over what they are doing. It gives them a chance to use their thinking and reasoning skills in a positive way.  So instead of saying, ""Please put on your pajamas and get ready for bed.""  You could try, ""Which pajamas would you like to wear to bed tonight, your nightgown or your Dora jammies?""

This concept can be used for almost anything.  I started using this approach and it truly was life changing.  It has become second nature and my daughter loves knowing that she is making decisions instead of simply being told what to do.

The bounty was not claimed.** My conclusions are:

  1. There were several videos posted that (more or less) tried to follow the protocol. All of them showed the same fare in incognito mode. [One video] (http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1ekv6e/lpt_bounty_1_year_of_reddit_gold_to_the_first/ca1bf28) showed a different fare, due to entering different search parameters (JFK vs NYC). [Another one](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1ekv6e/lpt_bounty_1_year_of_reddit_gold_to_the_first/ca1ng4k) showed a different fare due to mixing up the departure and arrival cities on one of the searches.
  2. It's certainly not as easy as most people say it is. Over 20,000 people voted on this post, and nobody was able to produce a video proving it. Clearly, anyone who says this works a large fraction of the time, or that the effect can be summoned on demand, is wrong.  
  3. Two people *did* manage to get [different results in Kayak](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1ekv6e/lpt_bounty_1_year_of_reddit_gold_to_the_first/ca19wg1). This is not really the LPT we were investigating (in one case it was more expensive in incognito mode, and it's not them charging you more for the same flight). But it's definitely worth looking into. How can you make sure Kayak shows you hacker fares? That would make an excellent LPT.
  4. I'm really comfortable calling this an urban myth until someone can actually show otherwise. Nothing will ever convince certain people, though, so I'm sure we'll see this repeated over and over. Hopefully this test will make people at least think twice before just accepting it uncritically, or accept that it's possible they made a mistake once while entering search parameters.

Many people said there were problems with my protocol. Objections raised include: (1) you need more time to prepare (2) it only works with round-trip flights (3) it doesn't work in the United States (4) the LPT is wrong and you need to clear your cookies instead of going incognito (5) the LPT is wrong and you need to use different computers or IPs.

Here's the thing: I'm not stopping you from making any video you want. I can't _promise_ I'll give gold for it, but if you make video proof, I'm sure the community would love to see it, based on the interest shown here.  Just saying. And I'd be happy to help review your video to give you advice on how to eliminate errors and make sure it actually proves what it's trying to prove.

**Original Post follows:**

[A common LPT](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/13mdr5/lpt_if_you_want_to_buy_the_cheapest_airline/) is that airline prices are different in Incognito Mode. It's true for some online shopping, but I don't believe it's true for flights. I think this is an urban legend. I think that every reported instance is easily explained as [people accidentally entering incorrect search parameters](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1eh2t5/lpt_clear_your_browser_history_and_cookies_or_go/ca091oo), or prices simply changing (as they do) regardless of how you're searching.

I'm looking for someone to prove me wrong. If you're the first to provide _actual video evidence_, I will give you one year of reddit gold. Simply make a video showing it happening, and upload the video to YouTube.

 * Your video must follow my strict protocol (given below). The point of the protocol is to reduce errors and potential for tampering.
 * If you post a video that fails to follow the protocol, you'll be disqualified for 6 hours.
 * If you need the protocol changed, suggest an amendment **before** recording your video. I'll accept reasonable changes, but I will **not** accept any video that fails to follow the protocol as it was written when the video was made.
 * You must post a link to the video in this thread within 3 hours of recording it.

Flight search video protocol (version 2):

&gt; You must stick with a single browser and a single flight search website for the entire video.  
&gt; * Acceptable browsers: Chrome, Firefox, IE, Opera, Safari  
&gt; * Acceptable websites: Expedia, Orbitz, Travelocity  
&gt; * Or use the website of one of these airlines: Alaska, American, Delta, Frontier, Hawaiian, JetBlue, Southwest, United, USAir

&gt; 1. Open a browser window of the [Times Square webcam](http://www.earthcam.com/usa/newyork/timessquare/). The date and time must be visible. This window must remain visible for the entire video.
&gt; 2. Perform a flight search in a regular browser window.
&gt; 3. Perform the same search in a window in private/incognito mode.
&gt; 4. Perform the same search in a regular window again.

&gt; The windows in steps 2, 3, and 4 must be fully visible while the search is being conducted, until the results appear. You can optionally close the windows from steps 2, 3, and 4 before going on to the next step. You can use the same window for steps 2 and 4. You must not perform any other searches or visit any other web pages during the video.

&gt; Your flight search **must** be for 1 adult, **one-way**, economy/coach class, flight only (no hotels etc.). You can choose any departure city, arrival city, and date, but only one of each: do not select nearby airports, flexible dates, time of departure, or any special options like that. You may perform any searches you want before recording the video, but do not change any settings or preferences on the search website.

&gt; The same flight (same date, time, airline, and flight numbers) must appear in all 3 results, and it must have the same price in steps 2 and 4, and a different price in step 3. The difference in price must be at least $10 USD. Each time, you must clearly show all the search parameters. On the results page, the parameters of the search must be visible.

&gt; Make sure the uploaded video is high enough resolution that the necessary text is readable.

1356504149.0,3096,self.LifeProTips,15gh9j,LPT: What to look for when buying a used vehicle.,Swagger_Lacking,5855,2759,305,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/15gh9j/lpt_what_to_look_for_when_buying_a_used_vehicle/,"Mileage doesn't mean much, look at the brake pedal. Cars even with low miles (40,000) and a worn brake pedal pad usually means that car has seen a lot of city (stop and go) driving which is hard on the transmission.

Look at the tires. Worn on edges generally means either worn wheel bearings or bad alignment. BRAND NEW tires is usually a ""quick fix"" for this and masks the problem for a few thousand miles.

Look at the body lines where the doors, hood, and trunk lid meet. The gap should be the same the entire way around. If it is closer or further apart in some areas it usually means the car has been in some accident. Cars from the factory have equal lines.

Look at the paint. It should all be the same color completely all the way around. If it is slightly different shades on panels or in the door jams it usually means body work was done and they did not match the color correctly. Look for bubbles in paint or very small holes in body panels (could be ""tip of iceberg"" for rust and could lead to serious body work shortly down the road).

Inspect the underside of the car. I have personally seen cars with less than 30,000 miles look great around the outside and inside but be rotted and rusted under them due to sitting for long periods of time or road salt in many northern states.

Be wary of later model cars with low miles. 1992 22,000 grandma drove it to the store once a month. Avoid low mile older cars they tend to be very unreliable due to drive-train seals drying out from lack of use.

Test drive the car and drive it harder than you normally would drive it. Accelerate hard and brake hard listen for odd noises coming from engine or transmission, and check for pulsing in brakes or pulling one way or the other on the steering wheel. Lightly hold the steering wheel on a straight section of road. Make sure it doesn't pull to one side or the other and watch it to see if it shakes.

Try all windows, hood release, locks, keys in all doors and trunk. Not hard to change a door or hood for another of same color and most people forget to change the lock cylinder. Another sign it may have had a small accident.

Ask for maintenance log or records of upkeep. Did they change the oil every 3-5,000 miles. Did they buy tires in pairs/sets or single tires at a time (could be sign of alignment problem again)

Look under the hood are there signs of recent cleaning? (not always a bad thing on a overall clean car but many people pressure wash engines that leak oil so they look nice). Pull the engine oil dipstick (is it low on the stick or very high up the stick. Is the oil clean or black like they have not changed it recently). Pull the transmission oil dipstick (only automatics have this generally. The fluid should be a nice red color and shouldn't glimmer like it has glitter in it. smell it YES smell it. It shouldn't smell burnt.) Remove the radiator cap ONLY IF ENGINE IS COLD! Coolant should be either Green, Yellow, or Red depending on type it uses. If it looks like a milkshake that could be headgasket or oil cooler in radiator has failed. level should also be to full mark on overflow tank and near the top on radiator (some cars dont have caps on radiator and only have one on overflow tank.

Check all windows for cracks or chips. Chipped windows can become cracks sometimes and can be pricy if you don't have glass coverage.

Look at dash with key in run position (Not running) and look for check engine light. If light doesnt show at all then it is either burned out or removed. Owner could be hiding a major problem. With car running there should be no dash lights. At most the seatbelt light may be on if you don't have the seatbelt buckled.

Check the heater controls and be sure the positions change as well as the temperature and fan speeds. Does the A/C work? (may seem like it works great on a cooler weather day such as 60 degrees out but really doesn't work well.

Don't always trust them with sayings like ""My mechanic said it just needs a sensor that is $30"". Sure that sounds nice but why didn't they have it fixed if it is a cheap part? Could be that part along with a ton of labor (lots of $$$$) or could be something worse than that part and they are making it sound better. Also be careful if they include the parts needed to fix in the deal. Once again they may know something you don't about fixing that part.

Grab wheels and shake them both at the top and the sides. If you notice something seems loose it could be ball joints, tie rods, or wheel bearings.

One of the biggest things is DO NOT let them tour you around the car until you have looked it over yourself. Also don't be afraid to ask questions about something.

Is it a smoker car or non-smoker. With the heat on in a non smoker car you shouldn't smell any smoke (smoke smell is almost impossible to get out of heater vents). Also look for burns in the seats, carpet, or headliner.

Remove the spare tire from the trunk and look for signs of dampness or rust. When trunk seals go it tends to gather here and rust the trunk floor out.

Be sure to closely inspect cars with aftermarket lights, bumpers, grills, hoods and so on. Aftermarket parts are usually cheaper then OEM parts and could be accident cover up!

Ask when the timing belt has been replaced (applies to cars with timing belts and not timing chains) They have a replacement interval and could fail if not replaced at or close to this mileage. Broken timing belts could cause very expensive engine damage.

Im sure there are many many more things to look for but this is a pretty good list of things I look for when buying cars.

**EDIT: Also Google the vehicle you are going to look at. Many times Google will lead you to sites that tell you common problems with the vehicle. Example: 2003-2006 Ford 6.0L Diesels had many head-gasket problems. You can use this knowledge to see if the owner has had this problem addressed. If not you may be able to talk the price down some to pay for the problem to be fixed.**

**EDIT 2: I see a lot of comments regarding buying from dealers. In a good world yes most people would deal with one. But there are a large group that buys from private people. This post is directed more towards that. Its off figuring you show up to some guys house to look at his car. Although these are also great things to look for anytime you buy a vehicle.**

**EDIT 3: To people saying things such as ""You need to jack it up"" or ""Misaligned panels doesn't always mean accident"". I know I'm saying your driving down the road a private party has a car in their front yard. You stop in to give it a look-over. Here is a list to help you out. This isn't you're a fully prepared mechanic going to look at a vehicle full truck of tools to check everything, or that a door that is a different color means run away screaming. Example: Went to lake for a day fishing. On the way home I see a 2000 Jeep wrangler for sale sign stuck in window. I have zero tools/books/charts with me. Give it a look-over to my checklist above then I can go about deciding if its worth buying (perhaps talking price down if you can) or hoping back in my truck and going on my way.**

Edit: Thanks for all the replies! I've noticed from the comments that a lot of people are saying ""if you can light the candle, you can light the fire"", which is a good point.

 However, an advantage to this is that you could hold the candle close to your body, with your back to the wind, and light it easily with your whole body as a wind breaker. Then you can bring it down to your tinder easily, after waiting however long it takes for the trick candle to start working.

If you have decided to attempt keto/become an atheist/start lifting/discover feminism/not to have kids, I would suggest giving yourself some time before making an attempt to announce it to your family and friends. These are the people we tend to alienate the most because they are closest to us. And if you are a minor who is dependent upon your parents, I suggest seriously considering not making an announcement at all unless you are being physically or emotionally harmed.

I know when you discover something you are suddenly passionate about, you want to tell the world about it. It's natural to want so badly to share with those closest to you this exciting new discovery you have made. It has changed your life, and there is a whole new world out there and you want to recruit others to share in it as well because you have found the key to happiness.

I suggest taking some time to learn about this new area you have discovered before you start telling everyone else why they are suddenly wrong or how they are smothering and disrespecting you. Read as much as you can, live your lifestyle for a few months, and see if it becomes just another thing you do or think rather than something you are. Ask yourself why what everyone else is doing is suddenly wrong, what you have to gain by sharing this information about yourself, and if you are bringing something positive to the conversation rather than trying to bring everyone else down.

We see a lot of rants in our favorite subs, and we can identify. ""Everyone is stupid but us. Why don't they get it? Why aren't they listening to me?""

My use of this tip began in painting school, where the paint cans were shared by all of us, which meant that I  regularly came across cans that looked like they had been opened by a blind gorilla wielding a balisong, and cleaned by a single swipe of newspaper. This LPT was a good way to try to make the best out of a crusty ricrac rim.

**2nd EDIT**: It has been interesting reading replies from painting pros. My teacher had decades of experience from both painting and teaching when she taught us this tip, so I believed it at the time. However, so many painters have shared differing viewpoints that I have no other logical choice than to re-evaluate this LPT as bogus, as of today. 


**3rd EDIT** Some kind redditors have shared useful instrucction on opening and closing cans properly. They consented to me adding them here so people won't miss it and can use this info. Thanks guys.

From [bbaglien](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/14lygs/lpt_once_you_have_tightly_closed_the_lid_on_a_can/c7eg0m2)

&gt;keep the inside of your lid CLEAN, use a rage to wipe it off, when paint gets on there it dries, and the cap won't fit on.

&gt;To close it, I apply pressure to 2 opposite sides of the top, then the other sides. Just don't push one side too much.

&gt;After painting many houses, I just put the top on the clean lid, and step on it (I've gotten pretty good at it).


From [kaiserbun](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/14lygs/lpt_once_you_have_tightly_closed_the_lid_on_a_can/c7ejv8x)
&gt;The trick is to use a painters tool, (5 in 1 tool), and work your way around the can evenly. Next best thing is a paint can opener or key that has the proper angled end. The worst thing you can do is try an open a can with a flat head screwdriver especially an old can.

2. Android App [WiFi Analyzer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzer&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5mYXJwcm9jLndpZmkuYW5hbHl6ZXIiXQ..)

Other things you can do is to move your router away from other  sources of interference  such as phones, wiring and microwaves.

Every Congregation has a record of those who ask not to be called on entitled the ""Do Not Call List"". This buys you at least a year, sometimes more. Eventually 2 older men will come back to call again in case you have changed your mind or there are new owners.

2. Hang a **No Trespassing** sign. *NOT* a ""No Soliciting"" sign as Witnesses are instructed that those do not apply to them ""since they are technically not soliciting."" However, they are specifically instructed to avoid entering property with a ""No Trespassing"" sign because it can bring legal troubles and the Watchtower Society will not help out in that case should a situation arise.


BONUS: 

- Tell them you are **Disfellowshipped/Disassociated** and they will back away from you like Satan himself.

- Dress up like **Satan** himself.

- **Beware of Dog** signs are pretty effective.

- EDIT: Actually, pretty brilliant suggestion from u/tophatmcmonocle: Hang a Do Not Disturb sign on your door.

From my own experience, it's all about giving yourself the right habits:

* Stop drinking caffeine.  Cut it out entirely.  Take aspirin for the couple days of headaches.  Then when you need it once a month, it will actually be a boost instead of ""reset to not drowsy"".  Even then, take it (small quantities: tea not soda) in the morning, never in the evening (it has a **half** life of around 5 hours).
* Stop making up lost sleep on the weekends, by getting more sleep on the weekdays.  Make a schedule and stick to it.  Do you need 8 hours of sleep to function?  Do you take an hour to fall asleep?  Do you need to be up at 7AM?  Aim to go to bed at 10PM, every single night of the week.  Are you an insomniac who needs 2 hours to fall asleep but only 4 hours of actual sleep to function?  Fine!  Plan for six (but seriously consider meditation classes for while you're waiting to fall asleep).  You can adjust this as you go but force yourself to lie in bed at that time for a couple weeks until you're used to it.  If your schedule won't allow this much time set aside for sleep, re-evaluate your life (I used to be an MMORPG addict and now regularly go weeks without playing a game).
* Stop snoozing / setting multiple alarms.  Snooze sleep is not worthy sleep.  Set your alarm for the last possible time you can get up (I don't mean like ""not even time to shower"" but the last possible time to do your entire morning routine with a little urgency).  Then train yourself to get up as soon as it goes off.
* Regular exercise (any kind of exertion; walking a few miles a day totally counts) is really important, you're not going to sleep well after an all-day movie/gaming marathon.
* Light can be more powerful (but shorter lasting) at keeping you awake than caffeine.  In the morning get that awakeness you lost giving up caffeine by opening the windows and letting the sun shine in.  But you also need to give yourself a sense when it's getting dark so your body can wind down.  Dimmers are cheap and easy to install.  Make sure your alarm clock isn't a beacon of light.  Put sticky notes over it if you have to dim it, you shouldn't be able to read it well in daytime.  I use a projection clock because I sleep with my head facing up and I don't have to move (or mentally wake up) much to read the time from the ceiling at night (it's unreadable with the bedroom light on).
* Oh it's an hour before bed-time and it takes 45 to 90 minutes to play a round of a video game?  NO.  BAD.  Even at 45 minutes that's a lot of light in your face right before bed.  Honestly you're better off spending that last hour with some human contact (in a low light area) or (at least for me with some self control) on reddit with the enhancement suite's dark background on.
* When you do wake up in the middle of the night, keep it simple so you don't ""rev up"" your brain to full awakeness.  A bathroom nightlight is good, depending on your vision you may need to tape it darker.
* The bed is for sleeping and sex, nothing else.  Pull the reading light and TV out of the bedroom.  For that matter, I try to get my sex done in the mornings or day time so she's not pining for it when I'm trying to sleep.  Back to the light thing, I bought blackout curtains and keep mine as dark as possible.
* Dunno about diet though I generally don't worry about mine.  Do you wake up hungry and then can't fall back asleep?  Eat more non-sugary foods before bed (okay maybe not *right* before bed but soon enough).  Capping the night with a small sugary food can be a digestive aid, but I mean like **one** cookie.
* I found myself futily waking up many nights because I was too warm.  I then read somewhere that your body temperature naturally goes up at a certain point in your sleep.  I bought a programmable thermostat for my central A/C in the summer (apologies if you don't have this option), and set it to go down two degrees at approximately 2.5 hours before I planned on waking up.  It makes a huge difference.
* Establish boundaries with your bed-mates.  If they are disruptive, you can tell pets what to do by locking them out.  Humans require a little more negotiation.  Let your partner know when you are getting ready for bed ""I'm brushing my teeth now"" and encourage them to get their pajamas out of the bedroom because you're going to sleep soon and don't want them to have to turn on the light.  Over time if you're consistent, your partner will probably end up in bed 5 minutes after you most nights anyway.  Noisy neighbors?  Get a pack of earplugs and learn how to properly insert them.
* Don't ever use any kind of drug to help yourself sleep.  Count your alcoholic drinks and switch to water at the appropriate amount of time before your planned bed time.  Think of it like planning to have your hangover as you're falling asleep, and then it never comes.  ""Passed out"" is never the same as ""asleep"".

Do most of this and you'll find yourself calmly waking up just before your alarm, consistently.  It's what works for me, I'm not trying to be demanding I just try to consider them absolute rules *to myself*.

How do you think he felt?* etc.

It's actually a method of teaching and a very effective way of winning arguments against the unsuspecting. For example, let's say your girlfriend is angry about you coming home late one night. She says, *You didn't call me! I was so worried, and you were probably out at the bar hitting on girls!*

You could respond, *No baby, I wasn't, I swear.* But effectively this is two heads butting; the one with greater force wins.

Instead, ask questions. This puts you in a position of control without being aggressive, and forces the listener to accept their own hypocrisy/flawed reasoning.

Say something like: *Why are you upset? What do you think I was doing? Is it that I'm late that bothers you, or that you can't trust me?*

Rather than arguing back and forth, you're encouraging her to express how she feels, and it seems like you're making an effort to listen. Eventually she'll either forgive you, or you'll see that you were wrong, or she'll see that she was being unreasonable.

I gave a very sexist example, but this works for heated debates as well. Rather than saying, *Animals aren't meant to be in captivity,* say, *Do you think animals were meant to be in captivity?* Wording your point of view in the form of a question forces them to see it from your perspective whether they like it or not, because a question psychologically puts them in a position where they have to answer it.

Also useful when teaching your kid. Instead of just explaining how the world works, arrange your questions as a guide for your child to figure it out on their own. Questions are powerful, powerful things when used correctly. Takes a bit of effort to think them through, but after a bit of practice, it becomes second-nature. Just don't overdo it.

**edit: blablabla, front page, wasn't expecting this. My example wasn't very good -- use the questions sparingly and at the appropriate time, as many comments below have pointed out.

Engage as much or as little as you want, naturally they will follow you. Once you get into their office, they will sit down. It's damn instinctual. Then say goodbye and go back to yours, works every time.

* If you have a micromanaging type boss, they tend to enjoy the feeling of control more than the understanding that it undermines morale and can build resentment. Get to know his habits. e.g. If he comes into your office 3 times a day to get an in depth look at what you are doing, plus details, take charge.

    Note what time he does this in a day, enter his office 10 min prior on a regular basis. flood him with the details... Don't BS him, but flood him with details that a supervisor shouldn't need to know. You'll accomplish two thinigs.

    you are signalling you know your job and are in control, you established his office as the place to discuss workload, and yours as a place to get things done. He won't bother you, since it's pointless to get a rehash of what you've already gone into. If you get visits later in the day, just reiterate he knows the plan, and you will see him when complete. Also, above tip helps with this.

* Finally, if you tend to be a burst worker ( lots of work, plenty of brakes, but down time often in between) and have bossess or coworkers who still believe that lookin busy = getting more done, then leave the office. Hell, I've gone so far as to go to starbucks to have some down time during lunch hours.

The stroke victim may suffer *severe brain damage* when people nearby fail to recognize the symptoms of a stroke.

Now doctors say a bystander can recognize a stroke by asking three [edit] four simple questions:


1. Ask the individual to **SMILE**

2. Ask the person to TALK and **SPEAK A SIMPLE SENTENCE** (Coherently)

3. Ask him or her to **RAISE BOTH ARMS**

4. **Stick out Your Tongue**

Another 'sign' of a stroke is this: Ask the person to 'stick' out his tongue. If the tongue is 'crooked', if it goes to one side or the other that is also an indication of a stroke.

You see a lot of ads like this on craigslist, promising 50k salaries, entry level training, no experience required, for something called ""Outsourced Marketing"" or ""Direct Marketing."" Links like these tend to proliferate on craigslist. When I went to write this post, I figured I would have to do some searching to find them. Turns out, there were multiple ones posted in the last week. 

http://newjersey.craigslist.org/mar/3788629725.html
http://newjersey.craigslist.org/mar/3821805722.html
http://newjersey.craigslist.org/mar/3787127761.html
http://newyork.craigslist.org/que/fbh/3846462232.html

Here's a paragraph about what one of these companies says they do:

""At LIFE Long Island, our marketing services provide our various clients with the ability to reach out to thousands of potential customers and consumers on a daily basis. In a marketplace full of generic advertising and increased competition, LIFE Long Island is able to interact and build relationships with the people that matter when our competitors flyers and direct mail is sitting in the trash.

LIFE Long Island has had incredible success with its current and past clients employing a business to business marketing plan in many industries including telecommunications, office supplies, retail solutions, and merchant processing. Our account managers are professional, knowledgeable, and adaptable to the changing needs of today's small and medium sized businesses. We utilize a strong marketing system while integrating a personable approach to make sure to satisfy the needs of the business owner as well as the client we are representing.""

You may have noticed that a lot of proffesional sounding buzzwords later, you still don't actually have a clear picture of what they do? Because they're intentionally trying to hide what they actually do. 

Door to door sales. 

The company I got an interview with, Life Long Island in Mineola, NY, does door to door office supplies sales. They order supplies cheaply off amazon, and then send their door to door salesmen to resell them to offices, advertising it more cheaply than if they ordered from Staples or Office Maxx. 

These salesmen get paid on commision, pay for their own gas and tolls, and will be expected to go on an all day, unpaid ""Second Interview"" that's basically a day's work for no money. Secondly, many of these companies don't actually pay commission to their employees, but screw them out of it. Life Long Island, apparently, paid someone who posted on Ripoff Report 130 a week, even after he made quite a bit in commision. 

Because of these practices, there's an incredibly high rate of turnover. Many employees leave, which is why their HR representatives are so aggressive during interviews. When you go on an interview, no matter what, you will be a strong candidate. For your second interview, you're told to wear comfortable shoes. Odd? Because you'll have to walk around all day, following door to door salesmen. 

Now, full disclosure, I haven't worked at one of these companies. I got an interview at one, was informed what they really do, and then promptly backed out. The next week, a friend of mine got an interview at a different ""Direct Marketing"" company with a suspicious website, and we proceeded to maybe read every single piece of info in existence on this. 

Many of them are pyramid scheme type places that are affiliated with Cydcor. They tend to train people how to set up their own ""Marketing"" companies that do the same thing. But there's a massive amount of turnover due to the shitty practices, and multiple companies, such as Limitless Marketing and Life Long Island, have had to change their names when they get in trouble with the state. 

I see posts on Craigslist ALL THE TIME for companies like these, so I figured I'd kick it over to you guys. If anyone has a good experience at a ""Direct Marketing"" or ""Outsourced Marketing"" company like this (not an actual, legitimate marketing company), then please, correct me, because every single thing I've read about this has been awful. 

TLDR: Entry Level ""Direct Marketing"" and ""Outsourced Marketing"" is a scam. It's door to door sales.

Instead of this happening, you institute the veto rule, which means that **anyone who vetoes a suggestion has to pay for that veto with a suggestion of their own**. This keeps it from becoming lopsided.

**WITH** the veto rule:

&gt;Me: Want to grab some Pizza?

&gt;Her: Veto. Mexican?

&gt;Me: Nope, sounds awful. What about burgers?

&gt;Her: Nah. Chicken Tenders?

&gt;Me: Agreed.

**Edit:** since this blew up, I'll mention something many commenters have as well: 

The **Pick Three Rule** (or 5-3-1 or some other variation). 

Someone suggests 2-5 options, the other vetoes some of them, and the original person chooses from the survivors. 

*Optional rule:* if the second person vetoes all suggestions, they must re-suggest an equal number of options in return. 

----

Also, here's how you can make the ramen variation I mentioned:

1. Put a bit less than 2 cups of water in a pot and boil it. 
2. Add ramen. Fuck the little packet of powder, you can toss that. 
3. Set timer to 3:33 for the noodles (it's quick to enter on the microwave). The next few steps are done while the noodles cook. 
4. Prepare eggs and sauce. Crack 2-3 eggs in a bowl. Leave them alone. 
5. Put a dollop (trial and error for amount) of peanut butter in another bowl--the one you'll eventually eat out of--and cover that shit with sriracha sauce. Mix it up with a fork, and you should have a nice paste (not too thick). Start with a little bit of peanut butter and a little sriracha; you can always add more of both, but you can't take it away. 
6. Noodles are done. **Leave the heat on high.** 
7. Add eggs, one at a time, stirring them into the noodles. Once it starts to ""boil"" again, add another egg. 
8. Finish cooking until eggs look done (1-2 min. maximum).
9. [Optional] drain remaining water. I don't like soupy ramen, but this is up to you.
10. Add egg noodle stuff to the bowl of spicy peanut paste. Stir, add more sriracha to taste, and enjoy this delicious meal.

But a lot of times when we have been out trying to have a nice romantic evening we end up discussing how the kids are doing at school, or plans for house repairs or whether we should save more for retirement, etc. Not very romantic, right?

And yet, when you're living with someone, especially in a long term relationship, there are a lot of ""business"" items which do need to be discussed. The solution we've found is to have coffee and/or breakfast once a week during which time we discuss those kinds of things. Breakfast is a good time of day because you are fresh, presumably are fully sober and have the whole day ahead of you to accomplish stuff. Extra points if you make it a nice breakfast with pancakes, bagels or whatever.

In addition, if you make the business breakfast a time when you can bring up petty grievances, it really can reduce snarking at each other during the week. Instead of having to confront your SO over some little thing when it occurs to you, you can have time to frame your requests in a more productive manner. 

For example, you might want to ask your husband to be more helpful with the laundry. Instead of seeing the laundry piled up and automatically reacting with ""How come you never help me with laundry?!"" you might instead wait until your weekly breakfast and say ""You know, it would be really helpful if you could put start a load of laundry before you go to work in the mornings.""

* subconsciously: proclaiming a goal makes your brain think you've already completed it, giving you a sense of satisfaction without actually doing any of the work
* consciously: you think you've already made a step towards your goal, allows you to procrastinate more
* makes you more likely to give up sooner than if you kept your goals to yourself, because you think you have less work left than you actually do ([1982 - Peter Gollwitzer study](http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2009/05/12/talking-the-talk.html))

If you don't know what you're talking about, don't try to pretend that you do. We'll know. 

If you **do** know what you're talking about, don't talk our ears off, and don't stalk our bay like a vulture. Use your knowledge to tell us exactly what we need to know, stand back, and let us do our job. I'm not saying you shouldn't keep a watchful eye on your technician if you have the ability to do so, I'm just saying that you shouldn't hang over their shoulders trying to, for lack of a better phrase, ""talk shop"" with them. 9 times out of 10, as long as the shop doesn't have a rule against it, if you ask if you can watch and promise to be quiet, mechanics will gladly let you. Gaining their permission to do so is generally a solid indicator of how confident the shop is in their work, but turning you down does **not**, on its own, mean they're running a shady operation. Shops are dangerous as all hell, and something bad can happen before you even realize it.

**Call us out**. If for any reason you aren't comfortable with what we're telling you needs to be done, ask us to show you exactly what we're talking about. Trustworthy mechanics will practically fall over themselves to give you proof to back up what they're saying, because earning your trust is their top priority. They will also be **extremely** hesitant to do any work before they're 100% sure you understand what they're talking about. The shops you need to stay away from will fight you tooth and nail, and will do everything in their power to divert you away from their bullshit (and, in some extreme cases, will actively push you to authorize the work knowing full well you have no clue what they're telling you.)

Nearly every mechanic out there has an eidetic memory when it comes to cars and their owners. If you treat us like trash even when we're being patient and polite, we **will** remember. That goes the other way as well; if you're nice to us, we'll go out of our way to ensure your next experience is as smooth as possible, and if we're allowed to, will often give you a small discount.

There are **very** few truly shady shops out there. From my experience, most of the places that seem like they're trying to rip you off are actually just piss-poor operations that don't have people skilled in the delicate art of customer service. No time are people more testy and more defensive than they are with their vehicles. Combine that with a general lack of customer service, and honest ignorance can easily look like a willful act of fraud. That said, trusting mechanics with the life of you and your family yet treating them all like moronic swindlers is not a polite thing to do. Assume that they **are** trustworthy, until they give you a reason to believe otherwise.

With that in mind, you know how I said that we remember if you're a jerk or not? Shady places also remember if you're gullible or not. They'll essentially outright lie to you, and if you buy what they're selling, shablam...they've got a stooge for life. Given the nature of shady shops, they don't require a large number of customers, just a cadre of very gullible ones. As other posters have mentioned in the comments though, it's extremely rare to find a shady person working in an otherwise squeaky-clean shop, as they get run out pretty quickly. As a general rule, either the whole shop is crooked, or the whole shop is on the up and up.

Very unfortunately, the stereotype that women often get higher bills than men is true to some extent, but it's not due to sexism or anything like that. In general, women are more willing to get work done on their vehicles precisely because they don't understand what is being told to them (I know there are some incredibly kick-ass female technicians out there, but generally, this is the case.) As a result, women are given bigger writeups/less discounts in the hopes that they'll just say ""screw it"" and agree to have things done. Highly reputable shops will **never** do this, but even relatively decent ones sometimes will. It's an unfortunate pock mark on the industry.

A shop that has a competent, well-liked shop foreman is likely to be a competent, well-run shop. Just like a head chef does far more than just cook, a shop foreman is responsible for things like inventory, customer service issues, and in really smartly run places, things like ticket allocation for specific repair needs. For example, if Josh can do magical things with a welder and a Huth pipe bender, and Arnie can properly align the rear camber of a riced-out Civic, it doesn't make any sense for Arnie to break out the Bend Cards and for Josh to struggle with the Civic just because of the ticket order. I know that's getting into the nitty-gritty details of things, but the point is that a skilled foreman (**with both cars AND people**) usually means a solid operation.

People are often miffed about going in for a simple oil change, and then leaving with a $1000 estimate for a bunch of work on their car that they might not necessarily need right then and there. It's important to remember that an estimate is exactly that: an estimate. It's just a way of informing you of things they found wrong (or things that could *potentially* be wrong.) Why would they look if they're just doing a simple oil change, and why would they mention something if you don't actually need it yet? Well, say something looks like there's even a 10% chance of being bad (or going bad in the near future), and a shop doesn't tell you about it, and then two days later it breaks. Who are you likely to blame: the car, or the shop you just went to? Liability and ass-coverage is the name of the game, dear poster. I assure you that their goal isn't to piss you off. Most of the reputable places will wince at doing it, but will still do it all the same. 

If you want to give your mechanic a little treat (which, just like a customer's attitude, is something mechanics ALWAYS remember), any kind of food or drink that fits with the time of year is a solid bet. Soup, coffee, etc in the winter, or super-cold drinks or sandwiches in the summer. Something that isn't too sugary or soda-like is actually preferred...they might tell you they would prefer soda, but trust me, they don't. Hydration is what they want. Mechanics are also known to be fond of gifted six-packs, regardless of the weather :)

There are many issues that can honestly seem like they're coming from one part in the vehicle, when in fact they're coming from a different part. Some of us refer to these issues as ""phantom problems"", although I've always been partial to the phrase ""ventriloquist bastard"".

Here's a basic example: your check engine light comes on. You take it to the shop, they hook up an OBD2 scanner to it, and the code says that your downstream O2 sensor is bad. The mechanic replaces the sensor, and sends you on your way. Three days later, the light comes back on, and the same code is tripped. Turns out that, yes, the sensor was indeed bad, but so was your catalytic converter. Since the sensor was downstream of the converter, it's the **converter** that caused the **sensor** to fail in the first place. The sensor was indeed bad and needed to be changed, but that wasn't necessarily the root cause of the problem.

This doesn't mean the mechanic is dumb or bad at their job! It just means they might not have a lot of experience, or they might not have ever encountered a converter fouling out a downstream oxygen sensor. Remember, cars are insanely complicated, and there are a near infinite number of things that can go wrong. Everyone screws up sometimes.

It's also important to remember that being a mechanic is **brutal**. This can vary depending what shop you work in, but we're talking temps in the winter so cold you can't even hold on to your tools, and then in the summer temps so hot you can drink 2 gallons of water a day and STILL be dehydrated at the end of it all. Even if you work in an air conditioned/heated shop, you're still essentially weight-lifting and doing cardio for 8-12 hours a day, 5-6 days a week.

It's a very tough but very rewarding job. Knowing that someone is able to get their kid to daycare and then get to their job safely all because of the work that **you personally do** is immensely satisfying. Likewise, every mistake you make has high visibility on it, so the job requires you to be very humble and to quickly grok what you did wrong. Making a mistake happens to everyone, but all good mechanics never make the same mistake twice.

2) Pull up beside the car in front of the space. Exactly beside them. Your back bumpers should be pretty much lined up.

3) Cut the wheel **all the way** to the right and back up watching your right side view mirror. 

4) Stop backing up as soon **as you can no longer see the car parked in the space behind you** in your right mirror.

5) straighten the wheel out and back **straight back** until the front of your car can clear the back bumper of the front car.

6) Cut the wheel **all the way** to the left and continue backing into the space

7) Once you're in the spot straighten your wheel out and make sure you leave about equal room in front of and behind your car

YOU'RE AWESOME AT PARALLEL PARKING!!!!

If you need to get a bit closer to the curb remember that each time you scoot forward or back you'll need to cut the wheel AND straighten it out with each back and forth. If you don't do both your literally just retracing your own tracks.

Just as a disclaimer, I do feel a little bad about this. I understand that spreading Adblock around probably hurts content creators. There's a whole debate to be had about that, but I'll leave you to consider that for yourself. If it really bothers you, you could disable Adblock for the pages that they visit that aren't covered in malicious garbage.

Every now and then I see some advice about interviewing on this sub that I find questionable, so I decided to share what I consider to be my interview bag of tricks.


* Look put together. 

Ask your recruiter/HR contact what the dress code is during the phone screen or in-person interview scheduling process. If he or she says business casual, wear nicely ironed slacks, an ironed dress shirt, and dress shoes. Dress code is highly debate and some interviewees say ""If I can't wear a t-shirt to the interview, I won't be a cultural fit!"" - great, this tip is how to get a job, not how to avoid getting one. If you must look ""casual"" without asking about the dress code, at least wear a polo.

Being put together is more than dress code, though. Go to Target and get a $10 faux leather folio and ditch the 5 star notebook look. Get a pen that looks nicer than a $.25 bic. Keep extra copies of your resume in the folio along with paper to jot down notes during the interview.

* Be memorable

This means that they should think you're a good dude or dudette from the beginning. As soon as anyone walks into the interview room, immediately stand up and offer a hand shake and introduce yourself. Don't wait for them to introduce. You're the one trying to look personable and make a good impression.

This also means that you should do things like asking ""What would my typical day/week look like in this position?"" or ""How many members would be on my team and can I meet any of them?"" This gives you a glimpse of the actual job itself, while making them think about situations where you're in the job. This is good.

* Don't be bashful.

Interviews are not a time to be humble. You need to outperform every single other person that's interviewing. If someone asks, ""have you worked with X"" and you haven't, the correct answer isn't ""No, I haven't,"" it is ""I've worked with Y extensively and I've been dying to get my hands on X. I know that a lot of skills overlap between the two, but I haven't had a chance to use X yet. I've kept up on it and my strong background in Y makes me confident I'd pick up on X quickly.""

* Do some research about the company beforehand.

Walking in knowing that they just landed a huge customer or moved to a new office building gives you a talking point if there is any downtime in the interview, or gives you questions to ask at the end of the interview. It makes you look interested and prepared. It's also OK to look people up on LinkedIn, if you know who will be interviewing you.

* Always have questions.

No job is ever how it's presented during the interview. You need to make sure that it's a good fit for you. Yes, the economy sucks, but if you're lucky enough to be in a position where you don't *need* the first offer that comes across the table, then you should be vetting them as much as they are vetting you. Things like ""On the way out, could you show my where my work area would be?"" or ""Can I meet any members of the team?"" or even ""How long have the most senior and most junior members of my team been here?"" will all give insight into the conditions/culture. You want to avoid high turnover, but you also want to avoid lifers and a team of geriatrics if you're a younger up-and-comer.

    * A summary of the research paper by /u/Exaskryz : I just looked at it, and here's a summary from the conclusion (not the abstract):

        * Multimedia principle - giving multiple representations that build off of each other is better than just one representation.  
        * Redundancy inhibts learning. That is, just reading aloud text and displaying it (powerpoints, handouts, etc.) inhibits learning.  
        * You can replay *video* lecture material at up to 1.33x speed and get the same learning benefit. Video may be just a powerpoint with changing pictures that supports the audio.  
        * Audio only lectures at 1.33x speed hinder high level learning (their example of high level is problem solving). If the audio lecture is part of a multimedia environment, it's OK though.  
        * A multimedia environment is defined: ""verbal (text or narration) and non-verbal (images or icons)"" 

            
* People curious of what I study, I'm a Neuroscience Major at the University of MIchigan. I would ask kindly to not ""bash"" other people's fields of study just because you feel that yours is more difficult. Information is information and this tip can be applied very broadly.

Thanks for the upvotes and the comments.  Just a quick clarification as I read the comments:  the intended audience for this LPT is college undergraduates.  If you are a college student trying to improve your B's to A's, these tips may help you.  If you are an aspiring New Yorker contributor, accomplished editor, or a grammarian, please refer to the comments on the finer points of the word ""however,"" the nuanced use of the semicolon, and the difference between a present participle and a gerund.

I am not a writer or editor. I am a science/math person who struggled with writing in college.  I used the following formulas to improve my essay grades.

Note: I am skipping the usual advice on proofreading, organization, creating a thesis, etc.

A. **Transitions.** Use liberally.  They add fluidity to papers and make you sound less robotic.  Examples include furthermore, therefore, however, in addition, in contrast, and moreover.  Look up more examples.  There are two general formulas to use transitions.  TRANSITION + COMMA + CLAUSE.  SUBJECT + COMMA + TRANSITION + COMMA + PREDICATE.

* ex: Medieval art is characterized by the depiction of religious figures.  **In addition,** art from this period includes the use of precious metals such as gold.

* ex: Ukarine does not have any natural environmental hazards.  The **country, however, experienced** an environmental catastrophe following the Chernobyl disater in 1986.

**EDIT:** Some comments below have brought to my attention that [it may be bad style to start a sentence with ""however"" though it is grammatically correct.](http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/starting-a-sentence-with-however.aspx)

B. **The semicolon.** Considered the ""cherry on top"" that adds sophistication to a paper.  Use sparingly.  Too often, this punctuation is abused because students needlessly replace a period between two related independent clauses with a semicolon.  DO NOT DO THIS.  My suggestion is to use the semicolon with transitions with the following formula.  CLAUSE 1 + SEMICOLON + TRANSITION + COMMA + CLAUSE 2.

* ex: Heroin is a prodrug that metabolizes into **morphine; therefore,** it has the same effects on the CNS as other opioids.

* ex: Researchers have found that playing violent video games does not cause violent **behavior; on the contrary,** many recent papers suggest violent video games reduce bullying in adolescents.

C. **Not only this, but also that.**  Another winning formula. This should be used as a topic sentence to transition from one topic to another.  Let's say you're writing a paper on the health benefits of exercise.  Your first paragraph is about how exercise improves cardiovascular health.  Your second paragraph is about how exercise has pyschological benefits.  Your topic sentence for your second paragraph can be constructed like this:

* ex: **Not only** does regular exercise prevent cardiovascular disease, **but** research has **also** linked exercise with psychological benefits.

Don't forget the ""also.""  Common mistake.

D. **Show.**  Use words like show, demonstrate, and indicate to link ideas together in a conclusive way.  This is also a great way to link evidence to commentary or fact with opinion.  It demonstrates logical thinking.  The formula is EVIDENCE + ""SHOW"" + COMMENTARY.

* ex: The rise in teenage pregnancy in communities that have banned contraceptive education **demonstrates** that abstinence only sex education has no place in the classroom.

If you want to highlight a point or argument, use words like highlight, underline, and underscore.

If the evidence does not directly show a conclusion or the evidence is weak (e.g. a correlation), use words like suggest, imply, and implicate.

E. **The gerund.**  The gerund helps link two ideas in a single sentence.  It also helps vary sentence length and structure.  Again, it adds sophistication and fluidity to a paper.  ""Gerunding"" is best used with tip #4, which basically converts *show* into *show-ing*.  The basic formula is CLAUSE 1 + GERUND + CLAUSE 2.

* ex: Thoreau's ""Civil Disobedience"" describes the military as ""small movable forts and magazines"" **suggesting** that soldiers are mindless drones taking orders from a corrupt government.

**EDIT**: As some redditors have pointed out, this is actually a participle and not a gerund.

Here are some tips.,riceandrain,4173,1992,682,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1a98lk/lpt_awkward_with_kids_here_are_some_tips/,"I hang out with children for a living and thought I would share some basic tips for interacting with kids. This post mainly pertains to kids 3-10, but can be adjusted as needed. Also this list is for casual/familial contact with children, think meeting a girlfriends kids or thanksgiving with your cousins. 

1. After being introduced or asking their name remember it. Pretty basic right? Who doesn't feel valued when a new friend (and that's what you're doing, making a new friend) remembers your name? But you would be surprised how many times a child gets introduced as ""Nancy's boy"" or ""Tom's girlfriends daughter"". 

If for some reason you are introducing them to someone new say this is my friend ""insert name"". Is it cheesy? Maybe, but I haven't meet a child who minds and it's sweet when they introduce me to their friends the same way.

2. Boundaries. They are important, especially with kids. Don't want to be ""Uncle Jimmy who wrestles"", Then don't start. Horse play around with them once and you will be asked to do it every time. Not that wrestling is a bad but expect two things a) The parents will most likely hate it,  not because they think it is creepy but they don't want them to bug you.  b) You will hurt them. If I had a dime for every child that got hit by a rogue elbow or slipped from my grasp I would have two dimes.... Two very sad dimes.

3. Don't ask them about school. They like it ""okay"" and their favorite subject is recess.  There are a couple exceptions a)  If they bring it up and b) If you know a child of similar age/grade/teacher that they may know. 

4. So what do you talk about? Just like talking with an adult try and find similar interests. Sports, dance class and movies are all good starting points. And depending on the age, your profound knowledge of Spongbob and Adventure Time could come in handy. 

5. Learn a skill (also known as a kid friendly party trick). I have two card tricks and know how to make three kinds of paper airplanes  (simple enough to make in under a minute but complex enough to impress) up my sleeve at all times. 

6. Take the heat. Getting too loud? Paper airplane hit someone in the head? Take the fall, apologize and move on. Remember what it feels like to always get in trouble?  Misspeak? Admit it immediately without saying things like ""like you never make mistakes"" or ""you say stuff wrong all the time"". Adults admitting they are wrong are few and far between and doing so garners instant respect. 

7. Don't be condescending. The only thing that separates them from adults is a little bit of time and experience. Don't make the mistake of thinking you're more intelligent than them, you're just older.

Wow, didn’t expect this sort of response when going to bed last night and especially didn’t expect the backlash I got for this. I really feel the need to address this instead of just ignoring it and reason what made me write this tip. First of all, it’s called life pro TIPS, so it’s not something that you have to do, and if this doesn’t work for you, I don’t see why you should. The thing is that on this subreddit, I’ve seen posts before that I knew right away that it wouldn’t work for me, so I just ignored it. I thought that was the thing to do. Instead people started to rage about this and when I woke up this morning I wondered why I had 200+ comments where half said thanks and half of you hated it. 

I think the first misconception came when I had the word work out in the title. This is my first sign of “regret” that I probably should have used a different wording. In my native language, the word for work out is the same for all work outs, and that’s what I thought would be the same thing here, and it probably still is. But people assumed directly that work out is lifting weights and pumping on the gym. And you are probably right when you say that this doesn’t work while you are on a gym and lifting weights, but you also need to understand how many different kinds of workouts there is and my “go to” training is cardio. I have started a habit to run long and I’m now in a place that I have to run every day. I’m also a guy who over thinks EVERYTHING so if I  would listen to music, I would just think of the number of songs I’ve heard and with simple math trying to figure out my time, which seriously doesn’t work for me. I started to listen to audio books and only when running, and find myself lost in my audio book and my running and I could run for 45 min to an hour without thinking. So as I said in the beginning, this is a tip for people who maybe have problem going back to working out (which is a really important thing to do). 

I’ve also read some people saying things like “why don’t you just stop being a fat fuck and the motivation would be to not be a fat fuck” or something like that. While I first thought it was just a random troll, I still felt a reason to address this as well. First of all, I’m not a “fat fuck”. The thing with motivation is that it works different with different people. A few years ago I worked out almost two times a day in a sport team before my “posterior cruciate ligament” (I googled translated that) snapped and I had to stop with all exercising for two years. During that time I also had a death to a really close friend and I started to get depressed. While I really felt the need to just “fuck it all”, this tip helped me not to just lie down and feel sorry for myself and instead start running again. Motivation comes in all forms and sizes, and it’s not just for getting up from your couch and stop eating McDonalds or something.

If this is something that you tried now and it works for you, then it would be awesome. But if it’s not something you think would work, then that’s also fine. I just didn’t expect rage for a LPT that might just help someone to start exercising again. I’m also sorry for a long post which probably had a lot of grammatical errors and spelling was probably off as fuck, but as I said; English is not my native language so please don’t try to win any arguments by correcting my spelling.

The reason for this is you will unconsciously try to cognitively process the words of the song when listening to music with lyrics, which will tend to make you feel overwhelmed and make it more difficult to bring all your focus onto what you are writing or reading.  This is also why watching tv or movies or listening to some type of spoken word radio show while doing these activities tends to go very badly, at least for me, turning one enjoyable activity and one productive one into a hectic mess with the combination of the two.

Classical music, jazz, movie theme songs, and word-free EDF tracks are probably your best bets for this type of multitasking, in that order.  And with classical and jazz music at a minimum I think you should find your performance will be improved even compared to just completing your task in silence with full focus.

Here are a few words of advice.


If you come in person to interview or just to get an application, dress nice. Not saying you need a suit and tie to apply for a lifeguard position, but wear decent pants and a nicer shirt (ie: a polo shirt), not ripped jeans and a dirty ""420 YOLO SWAG"" shirt.


When you are talking to people look them in the eyes and engage them. I can't tell you how many people come in to apply for a job and look at their shoes the entire time and mumble responses to my questions.


Make sure your application is readable. I have shit for hand writing but when I was filling out applications it looked like I got an A+ in hand writing class. If I can't read it, I won't hire you. On the same vein, answer ALL the questions. Don't leave half the application blank and expect anyone to call you back.


Put the cell phone away. If you are waiting for someone that is fine, but when someone is talking to you put it away and don't bring it out again until you leave.


If you have questions about hiring, the position, or if there is any word on your application make sure that it is you that is calling, not mom or dad. It is a sign of maturity and that you are responsible enough to follow up yourself. It is a huge red flag if mom is calling me every day to ask questions for you or to push me to give you a job.


source: I do HR at a decent size country club and have been doing the hiring for the last few years and have reviewed more than enough terrible applications and candidates.



Edit: Some of you gave some good advice as well so I will add it as well:



*Use a blue or black pen to fill out an application.



*Don't bring friends with you to apply. 



*Have a professional email address, not  fingerbanger666@gmail.com 



*If possible hand an application to the manager not an employee.



*Don't show up when we are running around like mad people expecting anyone to talk to you or remember you.



*Don't apply too early (we forget about the application) or too late. Try and think of a reasonable time to apply, sorry it is vague advice.



*Don't be late and don't have a poor excuse.



*Know how to shake someone's hand.



*Be confident when you are applying in person.


*Be polite!",,False,self,t5_2s5oq,1369242718.0,,,True,t3_1eu1ga,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1eu1ga/lpt_school_ended_for_the_year_and_you_are/,

* https://www.decide.com/ for electronics and appliances (by /u/philodox)

Some of them support multiple sites as well as multiple countries while others are limited to Amazon US only. To keep track of a particular product, just go to any of the above trackers, search for the product and enter your email address or twitter id and the desired price in the specific fields. Its that simple. Here's an example:

http://camelcamelcamel.com/The-Matrix-Collection-Film-Favorites/product/B001DJLD1M

Just enter the required information and you are good to go. Once you do that you will be notified as soon as the product reaches the desired price you mentioned. Its pretty awesome. The best time to buy a product IMO is when it reaches its lowest historical price. Of course it may take a few months, and is only good for products that you don't require immediately. But if done right, it can save you a lot of money.


* **How much money can be saved buying products at their lowest price**


To get an idea about this, I looked at the lowest price and the usual price(the price at which you can buy the product when not on sale) and formed an excel sheet using the data. Don't confuse the list price with the usual price. The usual price is the price at which you can buy the product regularly, while the list price is the price at which the product was launched. 

Upon analyzing the data, I found that you can on average save approx 30% off regular price if you buy it at the lowest price. That's $300 for every $1000 worth of products you bought. It is a lot of money. Here's the data in excel format(I collected this data from a new subreddit and I only have data for approx 40 products right now)

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B08rF-l_lyR7NW44b0RNTF85U1U/edit?usp=sharing


While most deal sites would say, always buy products at deal prices, I say, always buy products at their lowest historical price. Chances are that you won't regret it for a long time to come. 

**EDIT:** I guess I should add this right here

Check out /r/amazonLP as well(the subreddit I used to get the price data). It lists products that are at their lowest historical price currently.",,False,self,t5_2s5oq,1364509408.0,,,True,t3_1b6c96,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1b6c96/lpt_how_to_use_price_trackers_to_wait_for_the/,

Abstract: An unwanted mind pattern can be removed using a simple method: Corrupt the pattern. 

Background: 

The human mind is good at learning patterns and lessons. This has helped ensure survival. This mechanism causes problems when the distinct pattern of a catchy song or the memory of a painful or embarrassing experience gets stuck in your brain like a leech in a place you can't reach. 

A memory is not like a digital video that remains the same no matter how many times you play it. Rather, a memory WRITES OVER ITSELF each time you re-experience it in your mind. Memories are UNSTABLE, and there have been studies in which false memories containing events that never happened into subjects' minds. You can exploit the instability of memories by repeatedly rewriting over the unwanted memory, until the original loses all meaning, context, and structure, rendering it inert if not deleted.

Process for deleting an unwanted brain/earworm:

* Replay the memory, pattern, song progressively mess it up by adding, changing details, pace, exaggerations, distortions. Make it funny, strange, surreal. 
* It is important to STRONGLY experience the distortions in your mind and and associate them directly with the memory.
* Do this repeatedly, CHANGING the pattern each time. Increase the intensity of the distortions with each subsequent repetition, until the original pattern becomes scrambled. 
* The beginning of the pattern is hardest to scramble. It is like the start of the path to the memory. When the original pattern is scrambled, you can set the path from the beginning of the pattern to lead it to a more desired outcome.
* Avoid reminders or things that will re-establish original unwanted memory.


Example: You want to forget ""Call Me Maybe""

* Replay and change lyrics, tempo, key, context: ""Hey, I just m... ight eat a potato, or maybe a banana..."", ""Hey, I just aaaaaaaate a pooootaaato..."", ... ""Hey, I like chicken, I like liver, Meomix..."", ... ""Hay, the horse likes hay...""
* Strongly experience means you have to sing or mouth the new songs. Sing as differently from the original pattern as possible.
* Enough repetitions will unhook that earworm.
* Now you might still have ""Hey"", the beginning of the path. Now you can think about another song that begins with ""Hey""
* Avoid listening to the original song.

**EDIT:** 

How easy this is will vary based on the memory you choose to corrupt. A fresh memory of some faux pas or some recently-heard commercial jingle would be relatively easy to get rid of. Others are mental scars set deep in your long term memories that are near-impossible to wipe, due to your mind anchoring them to different contexts, emotions, and other memories. While it is hard to destroy something so deep, this technique WILL at least soften the impact and blur the harshness of the memory, with enough persistent repetition across long periods of time and upon each willing or spontaneous recall. Over time you can expect the memory to be more and more muddled.

* REPETITION is key. It's unreasonable to expect to erase a persistent brain pattern in under 4 reps. 10 reps recommended, but you should know when it's working.
* FOCUS is key. You must focus on EXPERIENCING EACH NEW DISTORTION so that your mind writes over the old pattern.
* DISTORTION is key. You must make each and every subsequent distortion weirder, stronger, and more ridiculous. If you recall any part of the original pattern in your later repetition, you need to distort harder.
* This is a mind exercise. You only get stronger and more successful if you keep doing it. If you try once or not at all and then give up, you know it's your own fault when you get that worm stuck in your head.

Please note that there was only about 6cm of water in the tub in this video. It only went up to the base of my fingers when I stuck my hand in (left out of the video, oops). It's a brand new golf ball for this video, and the ball I originally used was VERY scuffed up, which I think also helps ensure the bathtub is fully drained by morning. You could also put one of those tiny rubber bands around the middle to make it drain a little faster (I'm embarrassed to admit that I experimented with that, nerd that I am), as sometimes I would come in in the morning and the tub would still have a little bit of water.

Also, there's no tricks... this isn't one of those 'trick' or 'stunt' tubs in any way. :) It really will flip around the drain for almost a minute (or even more if there's a lot of water).

Please note that I don't think this will save the planet or is otherwise significant in any way... I was just goofing around, trying to save some heat on a -30C day, and in the process noticed an unexpected physics quirk at 6am in the shower.

This post was meant for OTC eye drops for redness/allergies/irritation and such. If your prescription drops need to be refrigerated, of course don't do this.

Also, as /u/MouthyMike pointed out below ""you don't actually have to have your eye open.. just drop it in the corner of your closed eye and open your eye then... makes it much easier..""

I do that, and I actually STILL need the drop to be warm. For me, cool drops are like icepicks in my eyes.

I work front desk at a hotel and I can tell you that 75% of the 'issues' I have reported to me originate with 'Do Not Disturb' signs.


**It varies from hotel to hotel,** but these signs are taken quite seriously at some hotels.


**At the property where I work** at you could call for towels to be sent up to the room, but if there is a DND sign on the door we are NOT allowed to knock or disturb you, hotel policy.


Once we have noticed the sign (There is an active list updated every 3-4 hours by walking the floor to see who has them up, and who doesn't.) we **(the staff)** cannot call you unless it an emergency, there is a billing/clerical issue, or you receive a ""personal"" phone call. 


*(Another quick LPT, if you know someone is going to call you at the hotel make sure they know your last name AND room number, most hotels can't transfer calls unless you they know both.)*


If you are staying at a hotel for more than one night and want Housekeeping to tidy up for you, remember to take down the sign.  **At my particular property** could be walking out the door to go out for the day, see a HK and ask them to make sure your room is freshened up, but if you left your DND sign on the door they cannot go in *(Hotel policy does state however that we have to enter the room once every 3 days to make sure you aren't wrecking the room or ...well to be honest, dead.)*

Thanks for reading.

This is by no means the only way to go about this. This is just how I found the easiest way to do it. If you have questions post them and I'll try to get to them tomorrow because well I have homework to do. Also this is from when I was homeless and traveling so if you have any questions about that that's fine. Feel free to repost this to a more appropriate subreddit if you think there is one. Just include the information at the bottom please. Also this guide might only work in the U.S. or similar places with a similar or better welfare structure.

Also including a link to the recent IAMA that sparked this now I know this person posted in the wrong forum but if they can provide some key information maybe we can get them in contact with somebody that can help? I've already reposted their IAMA to /r/assistance http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/x1et3/iamabout_to_be_homeless_im_going_to_ask_to_be/

Alright so here's a bit more about what this is. This is not how to be homeless, it's not how to travel, it's not how to beat the system. This is last case scenario advice for somebody with no safety net who has just been kicked out of the house. This advice should help you to get back on your feet using the shelter system in America. This is by no means how most homeless live. Most homeless are under a bridge, or in a covered cause way. They are forced to sleep on cardboard pallets in abandoned buildings. This is fancy living compared to how most homeless have to/ forced to/ choose to live. Homelessness is a very complex issue and encompasses a very diverse group of people.
___________________________________________________________________________________


During your eviction hold a ""fire sale"", that is sell everything you own that is not


3 pairs of pants


3 shirts


7 pairs underwear

All of your socks

A blanket or sleeping bag

A backpack to put all of this in

After you have sold all of this stuff for whatever it will go for sight unseen, go to the bank that has your account and do one of two things. If you do not have a negative balance you should deposit all of the money you just made. If you do have a negative balance you should withdraw all of the funds that they will allow you to.

Now go to a different bank and open up an account, but do not get an atm card. This will require you to go to the bank to withdraw money. It will also make it easier to deposit money than to withdraw it.

Now take your backpack and go to the nearest mission, you want to do this pretty early in the afternoon or sooner if you can. Ask the person at the front desk if you can be processed for intake. If they say no tell them you are homeless and ask for the address of the nearest shelter that is taking in people. If they say you're too early ask for when intake is and be there a half hour early, this is because beds go fast. The reason beds go fast is because here you'll get a shower, a bed and a hot meal.
Now that you're in the shelter you must do this one thing. Treat everybody there as a human, you'll be rooming with some pretty sad sorts, and you are no better than they are. The reason they are there is the same reason you are there, it beats the hell out of cold concrete. I can attest to the frigidity of concrete and it'll humble a soul.

Now that you have a bed you need to ask where you can safely store your belongings, this is very important because now you are going to realize the importance of everything you own. Also theft is pretty much the worst thing that could happen to you right now so guard against it.

You'll probably have to go to some church service before dinner. Suck it up and do it, this is your rent that you pay. Close your eyes and think about Half Life 3 finally coming out, or replay all of the greatest things that you've ever done with a girl. Do anything you can that will prevent you from falling asleep and making the pastor/preacher/reverend from having an excuse to kick you out. Also you don't want to insult somebody that has agreed to feed you.

Ok so now it's chow time, eat up. But don't take seconds. I know you're hungry but see that old toothless bastard over there, he's been doing this all his life. You're only going to be here for a week or two max.
Now it's shower time. This is probably going to suck unless you played sports in highschool or showered after gym. You'll be showering with your own gender. This is only as awkward as you make it. But just keep in mind somebody is going to see you naked. After the shower you may be offered socks. Take them! You may even be offered a laundry service. You need to figure out how this is run and who runs it. Get in good with this person so that you can get all of your clothes back when they've laundered them for you. This is important, because now socks are your best friend.

Ok so now you're going to bed and you've been told the rules, lights out after such and such time. Breakfast at such and such time.

You're going to wake up earlier than you usually do. Don't gripe. Make your bed. Go eat. Now go up front and see if you can get an I.D. card or inquire about how to save your bed for the night. You'll probably have to do some chore or such. Do them, remember bed &gt; concrete.

Now that it's morning and you've done your chores. You're going to feel pretty childish. Well it is. Don't get used to it. You should now go out and look for employ. I used to hold a sign near Home Depot or Lowes saying Will Work For Peanuts with a little elephant on it. It worked and I learned many a trade. Usually through this I would befriend somebody who's couch I could sleep on. I did this while I was traveling. 

When I stopped traveling I ended up being roomates with a guy on the job site and we have been great friends ever since. Even though I now live in Chicago and he in Escondido we still talk on the phone.
Until somebody offers you a couch, you need to rinse and repeat this day until you get a couch. Once you get a couch you have access to laundry and hopefully respectable clothes. If you have gotten on in a job site you might even have learned a trade much as I did. If not well apply to any local coffee shop or small business that gives interviews. Tell the interviewer what you've just been through. People will generally hire you on at a low wage and train you because you're showing more initiative than most candidates. Also many people want to help. More people want to help you than you'll ever know. Cherish this fact and pay it forward. It'll reward you more than anything.

I was homeless and traveling from age 18 to 23. I'm now 27 and going to school under the Pell Grant for Computer Science and have enough knowledge to build my own house. I wouldn't have any of this knowledge if I was not in your position when I was younger. I regret not going to college sooner but everybody has their cross to bear.

From [CXR1037](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/x1lqq/i_have_been_seeing_a_lot_of_im_about_to_be/c5ihh7r) Look up a food not bombs feeding in your area it's a great place to get lunch and meet people who might let you crash or might have a line on a job. 

From [fearthespoon](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/x1lqq/i_have_been_seeing_a_lot_of_im_about_to_be/c5ih1io) Good resource on sleeping in a car as a shelter. I was never lucky enough to have a car but it's a good point nonetheless. 



From [00fordmc](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/x1lqq/i_have_been_seeing_a_lot_of_im_about_to_be/c5ihu9n) It is definitely important to be aware of your surroundings and know that not every one of your peers wants to give you a hand up.



From [flooing](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/x1lqq/i_have_been_seeing_a_lot_of_im_about_to_be/c5ii2gj) If you are a guest in somebody's home you are a fucking guest. Do the dishes, make your bedding invisible, be up before they are with coffee and breakfast. Also learn to dumpster so you can contribute food to the house without using precious money

From [superconfused](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/x1lqq/i_have_been_seeing_a_lot_of_im_about_to_be/c5ihxld) Stay clean and approachable, you'll get much better reactions because believe it or not appearance matters.

From [surejohn](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/x1lqq/i_have_been_seeing_a_lot_of_im_about_to_be/c5ih85v) Also it's suggested to bring a towel.

At least 3 other people were standing there taking pictures on their phones. No one had called 9-1-1.

I yelled for someone to call and then checked on the two kids that were in the car. One was crushed inside the driver's side and the other was ejected. Checked on the ejected one first; he had no pulse, wasn't breathing, and multiple bones were out of his body. The other was having trouble breathing and struggling to get out so I calmed him down, kept him talking to me, and stabilized his neck until the paramedics arrived. He had to be cut out of the car with the jaws-of-life.

**PLEASE WEAR YOUR SEAT BELTS!**

**Edit:** I typed this up about 30 minutes after law enforcement let me leave, it was after midnight. I left out a few details and didn't clarify things so I will now:

* I am fine. I did not witness the accident. I arrived moments after it happened.
* I was in the army and part of basic training is combat first aid. A lot of this applies to real life situations too. It just kind of kicked in.
* I did point to a specific person when I yelled ""CALL 9-1-1, NOW!"" She did.
* I directed other by-standards to stop all traffic coming on our road (one-way road)

For those saying that I should have tried CPR on the kid that was ejected:

* He was laying face down
* I checked for responsiveness
* I checked for breathing
* I saw a lot of blood underneath him, but none on top, so I ran my hands underneath his body without moving him to check for arterial bleeding. His neck had a massive hole in it that half of my hand fit in. I could feel bones.

I am around for a bit if anyone has any questions. I'd be happy to answer them.

The trial of self-posts only for a week ended today and we have to say that it was rather successful. The discussion and submission quality drastically improved, the spam filter was way down, and lots of people wrote in to express their gratitude for trying something like this.

As of now, we have no plans to switch the submissions back to also allow link posts, since the only thing that is really gained from it would be (link) karma. You can still submit images in self-posts and comment on the article to obtain that sweet karma that you may fiend for, but for now self-posts are in.

**Please upvote this thread so it gets visibility (I get no karma for self-posts).**

As always, we'll keep this thread open for additional discussion where you can express your opinion and myself as well as the other mods will be in here to answer your questions/concerns.

**Update:** Some of you have mentioned of allowing link posts once per week.

These generally take the form of two long steel bars mounted in plastic. [(They look like this).](http://imgur.com/PAT7v) As your wet clothes rub against the bars, a voltage is transferred from one bar to the other. This voltage decreases as the clothes dry out. Once it drops to a certain point (based on where you put the knob), the dryer will shut off.

If you use dryer sheets, they tend to coat everything in the dryer with a film over time. This film builds up an insulating layer on top of the electrodes, and prevents them from accurately measuring the moisture content of your clothes. So, the dryer thinks that it has finished before it really has.

The simple fix is to periodically scrub the electrodes with a scotch-brite pad, or very fine steel wool or emery paper.

Of course, you should also make sure your ducts are clean, and while you are at it, scrub your lint filter with a bristle brush. The dryer sheets also form a film over the mesh, causing a measurable reduction in the amount of air that can flow through the filter.

We frequently try to will power our selves out of bed in the morning. However, our minds are obviously functioning at shit levels and making a good decision when you are groggy is near impossible.  The trick is to train your mind so that the response is automatic and not a decision.

1. Pick a song or sound to wake up to.
(Preferably not a song you like, you'll just end up hating it)

2. After you've been up for at least an hour or two, set your bedroom like you would for going to bed.. Close the shades turn the lights off, and whatever else you feel is necessary. 

3. Set your alarm to go off in 5 mins after you've laid down. 

4. When you hear your alarm go off, get up and start doing things  that you might do when actually waking up.

5. Repeat this twice a day for one month and you will never go back to hitting the snooze again.

This works especially well because it is self reinforcing.

I think the better advice here is what I saw someone else write, there is no such thing as a blanket interview set of questions.... And I don't think anyone should use these verbatim. You should be able to spin your own style off of all interview advice, and secure your own job.

1362073335.0,1796,self.LifeProTips,19en8g,"LPT: Fast food alternative for broke college students. 30 bucks a week for excellent, healthy food. ",Unwright,3606,1810,486,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/19en8g/lpt_fast_food_alternative_for_broke_college/,"I've been seeing a lot of posts recently about broke college students and their fast food habits. I'm here to offer a dissenting opinion. Fast food is bad for you, and while easy, eats away at your wallet when you could be having better and more food for less money. 

The trouble of course, comes from budgeting. I spend 60 bucks a week at my local WinCo (most of the time, less) and buy produce. If you know how to use the produce, you can stretch it into far more meals than you could just going to McDonalds and dropping 3.50 on a one-serving nugget salad. You have to know where to shop for this to work. Albertsons/Vons/Whole Foods? Little too pricey. Ralphs/Fred Meyer? Closer to the target. What you're looking for is bottom of the food chain bulk/wholesale food, like WinCo/Smart And Final/ CostCo/BigLots, etc. 

Now, it doesn't take much to cook at home. All you really need is a frying pan, a stock pot, and a knife. You can even get away with just a microwave and a knife, but you have to be more creative about it. Now, eating well is super super easy, but nobody knows how to do it because nobody takes the time to learn. There are TONS of youtube channels out there that teach you how to cook, all you have to do is search for them. If you have a TV, watch the Food Network for a few days and you'll start picking things up. 

Anyway, here's how my budget works. Half of my weekly budget is spent on produce, and honestly, I could get by on just that. 30 bucks of produce a week and ANYONE would be fine. You just have to know what to buy. First of all, never buy anything that's out of season if you can avoid it. Don't buy avocados unless you're in California (and even then, prices go way up out of season) or they're in season. If you buy avocados out of season, the quality will be lower and you'll be paying a substantial markup. ~~Buy those packages of romaine hearts (3.25) (3 per bag), a box of garlic croutons (1.50) and a container of caesar dressing (2.50). 3 (or more if you don't have a huge appetite) big, healthy meals for 7.25.~~ Buy a box of arugula or spinach, and just add a simple vinaigrette and maybe a sliced hard boiled egg. Incredibly simple, and even cheaper than the original caesar salad example which everyone hated.  You can stretch your money even further if you have a pressure cooker or crock pot. 6 dollars of vegetables (onion, carrot, celery, salt/pepper) and 4 dollars of meat (stew beef), throw into a crock pot for 7 hours and you'll have yourself an incredible stew that'll last you for at least 5 meals. 

I'm a broke college student myself, and I can make it work on 30 bucks a week. If I can do it, you can as well, all it takes is some prep time and a little bit of motivation to learn how to cook basics. Steaming, boiling, frying and chopping. If you can do those things, you can eat really well for really cheap. Of course, I would be happy to answer any questions about how to budget and prepare food, because I had to learn all this by myself and want to share food with everyone. 

By request, edit 8: **TL;DR-- if you go to Winco or other bulk wholesaler, you can buy pretty much everything on the cheap, and if you go to YouTube, you can learn how to cook it all. Finally, if you go to Amazon, you can buy a knife, a frying pan, and a stock pot and start eating healthier, more filling, and cheaper food.**

~~Edit: I don't know why something like this would get downvoted. It's bizarre to me that there are people that are so fast-food centric that they'd be aversive to better health and saving money and gaining a practical life skill. I'm not even upset, it's just wildly confusing.~~ Nothing here but us chickens, boss. 

Edit 2: Eggs are cheap. If you know how to fry an egg, you will never go hungry. Buy eggs. 

Edit 3: Avocado clarification: Avoid buying avocados when they're off-season. Any way you slice it, you're paying an obscene amount more than you should for them at any point that isn't the summer. As for the Californians part, that's just a bonus. If you live in California, you're going to pay less for avocados. Even less if it's during the summer. The general point to this edit is to pay attention to seasonal/regional things. If you can get them from nearby and they're in season, you'll pay a TON less. Avoid out of season produce. 

Edit 4: As flohammed_albroseph pointed out, Pasta was missing from this list. Pasta is great because you can dress it a thousand and one ways, and have a different meal every time. Plus, if you buy in bulk, you can get pasta on the cheap. It lasts forever, too. 

Edit 5: As is being pointed out in the comments, the Caesar salad example was a poor choice. While it still is healthier than anything you would find in a fast food joint, it's still unhealthy in relative terms. For broke college students who are struggling to just get chemical energy in an easy and (still, comparatively) healthier way, a caesar isn't a bad choice-- however, it's worth mentioning that there are easier and healthier salads out there which can't be ignored. When in doubt, grilled (or baked, or pan fried, or anything as long as it's cooked) chicken, sliced hard boiled egg, romaine lettuce, and fat free ranch. 

Edit 6: For those just showing up to the party, I strongly recommend reading the comments. Lot of people suggesting healthy, cost-effective meals down there, as well as having high quality discussion in general. 

Edit 7: Let's talk meat. Now, a lot of people assume that meat is expensive. To some degree, that's correct-- but really only regarding quality cuts of beef. Here's the thing, if you don't buy it prepackaged in the meat aisle at your favorite market, you can save some money by visiting a butcher. If you don't have a butcher in your town, the deli counter in a market can still save you some money. Boneless chicken breasts are actually the best choice here. They're the most versatile of any meat when trying to eat healthy and cheap. Sausage (bratwurst and such) is a close second, and the stuff is pretty filling. Cuts of fish like Mahi Mahi and Salmon can fluctuate wildly, so keep your eye on the prices as you shop. If you come in next time and see that it's a buck less per pound, it's time to stock up.

You're a regular guy who drinks Folger's and 7-11 coffee, and you don't think it is half bad.

**Here are a few ways you can make your coffee taste better:**

*Before brewing:*

Add stuff! A pinch of salt will take some of the bitterness out of your coffee and make it taste a bit more smooth, but only add a bit. You can add other stuff too. I used to add a few pinches of ground cinnamon and a dash of vanilla extract to my coffee grounds before brewing to improve taste. *Experiment with it.*

**Quantity:** 4 tablespoons for every 3 cups of coffee. Or get a coffee scoop and it will be two scoops to every three cups. This brews coffee that is a bit dark, and we will get into that if you like lighter coffee. Putting less grounds in when you brew can often ""burn"" the grounds resulting in worse flavor. *If you like lighter coffee*, brew a half of what you normally would and when it is finished, add water to taste. This way you can have lighter coffee with a better flavor.


Lastly, if you already do some all or all of those things, *here are some of the biggest factors that affect coffee flavor*:

**Freshness:** How old is the coffee, and how recently was it ground? Ground coffee ages faster than unground, so if you don't mind the extra hassle, you might think about buying whole bean coffee and grinding before you brew.

**Water:** Tap water will, in theory, brew worse coffee due to it's impurities. Filtered water or distilled water would technically be the best, but may or may not be worth the hassle to you. Using tap water also has more calcium build up over time and will mean that you have to clean your coffee maker more frequently.

**Grind:** How finely or coarsely ground your coffee is *will* affect the flavor, especially if you start buying whole bean and grinding it yourself. There are ""correct"" grinds for different brewing methods, but for a regular brewer, a finer grind will result in darker coffee. Don't overdo it with this, it's easy to brew something undrinkable if you get the grind too far from what it should be, and coffee that s too finely ground will be very bitter.

**Proportion:** We already covered this. If you brew the right amount of grounds to water, you optimize the flavor.

**Edit: French Presses:**

So you really like coffee, and you are ready to try something new. You should pick up a [french press.](http://www.amazon.com/Bodum-Kenya-17-Ounce-Coffee-Press/dp/B000YYODLO/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363459839&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=french+press)

French presses are great because they:

* Are easy to use,

* Easy to clean,

* And make better coffee.

If you are just getting started, all you really need is a *french press*, some ground *coffee* (typically a bit coarser than used with a standard machine, but using the same grind for both won't impact the flavor too badly), and a way to get *water* almost to boiling temperature (200 degrees F is ideal).

You put the grounds in the french press with the lid/plunger removed, and add water until it is full. With the handle of the plunger pulled all the way out, put the lid back on. Let the coffee steep for 2-5 minutes before you depress the plunger (depress the plunger slowly and steadily), and once the plunger is all the way down, you are ready to pour yourself a cup.

When adding the water, two important notes: 
**Don't use boiling water** or you will scorch the grounds, and try to make sure you pour the water so that **all of the grounds get wet**. Usually this won't be an issue, but now and then you'll get pockets of grounds that stay dry. *Post-Script: Many people have suggested stirring your grounds or using a spoon to immerse them into the water, and this will yield better results for your effort.*

You can incorporate the other elements of this post with your french press, though as another user has mentioned, I would recommend not using salt when brewing with a french press, as it is often not necessary.",,False,self,t5_2s5oq,1363476560.0,,,True,t3_1af1so,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1af1so/lpt_make_better_tasting_coffee/,

They respond with a scripted answer of their job tittle and duties and maybe some history of their employer or the field they work in.  They ask you the same question and you take your turn mindlessly telling them about your mundane job.  The conversation peters out because you can both sense no one is in the mood to talk about work. 

But what if you had asked this person, ""What do you like to do?"".   The response from this question will be drastically different.  The person will become excited and talkative while they are sharing what they do for fun or where they like to travel.  Who knows, you may share an interest or hobby that would have remained buried if you had never asked the question.

I know that many conversations will naturally progress from talking about work or school to things like hobbies and passions.  However, first impressions are important and time is of the essence.  When someone is walking away from a conversation with me, I want them to remember me as the guy who is excited and passionate not they guy who is boring and overworked.

TL:DR, Have better conversations when meeting new people by asking them about they like to do and not what they do.

(Disclaimer: If breathing concentration works for you, go for it. But I know that for myself and many other insomniacs it doesn't. For you special and unfortunate few, try daydreaming... at night.)

When your eyelids shut, **don't try not to think**. We all know that leads into the cycle of thinking about trying not to think and thinking about trying to not think about thinking about not thinking... and then it's 7AM and you're a bleary-eyed wreck. If it doesn't work for you, don't do it.

Instead, allow your mind to think. But not about real world problems or people. Daydream. Look at the swirls of color inside your eyelids and watch them morph into new shapes and figures. Let your mind's eye show you whatever fantastic situations and characters it wants to. With your eyes closed, you can see some pretty psychedelic stuff.

It's fun in a very relaxing way, and once you're doing it, you're almost asleep. You're daydreaming, but when you fall fully asleep there are no consequences. The teacher isn't going to call you out. You won't hit your head on your desk. You'll just be asleep.

I like this technique because:

* It's fun
* It stops your mind from racing and lets it walk 
* I see cool psychedelic stuff without being on drugs 
* It relaxes me automatically, more than systematic relaxation methods
* It leads naturally into sleep 

This might sound like a bunch of hippie bullshit to you, but I would urge you to try it before you knock it. No drugs were used in this technique and it got me through an absolutely hellish few semesters at college.

There's the old saying, ""You can't help someone who won't help themselves"", well this tip takes that a bit further ""Don't help someone who won't help themselves""

If you're a helpful person, chances are you find yourself always with a promise to keep, and some people may in fact be taking advantage of the fact that you will always be available for them.

**Protip: Whenever someone asks you for some kind of favour, create a little hurdle for them to do in order to redeem the favour.**  
If they're not willing to cross the hurdle, then what they needed from you was clearly not important enough for them.

For example, if a family member needs tech support for their computer, rather than drop everything and go around to help them - I'll ask them to deliver the computer to me at work. If it's not that important for them, they won't be bothered to bring it to me and I won't have spent my time and resources on it.  
If it's really important enough for them, then they'll do it and I'll happily fix it for them at that point. 

Sometimes it's as simple as 'Write me an email with all the details, and I will follow it up from there'.

You will need a:

-Fitted Sheet

-Flat Sheet

-Comforter

-Decorative Sheet

-2-4+ Pillows

-1 Decorative Pillow

-Bed Skirt (Optional)


1. Start with FRESH linens! http://i.imgur.com/dyapWiel.jpg

2. Throw your fitted sheet over the mattress. Doing diagonal corners first helps even it out and look smooth. Put the flat sheet over it and put it to the top of the bed. Put the comforter on over that, and lay it about 5-6 inches below the flat sheet: http://i.imgur.com/nSs7s4ol.jpg

Make sure there is enough room at the foot of the bed for the comforter to fold under the mattress. 

3. Lay the decorative sheet over the other sheets, making it end about right in between the comforter and flat sheet, the fold it about halfway down the bed on both sides: http://i.imgur.com/WXmd3qxl.jpg

4. Next take your flat sheet and fold it over the comforter: http://i.imgur.com/oSLz7jKl.jpg
 
5. Do the same thing to the comforter over the fold of the decorative sheet: http://i.imgur.com/sRV59Cnl.jpg 

6. Wrap the decorative sheet around the comforter and tuck under. This makes that nice looking design: http://i.imgur.com/sHU8lexl.jpg

7. At the bottom of the bed, pull the comforter and flat sheet like so: http://i.imgur.com/UkxExqTl.jpg

And fold it under so that it hangs over the bottom of the bed: http://i.imgur.com/UIHUWjKl.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/plaSiupl.jpg

And repeat on the other side, tuck the entire end of the comforter under the bed. Make sure this is evenly proportioned and there is no unevenness. 

8. Take the decorative sheet and pull the opposite direction as you did the comforter: http://i.imgur.com/CBbyRTSl.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/GumcmeXl.jpg (Sorry, had to take pictures of another bed because my boss actually showed me a better technique later, where you only tuck under the one side, so that the side of the bed has a nice flat corner to it. Here is what it should look like: http://i.imgur.com/4uUSFail.jpg

9. Take your stripped pillows and put on fresh pillow sheets: http://i.imgur.com/egKl181l.jpg

10. Lay them on the bed, with the decorative pillow right over the blanket bunch: http://i.imgur.com/ltP0Z3vl.jpg

As you can see in these last picture, the bottom of the beds could be more proportionally tucked underneath, and the way you fold the decorative sheet makes an incredible difference in how the bed looks overall. So do the decorative tuck like I mentioned above and your bed will look quite ravishing! 


Now here are a few tips on your next hotel stay, and this may be specifically to the Courtyard Marriot but it is just a reference: 

-We ALWAYS clean the rooms, up and down, before you stay here. All sheets are fresh when you arrive, every single surface of your room has been sanitized. We even go on our hands and knees to manually wash the bathroom floors. You wouldn't believe how much people shed. Sorry if we miss a hair. 

-If you feel skeptical on your room being cleaned, check to see if there are any fingerprints on the toilet flusher.

-At the Courtyard Marriot we only refresh your sheets if you're staying for more than one day if you ask, otherwise we just make your bed up with the same sheets. 

-Last but not least, say hi to the housekeepers! We are the silent heroes of the hotel business and we really do our best to make your stay as inviting as possible. We do not cut corners, we work our asses off, and luckily for me, I love it. We rarely get tipped, but when we do it makes our entire day better knowing that people care about us as much as we care about you!

If you have any more questions on your hotel stays, ask away! 

And for some reason the numbers above start over if you inject a paragraph between them, sorry.

You will typically get a response along the lines of ""there is no such thing"" or ""that's stupid"". This attitude is actually helpful for the trick to work.

Then, with a dead serious look on your face, look them directly in the eyes. Hold their gaze for a second or two and say ""smile"". (I told you it was ridiculously simple)

In my experience they will crack a smile in under 10 seconds even if they don't want to. Once they start to smile they will giggle a bit because your Jedi Mind trick was effective even though they thought it was a waste of time.

Once they smile for a couple of seconds their mood will lighten a bit.

 This trick works best on younger kids but I do it to my wife when she is feeling grouchy and it still works every time. Also, the trick has a cumulative effect. My oldest son who is now 15 will crack a smile every time I tell him I'm going to use my Jedi skills on him if he doesn't cheer up. Any one with teenagers knows this can be particularly useful since teenagers generally have something bothering them.

To be clear, when I say ""grumpy"" or ""cranky"" I do not mean angry or pissed off. This works best on folks that are just a little agitated or mildly frustrated. If they are *really* upset you're on your own.

Use your new found powers wisely.

As they melt, you'll have fresh cold drinking water. +8 cooler tips inside.",SmellsLikeUpfoo,2756,1045,194,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1c7xco/lpt_taking_a_cooler_on_a_long_trip_freeze_a_case/,"Doing this keeps your food drier since you won't have ice melting into a pool of water, and you're not wasting space with ice packs that you can't eat or drink. If you'll be staying somewhere with a freezer during your trip, save the bottles to refill and refreeze.

Normal plastic water bottles won't explode when they freeze because they are built to expand. If you use a different kind of bottle (plastic milk jugs work well), make sure you leave some air space to allow for ice expansion. Don't use glass bottles; there's a breakage risk and they're heavy.

Some people worry about carcinogens or other toxins from freezing or using plastic water bottles. There's [no](http://cancer.about.com/od/cancercausesfaq/f/freezingwaterbo.htm) [need](http://www.jhsph.edu/dioxins) [to](http://www.plasticsmythbuster.org/main-menu/plastics-rumor-registry/freezing-plastic-water-bottles-releases-dioxins-into-water-)
[worry](http://www.fitsugar.com/Bad-Freeze-Disposable-Water-Bottles-148073).

Other tips:

1. **For some cool drinking water at the start of your trip**, freeze some half-full bottles and then fill them up with cold water just before you put them in the cooler.

2. **Make sure you pre-chill all the food** before you put it in the cooler. If your food can be frozen without affecting the quality (milk, most soups, chilis, etc.) and you won't need it right away, freeze it. You can freeze juice boxes. Don't freeze canned beverages or foods.

3. If you have a large chest freezer with enough room, **freeze your entire cooler** for a few hours before loading it. If your freezer isn't that big, you can pre-cool your cooler putting some ice in it for 6+ hours. Dump out the meltwater and dry it out, then load it up.

4. **Pack related items together inside a large ziplock bag**, such as condiments or sandwich ingredients, or everything you'll need for a certain meal. That way it's easier to find everything you need quickly so the cooler is open for shorter times, and the food will stay drier. Throw in a few extra bags to store leftovers. Foods that come in a ""resealable"" package will probably not stay dry if they get submerged in meltwater once they've been opened; put them in a ziplock bag.

5. **Keep your cooler out of the sun, and don't leave it in a hot vehicle** if you can safely store it somewhere else. If it does have to stay in the sun or a vehicle, cover it with a blanket, towel, or reflective emergency blanket. (If you're camping, don't leave your cooler in your tent or outside. Hungry animals and/or people will show up.)

6. **Keep a thermometer in your cooler.** Your food should stay below the ""[danger zone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger_zone_\(food_safety\))"" temperature of 5°C / 41°F. Foods that are potentially hazardous if they spend two or more hours in the danger zone are: meat, fish, poultry, eggs, protein rich foods, dairy products, cut or peeled fresh produce, most cooked foods, shellfish, sauces and gravies, sprouts, and any foods that contain any of these items.

7. If you need your cooler to stay cold longer, and/or to stay cold enough to keep things frozen, **find a dry ice distributor** in your area. (Regular ice will *not* keep things frozen.) Wrap the dry ice block in a towel and put it in your cooler. Be careful when handling dry ice; it's not toxic but if you touch it you will have a bad time.

8. Plastic **egg carrier cases** work well, but they take up a lot of space even when they're almost empty. (Two small carriers is better than one large one!) A cardboard egg carton inside a plastic bag is fine as long as you're careful not to crush it, and if space is needed you can cut off the unused cells. Hard-boiled eggs can be pre-peeled and kept in a ziplock bag. If you're making scrambled eggs, pre-mix them and put them in a tight-sealing container or wide-mouth bottle. It is possible to freeze eggs too, but [with some preparation](https://www.google.com/search?q=freeze+raw+eggs).",,False,self,t5_2s5oq,False,,,True,t3_1c7xco,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1c7xco/lpt_taking_a_cooler_on_a_long_trip_freeze_a_case/,

The first two numbers affect overall width. Those two numbers are the Lens Diameter (how wide each lens is across), and the Bridge Width (The space that sits upon your nose). You will also need to know the length of the arms called the Temple Length. Typically this number is in the 100’s with an average range of 125-150 mm.

NOTE - This does not include your pupillary distance, which is required when ordering glasses online but not included with your prescription information.

To measure your PD:

* Place a mm ruler up against your eyes, resting it on the bridge of your nose. 
* Line up the starting point (0 mm) with your left (or right) pupil. This measurement is only accurate if you are looking straight ahead. 
* Look at yourself in the mirror or have someone else read the ruler. If someone else is reading the ruler they must be at the same height as you. 
* When the 0 mm mark on the ruler is lined up correctly on the left (or right) pupil the mark that lands in the center of the right (or left) pupil is your distance PD.

But holy cow, you really don't need them.  Here are some uses for baking soda, and some other home tips, if you can suggest more, add to the list!

* Black Head remover: Rinse face with warm/hot water, then apply a thick paste of baking soda and water to the entire face or afflicted areas. (I suggest doing a test spot for safety!)  Leave the baking soda on for 3-4 minutes, don't leave it on for any longer because it doesn't need it and you don't want to damage your skin. Rinse with warm water, then for an extra toner, mix apple cider vinegar and water, then wipe your face with a cloth dipped in that.  Finally rinse your face with cool water.

* Grout &amp; Mold Cleaner: Apply a tick paste of baking soda and water to your grout and afflicted mold areas (sink, grout, toilet, shower, etc) and let sit for 2-3 hours. Come back and rinse off. I've found this to be more effective than bleach.

* Stove-top &amp; Oven cleaner: Apply a thick paste of baking soda to the caked on food and burnt stuffs on your stove.  Let sit for 2-3 hours, and come back and wipe away, boom, like new. 

* Homemade furniture polish: Mix Vinegar, Oil and Fresh lemon in a dish, and apply to wooden furniture. Is just as effective as expensive polish and doesn't cost anywhere near as much

* Homemade all-purpose cleaner: White Vinegar, Water, and Fresh Lemon.  Wash everything and this will clean it.  Also good on glass, and you can use newspaper to dry glass as it leaves a streak-free dry.

* You *can* mix baking soda into your toothpaste to help with teeth whitening, but be careful as this isn't the best for your gums, especially for prolonged use.

* Put a touch of baking soda into your bath water to help relieve skin irritations.

* Sprinkle baking soda into cat litter to soak up odor

For example, you might be tempted to write ""Click *File* on the menu bar."" Better instructional syntax is ""From the menu bar, select *File*."" This helps the reader establish the region before the action and not the other way around. 

Continuing the example with an additional step and the outcome: ""From the menu bar, select *File* then *Open*. This launches the 'Open file' dialog box.""

This may seem overly simplistic, but when you delve into complicated procedures, it really helps the learners stay on the path. For example: ""Near the bottom of the screen, in the 'Parameters' section, select the ""Reset on exit"" radio button then click the Filter button (it looks like a yellow funnel).""

* In the case of an accident, you want the headrest to contact your head first, and not your neck. Contacting the next first will actually increase injury to yourself.
* When adjusting for height, the majority of the headrest should sit at ear level, directly behind the drivers head.
* A properly aligned headrest can reduce injury by up to 40%. That number is HUGE.
* If you aren't sure you have the headrest lined up right, have someone else look at the headrest while you're sitting in the car seat to ensure you have the headrest at the right level.

Details inside",thenewyorkgod,2714,1145,728,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/18gvki/lpt_if_you_are_healthy_or_cannot_afford_a_good/,"It is fairly easy to find a health plan that is very affordable because it has a giant deductible. I am talking $5000-$20,000 deductible for $50-$100 a month

Even though you have a giant deductible, which means you will be paying for all your bills until you hit that deductible, you will still benefit from the HUGE discounts the insurance company has negotiated with the hospital/doctors.

For example, I had a PET scan done. The retail charge, the amount billed to the insurance (and how much a non insured patient would be billed) was $8500. My insurance company's ""Negotiated Rate"" was $846. That was the amount applied to my deductible, and the only thing the hospital could bill me for.  

So in short, even though you may be paying for most of your bills, you will benefit greatly from the giant discount insurance companies have, and as long as you go to an ""in network"" provider, they have to honor those discounts. And as a plus, if you do have a catastrophic illness, you will meet your giant deductible pretty quickly and then have the insurance kick in.

*edit*
You also benefit from having access to the insurance company ""rules"" that doctors have to follow. For example, if you walk into a Lab to have blood tested, you will get billed a charge for drawing the blood and a charge for each test done. Under most insurance, the blood draw fee is considered ""incidental"", meaning, its included in the cost of doing the  blood test, so the blood draw fee gets denied, and they cannot bill you for that.

**EDIT**
I just wanted to share a copy of a typical EOB (explanation of benefits) from some MRI's I had. As you can see, I had to pay the entire negotiated rate since my deductible was not met. If I did not have insurance, I would be responsible for the entire amount, or perhaps get a 10-20% discount for paying in full. My discount here is nearly 90%.

20 minutes of extra time to listen to music.

Minor traffic problems won't cause you stress - you're prepared.

Cut the pizzas after delivery using any utensil available (Star Trek Pizza etc.) and you'll notice a huge improvement in quality.

The reason is because when you cook a pizza, the water in each ingredient rises to the top of the pizza and forms a pool of water. The amount of water depends on the type and quantity of ingredients so ingredients like shrimp, pineapple and most meats will have the most water content. When they cut it right after cooking, the water goes into the cuts and the crust absorbs the water making the toppings slide when you take a slice. If you wait until the pizza is at home and in one piece, the water has time to evaporate. Now when you cut it, there is no water and the toppings stay put and everything tastes better because it's not watered down.

Been doing this for years and will never go back.

I feel I have learned a few things about being in and around university life. Here are my best tips. Feel free to add your own.

**Class schedule:**

One of the most important things needed in order to be successful in college life is to have your schedule set in the way that will be most beneficial to your lifestyle. Have trouble getting up in the mornings? DO NOT schedule an 8:00 am class; don't fool yourself into thinking that you will start getting up this semester. The reason universities offer classes at varying times is to allow students with different lifestyles to be successful. Sometimes, however, certain classes (especially courses within a major) are only offered at one time.

Look up where your classes are. Make sure that you have time in between classes to travel, eat lunch, and have some personal time. Don't pack all your classes back to back. Many freshmen in college do this since that is the way they have done school their entire lives. College is different. Give yourself some time in between classes.

Schedule in time to workout, eat, study/do homework, and personal time. This is often neglected. Once you get busy, all the things that you plan on doing ""when I have time"" will not happen. Put them in your planner/calendar.

Diligently use the calendar app on your phone/iPod/tablet/computer or buy a calendar book. Write down your classes and assignments. Write down social engagements as well. You may have been able to remember everything in high school, but there will come a time where your brain is so full that you simply can't remember everything. Write it down!

**Food**

If you are living in dorms and eating dorm food, try new things. Understand that not everything will be mind-blowing, but some things will work well for you. For example: Is it better for you/your body to just have cereal, fruit, and a yogurt for breakfast instead of waiting in the hot food line and getting sausage, bacon, pancakes, etc every morning.

If you live off campus and will be buying your own groceries: make sure to make regular trips to the grocery store. Don't be caught without food, forcing you to get fast food. This seems convenient, but is less healthy and is much more expensive than buying groceries. If you will be on campus all day, make a sandwich and take it with you. This isn't as exciting as getting food out, but you will save hundreds of dollars a year with just a little planning.

**Parking**

Parking on campus can be very, very expensive. Learn where the free places to park are. There are often places only a few blocks away where you can park on the street for free. Be willing to walk a few blocks or take a bus in order to save a lot of money. Parking where I teach costs close to $400 per year if you buy the campus pass. I found a free place to park and I take the bus into campus. It takes me about ten more minutes each way, but saving $400 is worth twenty minutes a day. I use this time to do some reading on my Kindle or answer emails on my phone.

**Bathrooms**

Every campus has good bathrooms and bad bathrooms. The bad bathrooms are usually in the dorms and close to class rooms. The good bathrooms are by administrative offices and offices that bring in lots of guests, such as the International Student Center. Explore. Find the best bathrooms; you'll be glad you did.

Carry a little toilet paper or wipes with you. Not all toilet paper is created equally. Campus toilet paper is some of the worst TP on the planet. I'm not even sure how it qualifies as TP.

**Quarters**

Quarters are one of the most prized commodities in university life. You'll need them for laundry, vending machines, parking, photocopies, and playing quarters (do people still play quarters?!)

**Try New Things**

The first couple weeks of college are very exciting - you meet new people, you are in a new place, and you learn new things. After the first month most people settle into a pattern. Buck this trend and keep things exciting by doing one thing a week you don't normally do. Eat somewhere new - try local places; go to a concert, dance performance, or play (these are often free on campus; go to the theater on campus (if there is one) and see an art film; go to a sporting event of a sport you don't normally watch. Try new things all the time. You may be surprised with what you enjoy.

**Professors**

Professors are generally intelligent people. Don't try to bullshit them. Be honest. Instead of fabricating some story about why you missed a test, be honest. I would rather have a students say ""I screwed up and forgot,"" than making something up. I am more apt to give honest students a second chance that those that I feel are trying to slip one by me.

Get to know your professors. Visit them during office hours if you need help. You may feel like you don't want to bother them, but believe it or not, most professors got into the profession because they want to see people interested in the same subject they are interested in.

Get to know your professors, but keep a healthy professional relationship. Do not call their cell phone or text them. Only use their official university email and office phones.

**Roommates**

Communicate about schedules before school starts. There is nothing worse that waking up for the first day of classes and have someone be in the shower when you need it. Try to have a good idea of their schedule so that you don't step on each other's toes.

Clean up after yourself. Most roommate trouble starts with dishes left around the apartment or in the sink. Take a few seconds to clean up after yourself; it goes a long way.

Do something unexpected for your roommates once a month. Cook them a meal, pick up something at the grocery store because you know they like it, etc. 

**Common Campus Courtesies**

Take off your headphones when people are talking to you.

Open a door for someone.

Keep your head up and smile at those around you. Too many students walk around with their head pointed at the ground.

Please, for the love of all that is holy, let people off the bus before you get on.

Help someone that needs help in a class.

Help someone that is handicapped - open a door, carry books, etc. 

Throw your garbage in the garbage can and recycle when possible. It's your campus and your home for the next several years.

These are just a few thoughts. Please leave your own in the comments. Good luck going back to school!

**EDIT:**

**Textbooks**

DO NOT buy textbooks at the university bookstore if possible. Try the local competitor or Amazon. 

Take classes with a roommate and split the cost of a book.

Check to see if the library has your text. I found this out my junior year of undergrad. The library had a copy of every class I took. I was the first to check the book out (a week or two before classes) and kept renewing the book throughout the semester.

**EDIT 2:**

I know I got the acronym wrong. Thanks to the eighty people that pointed it out.

**EDIT 3**

Forgot a big one. Change your sheets every week. If you are expecting ""company,"" change them that day.

**EDIT 4**

Several responses have been along the line of ""LPT: Don't go to college."" I think we can be more accepting than that. May I propose a new method of thinking when it comes to education?

Get the education you need for the career you want.

If this means medical school, then do it. If this means enlist in the army, don't go to college. If this means you want to be a college professor, grad school it is. Have the courage to try to live your dream. College/university isn't for everyone, but for those with specific goals in mind (that would be benefitted by a college degree), go to school and work hard.

Edit: Also why I recommend side tie bikini bottoms for women who don't buy swimsuits very often. Side tie will help you control the tightness as the swimsuit wears. 

Edit2: FOR EVERYONE, PLEASE DO NOT DRY YOUR SWIMWEAR IN THE DRYER. The heat will fuck hard core with the lycra (pulling, twisting, thins your fabric).

Thanks all for making this a highly visible tip. My message as a first responder (firefighter): If you're not first aid trained, **book in to get trained, now!** It's easy, doesn't take long (a weekend at most) and gives you the skills to save lives. Emergencies happen without warning, I know from experience. Knowing what to do and how to delegate tasks during an emergency will dramatically improve the victims chances of survival. 

**Get trained. Do not put it off. You do not want to regret putting off your first aid course if a friend or a loved one needs your skills and focus.**

Regarding liability: **check your local laws** as this varies by state and country. Almost all jurisdictions have 'good will' or 'good samaritan' legislation that waives liability for assistance rendered in an emergency. If in doubt: **always call an ambulance/render assistance if able**.

**First aid trainers**

Orangered me more trainers if you know of any.

--------------------------------------------

Seems strange, though is true. The rhythm beat in [""Stayin' Alive""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_izvAbhExY) is the correct rate of compression to give to a heart attack victim.

Play the song in your head, or get someone to play it on their phone for you **after you've asked how far the ambulance is away** - this both ensures that someone has actually *called* an ambulance **and** gives you a estimated time of paramedics arrival. 

One other thing: **press hard**, with **locked arms**. CPR shown on TV shows and movies where the first aider's arms bend during compressions is **incorrect** and is most definitely not hard enough.

Effective compressions are 1/3rd of the way into an adult victims chest. Don't be afraid to break bones. A few cracked ribs are a much better alternative to death.

Keep calm and keep compressing until paramedics take over.

*Comb
*Listerine strips
*Small sample tubes of my most frequently worn colognes
*Chapstick
*small mirror
*$30 (in case of calling a cab home, etc)
*Whisp (single use toothbrush thing)
*Nail file
*Tissues
* Allergy meds, tylenol, medications
*Box of condoms (because you really cant cary more than one in a wallet)
*Bottle of wine (in the trunk): you never know when you are going to be invited home with someone...

Ladies, obviously would probably want a makeup compact, etc, but I would assume you have purses for that :-)  I'd love input on what a woman might want in there though.  Having this stuff has saved me many times I was running late, and it is always a good confidence boost to check yourself right before you dive into a date.  Other helpful things from my other car kits that have been helpful are:
*flashlight (lady looses an earring, etc)
*gauze pad (for a lady wearing new, unbroken-in shoes)
*umbrella, in case of inclement weather

However, they do take some time to complete work.

**Boil vinegar.**

A few weeks ago over at a friend's house, I was cooking dinner.  Part of it was a Balsamic reduction, which I needed a lot of (many people).  We'd had the windows and doors of the house open all day because it was warm, and there were probably 10-15 flies meandering around the down stairs as well as the upstairs.

As soon as the vinegar fumes hit the air, they starting dropping out of the sky like they'd been sprayed by raid.  They weren't stunned, they were dead.  As the fumes spread, the ones upstairs died too.

Today, I came home from work to find a small cloud of horse flies in my living room (probably about 10 of them, but those assholes are huge).  I opened the back door to see if they'd go OUT, but more came IN.  My neighbor's garbage was apparently infested.

I figured I was having pasta and beef for dinner anyway, so I'd see if the vinegar worked again.  I started simmering some Balsamic... and lo and behold, they all died within 10 minutes.  I swept them out the door.

Yes, your house is going to smell like vinegar for a few hours, but that's easily aired out.

**TL;DR Simmer or boil vinegar on your stove.  The fumes will kill flies almost immediately.**

1335545168.0,1427,self.LifeProTips,svi2a,"I've worked at grocery stores for my entire adult life from stocking shelves, to brokerage sales, to distribution and I learned a little trick to buying ""store brand"" items. [x-post from /r/frugal]",,2535,1108,422,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/svi2a/ive_worked_at_grocery_stores_for_my_entire_adult/,"**Hey, [/r/lifeprotip](/r/lifeprotip) -ers, I was told to cross post this here, I don't read this subreddit often, so if this is not acceptable or bad material, please accept my apologies and have the mods remove it**

So, I've always worked with fresh departments (meat, deli, bakery, produce) so that is where my example is going to come from. 

Store brand items are rarely made by 'cheaper' companies in grocery chains.  Usually a large brand will repackage the store brand item so they can get more items and facings in the store and preferential treatment from corporate buyers when selling new items (or even discounted/waved slotting fees, which is huge).  The ingredients of the store brand item won't be EXACTLY the same as the name brand BUT it will still have the same level of quality, which is what a lot of people are worried about when buying store brand.

OK, on to the trick.  I'm sorry if most people already know this in [/r/frugal](/r/frugal) **(now [/r/lifeprotips](/r/lifeprotips)!)** but no one I have talked to has, so I'm sharing it.

Lets say I'm having a cookout and need to buy bratwurst but the high quality Johnsonville Brats are 2 dollars more expensive per pack than the store brand and I need to keep prices low but keep the quality of my meats for the BBQ high (so my friends don't think I'm a cheap ass... but the PBR might give that away...).

[Here is a picture of a package of Johnsonville Brats](http://i.imgur.com/phH8p.jpg) Do you see the small circle above ""Previously handled frozen for your protection, refreeze or refrigerate""?  That is the serial number for the factory/slaughterhouse where the meat was packaged (in this case 34225).  **edit 3** FDA regulation, all meat products are marked with serial number so you know where they came from in case of contamination.

Even the biggest names only have handful of places that will package their product and (usually) only one that will handle the grocery chains in your region.  That location will also handle/package the store brand items.  

SO, match the serial number on a name brand meat product that you know to be quality with the store brand meat product of a similar type.  If they are the same, you have found who actually makes the store brand item.  It takes a little while to find out exactly who is making what, but it will save you money if you are looking for quality along with low prices.

**edit** Someone in [/r/frugal](/r/frugal) said this was like excessive coupon cutting, meaning that is wasted time for not much money saved.  I disagree, if you pick up a meat item weekly it really isn't hard to look at the store brand 5 feet away and compare serial numbers.  If the same company you are loyal to makes it!  Awesome, you can buy store brand instead and enjoy the same quality.

**edit 2** P.S. I've worked with 8 grocery chains (actually in their stores/offices) in 9 states in 3 regions, and the best?  Who has the best prices for the most quality product AND treats their employees the best?  Trader Joes, hands-fucking-down the best god damned operation I've seen in these United States of America.


**edit 4** Ok, I hate when redditors do that whole ""I'm going to edit this popular post and be total douchebag"" thing.  But I just created [/r/grocerystores](/r/grocerystores) and I'll be updating it regularly with grocery store reviews, hopefully more posts like this one, and other tips, also a place to bitch about working in a grocery store and making connections.  Join me or don't, I just really think it would be good for me to actually start documenting what I've found out about the grocery industry (as banal as I'm sure some of you think it is, it is my life and I'm rolling with it).

Also, if you decide to have a bath, pour in a capful and walk out with the silkiest skin imaginable. Bonus: you learn what it's like to be spaghetti.

As [requested](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/11j1o6/violentacrez_comes_back_from_the_dead_as_mbrutsh/c6mx7yi), here is some information on how to avoid being d0xed.  This has happened to multiple redditors recently, with Violentacrez being the most famous example, but other users of NSFW subreddits, and SRS, have also been d0xed in the last 72 hours, even though that hasn't been widely publicized.  I mostly lurk on this site, but I see this recent d0xing trend as a major problem.  I hope the comments on this post deal mostly with how to harden one's online profile, instead of degenerating into ""who's right"" in any of the recent dramafests.

As a first point, my title is a lie.  If you do anything online, there is always a trail.  An entity with enough resources, time, and interest can always document your personal identifying information (known as d0xing in hacker slang).  So, for example, I think it is safe to assume that the NSA can connect any username I've ever used on any site to my real identity.  They may not have bothered to do it yet, because I doubt I'm a person of interest to them, but they likely have all the data stored to connect the dots if they needed to.

Most users of this site aren't political activists though.  They are people who would probably prefer that their employers/parents/church not know about their requests for relationship advice, their comments about sexual practices, or the humiliating story they posted on Ask Reddit.  I'm going to provide some information and key links that will (probably) protect you to that extent.  The Reddit Admins might still be able to figure out who you are, but a nosy fellow Redditor won't.

General Tips:

1. **Google every username you've ever used.**  (Also use Bing, Yahoo, Ask, etc.  I'll just say Google from now on.)  This includes handles on message boards, IM, and dating sites.  Close or make private all profiles that come up, so an attacker cannot cross-reference from site to site to get more information about you.

2. Delete your MySpace, Facebook, LinkedIn or at least set them to ridiculously private.  This includes setting it so that people cannot find you through search or search-by-email.  If you need LinkedIn for work, invite people directly.  Don't allow your identifying information to be visible to friends (or at least premium members).  [LinkedIn is a hacker's dream tool](http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/12/technology/linkedin-hackers/index.htm).  The same is true about Facebook.

3. Use multiple online usernames, and compartmentalize what each is for.  For example, on Reddit, use one username to create and moderate subreddits, another to surf NSFW content, and another to post in the default subs.  Also, it's best to scrub your content history regularly, and/or to throw away old usernames and start anew on a regular schedule, such as the first of every month.  These usernames should not be obviously connected to one another (""name001"" and ""name 002"" would not be a good choice).  You can always PM your friends saying that you're using the new name, so people you trust will know.  To make switches from name to name easier, I recommend installing a [password manager](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2381432,00.asp).

4. [Remove your personal information](http://www.howtovanish.com/2011/02/remove-personal-information-from-the-internet/) from the major search engines and databases.  There are a lot more than Google, including some you've never heard of, like Spokeo.  This link provides a list containing most of them.

Good luck, and stay safe.

That way, when the annoying thought comes back around (and believe me, it will) you can get some use out of it. Hope it helps!

But there are other very useful purposes for it. A few I know off hand is if you are on a friends computer or on a Mac at the apple store, open up incognito to do your facebooking or tweeting. Also you can check your email among other sites that require a login. This way, when you close the browser, it's as if you were never there. 

Popular belief (or fact) is that airlines charge you more if they see you browsing flights before you actually book one. Open up incognito mode if you want to browse flights and you'll be smooth sailing, ...errr or flying.

Please feel free to name other sites or reasons, besides porn, incognito can be utilized to its full potential!

---------------------------------------
Edit2: Incognito is a feature for the Google Chrome Browser. Almost every (if not every) browser has this feature but it is called other names. Firefox has inPrivate Browsing, IE has Private Browsing, etc. 

---------------------------------------
Edit1.3: List of Uses for Incognito mode:

* First and foremost, porn

* Log into a second website (second login for reddit, gmail, gf's facebook, etc.)

* ~~Check amazon prices (apparently they raise the price? Needs verification)~~

* View facebook and other social media on public computers (Read the blurb at the bottom)

* View email on public computer (Samsies as above)

* Quick logout when you exit the browser.  Useful for banks, emails, facebook, etc.

* Check airline prices (without computer saving your cookies thus jacking up airline costs (yes this is true, there is multiple articles around reddit that talks on this subject including LPTs and AMAs to name a few))

* Disabling Extensions on the fly for sites that don't cooperate (News for example)

* News sites like after you hit the article limit on NY times, the paywall on the Daily Telegraph, Hacker News has a anti-procrastination time delay

* If you want an unbiased google search result (google tailors based on previous searches)

* Online shopping for SO or friend that uses the computer so they can't see what you got them

* Double printing coupons.  (Some sites monitor if you have been there)

* Use it on a friends laptop to keep the out of your history

* See how your facebook looks to the public

* View LinkedIn profiles without people knowing you visited them

* Private browsing in general


------------------------------------------
Edit3: Gee Wilikers there are a lot of comments. I'll update the above lists after work. (Central Standard Time)

------------------------------------------
Edit4:  And lastly yes, watch out for keyloggers, malware and traffic monitors.  For top notch security, type your password in sections by using your mouse move to locations within the password... or use the on screen keyboard (start-&gt;run-&gt;osk).  These are extra precautions on truly 'public' computers to beat 'primitive' keyloggers.  (see u/WK_of_Angmar and u/SanityInAnarchy 's reply for more details.  I have not verified this)  Also note that your ISP still knows the sites you access and the IT guy, in some cases, will too.

These are just some examples, but I hope this helps make this year ∞ times better than the past!

One other thing I thought of was telling your resolution to someone else that will be excited for you! This will be great and helpful because when you are plannin on taking that extra slice of cake, you'll remember that so-and-so will be askin you about it later, and you might re-think your decision. And when you tell so-and-so that you did re-think your decision, they are goin to be happy for you which will only lead to better decisions later on! :)

Any ways, after I wake up tmrw, I'll look for more subreddits that seem interestin / useful! And to all of of you that are sayin thanks, its greatly welcomed!

Although there are alternatives: 

For your PC, you can change the colours with a free program called [F.lux](http://stereopsis.com/flux/). Apparently this works on iOS devices also.

I use a combination of Lux and Tasker to automatically turn my phone into night mode at night. This isn't free, but I'm sure there are free alternatives. [Lux Screen Adjuster on the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vito.lux&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS52aXRvLmx1eCJd) and [Tasker on the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm5ldC5kaW5nbGlzY2guYW5kcm9pZC50YXNrZXJtIl0). These don't take long to get used to either, once your eyes adjust this hardly seems different to looking at a regular screen.



Here's some other suggestions:

* Using a Kindle, or something similar with an e-ink screen

* [Using gaming glasses with a yellow tint (My friend swears these work)](http://www.gunnars.com/) edit: According to /u/darkstrategy, a 5 dollar pair of shooting glasses will do the same. 

* Reading a book, if you're into that kind of thing

* Going to bed an hour earlier with some music on, with a sleep timer so you don't have to worry about it.

* Keeping lighting to a minimum, I use a soft glow lamp with a yellow globe if I need one when it's late. The whole point here is to keep colours that are a high kelvin away from your eyes (4300k is great) edit: [C3 says 2700k is better, and he explains his reasoning.

I'd love to hear some more suggestions too! Especially if you know a free Android alternative, to help others out.

Also, I know the rules say no product recommendations, but I feel this really fits into the category of a LPT.

I would like to tell you about a way that can increase your happiness, day by day.
For a long time, i have been feeling unhappy about my life. 
However, i recently decided that it was time to turn the unhappiness, into happiness.

The tools i used for this was a pen and a block of paper.
Every night, before going to sleep, i sit down by my bed table, and i write down the good things that have happened to me during the day.
I have started writing down even the smallest event, as long as they made me feel happy, or good about myself.

An example: 
2. March 2013
- Played the guitar again
- Had a pizza with my good friend
- Had a good talk with mom on the phone

You can put down as many things on the list as you'd like.
However there might be days where you feel unhappy, and you dont feel that you have anything to write at all.
Whenever this happens, read the list of good things you have written so far.
By every day there will be more added to the list, and there will be more good things to help you cheer up again.
Be careful that it doesnt just turn into a diary. Write only the things that made you feel happy and good about yourself.

I have been doing this for 3 months now, and it has made me a lot happier, and helped me when i was feeling down.
I hope that this can be a tool to help any of you that feel unhappy, to become happier.",,False,self,t5_2s5oq,False,,,True,t3_19jqha,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/19jqha/a_way_to_increase_your_happiness_day_by_day/,

I adapted to the horrible tasting stuff, the method where you leave one alone, then another, etc until you've stopped. That never worked for me, because I started doing it subconsciously. It took the proper motivation for me to get my head down and think. For me, as a metalhead, it was the Download festival 2012. Holy fuck, I couldn't miss that. So my parents said they'd buy me a ticket. If I stopped once and for all. Fuck. 
So I came up with the solution. I thought, I can't rely on substances, I can't count on my ability. So the only thing left was to remove the chance. The next day I bought some medical tape and bound up every finger. I didn't just bite the nails, I had removed the skin on every finger up to the mid-joint. (It was vile) I replaced it daily, wore gloves when I could.  Once you remove the ability to bite, you remove the habit. I stopped. But I wasn't convinced, so I began to remove the tape finger by finger over the course of a few weeks. I didn't bite them. For the first time in 19 years I could cut my nails. The Whole process took about a few months, then a few weeks for the unravelling. I couldn't tell if my parents were happy or sad. I'd done something they'd been trying to do for years, and now they had to fork over £200 for a ticket. I was extremely grateful, and download was fucking awesome.
So that's it really. Get yourself some motivation and some tape. 

EDIT: well this has taken off, many thanks for the congrats and the extra knowledge for the biters still fighting the battle. I'm gonna throw in other things that have been known to help and i may or may not have done. 

-Hypnotherapy    I was about to have this done, not sure if it's a definite fix, but may be different for people. A gentleman tried it below and i don't think he had a massive effect. And it's quite expensive, so this would be a last resort. 

-Rubber band technique-   Another gentleman (JC_BOOM_) turned himself into the pavlovs dog of the biting world, he put a band round his wrist and snapped it everytime he was biting. Untill he associated the whole thing with pain, a few relapses,but putting the band on seems to be the trick.

-getting your friends/family/co-workers to kick your ass into submision-  I tired this, telling everybody to punch you if you're biting. It didn't work for me, but worth a shot!

-meth- juhesihcaaa has stated that a woman in a gas station told her she stopped after she took meth. Every      little helps I guess. (I'm not actually condoning drug use)

-Chew something else- keep yourself occupied, toothpick, chewing gum, cats teeth. Whatever takes your fancy. it keeps your mouth occupied. 

TL;DR
Get tape. Tape yourself. Unravel slowly. A few months. Stop. Be a badass.

EDIT: ok people there seems to be people who don't get why I'm doing this, so ill explain it up here... I do not condone breaking the law. Pay attention when your driving. Don't run a red light. However, I have seen fines up to a thousand dollars for running a red light, that's rent money. That's food on the table. Im not trying to help people break the law or do it more often, I'm trying to help people not get robbed blind by our government.

Alright here it is people. I'm a cop. I think that tickets have turned into a way, for the most part, for the city/state to tax the citizens. That's not the role of a police officer. So ill give advice where I can on how to avoid getting them. A red light camera ticket. Prevention is best. If you know you are about to run a red light on accident, look away. Cover your face. Do whatever you can to make your face unrecognizable to the camera. The burden is on the court to prove that it is you. When you get the ticket (and you will) just state that there is not sufficient evidence to prove that it is you in the vehicle. (if your face is covered/blurred there is not) they will ask you who was in the vehicle. You do not have to tell them. The burden is on the court to prove your guilt, not for you to prove your innocence. Also another handy way is if your. Married and you and your spouse drive different cars, register the opposite spouse's name to each car. They issue the ticket to the registered owner. If your married and your spouse is the registered owner of the car you normally drive, you can just say that you are clearly not the registered owner and get out of it that way also.

If anyone has any other questions on how to get out of petty things like traffic tickets..let me know ill try to help

Then either you wash them straight after use, or you're forced to clean them before use.

This might sound obvious and not worthy of being a 'pro tip' in theory; but in reality it's a practice that's difficult to execute at first, as when you're hungry or thirsty it's too easy to take the easy-option, but if you train your self to observe the rule, it becomes genius.

We fall into grooves living with others, of always getting a new plate, or a new bowl out of the cupboard every single time. When living alone with no-one to wash the dishes to appease, we get sloppy and let things pile up until we're forced to tidy and clean; this can lead to catastrophe, cockroaches love dat standing water...

If when living alone you stick by the rule that the plate you use is the only plate you use, and the fork and spoon that you eat with are your only mistresses, you save your self so much fucking hassle.

If you are copying class notes or anything similarly important, it might take you hours and it is important to keep going. 

I always get annoyed when the pen stops writing, but not because its out of ink, it just starts to sort of slide, but it won't write. The ink simply won't come out. 

**LPT:** *put a piece of paper underneath your hand, to make sure that your arm does not rest on the exact same paper you're writing on*. See, when your hand comes into contact with the paper, it transfers some of the natural grease and minerals, which cover our skin. The ball inside of the pen simply starts to slide on top of that grease, not revolving, thus not getting more ink out. 

This isn't based on any research or anything. This is just my observation from college years. 

**TL;DR:** put a piece of paper under your writing hand to make sure that the hand does not come into contact with the paper you're writing on. The paper is less filthy and prevents pen sliding. 

**Edit:** I'm glad that some people found this to be useful! Keep writing:)

Also, yes I'm aware of laptops and other useful tech, but sometimes it just feels like you want to actually write something down instead of typing.

I've been struggling with constant fatigue (pretty much every day) for the past few years and I decided that it has to do with my lifestyle, so I made some changes - I've changed my diet (now paleo), started working out every other day of the week (cycling, swimming, cardio) but nothing seemed to help in a significant way.

Fast forward to around 2 months ago, I've had my routine check-up, including an eye exam. I've been told that I have astigmatism, and that I'll have to wear glasses to correct my vision.

Ever since I received the glasses (and actually started wearing them :) ), the fatigue subsided. Fast forward to now (around a month and a half since I got my glasses), and my life has almost turned around 180 degrees - I feel as if I'm reborn. No more headaches, no more fatigue ever since I wake up, no more oversleeping, I even stopped drinking coffee/yerba mate. Life's good :)!

I bet you're thinking ""My vision isn't THAT bad"" - Hell, mine isn't bad either, I'm only at -0.5 and -1, it's mostly the astigmatism that screws me up.

**tl;dr** If you're feeling tired very often, get your eyes checked. Your bad eyesight might be the culprit!


EDIT: To those dismissing my tip.. it's just friendly advice.

I say ""real"" because I first want to warn you about a quick fix technique that does NOT work.

The ""wrap around"" technique is where you stay up all night until, say, 10pm the next day. You force yourself to go to bed at 10pm from then on.

This doesn't work. If you stay up all night you get ""sleep debt"" and you  will end up requiring more sleep in the following days to pay back your sleep debt. Sleep debt is a real phenomenon that has been discussed in academic journals. FYI If you oversleep one night you cannot expect to be able to sleep less the next night. There are no rollover hours. But if you don't get enough sleep one night you WILL have to repay those hours over the course of the following nights. This is why the wrap around technique is a myth. I have tried it over 10 times and failed over 10 times.  

**HERE IS THE QUICK FIX**

Stop eating. Right now. *Fast* until the time when you want to wake up, say, 7am. Go to sleep whenever you want but force yourself to wake up at 7am. 

At 7am go to a window where you can see the sun and look at it (not directly! but get the sun in your field of vision). Then eat a complete, healthy breakfast.

You can survive 3 weeks without eating so it won't do you any permanent damage to fast until 7am.

Your circadian rhythm is mostly affected by two things:

1.) Sunlight

2.) Meal timings

Even ancient roman philosophers (I'm thinking of Epictetus the Stoic) said that one must first control his eating habits, and then he must control his sleeping habits, (then he controls his sexual desires!)

I have found it relatively easy to force myself to eat once at 7am, and not at all after dinner time. It's easier to change your eating habits than your sleeping habits. Once you change your eating habits your sleeping habits become much easier to change as well.

Also consider if you are getting enough exercise.


**TL;DR** Don't try to stay up all night. Stop eating right now and fast until your target wake-up time. Eat a large healthy breakfast and get some sunlight in your retina at that time. Repeat until sleep schedule has been fixed, it will take only** 1 or 2 days.**

*****

**EDIT** I read the comments and I would like to add some of the things that helpful redditors have mentioned.

Yes, you must force yourself to wake up in the morning. But the point is that it is *easier* to do this if you are hungry and *even easier* as the days go on (by day 3 you might wake up with no alarm clock naturally feeling refreshed). After the first morning your belly will wake you up naturally, expecting a meal. Just like how my cat wakes me up in the morning expecting a meal.

It's winter time so the sun rises late. Daylight savings times helps this however. If you still must rise before the sun consider buying a sun lamp.

Specifically BLUE light is what wakes you up. But any bright light source will stimulate your circadian cycle.

This technique is less effective if you body is used to sporadic meal times.

This technique is consistent with the old adage ""Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dine like a pauper."" However you might want to consider reading [this article](http://www.leangains.com/2010/10/top-ten-fasting-myths-debunked.html) that attempts to debunk the adage.

Redditor ""ejactulator"" claims to be a physician and PhD student and vouches for this technique. He says he does it when he travels around the world to avoid jet lag. That is also how I learned of this technique. Instead of using it to cure jetlag, I applied it to cure a fucked up sleep schedule for any other reason.

Avoid using the internet or watching tv in the hour or two before you go to bed. Find another activity to do during that time that does not require looking at a bright screen.

Consider Melatonin supplements but they are not for everyone. If you suspect your body might not react well then talk to your doctor first.

1352868197.0,1248,self.LifeProTips,135z5u,LPT: How to write an essay quickly and efficiently!,,2481,1233,192,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/135z5u/lpt_how_to_write_an_essay_quickly_and_efficiently/,"I am a history major at a large university. Writing papers is practically all of my school work. I receive As on all my essays, except for the one time I got ten percent knocked off for forgetting the title (remember the title, please). Over time, I have discovered ways that you all may or may not know. This is obviously for research-based essays.

*I have made edits based on popular suggestions!*

* First of all, know your professor or the AI grading it. Write papers according to what they want.

* Organize your sources. If you are given a list of sources you can use, determine which book is a primary source or secondary source. The secondary source book (typically the textbook of the class if that is allowed) will be the basis of your essay. You will compliment it with primary sources and then embellish with a few points from lecture. *IF* your textbook is a real textbook (a book intended for covering a subject and published by a textbook publisher), then you never use it. If the books for your class are scholarly works by an individual (or sometimes two or three) professionals in the field, then you can use it. (That was what I meant by textbook).

* When you write, dig through the book for all the chapters covering your subject. Start off with that secondary source book and write from it. Go back and add in the primary sources or additional secondary sources, then embellish with lecture points. Focusing on one book initially helps you to get the point across and then you can go back and elaborate or add sources to get the page/word count.

* ~~Use your lectures as a source! Professors and the TAs that will most likely be grading the essay like seeing that you paid attention in class.~~ Only do this if the professor asks for it or you know it will be fine.

* If you cannot use your textbook, but you can use your own sources, find another book similar to your textbook. Mostly, this works for history papers. Can't use your *A History of the Roman People* textbook for the paper? Then use *History of Rome*.

* Do not waste time on footnotes when you are writing your essay. Instead, do this: If I am quoting from an author named Ward on page 232, type (w232). After you are done, go back and do your footnotes. Obviously, if you are using another author with the same last initial, make sure the include the first initial so you do not get confused and misattribute a quote. While trying to figure out the footnotes in Word, you can lose your momentum or a great idea.

* As for the dreaded length requirements: learn to be eloquent. I like to write fantasy stories, so this is a developed skill. Right now, I am being concise for obvious reasons.  Unless your professor allows it, do not quote entire paragraphs from your sources word for word. This makes it too obvious that you are doing your paper last minute. Instead, summarize what you read in your own words and then put in your citation after you have completed summarizing. This is the easiest way to gain length, since a research essay is just a collection of sources regurgitated into a coherent paper.

* Lastly, choose a topic with widely available information that is easy to understand. I was given a list for my Roman history paper with topics such as slavery, economics, and wars. While I love studying Roman warfare, it is a broad topic that is often confusing. Instead, I went with religion and culture. Why? The information is straightforward and easy to find. The aforementioned book *A History of the Roman People* has chapters dedicated to those subjects divided from the rest of the information, making it incredibly easy to find.",,False,self,t5_2s5oq,1352915955.0,,,True,t3_135z5u,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/135z5u/lpt_how_to_write_an_essay_quickly_and_efficiently/,

(Details inside).,Ihaveastupidcat,1680,435,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1dz4el/lpt_avoid_driving_over_plastic_grocery_bags_when/,"First off let me say, be safe out there! Avoid swerving dangerously at the sight of a bag. Check your mirrors and carefully change lanes to go around the bag. If you run one over watch your rear view mirror to see if the bag passed under your car and is still in the roadway. If not and its safe to do so, pull over and look under your car in a parking lot. 

As stated I am a professional mechanic and I see at least once a week a car come in with damage caused by a plastic grocery bag. Most people are completely unaware they hit the bag or that it was causing problems. 

Here is a list of problems plastic bags can cause. 


* Getting sucked into the drive belts and wrapping themselves around alternators, AC compressors, pulleys, etc. When they do this it can cause anything they are wrapped around to fail, leading to expensive repairs, and even a risk of fire. 


* Getting wrapped around half axles and destroying the axle boot and leading to axle failure. This is really common, the bag gets sucked up into the spinning axle and then wraps itself tightly around the rubber CV joint boot, and ends up tearing the boot allowing all the axle grease to escape and destroying the CV joint/axle. 


* Getting stuck to the exhaust system components and melting, causing burning smells inside the vehicle and sometimes fires. This is another really common problem. I have even seen a bag become stuck to the exhaust, catch fire, and then burn up the wiring on the O2 sensor. That resulted in a check engine light, and a costly repair for the vehicle owner. 


* Getting sucked into the torque converter, clutch area. This is pretty uncommon, but I have seen at least one example of this. 


This is just a quick short list. There are many more issues these bags can cause. And often its not cheap to repair and can lead to dangerous situations for the vehicle owners. 


So next time you are driving and see a bag floating across the roadway, try and avoid it.

For clarification since there seems to be comments about pills inside straws...

1. Put the pill on the middle/back of your tongue.

Number 1 in LPT. Cool.

Many of you are clearly going out of your way to askew its meaning. Most people associate the phrase ""walking around like he/she owns the place"" as a negative, that the person has a sense of entitlement to do whatever they want to because they are the owner. That's just being a douche. 

Think of a business you would like to run, or a place you would love to live in. How would you treat it? Would you act like a dick to your customers or to your tenants? Or would you treat everyone there with respect and a smile, because treating them that way creates a friendlier, more welcoming environment and stronger relationships?

**EDIT**

*tl;dr*

*My opinions and responses to several comments*

ok, so a bunch of people are saying ""get a gun"".  I'm an American, so that sentiment does make sense to me, but not every region of the world is going to feel that same way. Even here, there are plenty of people that won't/can't buy a firearm, that do have access to a vehicle.

While I think that a gun can provide a good sense of security, who is going to start shooting through doors and walls as soon as they hear something?  The people that say ""Me!"" are the ones, in my opinion, that shouldn't own a firearm.  You had be very damn sure that you want someone dead before you start pointing guns at them. 

Setting off a car alarm won't accidentally kill your neighbor, your spouse, your pet, or your kids sneaking back into the house.

I also agree that a home alarm system would be a better solution, but those aren't always available. They can be cost prohibitive, logistically problematic (I don't have a land line - things may have changed, but this used to be a requirement), or just plain not allowed. 

The people that say your neighbors are going to hate you if you do this... No they're not. If you're not an idiot, you're not going to be setting off the car alarm every 15 minutes, every night. If you are that kind of person, I hate to break it to you, but your neighbors probably already hate you. 

This LPT was just something that I saw on Facebook, shared through a local police department's page. This is not an an excuse to forgo all common sense, but I really was thinking of the people that may have reasons to be scared. 

Single parents? If you don't have kids, you might not get it, but you never want to leave them parentless. 

Alone and recovering? When do you feel the most helpless, if not when you're sick or hurt?

I'll even through out there, past victims of crimes. If someone has been traumatized by a crime, there's a good chance they'll be afraid of it happening again.

Maybe, just maybe, this would help them sleep through the night. 

Oh yeah, realistically, don't be a hero. Call the cops. Even if you're not sure, they'll come out and check it out. Keep your doors and windows locked at night, and if you can, keep an exterior light on.",,False,self,t5_2s5oq,1356877907.0,,,True,t3_15nab1,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/15nab1/lpt_if_you_live_alone_or_otherwise_feel_unsafe/,

I've tried just about every product on the market (aside from prescription) and never had any luck with any of them. 


I started doing some research, and found the Oil Cleansing Method, or OCM. It has been 2 years now since I started, and I have not had a single pimple since. So I thought I'd share with you, reddit!




**How it works**

We all know our skin produces natural oils. These oils hydrate and protect your skin. OCM works by daily replacing dirty oil with clean oil, rather than stripping the oil from your skin completely (which is what common cleansers do). 


**How to**


To make your oil cleanser you will need 3 things: Coconut oil, Castor Oil (found in the laxatives section of your pharmacy), and a clean bottle to store it in.


Start with this ratio: 90% coconut oil, 10% castor oil mixed in your storage bottle.


Every night before bed, massage a quarter size amount into your skin. Next, take a clean wash cloth and wet it with hot water (don't scald yourself, however!), and gently wipe your face clean. Dry, and you're all done! 


*only wash your face a maximum of one time per day!* that's all your skin needs. In the morning, just splash your face with some cool water, nothing more.


After a few days, if your skin feels too dry, increase the coconut oil and decrease the amount of castor oil in your mixture. Likewise, if your skin feels too oily, increase castor oil and decrease coconut oil. Be very careful with the amount of castor oil you are using though, as it can severely dry out your skin.



**Results** 


For the first few days, washing with oil is going to feel very counterintuitive. After you wash and dry your face, your skin will still feel oily (obviously), but this is ok! The oil is acting as a moisturizer. After you wake up the next morning, your face should not feel oily any more.


I saw improvements in my skin after just the first day, and I haven't looked back since.


I hope this helps some of you out there struggling with acne!


Good luck!



**EDIT**

As has been pointed out, I forgot to mention that coconut oil is comedogenic, meaning that it may clog pores. I have had great success with coconut oil, but others may find it does not work for their skin.


There are several other base oils that you can use in place of coconut oil, however. Extra Virgin cold pressed olive oil, Jojoba oil, and Sweet Almond are among the highest recommended.


I do recommend starting with a lower castor oil ratio because too much castor oil can severely dry out your skin, whereas too much base oil can simply be wiped away. 


This is an all natural face cleansing process that has worked for me personally and countless others, but this isn't a miracle cure. If you try this process and your skin doesn't improve or gets worse, you should stop treatment and seek professional advice from a dermatologist.",,False,self,t5_2s5oq,1373400188.0,,,True,t3_1hy4am,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1hy4am/lpt_use_oil_to_once_and_for_all_banish_acne/,
1372607954.0,1162,self.LifeProTips,1hdap3,LPT: some tips on how to start conversations or keep them going,DopplerEffect1,1691,529,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1hdap3/lpt_some_tips_on_how_to_start_conversations_or/,"I have a few tricks to get conversations going and keeping them from dying:

1. Shut up and listen. Sometimes people will start talking and something will come up that is a common interest. Even if someone just mentions for example the word car, there's nothing stopping you from talking about cars. Pick up on those and reciprocate. Takes some practice but you'll start to build in triggers in your mind and before you know it, you'll be leading the conversation.

2. Express an interesting thought from a movie, song, book, etc... Doesn't have to be on-topic, if the conversation is dying, anything goes! Last time I did that, I was talking about the movie Man of Steel and how the people of Krypton reproduced. Turned out the guy I was talking to teaches religion and obviously that was quite a conversation sparker.

3. If you frequently don't know what to say to people at, for example, a party: write down your own interests on a list beforehand. Store it on your phone or something. If the conversation dies, go through your list, pick an item and start talking about it. So what if it's a bit awkward that a conversation just started and you're already looking at your phone, they'll forget about that in 5 seconds as soon as the conversation is back up and running again. This one has saved me many times!

4. Little bit the same as 3, read up on current events before going to parties. If you really want to be prepared, augment your list from nr. 3 with recent news.

5. Don't start or continue conversations with negative thoughts. When someone tells you he/she likes film photography, don't complain that the colors of old photos suck. Instead, ask them what they find so interesting about it, for example ""What drew you to film photography?"". Remember: what the heart is filled with, the mouth is full of. A simple follow-up question can release a torrent of information which you can use in applying the other tips.

6. Share your experience on something you just did or are about to do. I told someone I was going to music school, turns out he does too and gave me a lot of helpful information.
7. Remember what people are or were talking about so you can always go back to that topic. Yes, that means paying attention!

8. Maybe as a reminder to myself, alcohol may be a social lubricant but it also makes you forget a lot of stuff! What are you going to do when that cute guy/girl comes over and asks if watch a lot of TV and you can't even remember what shows you watch? It happened to me and I'll be damned if I ever let something like that happen again.

1364369684.0,1159,self.LifeProTips,1b3laf,LPT: Improve Your Wi-Fi Signal Using a Soda Can,good_guy_submitter,2243,1084,236,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1b3laf/lpt_improve_your_wifi_signal_using_a_soda_can/,"If you’ve ever had a TV with an antenna or a radio, you’ve probably heard of the trick of using tin foil to improve the signal. Using a soda or beer can to improve your wi-fi signal works in a very similar way. The metal in the can and the shape of the can when cut open can focus the signal to and from your router. The only things that you’ll need to achieve this are a beer or soda can, a utility knife, a pair of scissors and some form of adhesive that can easily be removed like tape or adhesive putty.

6 Steps to Better Internet
1 – Clean Out the Can

Practically any substance that is found in cans like soda, beer, juice and more can create a sticky residue on the inside of the can. This can attract bugs and make your router sticky. Before you start cutting apart the can, thoroughly rinse it out with soap and warm water. Dry the can as thoroughly as possible.

2 – Pull off the Tab

The tab for the soda can really has no use for this project, so it’s best to remove it. To remove the tab, simply bend the tab back and forth until you hear it snap.

3 – Cut off the Bottom of the Can

Grab a utility knife and carefully cut a straight, horizontal line around bottom of the can at the point where the sides of the can start sloping to create the bottom. Cut very slowly to ensure a clean cut and to avoid accidentally cutting yourself. Once the bottom is completely removed, safely dispose of it to avoid accidentally grabbing it or stepping on it.

4 – Creating the Base

The base for your wifi extender will be the top of the can. To create the base, turn the can upside down and use your utility knife to make a cut horizontal cut that is similar to the one you made at the bottom of the can, but leaves an inch or so of metal to keep everything in one piece.

5 – Cut the Side of the Can

Position the can so that the leftover piece of metal used to keep the base attached is opposite the location you intend to make a vertical incision in the can. Use the scissors to cut a straight line from the bottom of the can to the top. Then open the can up to create a shape similar to a satellite dish. If the can is still wet at the point, thoroughly dry the can before placing it on top of your router.

6 – Attaching the Can to Your Router

Place the can over the antenna for your Wi-Fi connection through the hole in the base. Using tape or another easily removable adhesive such as adhesive putty, secure the can to your router. Adjust the can to maximize the signal.

Basically the can should be splayed out, creating something similar to a sail around the router’s antenna. The antenna serves as a mast and the pop can helps the router function.

You are now free to enjoy a stronger and more reliable wi-fi signal.

AMAZING results. Instead of saying, ""You need to see this new movie"", I might say, ""I really enjoyed this new movie"". I do not have to even tell them, ""I suggest you see it"" because they can make up their own mind. ""You shouldn't eat so much fast food""as opposed to, ""I do not eat a lot of fast food because I know it's bad for me"" 

2, When someone gives me good advice, I do not let the person get in the way of their information. If someone tells me, ""You are LAZY"" I try to say, ""I will have to work harder"" rather than say, ""You live in your grandmother's basement and don't even own a car, and you're calling me lazy?"" 

3, When someone admits their faults, I acknowledge them instead of telling them how faulty they are. Odds are, the person who is being vulnerable about their weaknesses already knows their extent. I don't need to remind them. 

4, I ask others when I am confused. When someone says a word I don't understand, I ask them what the word means. 

5, Silence is my motto. The less time I spend showing others what I know, the more I learn. The best way I have found to show off my skills is to do it in the form of questions. If someone spells disc golf ""disk golf"", I ask, ""Are you sure it's spelled with a ""k""? This may sound like I am beating around the bush, but I am using this as a way to kill my ego.

I can never sleep before I'm exhausted, and that's almost never before 2am (I thought it would change as I grew older, but in my mid-30s it hasn't yet).

The problem is that I just can't turn my brain off, I can't sleep. I can try to lay quietly in the dark for hours, but my brain keeps whirling, whirling, whirling away. I'll even try consciously not to think consciously. You can image how well that works. It's futile, so I have to get up and do something else.

However, I've discovered that these tricks just about always work to put me to sleep. The key is that you're not really trying to shut your brain down, you're engaging it, while the sneaky science elves fight a rear-guard action to put you to sleep.

**1. Read a book in bed with a Red LED Headlamp**

Only a book though, not Reddit or facebook, etc. Any paper-based book, a kindle or e-reader without a backlight will work, but never use a phone or computer, these shine bright bluish-white LED light in your face, no matter what colour is on the screen. **Blue Light is stimulating to the brain, and will keep you awake; avoid at all costs!** This won't work with a computer screen, a white (aka blue) LED head-lamp, or even an incandescent bulb (too much of the blue spectrum). 

Before I picked up a cheap-o $20 princeton-tec red headlamp, I would use a white one, and it just didn't work. I'd be up all night reading, especially if the book was captivating. Go for the red, read for a bit, you'll be shocked at how little you can read before the book hits you in the face. When you read with a Red head-lamp, your brain is snuggled down and sedated. It's better than nyquil.

--

**2. Audiobooks = Bedtime Story = Zzzzzzzzzzzzz**

The other trick that works every time at shutting my brain off is to listen to an audiobook or lecture series (like the amazing TTC ones that you can find at your local library, among other places). Music won't do it, it's stimulating, go for a spoken story/lecture.

I keep one of my earbuds in one ear and put my other ear on my pillow and before I get 10 minutes in, I'm in dream-land. Even the most interesting story or lecture series won't be enough to keep me awake, I'll find myself struggling unsuccessfully to stay awake so I can keep listening, but before long, I'm conked right out.

------

Those are my guaranteed go-tos for when I need to sleep. What are yours?

They go well with anything that you would normally put on a sandwich and the only issue is that they tend to be about half the size of a normal sandwich if you do it taco style.

Bachelor Stromboli: Sandwich meat (I use ham or anything that looks good in the deli), provolone and tortillas. Throw it in the microwave for 30 seconds per stromboli and bam you have a pretty decent meal.


Edit: For the nit pickers. This tip was for the younger crowd, not for the health fanatics. It shouldn't matter too much anyways considering there are healthy tortillas as well as the junk food ones that were mentioned in comments. Also tortillas don't have to be refrigerated in order to keep their long shelf life; it is preferred though. In my opinion they also thaw better than bread.

As you also know, bees are a *very*, *very* important part of the ecosystem. I assume that most of you don't use bee-killing chemicals on your fields or have a garden, so I have a simple tip on how to save dying bees, one at a time, even for people living in cities.

If you spot a dying bee (or bumble bee), don't throw it outside or kill it. You can save that little fucker! It's easy and often takes only a couple of minutes. Step by step:

* don't be afraid of bees - just stay calm, they won't hurt or attack you
* bring it into a dry place (just put in on a table or whatever)
* take a cup and mix sugar (*not* artificial or diet sweetener or other crap, just normal or organic sugar) with water - something like a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio, small quantities
* take a spoon and make the sugar ''dissolve'', the end result should be thicker than water and a little bit less consistent than syrup (it's not *that* important)
* put a spoon of your sugar water on a dish and place the bee (use a paper to scoop it up) right next to it (*not* into it)
* observe the bee drink it and make sure that it doesn't end stuck in it (again, gently use a paper if it's stuck and try to help it out)
* open a window and turn off bright lights

And then wait. In my experience, even half dead bees will find enough force to drink/eat some. After usually anything between 1 and 5min, the bee will stop drinking, wait a moment and suddenly start flying again. If your window is open, odds are high that it will find it and directly fly out.

Younger I lived in the countryside and had to deal with plenty of bees. I never really thought about helping the dying ones, because they usually didn't die due to a lack of energy (flowers everywhere). Now, in the city, every other day I will find such a dying bee and I found out that this method works perfectly.

There's no point in killing animals, specially such useful ones like bees. Side effect, it's interesting to observe them drink and it's always a small victory when they fly away like nothing ever happened. Every bee I've helped with sugar water flew away in the following minutes.

Edit: Also, in case someone doubted, bees are not pets. As soon as they're healthy again, give them the opportunity to fly back home.

Edit2: Always use sugar if available. If you don't have any left, try honey. ",Animals &amp; Pets,False,self,t5_2s5oq,1375097802.0,anp,,True,t3_1j9pzu,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1j9pzu/lpt_easily_save_dying_bees_with_sugar_water/,

",,1532,504,182,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/15zhpd/lpt_having_trouble_affording_your_medication_or/,"**UPDATE 5/3/2013 MURICA TIME** The old links are dead, so here's a new link to the site, where you can get your card and all - http://www.caprxprogram.org/Index.aspx

Enjoy!

**END UPDATE**

Hey guys, I wanted to spread the word about a card my therapist gave me a couple sessions ago (I feel like I'm coming off as a salesperson, haha). 

I'm uninsured, and get generic prescriptions, but they still cost a good bit. My prescription at Target for Citalopram is **$26**. My therapist gave me a card she received from the Community Assistance Program. I took it to Target when I needed my refill, then put the card's info under my account without asking me ANYTHING about it, and that same prescription cost **$9**. 

The card saves you a different price, depending on where you go. They have estimated prices listed on their site, based on where you're getting it filled, what dosage you're getting, etc. I say estimate, because when I went to Target, the price from the website was off by about 50 cent or so. 

Anyway, you can either print out the cards yourself and use them that way, or you can order a bunch (&lt;50 cards = free shipping), and give them to your friends, family, homeless people, whoever you think needs help with their prescription. I'm about to put in an order myself for a bunch. 

If you're interested in seeing how much your prescription would cost with the card, check it out at this link- http://cashcard.lc.healthtrans.com/Pages/default.aspx

**WARNING-** This site takes a long time to load. I fear that if it recieves a lot of attention, the site might go down. Just in case it DOES go down, here's a link to the cards that can be printed, in PDF form- 

~~[**HUMAN** card](https://www.dropbox.com/s/90pxpk67sod9wt0/CAP%20HUMAN%20Drug%20Plan%20Card.pdf)~~

~~[**PET** card](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zf19nhqe7cjg6li/CAP%20PET%20Drug%20Plan%20Card.pdf)~~

**IN FACT**, if you're just interested in getting a card for yourself, just use the two links above. I'd hate for the site to go offline for some little old lady out there who's already struggling with the internet. 

Oh, the other tip for saving money on your meds, it's just a minor tip, is to get larger tablets and split them in half. My therapist knows I'm short on cash, and I have this one med called Deplin that is goddamn $50 a month. Well, the price is the same for both the 7.5mg and the 15mg. I'm supposed to take the 7.5mg, so she prescribes me the 15mg, I cut them in half and I'm able to save $25 a month that way. 

Your doctor may not be so understanding. Some doctors are assholes! Some meds are controlled substances, so there's nothing they can do there, understandably. If you're interested, ask your doc about it, see what they think, and you might be able to save some money! 

**TL;DR** Print these cards out for ~~[**HUMAN**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/90pxpk67sod9wt0/CAP%20HUMAN%20Drug%20Plan%20Card.pdf)~~ and ~~[**PET**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zf19nhqe7cjg6li/CAP%20PET%20Drug%20Plan%20Card.pdf)~~ prescriptions. Save money. Ask your doc about getting a double dose tablet and splitting it in half- same cost for the pill, but you get twice the supply. 

**Links to the site PLEASE DON'T CRASH THEM ;_;**

Actual site- ~~http://www.caprxprogram.org/Home.aspx~~

Check the price of your prescriptions, with the card- http://cashcard.lc.healthtrans.com/Pages/default.aspx

Okay, I hope this is appropriate for this sub. If not, I'll go over to r/Frugal or something, I don't know. Just tryin' to help out my fellow broke ass homies. 

**EDIT-** User david-saint-hubbins linked Target's $4 [generic prescription program](http://www.target.com/pharmacy/generics-condition). I'm on 10mg Citalopram, 30ct a month, for $9 after the discount. By raising the dose to 20mg, and splitting the tablet, I'll be able to get a two month supply for $4! 

Also, I should add that this is **US ONLY!!!** Sorry Canadian friends, and other folks overseas. I think Mexicans too, sorry. 

Oh yeah, a few posters also recommended checking to see if the company behind the pill has a **customer assistance program**. I was able to get one of my prescriptions through an assistance program, and it has saved me a couple hundred dollars so far!

Before I get into it, let me first say that I am somewhat ashamed to share this, but it did work. I got my first car this way and saved quite a bit of money in the process. Note that this was before the internet was around, but I'd imagine it would still work today.

His tip was thus: ""Instead of looking though used car ads, go through the obituaries.""

His reasoning behind this is pretty simple. When the elderly pass on, they generally leave behind a car. The car generally isn't wanted by the surviving family members and they're looking to make a quick buck off of it and/or just looking to get rid of it during the estate sell off. Sometimes they're happy to practically give it away to a struggling college kid who needs a method of transportation. This is where you come in.

What you do is you go through the obituaries, look up contact information for the deceased and call a family member with ""Hi I'm calling about the used car your selling""

Most folks will tell you that you have the wrong number, but you'll eventually get someone who will have a lightbulb go off in they're head and will make a deal with you. It takes a bit of fishing, but it does work. 

Generally speaking, the cars you do get off of using this method are in very good condition and generally just need a brake job (the elderly tend to ride them a bit). I told this tip to a buddy in high school and he scored a free car off of it.

Also, use a little backstory on the call to get them thinking. For example ""Aww I have the wrong number? I'm so sorry! I've been calling ads all day so I can find a car that'll help me get to college and I must have hit the wrong button"". If you get a ""Oh...actually...."", you know you landed one.

We were about to call AAA, but I gave it one last ditch effort with a helpful citizen walking by. They mentioned calling mall security. Never would have thought to try! They were there in a few minutes and jumped my car for free! Definitely useful information in case any of you are ever in this type of situation.

Edit: Getting a lot of replies concerning legal reasons that places with security patrols have for NOT jumping your vehicle. I totally understand why, but being that I was in a bind, I'm glad they were able to help me, exploding car or not. Couldn't hurt to call and ask anyways, especially if your only option is a wrecker.

This way they get some control, which is what they really want, and you don't have to spend the entire shopping trip arguing and saying no.

This is part of a general child raising philosophy of allowing kids to make choices, but controlling the what those choices are. Another example: you want your kid to get dressed -- offer him a choice of the red shirt or the blue shirt. Result: you don't really care which shirt the kid wears as long as he gets dressed, and your kid feels like he's actually gotten to make a decision.

Edit: Just wanted to add, when shopping with some kids you may have to add some additional parameters beyond price. For example: ""Live plant from the floral section - OK. Live lobster from the the fish counter - not OK.

For one of my more expensive books I found that I could preview all of the pages I needed to read, saving me a boatload. 


They omit a few pages every now and then, especially towards the end of the books, but if you're in the situation like me where you need to read your book before it gets here this can help a ton. It's also free (though you might need to log in to see more of the pages), so if you want to live dangerously and try to get through the semester without buying a textbook, this is a way you could do it.

So I've created two categories: 

Helping you, 

And helping us. 

Firstly helping you: 

You can order a filet a la cart, and it won't come on a bun but it rings it up as only $1.

Free mayo packets, adding mayo on to a sammich directly costs .30.

If you order a happy meal, you can request a large soda at no extra charge.

You can request fresh hot fries,

You can ask for two apple packets, or one small fry in a happy meal instead of one apple packet and one baby fry.

If you ask for extra sauce at the second window we won't charge. 

This works at some McDonald's: if you say only *whatever you want that would normally cost extra money* it won't charge for it 
Ex: McDouble with only Mac sauce = 1.00 McDouble with added macsauce=1.30 

Our small fries are now 1.25 and our medium is 1.56.... Perhaps upgrade to the medium?

One pie costs $1 two cost 1.25.

One cookie costs .75 three cost $1.00.

There are such a thing as McDouble meals and mcchicken meals. If you order things as meals it saves you some money instead of ordering everything separately (the only exception is if you order a number 4 with no cheese just order two hamburgers a medium fry and your drink.) 

Do not i repeat do not eat the mcribs
http://i.imgur.com/H1cFg.jpg &lt;that's why 

If you come during rush hours our food will be fresher but if you come during non rush hours it will be faster on average dinner hours are from 4:40-7. 

Helping us:

I have no problem giving you a few moments to think, but please don't give me half your order, then ask us to wait I get yelled at for it because times matter. 

Don't order additional food at the second window (go ahead and order it at the first.)

Get your money out quickly I get yelled at for that too. 

I'm not telling you not to order ice cream or speciality drinks but, if you don't want to wait, dont they take a while to make.

On average drive through times are anywhere from 90-120 seconds (meaning from the time I take your order till the time you get your food it takes 90-120 seconds) they can vary but that's average. That means if you're running late, or close to late, don't expect to be able to just swing by quickly for a diet coke because its only one item because when the car in front of you orders 4 happy meals and 3 number ones with 5 ice cream cones you're going to wait 

Lastly: do not pick change up in the drive through I'm supposed to yell at you for that because when you take that change my drawer comes up short but its just too awkward not to mention you hold everyone up for 70some cents and this is immensely frustrating. 

Edit:because I forgot about the fillet and spacing :/

I was completely sober and not in possession of any illegal drugs or weapons. 

 I was not acting any more or less nervous than I imagine most people might be while being pulled over and then harassed for nothing. When the officer TOLD me he was going to search me and my car because of my ""strange and nervous behavior"" I told him I did not consent to the search. At this time his supervisor approached us and told me I should ""shut the fuck up"" unless I wanted to go to jail. The officer who pulled me over then searched my car and the pockets of my shorts.

Long story short, I was not charged with anything but I was handcuffed and driven to parish prison. After a lengthy conversation, consisting of me repeating that I knew nothing about illegal drugs, the officer told me he would delete the police report and video recorded from inside the car then dropped me back off in a parking lot near my job and let me go. 

After watching a video on YouTube titled ""Police officer gets owned by law student"" (where a gentleman who has had his legal gun illegally taken by a police officer then very matter-of-factly asserts his knowledge of his rights and the law to quite righteous avail) I thought that compiling an  ""I-know-my-rights cheat sheet,"" consisting of laws, precedents, and any other pertinent information to learn and/or reference if I find myself in a similar situation MIGHT help.

1362589401.0,895,self.LifeProTips,19s87w,LPT: How to CORRECT your posture after your back has already hunched,Ribeye_n_WaffleFries,1190,295,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/19s87w/lpt_how_to_correct_your_posture_after_your_back/,"By Xiao

Here's an awesome and simple protip for you that I've learned from experience. Yesterday there was a request for tips to Improve your posture, which I was too late for. That thread did not have any solutions to correct an already hunched back, so enjoy this one:

You can correct a minor hunchback over time by lying on your stomach whenever you read a book or use a laptop!

1) Place a cushion under your stomach. This is optional, but it helps target the area of hunch.

2) Keep your neck straight and focus most of your spine's bending on where it is hunched.



*Q: ""My neck hurts from reading like this. Am I doing something wrong?""*

*A: Yes, you are bending back at the neck rather than trying to focus the bend where you are hunched.*

*Don't bend your lower back either, or you'll just look more like the letter ""S"" from the side, and no one wants to look like S. Again, focus most of your spine's bending on where it is hunched.*



It should correct your hunch over the course of several months depending on how often you work in this position. I've done this and now my posture is good. I've used an elastic back brace before I discovered this method; this method works much better. 

You do not need a chiropractor for minor hunchbacks.

There were two reasons snoozing is the worst thing you can do while waking up.

1.  Waking up is taxing on the body and the mind.  It's hard.  So do it once.  Think of it like starting a car.  You wouldn't go outside and start your car three times before driving off, and if you did, you'd have to replace the starter in no time.

2.  When you snooze on a regular basis, the very first thing you do everyday is procrastinate.  You put off the very first thing you do and you set the stage for the day.

Extra LPT, buy an analog alarm clock you can't snooze and you can't reset for twenty minutes from now.  


Didn't think I would, but I found the original article I read.  It was actually in 2006.  Here is the link:

Some common sources of unclaimed money are:

 - Old bank accounts that have may have been from banks that closed down or accounts closed due to various reasons

 - old jobs where the last paycheck after you left never reached the right address

1.  STAY HYDRATED.  Even if you're not thirsty drink water, 1oz every few minutes if you're outside.  Just because it's ""dry heat"" it doesn't mean you can handle it.  Those visiting from humid areas always comment on how 115°F doesn't feel like 115°F hot. True, with about 0% humidity it actually feels like 105°F.  Well, the reason it doesn't feel hot is because your body is efficiently cooling you by evaporating your fluids very quickly.  Humidity affects evaporation and how hot you feel.  

2. PROTECT YOUR SKIN.  Not only by using sunscreen but by covering up.  Wear loose fitting clothing that minimizes skin exposure.  Tighter clothes and a large skin area will facilitate rapid fluid loss.  At 115°F with minimal skin protection you can expect to loose close to 1.5L of water per hour. 

3. BE AWARE IT TAKES A FEW WEEKS FOR YOUR BODY TO ADAPT TO HEAT.   Bodies of those of us who live in dry hot climates have acclimated to the increased evaporation rate and our sweat contains less mineral salts.  Therefore less electrolytes are lost when sweating.  Additionally, less fluid is lost as urine volume is decreased and the body becomes more efficient at cooling as your blood vessels dilate more. 

4. YOUR BODY HAS A LIMIT.   Above 110°F your body can no longer cool you down safely at anything above normal resting effort. Also prolonged heat exposure at this temperature starts to actually cause damage to tissues.  Things start to snowball quickly once your body reaches that limit, you're feeling a little nauseated one moment and next you're dying.  

5. THERE IS NO BREAK FROM THE HEAT. The heat never stops in the cities.  Concrete, buildings and asphalt all absorb heat during the day and radiate it at night, so the coolest you can expect it to be is a chilly 100°F for a brief moment at 5AM.  The temperature difference from Highs to midnight is less then 10°F on average.

1374337594.0,813,self.LifeProTips,1ip8ab,LPT: Get Your Verizon FiOS ETF Fee Waived When Changing/Downgrading Service Bundle/Plan,THE_BOKEH_BLOKE,1452,639,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1ip8ab/lpt_get_your_verizon_fios_etf_fee_waived_when/,"I'm a Verizon FiOS customer and recently decided to ""cut the cable"" and opt only for their FiOS internet plan, and I faced their ETF (Early Termination Fee) for downgrading my ""bundle"" from my original double play (internet and cable TV).  I recently bought a Roku 3 box and already have AppleTV so I don't need cable, and frankly I'm tired of paying their bloated prices for channels I never watch.

Their ETF -- whilst ridiculous given you're still staying with Verizon -- is applicable if you downgrade out of one of their bundles.

I'd done some research locally, and spoke to a CSR with another provider and by switching to their services, they would pay Verizon's ETF for me if I switched.  I'm pretty loyal and would rather just stick with Verizon (their customer service and tech support are just superior).  I'm sure in all other areas of the US, competing internet/cable providers would help with other companies' ETFs, too.  Ask around.

So if you're looking to cut the cord and go purely FiOS internet and want to get the ETF waived completely:

* Inform the CSR that you intend to downgrade to just their internet package and cancel TV.  They're likely to want to transfer you to their retention department, but tell them no.  Retention will spend their time trying to convince you to a) not go to the other provider, and/or b) sell you other less expensive services.

* The CSR will likely inform you that as you're canceling a bundle, you'll be hit with an ETF - tell them that you are aware of that, and you're calling to request it to be waived in full.  This will likely result in them arguing the fact that this cannot be done - **yes it can, read on, and stay firm**

* Tell the CSR that the other provider has offered to cover the cost of your ETF and that you're willing to switch providers if Verizon cannot waive the ETF.

At this point it's important to bring up some important numbers to the CSR:

* If they do not waive the ETF, you will be switching to the other provider and Verizon will a) lose a customer, and b) make only ~$200 from you (the cost of the ETF) - also mention that you don't care about the cost of the ETF as it's being covered by the other provider.  If Verizon can't use the cost of the ETF as an incentive for you to stay, they lose that pricing power completely.

* If they do waive the ETF, you will stay and they will continue to make a significant amount more over the next 24 months.  Without promotions, their 50/25 internet deal is $85, so over 2 years that's $2,040.

Trust me, they'll make the smart decision and want to keep you as a customer as they stand to lose quite a bit of money long term if you go to the other provider.

The CSR I spoke to didn't have the authority to waive the fee (none of them do), but advised that she would speak with an on-duty supervisor and explain my request.  A few minutes after being placed on hold I was given approval for a complete waiver of the ETF.

I did this today, *and* they currently have two promotions with their internet plan.  Over the next 24 months I am going to be saving more money.  For the first 12 months they're knocking $15 a month off my monthly charge, and the remaining 12 months $5 per month.

So not only am I going to save $17 a month by not having to pay for the HD DVR, but I'm going to save $180 over the first year and $60 the following - a total saving of $240 over the course of the contract.  And all without being shafted with their Early Termination Fee.

Total saving over the 24 months = $444 and no ETF. 

It is very important that you remain calm, professional, and treat all reps with respect when going through this process - or any other CSR experience for that matter.  Calm, happy, and professional = getting exactly what you want.

Customer wins.

p.s. Roku is really awesome.

p.p.s. yeah I realize I essentially wrote Fee Fee

Don't do movie dates on a first date. What's the point? You spend most of your time watching the movie and less time getting to know each other. Most movie dates are followed up by a dinner, which is also not ideal, especially for the SAPs. 

* Don't do Dinner dates. Dinner dates are great for people who can carry a conversation and have no problems avoiding awkward silence. For the SAPs in the world, that's NOT GOOD.

So what can you do? The best options for a first date is to do something that is somewhat active. For the geeks among us, going to the arcade is a great idea. It lets you guys have fun while getting to know each other. You can also easily pass off awkward silence as concentrating on the game. Making witty remarks about the games you play should come naturally to most of us as well. 

Go to a pool hall. Pool + Alcohol + Girl = winner! Same as arcade really. You can get a little bit of alcohol in your system to loosen you up a bit. It doesn't matter how bad you suck at pool, you're there to have fun. It's easy to start conversations in between shots, and taking a little bit of time to gather your thoughts when it's your turn. 

In the end, what you choose to do should reflect a bit about you. Arcades and Pool for us geeks is great. You can stop by a toy shop on the way home and grab some foam swords to duel in the streets. Get creative. When you think about it, if someone was dating two people who were completely identical in all ways. You think they'd pick the one who took them on the average movie and dinner date? Nope! I most certainly wouldn't.

Purses get stolen all the time, but one easy to way really decrease the probability of yours being taken is to just put the safety belt in the child portion of the shopping kart through one of your purse handles and clip it, that way if a thief tries to grab and run they are tied to the cart.

1372206323.0,756,self.LifeProTips,1h2pov,LPT: Get to know Benadryl better. It can save you tons of money and potentially your life.,omnipoopent,995,239,182,http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1h2pov/lpt_get_to_know_benadryl_better_it_can_save_you/,"I know a popular and often revisited LPT is the concept that generic drugs are not any chemically different (in terms of active ingredients) than name brand drugs, but I'd like to expound on that a little bit, specifically on Benadryl. Most people don't realize how common it is for Benadryl to be combined to another drug or even sold by itself and re-branded with different suggested uses (allergy medicine and sleep aids).

First of all, learn the drug's actual name: 

- Diphenhydramine 

There are two common variations of diphenhydramine on the market:

- Diphenhydramine hydrochloride (abbreviated HCl) [9 out of 10 times, this is the ingredient you will find]
- Diphenhydramine citrate [this is rarer, but the tl;dr version of the difference is that it absorbs into the blood faster, thus dosage amounts are different than that of something with dyp HCl]

Now let's look at some brand names, their ingredients, suggested usages, and prices:

- Benadryl (Allergy medicine) (~$6.50 for 24 tablets) (one tablet contains 25 mg of diphendyramine HCl)

- Tylenol PM (Pain reliever/sleep aid) (~6.50 for 36 pills) (one pill contains Tylenol and 25 mg of diphenhydramine HCl)

- Advil PM (Pain reliever/sleep aid) (~8.00 for 40 pills) (one pill contains Advil and 38 mg of diphenhydramine citrate)

- Advil PM Liqui-Gels (Pain reliever/sleep aid) (~9.00 for 32 capsules) (one pill contains Advil and 25 mg of diphenhydramine HCl)

- ZZZQuil (Sleep aid) (~7.00 for one bottle) (one teaspoon contains 25 mg of diphenhydramine HCl)

- Generic Dollar Store allergy medicine (allergy medicine) (1.00 for 36 pills) (one pill contains 25 mg of diphenhydramine HCl)

- Generic Dollar Store Tylenol PM (Pain relief/sleep aid) (1.00 for 24 pills) (one pill contains Tylenol and 25 mg of diphenhydramine HCl)

- Generic Dollar Store sleep aid (sleep aid) (1.00 for 24 pills) (one pill contains 25 mg of diphenhydramine HCl)

- Generic Dollar Store Advil PM (pain reliever/sleep aid) (1.00 for 24 pills) (one pills contains Advil and 38 mg of diphenhydramine citrate)

- It's also worth noting that when it comes to Children's allergy medicine (name brand or generic) the only difference is that the dosage is cut in half (one teaspoon contains 12.5 mg if diphenhydramine HCl instead of the usual 25)

There are plenty of other brand names out there that contain Benadryl, but this is just the gist of it. See where this is going? Stop wasting your money on ZZZquil and Benadryl and get the same exact thing at the Dolllar Store for 10% of the price. Dollar Stores do often run out of certain items a lot faster than regular stores do, so don't be scared to buy some Tylenol PM to cure your runny nose or some generic allergy medicine to get some good sleep.

You should also get in the habit of looking at the ingredients before you buy ANY medication (as well as stuff already in your house) and get to know them by their chemical names. There are lots of drugs with multiple uses and it's nice to know A. Exactly what you're getting and B. How to find exactly what you're looking for. 

Also, if you are ever around anybody having a major allergic reaction to something and don't have Benadryl around, you should know you have other potential options. Having that information could be a real difference maker.

I told her it was mine but wouldn't believe me and refused to give me the camera back, instead insisting on turning it in as a lost item.
