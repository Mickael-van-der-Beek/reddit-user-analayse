It was apparently just am umbrella? Mary Poppins is the real victim here.

Kate Gleason Hall is the giant dorm building with the clock.

TIPS:

* ~~It's probably nothing~~ There are policemen walking around with shotguns, apparently. So... it's something. Better safe than shot.

* Lock your room door.

* Close blinds, possibly stay away from windows.

* Your professor **will** understand if you miss class because of this. **DO NOT RISK IT**.

* If you are off-campus, stay there.

Every student he met went out of their way to, not just point him in the right direction, but to walk him part way where he need to go, take his dishes for him or hand him the soda he wanted from the case.

Appreciate your school while you're here. Make the most of your time here because it passes quickly.

I'm back on campus for only the second time since I graduated 7 years ago. And walking around our brick city, I'm overwhelmingly filled with nostalgia. 

You may think that you're going to leave this place after graduation and never look back, that you'll finally be rid of all the BS of student life and never think about RIT again. If that's you, I think you either a) don't care much about your area of study, or b) greatly underestimate how much of an impact RIT is leaving on your life. I know I underestimated it. I complained a lot while I was here. I complained about the things I didn't like about RIT, and I was cynical. Many of you are the same. And I think that's ok, but don't forget to see the good things about this place.

And wow this place never stops changing... new buildings (and fountains) everywhere. But I guess it was silly to expect to come back to the school exactly as I had left it.After all, in the half decade I was here, I saw the installation of the sentinel, the field house, the closing of the old pool, the kodak quad and new base for the tiger statue, and my newly-formed college move into a new building. But it's still mind-blowing to see all the changes that have happened since leaving.

So what's my point? I'm not sure I had one at first, but I guess it's to appreciate your time here. One day you'll be back visiting and look back amazed at the time you spent at our little Brick City.",,False,self,t5_2qh3x,False,,flair,True,t3_1aiesk,http://www.reddit.com/r/rit/comments/1aiesk/rit_appreciation/,

His brother is also a landlord in the same area (Jim Hills, I believe), and is pretty excellent from what I've heard. 

----

My girlfriend lived in one of his houses, and friends of mine lived in one. I subletted one of their rooms for a summer as well. 

He came into my friend's house in the middle of the night and stabbed one of their mattresses with a screwdriver and left it sticking out of the mattress (roommate was gone for the night). He stole some things, including my sledgehammer (wtf). He only shows up to yell about rent, even if it's not late. Getting it exactly on time pisses him off, and he'll send really aggressive texts calling you ""commie liberal entitled rich kids."" His houses are very run down, which is fine for many college students, but he either doesn't keep track of what's damaged or just tries to blame it all on each new group of students. 

He had converted the garage of my girlfriend's house into a bedroom without notifying the town or getting a permit, and when he was caught the police showed up several times because he wouldn't answer calls or respond to court notifications. They'd post a notice saying ""it's illegal to remove this notice until the zoning violation is remedied."" He'd come by and try to make my girlfriend take the notice down (presumably so he could blame it on her if the cops got mad). 

Her roommates also bailed on the lease because he was a bastard, and he harassed her for months by text, even though she was the one that honored the lease. Obviously her roommates were wrong, but the level of harassment was extremely intense. 

Another friend of mine wanted to move into one of his houses and paid a security deposit. He went to a party there and saw mold, so called to ask if that would be taken care of before he moved in. He got no answer, followed by texts calling him a commie and swearing and saying he had no right to go to the house before move-in (he'd been invited to a party there by the previous tenants). 

He said ""I'm not moving in. I need a copy of the lease I signed and my security deposit back."" This was followed was more swearing and threatening court. Last I heard he was trying to figure out the guy's address so he could take him to small claims.

You *will not* get your security deposit back. You will be harassed, and you may have damaged or stolen property. He's deaf, so calls are only returned on his terms. He won't respond to maintenance requests and you'll only hear from him if he wants to yell about something. He doesn't honor zoning regulations and lies to his tenants about violations (""I have a deal with the town/preexisting houses aren't covered."") The truth is the town is fed up with him and he moves between his properties to avoid the authorities.

So yeah, avoid this guy.",,False,self,t5_2qh3x,1351529845.0,,,True,t3_128f5r,http://www.reddit.com/r/rit/comments/128f5r/hey_guys_i_thought_id_post_a_general_warning/,

Header graphic is ripped from RIT Athletics. If we had more time I suppose the original PSD could be tracked down but there's not time.

Resources - I'm not sure what you guys are using for image names in the current stylesheet (for the image in the logo announcement, the sidebar gradients, etc) so you'll need to adjust the %%ritgradient%%, %%ritgradientlarge%%, and %%tigerface%% to whatever they're called here.

""Logo"" image: http://i.imgur.com/7eB68.png - It is a transparent PNG. Still clickable but you see the graphic from what's behind it (the tiger head)

Listening to my music and enjoying the night like the chap I am when I discover my keys to be missing when I reach my front door. Searching frantically I find I have in fact lost them. Thinking I dropped them back where my bike was locked up on academic side I sprint-ride back only to discover they are gone. I mutter obscenities to myself and proceed to backtrack along the bike path, making it all the way home without finding them, locked out of my apartment, feeling defeated, I decide to give public safety a call before tracing back along the bike path one more time. To my amazement, someone had already turned them in, and I could pick them up immediately. I was ecstatic. In the 15 minutes I had spent looking for my keys, someone had found them and turned them in. I just want to send a thank you to the individual that did this and how much you have made my night.

On a similar note, this is an attitude that I have seen a lot of in my three years being here at RIT.  I'm not sure if this is typical college attitude, but everyone seems sympathetic to others (besides the occasional douche) and often reach out to help a fellow human here at RIT. It makes me feel good knowing I belong to such a community, and I feel even better I have it at my back. Maybe I'm inexperienced as far as the community feel here, but in my opinion, all of you rock.

Keep being sirs and madams, RIT.

I'm kind of embarrassed that people who mainly listed the bad things at RIT are still here. Seriously people? If there's something you can complain about in private, complain about it publicly. Tell a higher-up, don't keep that shit bottled up until you have a place to vent it.



Now sure, there are poor parts of the university, but overall this university is amazing.



If you complain about the weather, that's your ass, you should have known Rochester, NY was going to right in the middle of a snow band, right next to a huge fucking lake. Everybody is going to complain about getting snow in April, everybody is going to complain about how cold the winds are, etc... You came into this school knowing that eventually it'd be the complete opposite of Hell, weather-wise.



Oh, so you're a freshmen who got sent to live at the RIT Inn? Again, that's your ass. You didn't submit the housing forms early enough, you didn't submit your deposit, etc... All these things are going to be your fault if you or your parents didn't keep on top of it. You might have a bad roommate, or live on a really loud floor. Again, if you don't speak up, you're going to be living on the floor and with that crappy roommate for the remainder of the academic year. At least confront your roommate first if you have a problem with them, whether it's hygiene related or they're just not adhering to the ""rules"" form you both established during the week of orientation.



Ah, so you didn't get into the class you wanted? Wait list it. Show up to that class with an add/drop form, chances are they can make room for you, especially if it's a class only offered once a year. Make at least 2 or 3 schedules in case you can't manage to get all the classes from the first one. If the class is essential to your major there are going to be at least two sections that you can find a spot in. If they're not essential to your major, tough luck.



People here will say that everybody is super nice, then they'll turn around and start jabbing on those who aren't in their major. We are all friendly here, but some people are full of themselves. They'll pick out a specific group of people and label them, i.e. ""future baristas"", ""neck-beards"" etc... Nobody is really better than anybody else here, but people will think that they are.



Another issue some people have is parking. If you're a freshmen and you live on campus and are complaining about parking, shut your fucking mouth. You park in B and A lot and that's it, unless you put your name in the drawing for the ~100 spots in K lot. If you're a commuter and still complaining about parking... well you shouldn't be. I've been a commuter for over two years and have never complained about parking. So what if I have a class in GCCIS and have to park all the way at the bottom of H or G lot? I don't mind walking, stop being lazy. If you want to have less of a walk pay the $40/q to park in one of the reserved spaces. One thing I've noticed about commuters is that they aren't aware you can park in ANY spot (just not handicap) after 5pm. Parking is NOT enforced after 5pm. Shit park in an admin spot if it's available. Oh that spot in front of Crossroads is available and you plan on staying for 3 hours, fuck it, park there. If you enjoy the walk from the bottom of H/G lot to GCCIS at 6pm in the dead of winter, then so be it, but I'm gonna park in one of those admin spaces because I can. If you get a ticket during the day, well again, that's your ass. Shouldn't have parked there. I've gotten enough tickets in my years here, oh well, pay them or dispute them, move on. Some people still don't realize you get a freebie that you can use anytime you want out of the year. I've gotten a ticket early in the year, paid it, got another and decided to use my freebie on that one because it was $30 vs $18. The only days you should complain about parking is on career fair days or if there's an open house (like today 4/5/13).



If you're here just because you got an amazing financial aid package, then so be it, that's a valid reason, but you shouldn't be restricted to staying here if you hate the place. I would much rather see somebody who hates the school move onto a better school, then see them continue finding all the flaws this university may or may not. I know a lot of you are going to be scared of that ""massive debt"" after graduating, but you got six months to find a job and get off your ass before you're gonna have to start repaying those loans. Everybody is going to be in debt, one way or another. But please, don't just come to this school because you are paying little to none out of pocket. This university has one of the best cooperative education programs in existence, you'd have to be the most unlucky person to not find a job after graduating from this college, even if you're in a major that may be confusing when it comes to job searches. You aren't restricted to what jobs you can get just because of what your degree says. 



Come to this school because it's what you want, it's where you want to succeed at, it's where you think you'll meet your next best friend, it's where you'll meet the professor who made you feel like a star student, it's where you just might find the love of your life, it's where you will find your passion, it's where you will find out who you really are, good or bad.

This has happened on both on campus roads (car roads, not walkways) and roads surrounding campus (most likely RIT kids commuting via bike).

Not only is it dangerous to bike on the wrong side of the road, it's against the law:

&gt; Upon all roadways, any bicycle or in-line skates shall be driven either on a usable bicycle or in-line skates lane or, if a usable bicycle or in-line skates lane has not been provided, **near the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway or upon a usable right-hand shoulder** in such a manner as to prevent undue interference with the flow of traffic except when preparing for a left turn or when reasonably necessary to avoid conditions that would make it unsafe to continue along near the right-hand curb or edge

[Article 34, Section 1234 (a)](http://www.safeny.ny.gov/bike-vt.htm#sec1234)

AKA, ride with traffic, not against it. It's much easier and safer to ride your bike legally on roads. Please do so, and if you see or know someone who doesn't know, please inform them.

Thanks!

Destler Via Email:
&gt;Dear RIT Students, Faculty and Staff, 
In a time when we are increasingly mindful of the rising cost of education it is difficult to justify spending University funds on bottled water, especially when our tap water is free and of very high quality.  Therefore beginning this fall, departments and campus groups will no longer be permitted to spend University dollars on single serving bottles of water.
This policy will be phased in over the next six months to enable departments to plan for and adjust to this change.  Dining services will continue to sell bottled water in vending machines and retail locations throughout the duration of our current vending contract, should individuals chose to spend their own money. However, after the current vending contract expires, no new contracts for bottled water will be entered into.
Water is a healthy beverage choice and a basic human right, which is why water fountains are everywhere on campus; and water is available at fountain locations in dining centers at no cost.  Should you encounter a water fountain that is broken, please report it to facilities management through their [work order system](https://facilities.rit.edu/workordersystem/public/controller.cfc?method=cmdViewWorkRequestForm) so that it can be repaired in a timely manner.  Going forward, future construction and renovation projects will include the installation of hydration stations for easy refilling of reusable water bottles.  NTID has demonstrated leadership in this area and has already installed stations in two of its buildings.  
Exceptions have been written into the policy, as we recognize there may be times when there are no other options. I encourage you to review this policy and the fact sheet about bottled water that has been put together to help answer any questions you may have.  Both can be found on the new [sustainability website](http://www.rit.edu/sustainability/policies). 
RIT has grown to become one of the nation’s largest private universities in the country, and our community serves as an important role model. As I said in my recent letter about RIT’s accomplishments, let’s not be afraid to take advantage of this unique opportunity.
Sincerely yours,
Dr. Bill Destler
Destler@ReplaceItThrice.edu

[Full Policy](http://www.rit.edu/sustainability/policies):
&gt;Bottled water has economic, environmental and social implications. Our municipal tap water, coming from Hemlock Lake, is of high quality and is at least 2000% less expensive than bottled water. Therefore, this policy has been developed to minimize the non-essential use of bottled water. Find out more about bottled water [here](http://www.rit.edu/sustainability/sites/rit.edu.sustainability/files/sites/rit.edu.sustainability/files/BottledwaterFactSheetFinal.pdf).
&gt;
&gt;**Policy**
&gt;
University funds may not be used to purchase **single serving bottles of water**. 
&gt;
&gt;In new construction and renovation projects bottle-less water dispensers will be installed; and the university will explore the feasibility of retrofitting existing buildings with such dispensers.
&gt;
&gt;**Procedures**
&gt;
&gt;This policy applies to all departments, governing bodies, student groups, and any other campus groups that use university funds for catered events or beverage purchases; and will be phased in over six months to provide adequate time to make adjustments.

&gt;**Exceptions**
&gt;
&gt;Dining Services will continue to sell bottled water for the time being to individuals in vending machines, at its retail locations and at sporting events.  It will, however, not provide bottled water for other campus events.  Water is available at fountain locations in dining centers for no cost. After the current vending contract expires, no new contracts for bottled water will be entered into.

&gt;For all other catered operations, bottled water will be replaced with bulk water.  Until alternatives can be identified, box lunches that are intended to be carried elsewhere will be exempt from this policy.

&gt;Other exceptions may be made to this policy, in emergency situations; in cases where there are no reasonable alternatives to access safe drinking water (this may include off campus or out of town events); when there are hydration requirements for individuals outside of RIT facilities; where other legal or contractual reasons are present.

Details:
110cc Baja (Honda clone) pit bike. Silver frame, silver engine, black plastics and black exhaust. 1 down 3 up gearbox, manual with clutch. Kickstart is welded on. Neither front nor rear brakes are connected, and it currently has no chain. Stator cover is cracked near the chain. Clutch mount is cracked. Throttle has a lot of play. Silencer was removed from the exhaust, it's pretty loud.

Again, if you have ANY information, please let me know! Cash rewards may be offered. Email me at chugpuppy at gmail.com with any tips.

It's spring! Well, it is tomorrow. We're all incredibly glad to have this beautiful weather, and as a result, the bikes have come out in force. It's great to see so many people outside instead of cooped up, but a lot of new bikers seem to be unfamiliar with a bunch of unwritten rules at RIT. After some incredibly close calls, I find it necessary to make a PSA, in an effort to teach people about courtesy on a bike, making everyone happier. 

1. If you are using the quarter mile to ride, don't. It's scary as hell to have bikes flying past you if you're on your feet, and the bike path is less crowded anyway!

1. When riding on the bike path, near GCCIS, Building 9/8, etc., stay on the right. It's happened far too many times that someone's been riding all the way on the left in a crowded area, meaning that people who are actually on the right side have nowhere to go. 

1. Unless you're on the bike path, go slow. No one is impressed by flying by them.

1. When using bike racks, take one spot. Not two, not three, one. 

1. Don't lock other people's bikes. It has happened multiple times where I go to my bike, and someone locked their bike to the rack.... right through my frame. D'oh!

1. Say ""Excuse me"" when trying to get through a mass of people. It makes it easier. If they have headphones or are deaf, it wouldn't kill you to stop, let them know you're trying to pass, and they'll let you through. 

Some of these are common sense, but they aren't followed as often as they should. I'm not above breaking these either, and I've had my share of accidental piss-off incidents. I'm just saying, if people actually used some courtesy on a bike (and this goes both ways, pedestrians!), we could all be a bit happier and get to our classes without having a sour run-in with someone else.",,False,self,t5_2qh3x,False,,flairRITchie,True,t3_r5zow,http://www.reddit.com/r/rit/comments/r5zow/a_friendly_message_from_one_biker_to_another/,

-Bad start, used memes

-All info centralized

-Shopping cart appointment, put in as many class as you want, edit later.
Classes preselected so you can just click button and enroll during enrollment appointment.

-Enrollement appointment, begins as 7 am to 5 pm, everyone gets 30 minute slot
150 students per slot. Doesn’t lock you out after 30 mins. You have till end of add/drop to finish enrolling.

-looked at Credit, GPA, still too big a pool to choose from. Best to just randomly choose.

-Can enroll from any computer on campus

-Launches mid april. 

-Wait list, opt in feature. Can wait list 15 units. Similar to unmet needs, but automatic and actually integrated into system.

-This asshole in the front needs to shut up, he’s asking irrelevant questions.

-Swap a class. Once you get schedule you want clear wait list because if you don’t swap will automatically swap classes. 

-Swap doesn’t even sound like a word any more...

-If you’re on the wait list, but don’t have a swap or theres a time conflict, you’ll get skipped over.

-Alphabetical codes will not take effect until semester conversion

-System does not check prerequisites when showing classes
But in shopping cart, press “validate” and will tell you if you can take the course

-Can search by different attributes: start time, day of week, professor, Online, Person, blended

-Degree Audit in with system. No more tiger tracks

-People need to stop questioning the system; RIT didn’t design it.

-Now the asshole is reading a damn book.

-Oh boy, a funny video

-Circle, open class

-Square, closed

-Triangle, wait list

-EMAILLSSSSSSS

-Did he really just ask if they did stress testing?

-Enrollment is open ended. You have more than 30 minutes to enroll, it won’t end until the end of the add/drop period.

As you can see in [this screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/8j00P.png), the first two winners are not people at all. They are HTML links. As such, I think we can all agree that Batman wins by default as the only serious candidate.

The same phenomenon can be seen in [many other elections](http://i.imgur.com/oxNG5.jpg). Indeed, we are proud to announce that Batman will be not only president, but also CAST Senator, CIAS Senator, GCCIS Senator, KGCOE Senator, SCB Senator, and Women's Senator (it's complicated).

Getting uncomfortably close, trying to touch her arms/legs, persistently offering shots when she says ""No,"" etc. I'll tell these guys to buzz off, but they still end up coming back, doing the same things.

Anyway: the tiles on the quarter mile between the clark gym and the campus center are arranged in stripes of lighter and darker tiles. I noticed the other day that the pattern of stripes follows the Fibonacci sequence. i.e. the width of the stripes goes 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 (this repeats a couple times over the length of the tiled area). I guess I should've gotten a picture of it before posting this, because I can't remember if it's the lighter tiles or the darker tiles that follow this pattern, but it doesn't really matter. It's pretty easy to spot once you know what you're looking for.

To the trolls: You're not even remotely funny. At least have a bit of originality...

* 1.The higher the floor the more silence is expected.
* 2. Don't take phone calls on floors 3 &amp; 4. (See above) 
* 3.Although our library is excellent in the fact that you can eat anywhere in it.. save your crinkly chips and other crunching/ munching for the 1st &amp; 2nd floors of the building. (Once again see point 1.) 
* 4. Listening to your music while doing work is a great thing. But once again, don't blare your music if you are on the 3rd of 4th floor. (See point 1.) 
* 5. Don't share a work space with someone if you are a leg jiggler,pencil tapper, fake drum beater, or other tick prone person. That is distracting. Ain't nobody got time for that.
* 6. Group meetups/best friend meet ups/ boyfriend-girlfriend make outs - save this for the first and second floor. ( see point 1.)
* 7. If you don't require an outlet, safe the seats nearest outlets for those who do. 
* 8. Flush the toilets. (Pretty self explanatory.)

Happy Week 9 everyone! Good luck on the rest of your quarter.

Tip your driver. We get paid less than minimum wage and pay for our own gas. We survive on tips. 50 cents doesn't count as a tip. If you tip $1.00 to $1.50 per Zonie we can't complain. 

2. Be polite. We are people too. Also, we remember when people are assholes and you probably will be waiting longer if you are mean. 

3. Answer your phone. If you don't answer the phone number that you gave us, we can't let you know your food is here. 

4. Be where you say you will be. We may be earlier than the estimated delivery time and if you haven't arrived yet, it is incredibly inconvenient. 

5. When a group pools money for food and gives it to you to pay me, don't take any off the top. That is the biggest dick move in the book and it is very obvious when you do it. They aren't paying you for answering the door. 

6. Be prompt. We call you early for a reason, and we are always in a hurry to get other people their food too. When you take ten minutes to get down the stairs, it holds everyone up. 

7. Be neat. This is for when you eat at Zonie's. Please throw your stuff out when you are done. 

8. Don't yell at a driver for an incorrect order. By the time we see it, its already in a bag. 

9. Tips are also accepted in the form of: Beer (unopened), nudity, party invitations, phone numbers, and maybe a quick round of Rock Band or whatever videogame you are playing. 

10. Once again, just be nice and try to tip. If you do you will get your food faster.

We're here, and some of us are looking, but you have to say hello. Or at least don't cower in fear when we do.

Here, easy ways to meet girls on campus:

1. Take a liberal arts course. They're full of girls (and other people to socialize with outside your major) and you need a minor or concentration to graduate anyway.

2. Walk down the quarter mile. Find a girl walking the same way, smile and say hello.

3. Wait in line at any of the campus coffee places. You're waiting, they're waiting, two minutes of guaranteed attention. 

4. Join a club. Clubs have girls with similar interests who meet in one spot on a weekly/monthly basis. Go there. Participate.

5. Change your routine or you'll only be hanging around the same people. (thanks chimera8990!)

6. Go to parties, offer to DD or partner up for the drinking games. (thanks titsntats!)

7. Make friends with girls, even if they're taken, they have friends (thanks sunchatte!)

Now, in general I would find this a pretty skeezy thing for any school to do, but with RIT I find it particularly deplorable, for the following reasons:

**Aren't we already paying for that?** *The answer; yes.* According to the [Admissions Page] (http://www.rit.edu/fa/sfs/billing/tuitionandfees/1213/undergraduate/fulltime.html), every year we pay $32,784 in tuition, $240 in Student Activity Fees, $234 in Health Facilities Fees, and an average $7,607 in Room &amp; Board. And after that whopping $40,865, they have the nerve to ask us current students for extra money to support something on campus? It's shameful and inexcusable.

**What do we get?** *The answer; less than we should.* We are lured in with free swag, free Ben &amp; Jerry's, and the assurance that President Destler will match our contribution. Why not skip all the bells and whistles, and instead direct all the money you're spending on them to the school and student activities instead? President Destler recently wrote an [excellent article] (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-destler/college-competition-_b_1867165.html) on the rising cost of education, and how it is a problem that unnecessary measures are being taken to impress students at their own expense.  I think Bill needs to practice what he preaches.

**Does this school even deserve our money?** *The answer; no.* While I understand that these are touchy issues, I want to remind everyone of the Semester Conversion, the New SIS, and the Plus/Minus Grading debate. In the case of the former, the change was rammed down our throats despite an overwhelming student majority being in opposition. The New SIS was only announced to us very late in the process, and it as put in place with minimal student input. And despite the outpouring of negative feedback, the administration is showing all indications of staying the course. And though the +/- Grading topic has been tabled until after the Semester Conversion is complete, while it was still an active topic the debate once again seemed to be drifting against the student majority of opposition. Now take a moment and try to remember if your academic departments have taken the same approach. Speaking for myself, my major recently had a pretty significant change to our course-list (still under the Quarter system) and this was suddenly announced to us one day with no student input beforehand. Anyone experience something similar? Now ask yourself...does it seem right that our administration routinely ignores our opinions, and then expects us to donate money?

TL;DR: Our administration already charges us a boatload of money, which they proceed to waste in an effort to impress us, while ignoring our opinions. And now they want us to give them MORE money. Will you?

Any interest in fixing it?",gkoberger,57,8,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/rit/comments/rti75/so_we_all_agree_the_new_genesis_is_really_bad_any/,"RIT is stuck. They just spent tens of millions of dollars and two years on this new system, and they aren't getting that money or time back. In 20 years, people will still be using PeopleSoft at RIT. Even if we convinced them how bad it was, there isn't much they can do -- customizing PeopleSoft is crazy expensive, and it's just not a real possibility.

To paraphrase the Joker, ""This college deserves a better class of software."" Let's make it happen.

Is there any interest in working together to create an open source alternative to RIT's new geneSIS?

I know what you're thinking -- this sounds familiar! And it does. Many people have tried. John Resig (Schedule Maker 1.0), Ben Russell (Schedule Maker 2.0), Dan Fenton and Thomas DeMeo (a browser add-on for PeopleSoft?) and even myself (RIT Intersect), to name a few. But the problem with all of them is that they're one(ish) person projects, and they die as soon as the student graduates. That's why I want to start over, and make it completely open source. Anyone can contribute; anyone can keep it going.

PeopleSoft is necessary. No student run project could ever hope to achieve the level of features, stability and support PeopleSoft provides. It now powers the whole school, and will do a solid job of it. However, the interface students use is horrible. No website should require ""training sessions"" and a manual that gives War and Peace a run for its money.

Together, we can fix that. RIT has programmers, designers, marketers, sysadmins and more. Together, we can make an awesome system that fits our so called ""University of One"" like a glove. And it'll be open source! Imagine universities across the country running software made by RIT.

I wouldn't want to stop there. If we can get a good open source community going at RIT, we can make a ton of awesome RIT-related projects. I think we could even figure out a way to get co-ops or course credit for contributors.

We were able to talk about the good and the not so good pertaining to RIT. Here's what I really took out from the conversations we were able to pull from Destler.

1. The semester conversion wasn't made entirely to be like other schools. The biggest factor in the conversion was how it correlates with the co-op program we're so lucky to have. Companies find it much easier to accommodate an intern for a semesters length, rather than a quarters length because it gives them time to actively contribute to something at the company, and it's easier to deal with how other interns from other schools will begin and end at the same time, rather than having a student on the quarter system duck out 5 weeks earlier.
2. Destler also stated that the amount of transfers peaks at the beginning of week 10. The semester conversion will, with hope, grant RIT a higher retention rate for returning students. Originally, by plan, semesters were to be 14 weeks long, but Destler actively fought the faculty against this decision as he wanted to ensure those who were on the quarter system in the past would be able to be comfortable with an equal course load throughout semesters. Granted, Destler basically ""vetoed"" the situation and in turn had semesters become 15 weeks long.
3. Parking is a privilege at RIT. You can complain about having to pay $100 a year to park, and ""nowhere"" to park, or you can go ahead and ask those commuting to UoR who are paying between $400 and $1000 annually to park and in some cases have to continue to take a bus to the building. $100 a year is not a terrible expense, and even buying a reserved single lot pass is still not a terrible expense if you tend to like parking closer.
4. President Destler also stated that since we do not grant full-ride athletic scholarships, we must be more willing to accommodate for future athletes to wear our colors proudly. No money can buy the recognition we received when we made it to the final four, over 50 alumni groups around the country had viewing parties without even letting the school know (until afterwards of course). Nearly half of our alumni have graduated from RIT since 1990, and that's saying a lot for an institution founded in 1829.

It was either taken from a room on CSH or I left it in the Sol laundry room last Thursday (5/2). I was kind of distracted trying to put the finishing touches on my Imagine RIT project, but I remember having it on CSH, making 2 trips to the laundry room, then not having it.

And before you ask, yes, I have filed a Lost Item report with Campus Safety.

I love that jacket, but I would just buy a new one if that's all that was missing. Unfortunately, contained within its pockets is almost everything important that I own- wallet, keys, phone, and such.

**WALLET**: A black standard trifold. Has a little zipper pocket on the back for coins. Contains my license, RIT ID, debit card, library card, Subway card, etc. and about $13. (I am clearly the richest.) Plus some receipts I need to be reimbursed for my Imagine RIT project. 

**KEYS**: A silver carabiner that used to be purple before all the paint scratched off with keys to my apartment, car, bike, parents' house, some CSH stuff, as well as my [iButton](http://www.estexpert.com/image/mypic_customize/i_button.jpg)

**PHONE**: A Droid Incredible 2 with a [custom-painted Tardis case](http://alliekins.imgur.com/tardisphone) that is significantly more beat up now- much of the paint has chipped, but it should still be recognizable as a Tardis. It has so many pictures that I haven't uploaded, texts and contacts, stuff I can never get back.

**OTHER**: 1 pair of original Zune earbuds and a USB wireless dongle.

Please, if you did laundry in Sol on Thursday night between 7PM and 12AM and you think you saw my jacket, or picked it up, or might have grabbed it accidentally in your laundry pile, let me know. Alternately, if you stole my jacket, I'll won't be mad if you just return some or all of my things. Message me, or turn it in to Campus Safety. I'll even buy you a garbage plate or something.

And just in case somebody did steal my things, please be on the lookout for people selling any of the above. But honestly, if they did, it's a pretty shitty haul.

1349557427.0,42,self.rit,1123c9,How to properly lock a bike,BinaryMn,56,14,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/rit/comments/1123c9/how_to_properly_lock_a_bike/,"Today, I had a freshman student new to the area (and likely, new to the country) approach me as I was getting off my bike in front of Gleason Hall. He had recently bought a new bike and it had come outside to find that it had been stolen and was completely aghast. I just happened to be the first person on a bike he saw and he wanted answers.

I quickly found out that the student had locked his bike up with a simple cable lock and gave him a good 10 minute explanation and demonstration on why you never want to use a cable lock and to invest in a u-lock. Then I called public safety since he had the paperwork from the store he bought the bike from with the model and serial number, but I digress.

I'm writing this for everyone here for two reasons:

1. I've seen a few other threads here about stolen bikes lately
1. I could have cut every single bike loose off the rack his bike had been locked to with a pair of bolt cutters in less than a half hour

Seriously, not one bike was locked up with a u-lock and almost every bike had quick releases on both rims. Even worse, almost every bike was locked up by the frame. Any idiot could make over a $100 by swiping all theses unlocked rims in less than a half hour.


So, let me begin.

* Lesson number one. **Buy a u-lock! Do not use a cable lock.**

Cable locks keep honest people from running away with your bike. I'm not joking. If you don't believe me, go buy a pair of bolt cutters and try cutting your lock with them. If you can break it, what's stopping any other person with a pair of bolt cutters?

* Lesson number two. **Lock your bike up correctly!**

I took these at random unnamed racks located on the campus after campus safety showed up to take a report from the student that had his bike stolen. I'm not trying to be a dick, but [this](http://i.imgur.com/EJsbT.jpg) [is](http://i.imgur.com/2jbwi.jpg) [pathetic](http://imgur.com/QfKlq). If you're going to use a cable lock, don't be an idiot -- especially if you have quick releases. RUN THAT CABLE THROUGH THE RIM AND FRAME!

* Lesson number three. **How to properly lock a bike!**

For starters, you need a u-lock, but there's more. Never EVER just lock the bike through the top tube. Lock the back from to the frame and lock it to a bike rack or pole like [this](http://i.imgur.com/ugKLh.jpg). And if you have quick release skewers, [replace them with bolts](http://i.imgur.com/vuujh.jpg).

If you have a bike, go get it right now and flip it upside down. There's a serial number stamped into the bottom of the bottom bracket shell. Take a picture and e-mail it to yourself. If it's ever stolen, file a police report and contact campus security. I'm also pretty sure that RIT will register your bike for you for free, otherwise it's $10.

Another thing to know is that there's a bicycle co-op downtown called R Community Bikes. If you show up on one of the days their open to the public, you can get a free bike if you have a police report. It won't be brand new, but at least it'll be a working bike.

tl;dr: Don't use a cable lock. Buy a u-lock. Don't lock your bike up like an idiot.

If any students that know of any other specific campus resources, please post them here. Also, one last thing.

If you're reading this and have a friend with a bike that locks it up with a cable lock, give them an earful and tell them to buy a u-lock.",,False,self,t5_2qh3x,1350693012.0,,flair,True,t3_1123c9,http://www.reddit.com/r/rit/comments/1123c9/how_to_properly_lock_a_bike/,

&gt;Can anyone explain to me how a hockey program as classy as Rochester Institute of Technology’s Tigers could give rise to a fan base so completely devoid not only of class, sportsmanship and common courtesy, but basic patriotism as well? During the singing of the national anthem, the last line of which is, “And the home of the brave,” the cretinous crowd of RIT supporters shouts over the vocalist, “And the home of the Tigers!”

&gt;When the “Star-Spangled Banner” is being sung, that is a time for us to stand together as Americans, put aside all our petty differences and honor our country — not act like a pack of infantile morons. Such antics are not understandable fan enthusiasm, not acceptable adult behavior and not funny. It is a smear on RIT’s fine hockey program and wrong on every level.

If there are classes I'm required to take for my major that center around business policies and ethics, then there should be a class called ""Email 101"" that every faculty member is required to take. It's not just the unnecessary emails that can be disabled in the message center, it's practically every email I receive these days.

* The subject is often completely vague and rarely describes what the message is about. That is if it even has a subject.
* Almost every message I've gotten recently consists of a giant, 10,000x10,000 pixel image of what appears to be a scan or PDF of a poster.
* I've gotten multiple emails this year that have been sent three or four times because each time it is resent, the sender says ""Sorry, forgot to add ___."" Read and proofread before sending!
* There is a difference between CC and BCC, learn it. I'm tired of an email that's three sentences taking up five screen lengths because you CC'd the entire department.
* When you forward an email to someone, erase your private messages below. I've gotten five or six emails this quarter alone that have been forwarded by a faculty member with a whole conversation thread attached between that faculty member and other faculty members or even students.
* Learn to spell.
* If I don't reply to the first email about an event, chances are I don't need three more reminders about it over the course of the week.

Sorry for the rant, but it just seems ridiculous that we go to a tech school and nary a faculty member can properly use email that's been around for over two decades.

I have missed you all dearly. This is John (aka Conrad Conkledairy) from 2cookies1buck. For those of you who do not know who I am, I started a cookie delivery business at RIT in Spring semester of 2010. I graduated that year and it made me really sad to leave such an awesome business behind, but I had a full time job lined up at IBM and didn't think cookies were *the future*. Welp, I got fed up with programming after about a year and quit in September to get back in the cookie game. 

Unfortunately, I am not coming back to RIT. I AM SORRY. However, if you or any of your friends are now in Somerville, MA, you're in luck! I am starting my cookie business there tomorrow night around Tufts University. You can find more details on my [website](http://www.haveasweetidea.com). Right now it's a piece of crap (any web designers want to work for COOKIES!?) but that wil change. I also did an [AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/ow6yg/i_am_starting_a_cookie_delivery_business_in/) on /boston earlier today to help promote my operation.

I wanted to let you all know about what I'm doing because I could never have got to this point without all of you. The support that you all offered me was so incredibly awesome and running 2cookies1buck was the greatest experience of my life, no question. Thank you to every single person who ordered cookies in those short ten weeks. You all helped convince me that this is what I really need to do. I have no idea if this will actually work as a real business. I know according to my numbers it will work, but there are no guarantees. I hope that eventually I can serve you all again someday!

The theme is now live at http://www.reddit.com/r/ritmethod/

Tits&amp;tats suggested a tiger themed alien instead of the tiger logo (~~and the admins may require that we keep him in there, too~~), so there's that.

The orangered brick was tweaked a little, per TheGrayCoat's feedback.

People seem to think the tiger background is most appropriate/professional, so I moved WWIAFTM to the footer.

The orangered envelope is now also a brick.

I can do more with the header, but I wanted to err on the side of simplicity for now. I'd love to have the tube guy background be animated, but that could be a little over the top. If they'd let us, a konami code easter egg would be awesome as well.

A new school year has started, and with the new year have come hundreds of new subscribers and along with them a few problems that need to be addressed. 

I'm going to lay out a few rules, that really should be common sense, but that I think need to be broadcast to everyone -- especially the newbies. 

* ***NO POSTING SOMEONE'S PERSONAL INFORMATION*** This means *any* personal information. First name, last name, mother's maiden name, address, [facebook link](http://facebook.com/profile.php?=73322363), I don't care what it is... if it can be used to tie a reddit account back to a real person it will be removed. (That said, if someone's reddit account name is JoeSchmoe123 and you say ""Hey Joe!"" -- I'll let that slide.) Seriously though... personal info is a no no. ***[EDIT]: [Just in case people don't know, this isn't our rule. The admins can and will ban people for this.](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/07/on-reddiquette.html)***

* ""Hey /r/rit I want to do [insert illegal activity here] and get away with it, any tips"" -- It actually pains me a little to have to say this, but nothing you do on the internet is anonymous; you have no way of knowing who else is reading this board. There *are* members of the administration that troll through here every now and then. Posts like these, again, will be removed. Ask your neighbor if they know who makes quality fake IDs -- not /r/rit. 

* ***THE FIRST RULE OF FIGHT CLUB IS THAT YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT FIGHT CLUB*** -- If you don't know what I'm talking about, PM me or ask someone who does. This matter (filesharing) will not be discussed publicly. Your post will be removed.

* Play nice. If you disagree with someone there's no reason to turn it into a heated debate. [Please refer to this flowchart](http://www.notquitewrong.com/rosscottinc/2011/08/03/so-youre-mad-about-something-on-the-internet/)

* If you haven't read the [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) before, read it now. 


*If you're unsure about whether or not your post is acceptable it probably isn't... but PM either myself or titsntats and we can let you know if it's worth your time to make the post or not.*

This is not an all-inclusive list, but these are issues we've had to deal with several times in the past few weeks. Titsntats and I are busy people, please try to make our 'jobs' as easy as possible.

* I wish that they would teach people to use Google Docs. I feel like I always get that *one* person in the group that doesn't know how to use it, thus forcing us to do endless e-mail chains to coordinate the final group project papers/powerpoints. 

(Or even better...since Google Docs is a bit limited when you're doing more formatty stuff...Dropbox /[innocently drops referral code](http://db.tt/D9wzaFcH)/)

* But for when even the cloudiest of computing won't do and I'm forced to see you in-person to get this done, a simple [Doodle survey](http://doodle.com/) is a lot better for finding meeting times than more of this endless e-mailing. (BTW If you are on an e-board and you want to be all democratic about meeting times and whatnot use this or something similar and stop tormenting your fellow members. Kthnx)

* I wish they would teach people that the library tables with the [neon green tape at the end](http://i.imgur.com/8xgR8.jpg) and a the [green arrow outlet sign](http://i.imgur.com/zXwKo.jpg) have power strips UNDERNEATH THE TABLE ITSELF. So **don't** unplug the whole table for your one laptop when there's like 12 other people sitting there. Use the damn power strip.

* Group meetings should not be held on the ""quiet"" floors of the library. Stop being a douche. Some of us have problems with concentration and actually need the deathly silence (as in actual peace and quiet, not just blasting music to drown you out) in order to concentrate, if it weren't for that, I would be studying at home.

* I also wish they would either simplify the bus schedules or show people how to use them. For example, I had no idea there was a late night shuttle available back to my apartment since it was hidden on the RIT Inn/Racquet Club schedules of all places (but hey, it only took me like 3 years to find it).

* Embrace your RIT e-mail address or at least set up forwarding. If I am e-mailing you instead of texting you, I likely don't want to know nor use your personal yahoo/hotmail/gmail. I'd rather just look up your name in the RIT e-mail system in 2 seconds and send my message that way instead of trying to find wherever the hell I wrote down your weird seXxXymunkielykesdick6969@hotmail.com address.

With less than a month until the new semester, we wanted to revamp some of the features on this subreddit to improve content and make it a better place for discussion on RIT. There are several new features that are now in place:

- Comment scores will be hidden for 3 hours after posting to reduce ""initial bandwagon/snowball voting""- when a people downvote a comment that has already gotten a few downvotes or vice-versa.

- New flair options are available! You can add flair by clicking on the (edit) button under ""Show my flair on the subreddit"" on the sidebar. You can have both text and image flair.

- Some graphical changes to the sub (picture on the sidebar, new submit buttons, etc.)

- For all of you analytic types, you can now check out the traffic stats of /r/rit right [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/rit/about/traffic)

---------------

Our biggest change coming up is the addition of three new weekly threads that we will be posting for the duration of the school year, starting right before Orientation Week (Orientation Starts Tues Aug 20, First post will be the 19th.) We are looking into the possibility to have them auto-posted by AutoModerator in the future. The breakdown of the weekly posts is as follows:

On Monday there will be a Weekly Event Thread, where you can post information on events for the following week. You can post details on club events, things happening around Rochester such as concerts or festivals, or even use this thread to get some people to meet-up and try something new! Ever been to the [Indoor Trampoline Park](http://www.skyzone.com/Buffalo) in Buffalo (or the one that's coming to Rochester! thanks, /u/ScumbagRIT)? How about the exotic and tropical plants over at the [Lamberton Conservatory](http://rocwiki.org/Lamberton_Conservatory) at Highland Park?  


There will be a Weekly General Discussion Thread every Wednesday, where you can discuss anything, RIT-related or not. Ask a question on a class or housing contract, or discuss your favorite music, game or TV show (just be sure to use the spoiler tag- *\[This is a spoiler sentence.](/spoiler)* ).

There will also be a weekly ""Show Off"" thread on Fridays, where you can show off some of the work you've accomplished during the week. Something for a class, club, work, or even just something you're proud of from a hobby in your spare time! Post a story or share your artwork, videos, songs, and more!

2. *Really* don't drive unless you have to in low visibility settings
3. Get winter tires. Don't get just two, get all four.
4. Take it slower than normal. If that means going less than the speed limit, suck it up. This goes doubly for turning.
5. Keep your headlights on whenever the skies aren't clear. (But NOT your bright lights)
6. Get Winter wiper blades if possible. They clear snow better.
7. Even if the road doesn't have snow on it, it could still be icy. It's called [black ice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_ice) and it gets too many unprepared winter drivers every year.
8. Leave plenty of distance between your car and the one ahead of you. Things can suddenly happen in winter driving and you don't want to be slamming on the brakes. That just makes it worse.
9. Accelerate and brake *slowly*.
10. Get an ice scraper and snow brush.
11. Start up your car and turn the rear defroster on before you start scraping. By the time you're done scraping the sides and front, there shouldn't be any ice on the rear windshield. If there is, it'll be loosened up.

Fox's keynote was hijacked,pixelSHREDDER,45,7,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/rit/comments/leijm/that_last_question_at_michael_j_foxs_keynote_was/,"If anyone else found that last ""question"" a little random, it's because the woman who asked it cut in line at the expense of one of my friends in order to put out her weird little rant.

For those who weren't there, at the end of MJF's speech (which was great, btw) he opened the floor up to questions. They made the askers form 2 lines and gave each line a mic. Everyone asked their questions (many of which were also great), and when they announced the next question would be the last question, my friend was next in line and it was her line's turn. 

Now my friend happens to be a recent grad who loves MJF so much she came back to RIT specifically to hear him speak, and for the chance to ask him a question. So, naturally, she was thrilled. But before she could start speaking, the woman in the other line cut her off- and what she said was mind-bogglingly stupid. I'm paraphrasing, but it went something like this: 

""This isn't really a question, but my husband has Parkinson's, and i went to a hospital administrator's meeting- did you know that on their invoices, they have a line item that says how profitable their Parkinson's patients are?"" MJF just looks at her like, ""Are you kidding?"" for like 5 seconds before finally giving her a broad answer about his foundation's work.

I felt so bad for my friend, who lost her chance to speak with one of her idols, and I also feel bad for Michael J., who had to come up with a response to that woman's stupidity. I also can't get my head around what the hell that woman was thinking. Did she think she was being clever, like she was exposing some great corruption in the health care system? She clearly had no clue whatsoever how hospitals operate, and didn't bother to do any sort of research before bringing her all-important discovery to Mr. Fox's attention, at the expense of my friend's time on the mic she actually waited for.

I guess the moral of my rant is this: can we please have some sort of question vetting from the moderators before they're asked, and can the moderators maybe do a better job of organizing the question askers, so we can keep incidents like this from repeating themselves?",,False,self,t5_2qh3x,False,,flair,True,t3_leijm,http://www.reddit.com/r/rit/comments/leijm/that_last_question_at_michael_j_foxs_keynote_was/,

BarCamp is almost like Reddit, but IRL. People meet at one place to discuss ideas, show off projects, or tell stories. While people are encouraged to give presentations, you aren't forced to. It is entirely up to you. Althought we do have lots of technical talks, we are looking to hear about your greatest passions - technical or not.

Every event I seem to meet awesome people. Some of the talks that stick out in my mind was “How to Survive the Zombie Apocalypse”, “History if Cotton Candy”, and lightning talks hosted by Interlock Rochester.

BarCamp is Saturday October 29th, from 8:00am-6:00pm at RIT in the GCCIS building. Feel free to stop by anytime to check out the event. While its completely **free**, please be sure to sign up at [www.barcamproc.org](http://www.barcamproc.org) - it gives a head count for food and shirts.

I don't know if people have acted worse than this to cause the email, or if this is just normal behavior, but come on. TE3 riders are (presumably) 21+, so we should have enough respect for the bus drivers, SG and the people who keep downtown clean and running.

It’s frustrating for me to have to moderate things like saying someone’s name but guess what? It’s a rule of Reddit, not the subreddit. If anything were to happen, I would be held accountable for it, which is why I’m such a hardass about it. I would really appreciate if EVERYONE would just follow the simple rule of not posting other users personal information. I don’t care how easy it is to find their information from their handle or if you know them in person, **do not post their name or any other personal information**.  It kills me that I can go on just about any thread knowing that there will be a violation which is really unacceptable. Also, giving me attitude and fighting with me about it isn’t going to make me change the rules (I can’t) or stop enforcing them. If you don’t like it, don’t post someone’s personal information. It’s that easy.

Another thing I want to talk to everyone about is how we’re treating one another on here. I’m publically apologizing for how immature I acted on the notetakers thread (I wasn’t mod status when I posted on it but it should be said regardless). Back on topic, I’ve noticed a lot of shitty behavior towards one another as have other users. Blatantly calling people names and being condescending (it’s a personality flaw) about anything and everything seem to be the new thing on here. Not cool. Let’s take a que from Thumper (from Bambi) and if you can’t say something nice, don’t say nothin’ at all. Basically, if you can’t say something without calling someone a “bitch”, telling someone they’re “forever alone”, or claiming that you “have to be a dick”; you shouldn’t say it because you look like an asshat. I feel like I have to talk about this because I’ve received a few messages from distraught users, one went so far as to delete their account and apparently will never use Reddit again because of how they were treated by another user.  Whether or not they were overreacting to the situation, I do not want *anyone* to ever feel unsafe or unwelcomed on here. If there is ever a situation where you feel something is up on here, please contact xb4r7x or I. This is an amazing community and I think that gets taken for granted a bit too often.  

And lastly, shirts. Again…shirts. Yeah. So I stated in the original thread that it was a sore subject for me, assuming people would take the hint. It apparently made a WHOOSH and nobody caught on that I really have no urge to deal with shirts, hence it is sore subject. The short version of events was first time I brought it up I was torn to shreds, second time never went anywhere, and third time we got some good feedback but I wasn’t mod yet and the people “running” the show were not doing much of anything. Because of all that, my rule is if shirts were ever brought up again, when I felt like I could handle doing it all myself with a graphic designer/whoever can photoshop, I’d look into it. I already have to deal with the hell of group projects in class, I really don’t need that drama from here. I hope everyone understands and respects how I feel about this.

B&amp;N is legally required to show ISBNs on their website now.  However, to screw us over more, they publish them as images (which can't easily be copied and pasted).  So, I wrote a little script that will automatically convert and link them.  Enjoy!

You need [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748/) for Firefox or Chrome 4+ (or a similar addon).  This will automatically convert ISBNs and add links anytime you go to a college B&amp;N site.

It seems Midnight Oil has been slowly rotating Sugar Mountain cupcakes every day, so if you can't make it out to their shop on Alexander this is a great way to get your fix.


I just recently saw this getting coffee today, so figured I'd pass along the good news if anyone doesn't know.

Now I'm under two leases and I can't get out of the Park Point one until I find someone to replace me. So, once again....

You'd be the 4th person living there, your own room, $710/mo until May 31st. This is a lease take over, NOT a sublet. This means the apartment would entirely be yours and you would pay the full rent. You'd move in as soon as possible and only pay for the partial month for moving in at such an odd time. Only girls, I repeat, ONLY GIRLS can move in (stupid crap prevents guys from taking my place). Contact me at clm7324@rit.edu, ASAP.

1329443443.0,31,self.rit,pt82l,"For the majority who missed it: Destler's latest statements on hockey, UC, Riverknoll, tuition",FifthFleetOut,34,3,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/rit/comments/pt82l/for_the_majority_who_missed_it_destlers_latest/,"Here are a few of the questions that were posed to Dr. D when he was in the Fireside Lounge for Ask Destler on Wednesday. Questions were provided prior to and during the show. The interviewer, Arun, was provided by WITR. They were joined by Bob Finnerty. The following is taken from the first half of the interview.

**Hockey Broadcasting**

  *Destler:* I was just going to ask WITR... you don't [broadcast] for the women, is this a gender discrimination problem at WITR?

 *Arun:* It's certainly not a gender discrimination thing at all. We'd love to work through the channels to be able to at some point host the women's Division I hockey games. For now, I know they are covered by another streaming radio club on campus, so I know we already have resources in place at RIT.

 *Destler:* Well I'd like to see the audience expanded, so anything you can do in that regard I'd appreciate.

**UC Card Access**

 *Arun:* Housing has recently installed card access swipers to UC. What is the reasoning behind this and will the rest of the on campus apartments have swipers installed?

 *Destler:* We are trying to be consistent with the type of swipe access we use in the dormitories already, so I think that's a primary motivation. Really, it's all about student safety. I think the primary issues have been related to: What if the pizza guy comes and can't get in and can't get to the apartment door, especially at places like the Commons... if you can't get through the first line of defense how can you even knock on the door? We're going to have to look at that issue and see to what extent we can address that issue. It's all motivated by our attempt to provide the best and most safe and secure environment for our students... and I wouldn't be surprised to see this move on to the other housing units, especially apartment units, but that doesn't mean that we can't learn from this experience and provide a solution that is satisfactory for all involved.

 *Arun:* How will that transfer over, for example, to the Colony Manor apartments? Not all of those have access doors before you get to the actual apartments.

 *Destler:* It would be easier there, actually, because you'd just have swipe access to the actual apartment. I think it really depends on the system we decide to employ.

 *Arun:* Would we then do away with the keys?

 *Destler:* We could. It really depends on if the economics make any sense. For example, Colony Manner is in bad need of an overhaul, or maybe a dozing and reconstruction (laughs). So I think that those type of issues will come along and we'd have to decide if it's worth making the investment.

**Riverknoll**

 *Arun:* Speaking of dozing, how is the progress for Riverknoll going?

 *Destler:* Riverknoll is interesting. We, as you know, took down half of Riverknoll to build Global Village. We're probably going to start digging a hole in the ground for the new ice arena some time early next Fall. In order to accommodate the parking -- we'll need to lose some parking for the space we're trying to put the arena in -- we're likely to take down a few more units of Riverknoll. So if your objective is to see Riverknoll gradually go away, it's clear that the next step is likely to happen some time next Fall.

**Tuition**

 *Arun:* I want to skip to one of our more serious questions. ""Rising tuition costs have become a major worry for U.S. society. What measures are being taken to minimize tuition increases at RIT?""

 *Destler:* It's a very important question and we're trying to move aggressively to try to get some kind of cross containment mechanism in place. You don't want to lower the quality of your program, so the next question is: can you maintain the quality of the program offering to students and, at the same time, not spend all the money you do currently on providing those offerings? For example, there's some low hanging fruit in various areas. We're about to install about 20,000 LEDs to replace long tube fluorescents in areas where those fluorescents are on all the time, such as in this room. Those consume about 40% less energy, so over the long haul that's a real money saver for the campus. So we'll continue to look for those kinds of options. We'll look for opportunities to consolidate units -- maybe use fewer administrators to administrate certain functions of the university. You don't want to cut down on the faculty, we're not talking about downsizing the institution. We are talking about trying to be more efficient in the way we operate. This year I set a goal, because the last two years our tuition increases have been 4.5 and 4.3 percent... this year I set a goal for our planning group which does our budget planning to get the increase down to between 3.5 and 4 percent and I think we'll be there. That's encouraging, but it's not enough. We need to find ways to lessen the burden, though even when we do have these raises in tuition we take a lot of the money we raise and stick it right back into financial aid for those students who need it most.",,False,self,t5_2qh3x,False,,flair,True,t3_pt82l,http://www.reddit.com/r/rit/comments/pt82l/for_the_majority_who_missed_it_destlers_latest/,

I noticed the announcement that went out last week said that the Bubble Tea at Sol's was going to be a one time event.  This was incorrect.  We will be having it Monday, Wednesday and Thursday's starting at 6pm. This is still a bit of trial run of offering it, so if you are interested in it becoming a permanent thing, please come down regularly!

Also, we were given permission to run discounts on a lot of non-food items until the end of the quarter (we have sheets posted around Sol's as to what qualifies).  So if you need to stock up on essentials, now is probably a good time to do so.


Also also, if you have suggestions of things you want to see at Sol's, let us know please via the suggestion box near the register.  Salads, parfaits and bubble tea are some of the new things we're trying, but it'd be nice to know what the students are looking for from us.",,False,self,t5_2qh3x,False,,flair,True,t3_18rcn6,http://www.reddit.com/r/rit/comments/18rcn6/bubble_tea_sols/,
