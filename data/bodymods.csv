We need to talk. Lately, we've had some problems with users making negative (and sometimes, downright cruel) comments to users, on subjects unrelated to their modifications. Comments about the size or shape of body parts, weight, body hair, etc.

**This will not be tolerated.**

People judge us for our modifications often enough. We are denied jobs, shunned in public, or forced to hide them from relatives and friends. We should know what it's like, and being mean to each other is absurd.

**Effective immediately, any and all outwardly cruel comments to other users regarding their personal appearance (unrelated to the state of their piercings or other modifications) will be removed immediately and the offending user will be *banned*.** 

One strike, people. No second chances.

To be clear, comments on a user's personal appearance for purposes of recommending an aesthetically pleasing piercing are fine -- for instance, ""I think a septum piercing would be less than flattering on your face; maybe play up your lips/eyes/whatever instead?"" is fine, but ""Damn girl, your nose is all fucked up, don't draw attention to that,"" is not. We're not saying you have to be all kittens and rainbows and afraid to disagree with people, but we *are* saying you have to be constructive with your criticisms. 

If you see such a comment, please use the ""Report"" button and follow it up with a message to the moderators, including a link to the post and an explanation of why you reported it. We see a lot, but unfortunately, we can't be everywhere. Making this subreddit a better place requires you to help us out a little. 

**Additionally, we would like to see more credit given to artists** -- this is not a rule, just a friendly suggestion. Piercing well does take skill and experience, and it would be nice to see artists being honored for their work! You can include the name of the artist and shop in the title of your post, or in the description of your imgur link. 

**As this is a self post for which I receive no karma, please upvote for maximum visibility.**",,False,,t5_2qj5t,False,,,True,t3_19akyn,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodymods/comments/19akyn/mostpost_new_rule_effective_immediately/,moderator

However, we seem to have acquired a number of new users who didn't get the memo.

We really, really should not have to tell the community to be kind to one another. We're not asking you to vomit happiness and sparkles all over the keyboard every time you post here, you don't have to agree all the time. What we DO require is that you don't call each other names, or make judgmental comments about people's bodies. We're all adults here, let's act like it. 

**From the original Modpost:**

&gt;**Effective immediately, any and all outwardly cruel comments to other users regarding their personal appearance (unrelated to the state of their piercings or other modifications) will be removed immediately and the offending user will be banned.**
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;One strike, people. No second chances.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;To be clear, comments on a user's personal appearance for purposes of recommending an aesthetically pleasing piercing are fine -- for instance, ""I think a septum piercing would be less than flattering on your face; maybe play up your lips/eyes/whatever instead?"" is fine, but ""Damn girl, your nose is all fucked up, don't draw attention to that,"" is not. We're not saying you have to be all kittens and rainbows and afraid to disagree with people, but we are saying you have to be constructive with your criticisms.

If you come across an abusive comment, use the ""Report"" button and follow up with a message to the moderators. We want this community to be a safe place for people to share their modifications, without being judged.

(rant),recapthenrelapse,74,14,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodymods/comments/19po09/harassed_rant/,"I have two retail jobs meaning I constantly have to deal with the public. Even though facial piercings are not allowed at either of my jobs, management looks past my high nostrils and 1inch stretched ears because I'm an actual value to both companies. (I mean not to toot my own horn or anything but toot toot :P) Anyways, a few days I was harassed two separate times throughout the day.




1. I was waiting on a lady and taking her order for copying. (One of my jobs is in a print shop) I wear the gem front plugs so that you can barely tell I have my ears stretched. They look more just like big, flashy diamond earrings. Anyways, I pulled my hair back while talking to her and put it behind my ears and this lady goes APESHIT. She started screaming, ""OH DEAR GOD BLESS YOUR SOUL. WHY WOULD YOU EVER DO SUCH AN AWFUL THING TO YOUR BODY? etc."" Then proceeds to tell me how I'm going to hell and that I should be ashamed of myself. She then storms off to find a manager who finishes her order because she refuses to let me get anywhere near her without screaming that I'm going to hell.



2. Later that night, I was at the movies (that's my second job) and this guy starts raising hell about my nose piercings. Granted, he wasn't really being mean about it. More like ""Good gawd girl, ain't that hurt?"" (Oh, I'm from West Virginia BTW) I just kind of laughed it off, told him it wasn't too bad, and then told him to have a good day thinking the encounter was over. He continues to stand there and then starts asking me questions that gradually get inappropriate.

Guy: You got any tats?

Me: Yeah a few. (Shows him my half sleeve)

Guy: Got any anywhere else?

Me: Yeah, my foot and my leg.

Guy: Well you got a stud in your tongue too?!

Me: Nope.

Guy: Well why not?

Me: Because I don't...want...one?

Guy: I bet I know where else you got a stud. (He raises his eyebrows at me)

Me: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. That's quite an assumption. (I walk to the back, out of sight, and stay there until I see him leave.)
 






How is this acceptable adult behavior? 
Just because I have piercings on my face doesn't mean you automatically have the right to be rude and invasive. 

SIGH. 
Sorry guys. 
Had to get it out. 
Any similar stories about ignorant people?

The survey is [here.](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/VJ6MWZ3)

Voicing your opinion in the comments here is fine, but doing so *will not* count towards either side's argument. This survey will remain active for one week. At that point, we will either remove the global tag or leave it up. If it is removed, there will be additional discussion to determine what should be tagged as NSFW and how those rules should be enforced.

As you may have noticed, the global NSFW tag has been removed from this subreddit. This means we will be laying down some ground rules, also determined by the results of the survey.

Since removing the global NSFW tag means we also have to remove the 18+ restriction (and since there were so many people who voted not to remove the tag), we will be fairly strict in our moderation of improperly tagged posts. Before we discuss what actions will be taken in the case of rules violations, let's talk about the rules themselves.

**Henceforth, the following things will be considered NSFW, and should be tagged as such:**

* Any sexually suggestive images.

* All images of suspensions.

* Images of genital modifications, including the pubic mound, male and female nipples.

* Images of blood, gore, or severe infection.

* Images of fresh or healing scarification. 

* Images of modifications in progress. 

* Images of tattoos that depict violence or sexual material.

* Self posts discussing genital modifications, or containing in-text links to any of the aforementioned NSFW topics.

There will be situations where an image of a SFW piercing becomes NSFW. For instance, if you upload a picture of your hip piercings but you are wearing lingerie, that is NSFW. Tag it. All of these rules will be in the sidebar shortly.

**What happens when you don't tag your post appropriately:**

* First offenders will get a warning, and we will tag the post as NSFW.

* On second offense, the post will be tagged and the user will be temporarily banned.

* If a user routinely neglects to tag their posts appropriately, he or she will receive a permanent ban.

Handling rule breakers in this way will be a trial run. If it becomes too much trouble for us to keep track of who's been warned how many times, we will handle things the way /r/wtf does: **offending posts will be deleted without warning.**

Err on the side of safety with your tagging. If you're not sure whether or not something you want to post is NSFW, tag it anyway. There really was NO solid agreement on the definition of NSFW; almost everyone had a slightly different opinion. Everyone has a different work environment, and many things that are perfectly okay where you work could be worth firing someone over at another workplace. 

**As always, please upvote this self post, for which I receive no karma, in order to ensure maximum visibility to all members of the community.**

**Edit:** I have turned off image thumbnails. Let me know how you feel about that.",,True,,t5_2qj5t,True,,,True,t3_pgsg9,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodymods/comments/pgsg9/nsfw_survey_results_and_new_rules/,moderator

My question that I forgot to ask, and it's too late to call, is; I work at Petland and their policy on piercings is that, you can have them but they don't want them showing.

Easy peasy! I can just flip it. But, I just got it today, and it's flipped up right now because I had a shift tonight, and I'm just wondering, can I let it heal like that?

1336615921.0,31,self.bodymods,tfs0q,"Hey all, just a little bit of advice on stretching your ear lobes. Take it or leave it.",rxyzyxr,43,12,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodymods/comments/tfs0q/hey_all_just_a_little_bit_of_advice_on_stretching/,"I've been stretching my ears for a little under 5 years now, and am coming up on the 2"" mark. Here's some advice that I wish I could give to myself when I was first starting out. Most of you probably know this stuff already, and that is great! This post is directed more at people that are just starting out or are confused about some things when it comes to stretching their ears. Hope this helps!

First and foremost, if you are thinking about stretching your ears but haven't gotten them pierced yet, make sure to tell the piercer that you're planning on stretching. A regular ear piercing is in a different spot than a piercing meant for stretching, and the tiny bit of extra space you get can do wonders, believe me.

Second, take your fucking time. It is SO NOT a race. SERIOUSLY. You might not realize it at first, but it is WAY better to have slightly smaller lobes that are fatter and healthier than to have bigger lobes that are as thin as a string (or even worse, with a gnarly blowout on each one). Just take your time and listen to your body. The only part of having stretched ears that is supposed to hurt is when you get it pierced. The rest of the time, no pain whatsoever should be experienced. At the very most, it will be SLIGHTLY uncomfortable for a couple minutes when you put another layer of tape on your plugs. It is very important to listen to your body when stretching. If your ears feel sore at all, or if there are visible cuts on your ears, you need to stop immediately and wait a few days. Downsizing is your best friend. It might not seem like it because sometimes it can be unbearable to undo the progress you've made, but downsizing works magic on your ears. Not only do your ears get to relax, therefore allowing the cut/sore/swollen tissue to heal (especially if sea salt soaks are applied), but your ear lobes will also get thicker if you downsize frequently. If you're always stretching up and don't take your plugs out or anything, your lobes will be really stressed out and eventually become quite thin, and maybe suffer from necrosis or even just rip from the stress. It's pretty simple, really. If the muscles in your legs were sore and tender, you wouldn't go out for a run. So why would you keep stretching your ear lobes if they felt like shit? Just give them some time to recuperate. Trust me, the time it takes to downsize and re-tape back up to size is nothing compared to the time it'll take your ears to get back to normal if you push them too hard.

Don't use sketchy shit as plugs/to stretch with. Anything that isn't made out of surgical grade stainless steal, glass, quality wood/stone, or Teflon should not be going in your ears. That includes basically every kind of plastic in existence. Know how you can go in Hot Topic and buy a pair of 00g acrylic plugs for like, $14? DON'T DO IT. You would not believe how bad that shit is for your ear lobes! If you wear acrylic plugs for long enough, they will break down inside your ears. When the plugs do this, not only are poisonous fumes released into your skin, but the plugs themselves start to become porous, which in turn sucks the flesh of your ear into through a vacuum (on a microscopic level, of course).

When you're stretching at first it's ok to use tapers (simply to stretch with, not to actually wear), but I wouldn't bother continuing with any kind of tapering jewelry once you get to around 4g or 2g. The reason I say this is because 0g is a pretty big jump from 2g. Really there should be a well-known 1g size, but a lot of places don't recognize it as a necessity. The jump from 0g to 00g is even worse. So once you get around there, you'll want to start using PTFE Teflon tape to stretch. Simply put a layer of tape on the plugs every couple days and before you know it your ears will fit right on the next size plugs. I would stick with Teflon tape until you get to around 3/4"", then go to your local adult toy store or a Spencer's Gifts or something and get some non-adhesive bondage tape (also known as sex tape). The reason is because Teflon tape pretty much just comes in one size, and eventually the wearable surface on your plugs will start to become wider than the tape. Bondage tape is a little bit thicker than Teflon tape so you don't need to use as much of it, and it comes in a big fat roll that you can cut strips of to your liking. Teflon tape and bondage tape are pretty much the only things you should be using to tape your plugs with. You shouldn't use other kinds of tape because the adhesive is often toxic, and will irritate your ears a lot. Also, most kinds of tape are too porous to be putting on your ear lobes. When I was younger a lot of people used to put electrical tape on their plugs. That is sort of a step in the right direction, but the adhesive on the tape is just too much to risk. Plus, with bondage and Teflon tape, if you screw up and go too fast, you can easily just take a layer or two off and you'll be fine. Getting the first layer on the plugs can always be annoying, but with practice you'll get used to it. I always put 2 layers on initially to solidify the roll.

Get into the habit early on of letting your ears relax for a few hours a day. Take your plugs out in the shower, wash your lobes and the plugs, massage them a little bit, etc etc. As time goes on you'll be able to take your plugs out for longer intervals without them closing up too much, once they get used to it and their elasticity is improved. By the time you get to 1"" you should be able to leave your plugs out overnight with little consequence. Always keep backup pairs of plugs in the sizes just below where you're at because when you wake up, your ears will feel groggy and temperamental and won't want to go back to the size they're at. I always keep the next size lower just to throw in for the first few minutes of every day, pull on them a little, get my lobes ready and stretched enough to fit my actual size in. I like to use Jojoba oil to massage them with whenever I wake up or get out of a shower. Jojoba oil is chock full of vitamin E and other nutrients that moisturize, nourish and replenish your skin cells, aiding in the production of collagen (which is what allows your lobes and other parts of your body be stretched over time), and it also works as a great lubricant for putting your plugs in. You should be wary of the moisture of your ear lobes, especially in the winter when there's that dry heat being blasted inside everywhere. You should use oils that have vitamin E in them. Straight up vitamin E oil can be sort of syrupy and make a mess sometimes, so my advice would be to just get some Jojoba oil. It costs like, $20 to get a small bottle, but that bottle will last you for like, 6 months or more if you don't waste it. A lot of people swear by emu oil, but I've tried that and I really don't think it's as great as some people think it is. I heard that it's supposed to make your ears thicker, but when I used emo oil, my ears actually got a little bit thinner. I might be wrong, but i'm about 95% sure that the only way to thicken your ears at all is to downsize and to keep up your daily routine of massaging and/or washing your ears. It's all about blood flow.

That's mostly it. Maybe if I think of any other good stuff I'll edit this, but that's basically all of the really important stuff that people should know about stretching. Not saying that you guys didn't know all that stuff, but if there just so happens to be someone out there that hadn't thought about something in here.

Oh, and gauge is a system of measurement used to determine the thickness of wire! That's why small jewelry is measured in gauge, because it's the same size. The different kinds of jewelry have their own names, but none of them are ""gauge"". End of discussion!

I'm planning to keep my penis, but having my testicles removed sometimes before the end of the year. 

Friday I'm getting an Apadravya. Its something I've wanted for the last few years and never got up the nerve to get it done. 

I've recently become good friends with a peircer in town and she has done all of my piercings the last few times I've gone in for them. And I used getting my nipples done as a judge of the pain I might feel with getting a body piercing down there. 

I'm just kinda trying to psych myself up to be ready. Pain really isn't the issue. I know I can handle the pain, I'm a major masochist. 

I'm also getting my nipple piercings stretched up to 12g from 14g. Which will be interesting on its own.



Actually, Friday is pretty much going to be a day of body mods for me. 

Two Stretchings, Apadravya, and possibly starting a tattoo project on my left arm with a friend I've reconnected with. Right arms project is on hold because the artist working on it left her old store to start her own closer to me.

",DcHolliday35,30,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodymods/comments/19qr44/suspension_report_as_requested/,"So today I was finally able to do the suspension I've been dreaming of for about 8 years. Kaspa Disgrace, of DisGraceLand Hook Squad, came down from NY and strung up myself and 2 others. There were about a dozen people there, well wishers and emotional support, and was just generally a really chill and welcoming environment. Good tunes, good people, sharp objects. 

I went last and decided on doing a swan dive/superman type position. I've recently become obsessed with skydiving and it made the most sense. Kaspa suggested doing an 8 point (upper back, lower back, thighs and calves) which meant we had to cut up the shorts I was wearing. Tragic, but a willing sacrifice to the bodymod gods. We were a bit pressed for time so I was double teamed by both Kaspa and his lady/apprentice so Kaspa could start rigging. We moved the piercing table over to underneath the rig, I laid back down and they set to work. Got the tension adjusted nicely after setting up the shackles and clasps and away we went. 

I had expected a great outpouring of emotion and release but it was almost the exact opposite. Everything fell away and all that mattered was the hooks and the swinging and the bliss. I'm was up for about 20 minutes, I would've loved to stay up longer but as I said we were pressed for time and I was starting to feel like it was time to come down. They brought me back onto the table and started pulling hooks and bandaging me. 

The rush when I came back down was one of the best parts. That was the overwhelming flood of emotion that I had expected, and I was truly blissful. 

From bouncing off the walls for the past three days down to the peaceful calm I feel now, this has truly been a wonderful experience. I'm so thankful to DisGraceland Hook Squad, Kaspa and Mandolynn, and the Kinetic Hive in Atlanta for allowing us into their space. I'm hooked (har har har) and can't wait to do it again.

And the best part? My wife who, while supporting me, didn't understand it or have any interest wants to do a suicide suspension now. ",,False,,t5_2qj5t,False,,,True,t3_19qr44,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodymods/comments/19qr44/suspension_report_as_requested/,

(side note: Also, do not stretch (it's not called gauging, hehe) aggressively. Wait 1-3 months between smaller sizes and probably 5-8 months between sizes once above 8ga. If you think that's just way too slow, consider how much slower it is to try to stretch too fast and then get a blowout or tear the piercing so you then have to go back down to the previous size and wait a few months for it to heal before trying again.

Is this something thats more common than i know, or is it really limited in practice?  

How is it actually done, and whats the healing time and rejection rate?  

does it always require another piercing to hold it in place, or can it actually just stay in on its own?

anything else yall have about it or that would be helpful is appreciated.",,True,,t5_2qj5t,False,,,True,t3_1fpqqo,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodymods/comments/1fpqqo/have_some_questions_about_a_new_kind_of/,

Everything was healing normally until a few weeks ago when I noticed a crack where the ring went into my left nipple. At first I went back to my salt soak and cleaning ritual and put an end to any oral or physical contact. The crack was gross looking and the area around it was hard. It didn’t hurt at all though. Nothing I seemed to do helped though, the crack remained. I finally gave in and talked to my piercer about it. 

I have no clue why I put it off so long now that it’s all over and done with. The piercer took a look and told me what she thought the problem was. She offered to put barbells in for me and gave me instructions on what to do. 48 hours later the crack is healing great. She didn’t even charge for the barbell (I gave her a nice tip though). She said it was a good thing I went in though because all sorts of problems could have occurred if I hadn’t (losing the piercing being the least of them). 

Please if you have any questions about a piercing be it about healing or anything else talk to a piercer. Piercers don’t mind answering questions as mine told me “I’m not just paid to do the piercing; I’m paid to answer questions and stand by my work too.” I see a lot of questions posted with a picture asking if something is healing right or if the redness/crustiness/whatever is normal. It’s okay to ask reddit but please have a piercer look at it too. Trust me, not a lot of things shock them anymore (I flashed my piercer). Even if you didn’t get the piercing done with that piercer still ask one you trust because they would rather prevent serious damage.

For starters, the positions they healed in are kind of annoying. One is on the inside edge of my pointer finger and the other is basically right on the pad of my pinky (slightly to the inside), which makes it difficult to pick things up sometimes. Another thing is that I use my hands quite a bit for work (fabricator) and I find that the implants are always a bit tender. Placement aside, I find that they're not very sensitive at all. I was under the impression that I'd be able to feel microwave ovens from 12-15"" away, feel wires in walls, sense every little power transformer turn on, etc. but I hardly feel anything any longer. I can feel microwave ovens from about 1"" away and maybe a little fuzz around the outside of a spinning wood router, but that's about it. The only thing that gives me decent feedback is my 12V car battery charger, and I can only feel that from about 6"" away. I think the implants were actually more sensitive when they were first healing, around 3-4 months, but the sensitivity seems to have faded.
Does anyone else have any similar complaints?
I did play around with some super-strong rare-earth magnets near my implants a few times and almost have to wonder if they might not have weakened mine in the process.",,False,,t5_2qj5t,False,,,True,t3_13qk9y,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodymods/comments/13qk9y/anyone_disappointed_with_their_magnetic_implants/,

1317895185.0,21,self.bodymods,l2v1h,"My branding experience + picture, for those interested in such things.",Shemhazai,22,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodymods/comments/l2v1h/my_branding_experience_picture_for_those/,"Well, I've had a plan for a brand I wanted for a good while.  For those familiar with the old Black Isle RPGs, it's the Symbol of Torment from PS:T.  The brand was performed about 2 1/2 weeks ago and used an electrocautery device (a hand-held and mains-powered implement that uses electricity to vapourise flesh).  [Here is a picture of the brand, taken about four hours after the procedure was complete.](http://img233.imageshack.us/img233/8148/30014620530030287070210.jpg)  For those UK-ians, the procedure was performed by the always wonderful folks at [Holier Than Thou](http://www.holier-than-thou.co.uk/) -- which is a fantastic name for a studio.  Seriously can't recommend 'em highly enough.

So, how'd it go?  I don't mind admitting that my feelings prior to the brand could be described as 'dribbling, bowel-loosening terror', but the actual procedure itself wasn't as hideous as I expected.  It was an extremely intense experience, but I wouldn't call it pain as such -- it was the sort of full-body feeling you get upon jumping into freezing water, but with the shock of first immersion somehow stretched to about 20 minutes in length.  About half-way through, I started to shake and twitch, and by the end I'd experienced a full-on endorphin rush.  There was little to no pain after the brand was complete.  I could drive quite happily with my seatbelt actually pressing on the wound site.  The smell, on the other hand... well.  The electrocautery device vapourises flesh, so there were little curlicues of smoke rising from my shoulder.  It smelled like pork crackling.  The experience of being clearly able to smell parts of yourself cooking was ... surreal, to say the least.  I met a few friends for a pint after the process, and the first words out of their mouths were, 'You smell like a barbeque!'

Healing it... yeah, now that was a sod.  After a day or two, it started producing a yellowish discharge that crusted on clothes.  I also have very long dreads, and.. well, having to peel a dreadlock off the brand where it had gummed itself during the night was not a pleasant experience.  Because the area sees a **lot** of movement, it hurt mostly continuously for at least 10 days.  I've got a fairly high pain threshold, but I was chewing co-codamol like sweets.  It formed a huge, crusty scab in just under a week, which has finally almost completely flaked off now... with more than a little help from myself.  ([This](http://img40.imageshack.us/img40/9114/30415420494055290667710.jpg) is the scab in all its glory.  Sorry for picture's poor quality.) It's been approximately 3 days since the last of the pain from the area has receded.  I'd describe the healing process as considerably worse than my chest scarification (but you don't get the excruciating pain of the first shower with a brand!) and **much** more painful than any of my tattoos.  It has looked extremely unpleasant throughout its healing so far, with redness and irritation in the surrounding area.  I was actually worried it was infected for a while, as the redness seemed to be spreading for a few days -- but no, it's just the blood vessels widening to work on the healing process.  It did look rather scary, though!

The skin around the brand is flaky and red at the moment -- makes me look rather like a mediaeval flagellant or leper.  Aftercare was minimal -- I was scrupulously careful about wound hygiene, but otherwise mostly  let my body get on with healing without too much interference.  It still looks extremely unsightly + sore, but there's been (so far!) no spreading of the design.

So, yeah, my thoughts: so far, it's healed brilliantly, and I've got great hopes for its appearance further down the road.  Because the electrocautery machine has variable settings + attachments, different parts of the scar are healing with different textures -- which is exactly what I wanted, so I'm quite happy!  The procedure itself was intense but bearable -- but the first two weeks of healing were an absolute sod.  Irritating pain was pretty much a constant, sleep involved positioning myself **just so** and trying to move as little as possible and the wound was producing a horrid-looking discharge for roughly a week that crusted to the nearest surface (so yeah, clean shirt before bed!).

Yeah.  Enough rambling from me.  Thanks for reading, peoples, and I hope the above was of some interest to someone.",,False,,t5_2qj5t,False,,,True,t3_l2v1h,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodymods/comments/l2v1h/my_branding_experience_picture_for_those/,

Long story short, I have worked for a supermarket for 6 years now. In the last few months I have gotten a new job, so I only do casual shifts at the supermarket every now and again. I got told the store manager had left, so when I went in to do groceries this evening he was leaving. I took it upon myself (being the friendly chatty cathy I am) to say hello and introduce myself as he was walking out for the day.


Well, I won’t be doing that again! After I shook his hand and introduced myself, he straight away looked at my ear lobes and said “oh, didn’t that hurt?” I laughed it off and kept talking about how I only do very little casual jobs so I thought I would say hello while I have him free. He then asked “do you take your jewellery out when you come to work?” I feel I should say I do have a septum piercing (which I tuck up) and my lobes are at 36mm.  I tell him How I tuck the septum up and my ears would look funny without the jewellery to unsuspecting customers. 


Now here’s the kicker. He then asks me “Do you think if you didn’t have those piercings you would get more shifts?” Yeah, ‘scuse the French but what the fuck, buddy?  I am a supervisor at the supermarket, and even though it’s a slightly shit job, I am good at it! The only reason I don’t get many shifts is because I choose to as my new job is amazing (which I proceeded to let him know).


So I smiled, told him I have had them the whole time whilst working (which I have, and I used to also keep my angel bite peircings in at work!). I said goodbye and walked away. 


I just get gobsmacked by how rude people are about my appearance :( :( :(

I was looking for some more extensive, personal knowledge on experience and smaller nuances, and I'm sure others would as well, so if you have the time, please help educate the curious and answer any of the following questions you like. It'd be greatly appreciated:

1.) What method did you use? (laser, binding, professional, etc) How long ago did you have the procedure?
  
2.) What method would you now recommend?
  
3.) How far back was the cut? And did you have additional procedures done like a frenulectomy to help with the bifurcation?
  
4.) How long did it take to heal fully?
  
5.) Was there any regrowth? If so, how much?
  
6.) Is the inside of the cut, compared to other parts of your tongue, more or less sensitive to heat? To feeling? To taste? Is it more or less prone to injury from abrasion, scalding, or capsicum (spice)?
  
7.) Do your two tongues have reduced strength? Can you still pick stuff out of your teeth with the tips?
  
8.) Did you get any nerve damage or other complications?
  
9.) How long did it take to relearn how to talk? And to speak at your current level? Is it 100% 
  
10.) Can anybody notice that you have two tongues just by observing you? If so, who?
  
11.) Have you had any significant others that thought it was gross? If so, did they overcome these feelings? Are they fine with kissing you now?
  
12.) Can you still roll your r's?
  
13.) Can you still click your tongue? (sounds like ""dlock"" or ""clop"")
  
14.) Can you still chitter? (sounds like squirrels, ""tcsk tsck"")
  
15.) Does it look the way you want? If not, why?
  
16.) Do you have any regrets? And do you think you'll ever voluntarily have a reversal operation?

Hey body modditors!

I'm writing an essay for my Cyborg Society course about the connection between body modification and elective cyborgization. Essentially, I believe that the desire to modify the human body is the same one that would drive us to modify ourselves with technology beyond aesthetics*. But I would like to bolster my research with input from you all.

My primary question is: **Why do you modify?** 

Other questions to consider, if you feel like it, are:

* Are you interested in the way new technologies allow for different body modifications (e.g. digital ink tattoos, electronic implants, magnets, etc.)? 
* Are you waiting for certain technologies to become safe in order to achieve a specific modification?
* Are your body mods integral to your personal sense of identity? 
* Do you see your body mods as an *improvement* upon yourself, or something you need in order to *become* yourself?  
* Would you consider getting a body mod that goes beyond human capabilities for non-health reasons (e.g. bionic eyes even though your eyes are perfectly healthy)? 
* Do you identify as a cyborg†, or would you like to? Do you see yourself as beyond human in some way? 

*not to imply that body mods are ""merely"" aesthetic

† technical definition of cyborg as an integration of organic and inorganic systems notwithstanding

Thanks for any input! I'm excited to hear some of your responses and see if they match up to my hypothesis.

Any other advice or info is definitely encouraged. He has been thinking about it a while and is excited about it, but he would like to know about personal experiences with this. Our piercer is extremely knowledgable and has helped a lot. But he doesn't have personal experience with this. 

Thanks in advance!

http://www.reddit.com/r/bodymods/comments/utupj/tongue_splitbifurcation_after_2_weeks/

Saturday: Day 0

Appointment day.  Whilst wandering through the streets of an unfamiliar area of Brooklyn looking for the shop, some kind of hell storm decided to stop by unexpectedly. So we walked in pouring-buckets rain for a few minutes, then walked into the shop and dripped on their floor for a while. 

Waited around, talked to the guy who would be doing the splitting while the materials autoclaved, then headed to my doom. 

Told him I wanted it split back further than the 4g tongue ring I had in. But apparently I have absolutely no tongue webbing, so we just went as far back as he could (probably 1 ¼ - 1 ½ inches total) 
He ended up numbing my tongue, which beforehand I didn’t think he would do because most seem not to, but DAMN am I glad he did. I might have been able to make it through the split okay without it, but I would’ve wanted to kill myself during the suturing. And I’m a wuss when it comes to pain, so I guess I just liked not feeling anything while it was being done. 

So he cut, he sutured, he gave me some water and gauze pads, and sent me on my way.  

Walking back we stopped at a bunch of places asking for ice. If they gave us any trouble I just stuck my tongue out at them and they were like “JESUS, okay, here’s some ice”. Beautiful =P. 

Sunday: Day 1

Not bad at all. I was surprised at how not-bad it was. A little bit of swelling, so I made a smoothie and sounded retarded every time I tried to say something, but no big deal. 
Went to a friends birthday party that night and spent the whole time sticking out my tongue to show people. Was a sad panda because I couldn’t drink. 

Monday: Day 2 

Holy mother of god. Woke up in wanting-to-kill-something pain. Upped the ibuprofen doses to 5 pills (instead of 4) at a time [disclaimer: don’t take this many ibuprofen at once]. 

Didn’t eat til like 7pm, which was probably a bad idea. Then I downed 2 gigantic milkshakes, my stomach hurt (probably from all the sugar), then all was well. More ibuprofen, woohoo!!

Tuesday: Day 3 

	To go down in history as the tongue-split-healing-day-from-hell. Didn’t eat, which was bad. Was 90+ degrees, which was worse. Ended up driving through a tornado for 5 hours, which was even worse. So I was hot, hungry, in mortal danger, and my stomach was on fire from all the ibuprofen on an empty stomach. 

When I finally stumbled my ass into my house I used my mouthwash (biotine) and passed the fuck out.

Wednesday: Day 4

	Didn’t wake up til 11, which is awesome because that makes it the first night I didn’t wake up halfway through the night in need of my next ibuprofen dose. 

Tried eating a microwaveable omelet  (cooled before eating, of course). Didn’t work. Got a few small bites down then gave up, brushed my teeth/tongue, and did a longass saltwater rinse. 
Took out the 1 suture right at the tip of my tongue on the left side, and life was good. I cannot explain how much better my tongue felt after taking that one goddamn suture off. Made me want to take the rest out, but had to wait a few more days =\. 

Thursday: Day 5

Swelling went down, noticeably. 

Took the frontmost pair of sutures out. 

Ate solid food for the first time! Just a few ham cubes &amp; cooked veggie mix, but DAMN did it feel good.

Friday: Day 6

Tried eating during the day, didn’t work too well. Iced tea was a godsend though. 

Conquered two, count ‘em TWO, slices of olive and cheese pizza for dinner. …Eaten over a period of an hour, cut up in very small bites. But still, SUCCESS.

Took out all sutures except the back 4 (which are really close together). At this point I’d gotten pretty good at taking them out. Thursdays were a bit of a bitch, but suture-removal went pretty quickly today. 

Saturday: Day 7

Felt pretty normal today, though my tongues still a little swollen so talking’s still a bitch. 

There were 4 sutures left in the very back of the split. I noticed one of them was on the top of my tongue somehow, right at the back of the split. Since it was in a weird place, and also really loose (like, I could see the loop. It was hardly in my tongue) I figured it might have migrated. Felt weird whenever I closed my mouth, because the loose bit of thread attached to the top of my tongue would tickle the roof of my mouth =P. Odd sensation, to say the least. Took that one out when I got home.

Later noticed there was a really loose one right at the bottom of my tongue too. That one hurt more, and bled when I took it out (not like gushing-blood bled, but my-mouthwash-came-out-pink bled). 
More solid fooddssss  =D. Everything still in really small bites, though. 

Was going to wait til Sunday to take out the last 2 back sutures. Partly because I’m lazy and didn’t want to do it that night, and partly because I figured it wouldn’t hurt to have them there the extra day (regrowth and whatnot). But when I checked out the back of my split before bed, the remaining 2 sutures had pretty much migrated themselves out of my tongue already so I just took them out. A little more bleeding on the left side, right side was completely out of my tongue &amp; just chillin back there somehow. 


Random words of advice: 
-Salt water rinses are fucking amazing 
-Sleep with your head propped up. I legit had all my pillows under me at all times, at least for the first week. Neck hurt a couple times, but tongue didn’t explode so woohoo! 
-The tips of my tongue were kind of numb because of the swelling. And taste was pretty non-existent til at least day 5-6; probably also due to the swelling.
-Food will be your biggest obstacle. Or at least it was for me.  
-Pain meds/anti-inflammatory meds were really easy to overdue. Watch for that, especially if you’re not eating much.

This subreddit should have an FAQ section in the sidebar with recommended reading, and answers to frequently asked questions, many of which seem to be along the lines of, ""what do I do if something is infected?"" or ""should I get this type of modification?""

I showed him what we had, and we discussed his piercings and that he shouldn't be changing them just yet (they were only a few weeks old). He was debating on whether or not the rings he had picked out would fit, and I was wondering why they wouldn't...after all, mens' nipples aren't that big, right? Well, he finally just decided to pull his shirt up and let me take a look.

This poor guy. The right nipple looked perfect and well placed. Not crooked or too deep or shallow. The left one, though...was WAY too deep and crooked. Like, straight through the areola. I'm not sure what happened...the piercer was right on with the first one! 

I accidentally gasped as soon as I saw it, because I knew it wasn't good. I asked him where he had gotten it done, and he mumbled something like, ""Oh, some other place..."" (Likely meaning a friend did it.)

I told him that the right one looked great, but the left one definitely needed to be taken out and redone, and to go back and ask his piercer to fix it. (Or, preferably, go to a different one! Come to think of it, I should have recommended my piercer.) 

He was a super nice guy, but looked concerned at my concern and ended up not buying the jewelry. I'd rather lose the sale than risk exacerbating his condition and possibly getting mastitis. 

**Lesson learned kids: Make sure you know what your piercing is supposed to look like before you leave the shop. I see so many kids (and adults!) who think their piercings look good, but they're really just too deep, shallow, crooked, wrong jewelry.

(Apologies for how crummy I look in the picture; my hair and make-up were messy that day.)

Anyway, these are my first real piercings (I have my lobes done, but as they were done with a gun in the mall when I was five against my will, I don't count them as worth mentioned.) and although they were painful, I'm very happy with them.

Apparently, they're quite unusual, so my dad suggested I post them here for you guys to take a look at.

I'm washing them with salt-water soaked cotton buds, soaking them with salt-water soaked cotton pads and using mild, alcohol-free Listerine.
I also have Dettol anti-bacterial spray, as when I'm out, a few people have just come over and touched them without permission. My little cousin also likes to touch them, so I figured the anti-bac would be useful just in case.

I know I'm probably being totally over the top about looking after them, but I don't care. I want them to be healthy and stay forever and ever because I'm in love them them.

Anyway; do you guys have any suggestions as to care etc? I figure you're all pretty experienced, and I like to pick up tips c:",,False,,t5_2qj5t,False,,,True,t3_mgr29,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodymods/comments/mgr29/new_dahlia_piercings_c/,

One of my roomates is of the opinion that if you have a lot of tattoos (e.g., full sleeves, back pieces, chest pieces) then you cannot be successful in life (e.g., have a good career, have a nice house, have a nice car, support your family, things like that.) He is pretty much of the opinion that anyone with more than a few tattoos, is a freak. I on the other hand feel that you can be successful and have tattoos. I know of several people who work for law offices and computer companies, who are pretty high up that have numerous tattoos. Well the discussion continued on, and we came to an impasse where he began to stereotype everyone with more than a few tattoos into essentially being scum. I know that since this is his opinion I'm not going to change it, he has to be the one to change it, but I thought that it would be interesting to see how many people consider themselves successful in life and do have numerous tattoos. Also, if you don't mind, just post what you do for a living because I would like to show him this later tonight, just to further back up my point of success being related to the individual, not so much what they decide to put on their body.

It finally came to fruition last November. 
My implant is a magnetic toroid shape , roughly 8mm across and 2 or 3 mm thick and is in my left ring finger.
It was placed to sit fully on the pad but during healing it slipped lower toward the joint and slightly off to the side. I would definately recommend the lower aspect to anyone going for one in the future. It leaves the pad free of any problems when you pick things up normally  - like heavy boxes etc which otherwise would be quite tender.
The procedure was performed with a local so there was no pain but the first two weeks were like Hell. I havent had an injury before that managed to wake me from sleep when the pain meds ran out !!
It is now three months on and every thing is pretty cool. As many have said before the whole 'fields' thing is a little overblown but you can definately get a buzz every now and then.

I'd like to start off by saying the condition of my earlobe was not down to poor stretching or anything as such.

One winter, I found my allergy for non-implant grade silicone at 23mm. Which made my lobes swell up a little and ooze lymph. It also made my fistula red raw and gave me multiple keloids around the fistula also. It made me develop what looked similar to a blowout, but wasn’t. My right lobe suffered more and my left went completely back to normal. NOTHING got rid of the allergy infection so I had to resort to using surgical spirit. Yup, I know. But it worked. After they’d healed, I’d been left with this huge lump of scar tissue, but it was all healthy. I also managed to shrink the scar tissue to about 1/5 of the original size with daily oil massages and chamomile tea soaks. Later on I continued to stretch slowly with bondage tape, but usually it loosened so much each time, I could just place about 2-4mm bigger sizes straight in with no effort whatsoever. I got up to 2” and I also have bad blood circulation; but I massaged my lobes and has practically no problems with that. But then this winter is when the real problem happened. The cold makes your skin contract and it was pulling over my scar tissue and the skin was a tad thin because it was being pulled. Obviously the bigger the plugs, the heavier they are so with the cold, the weight of my plug and a few knocks from people, I then developed a split down the fistula about 1” long and 8mm wide. Naturally I took my plugs out and let it heal and have been downsizing since. It healed fine and the split shrunk from being 1” by 8mm to about 5mm by 5mm. Downsizing increases your blood flow (obviously) which made the bigger lump of scar tissue puff back out near to it’s original size. 

I’ve tried practically everything to thicken it, believe me. Thus I have decided to get this lobe PARTIALLY sewn and restretch in the future.

I've talked to a few artists about what should be done and what has been decided is that the thin part should be removed and have the two ends sewn together then have the fistula scalpelled to make it even again and maximizing comfort while wearing jewellery in the future. I'd be leaving my lobe at least a year after the procedure before I start stretching again; this time with a goal of 3"". It's all been arranged apart from the date as I have to travel miles and miles to a different city...country too.

I'll post about when I actually get it done as well.",,False,,t5_2qj5t,False,,,True,t3_xtwy4,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodymods/comments/xtwy4/idea_for_partial_lobe_reconstruction/,

The subject of the cultural appropriation of rituals and spiritual symbols is especially something I'm interested in, but a subject that is almost never covered in this material. While I appreciate the fact that no small number of people have a spiritual appreciation of body modification, there is an uncomfortable undercurrent (occasionally much more overt) of idealizing this side of the community that seems inescapable in the written and filmed material. I'd like to see something that tackles it without putting it on a rather large pedestal.

I've read/watched the following:

* Opening Up: Body Modification Interviews 1995 - 2008

* MEET TOMMY: An Exploration of Private Body Modification and Play

* ModCon

* MODIFY

* Flesh &amp; Blood

* Dances Sacred &amp; Profane

Mad Jack died in 2007,someone_like_me,15,4,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodymods/comments/1f4byd/til_rev_mad_jack_died_in_2007/,"I don't know if anyone on this sub will remember him, but I just found out that Rev. Mad Jack Kaplan died in 2007. He was the first man to pierce me (not counting myself).

I got into piercing after finding a copy of ""Modern Primatives"" and I started doing temporary piercings on myself.  By 1991 I wanted something permanent. Had I been on the West Coast, I could have found many people. But in Chicago, there was only one guy to talk to, and that was Mad Jack. He had a shop called Body Basics just South of Broadway and Clark. I didn't know it at the time but he had a global reputation.

Jack was awesome. He looked at the work I'd done on myself, spent some time trying to come up with jewelry to fit. I think think he felt he was helping a young freak. He also did a Hafada for me.

When I went to Body basics in about 1998 to get a new piercing, he was gone. Retired to AZ, the new owner told me. I presumed he was still there, living the good life. 

He was only 54 when he died. I think he lived a bit fast. 

Anyway, I'm grateful for the help he gave me, and I wish I'd had a chance to know him better.

Here are some links.

**Don't do what I did, go to a professional.**

I had first heard about magnetic implants in 2006, on BMEzine. At the time, they were hand-dipping magnets in biocompatible silicone.

Recently, I discovered that bio-compatible coated magnets could be obtained and used as implants.

EDIT:I removed specifics for magnet supplier, I don't want to ruin it for anyone else. These magnets are 3mm diameter, 1mm thick, and are coated in biocompatible parylene, the same stuff that goes on pacemakers and other medical implants.

I ordered #10 scalpels, a suture kit, and a suture needle/thread from a medical supply store online.

I numbed my gloved finger by submersing it in a bag containing ice cubes, water, and salt (to lower the freezing point) for 10 minutes. At this point, my finger was numb to a point midway up the first (closest to hand) digit. 

I made an incision 1/4"" long along the ""thumb side"" of my left middle finger, top digit. A pocket was formed beneath the finger pad by forcing the blunt ""needle drivers"" into position. Attempts to place the magnet with the stainless steel instruments available were frustrating due to the magnetic attraction involved, but placement was eventually achieved.

I attempted to place a suture, but the magnet was drawn to the needle and needle driver, out of position. 

As blood flow was returning, I applied super glue to the lips of the incision, which stopped most of the bleeding, and allowed a clot to form.

I wrapped my finger in gauze with tape. I drank some scotch and took some ibuprofen for pain management, which rated around a 5-6/10. 

**Don't do what I did, go to a professional.**

As my finger thawed, I experienced an intense throbbing sensation, and my finger swelled. I think I over-cooled my finger in an attempt to get numb. Feeling is returning, daily,along my finger, and I expect it to return in full within a few months (stupid, I know).Probing with external magnets was inconclusive.

Over the next few days, I continued to gently clean the incision site, removing bits of clot and superglue from the surrounding area. The swelling decreased, and further probing showed that the implant had migrated to a spot close to the incision. Attempts to re-position the implant with external magnets were unsuccessful.

Last night, I removed the magnet from my finger, opened the incision and re-opened the pocket beneath my fingerpad. The magnet was then placed into this pocked using a wood push-rod. Bleed was controlled by tourniquet at the base of the finger. Incision was sealed with super glue, and no further bleeding was evident.

Magnet is in position, and will hopefully stay there as the incision heals.

I know I should have gone to a professional body mod artist in order to complete this procedure. However, I have a demanding job that would not allow me a week to travel to a pro. 

I was extremely careful with preventing contamination during the whole process, and I think this will turn out right. If you plan to do this yourself, take the time to read and watch everything you can about every aspect of the procedure. 

**Don't do what I did, go to a professional.**

I don't see my parents very often, but they are very vocal about their distaste for any sort of body modification.  For example, when I was 18 I pierced my lip and they kicked me out of the house for 2 days until I took it out.  Right now I have piercings on my tongue (that they seem to have gotten used to), my nostril, eyebrow and below the waist (but they never need to know about that).  I also have two tattoos that I keep mostly covered when I'm around them, one on my hip and a much larger one on my back.  I recently got a blacklight tattoo as well, which is still healing on my forearm, making it decently visible.  

I'm home now for Thanksgiving and I really don't want to fight with my parents.  Our relationship has been somewhat strained for the past four to six years and I want to focus on making it better.  The issue is really with my father, who cannot understand why I would do this to myself and thinks that things like nose-rings are ""tribal"" and ""uncivilized"" and that I will never be able to get a job because of it.  He openly admits to being prejudice against people with tattoos or piercings. 

I'm an anthropology major and I find these prejudices to be insulting on multiple levels.  I feel like he is almost attacking me as a person and my character.  I love my piercings and tattoos and couldn't imagine my face or body without them.  I'm even writing my thesis on tattooing!  I get my short temper from my dad, so when we try to talk about this we end up screaming at each other.  Does anyone have advice on how I could talk to him in a civilized way without having to take out my piercings?  I think it's a generational difference. How can I make him see my point of view and still respect his own?

Put your knowledge in me, r/bodymods!

I got my first cartilage piercings last July. Upper and middle in my left ear, plus a third lobe in that side. After careful planning and caring for the piercings I already had, last Saturday I decided I was prepared for my next project. I got two conch piercings in my right ear! I am slightly sad that I need to wear barbells for a bit to let them heal properly, but I still find them lovely. I am not a huge fan of how long the barbells are, either, as they seem to increase agitation by bumping into things behind my ear. I was more scared than I had been my first time and the pain was more intense but after about an hour things settled down to the typical dull ache. I did opt out of the tragus piercing I was planning to get on the same ear, but I have enough to heal as it is and I am content to wait a couple of months for that step. I had had enough pain for one day xD So in December or January I will have that done. Then I'll be looking at getting a daith in my left ear and a forward helix in my right ear to top things off. This is the vision I've been sketching out; I don't know if I will end up completing it yet, I'm just giving you guys the full picture of my plans.

tldr; my experience getting right ear conch piercings. I love them. Have any thoughts, responses, sage wisdom?

Pictures coming soon! :D

EDIT: I've determined that my conchs are 12g. Now I am thinking that perhaps the main reason they hurt more is because of the larger size. My cartilage piercings are 14g.",,False,,t5_2qj5t,True,,,True,t3_l91f7,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodymods/comments/l91f7/double_conch_piercing_success/,

I stretched up to 00 while I was in high school. I could have done things a little better (used a pair of acrylic tapers once), but no blowouts, and everything is nice. I stayed at 00 for a long time; probably 2 years. Recently, I decided I wanted to stretch up more. My goal is an inch.

I bought some nice steel tapers, steel eyelets, and jojoba oil. I stretched up to 7/16'' about a week ago no problems at all. Didn't hurt a bit. I tried sticking in the 1/2'' taper in just to see where it would get. I got about half-way through before I got to that point where I KNOW pushing it any further would result in something bad (blowout, blood, not pretty).

So far, my lobes are lookin' super healthy. There is no redness on the lobe or the fistula. I try to clean out the dead-skin every other day or so (should probably do it more) and I keep 'em oiled. I wanted to wait a month before stretching. Is that enough? I'm not skipping sizes at all or anything. I just want to stretch without it hurting too bad... but I don't want to wait forever?


Any of you stretchy people have a time-frame or tips to help the healing process go by quicker :) Thanks!

(gun because yay walmart) They never healed up and I had to take them out eventually.

I decided to try again at 12 (gun again), that didn't heal so I gave up and tried cartilage at 13. That was with with a gun too and I got a big painful bump on the back that never healed. (To be fair, I didn't know about sea salt soaks and used the Benzallonium Chloride they gave me every time.)

Now, I got my nose done (the *correct* way) in February at 16 years old and I changed my jewelry too soon (I did wait 6 weeks though, but I guess it was too soon for me personally) and got a little bump by it. I realized what I had done and took good care of it and waited to change again until it was better.

It got better and once again, and I wanted to change my jewelry. It was painful to change it so I knew I had fucked up. I left it alone after I got the new piece in but, yay, the bump is back. That was over a month ago and it's still there despite my decent caring for it.

Now, my question is, am I just bad with these, or is my body bad with piercings, because I want to maybe get another or two (I was thinking snakebites or an anti eyebrow, both of which I wouldn't have to worry about changing the jewelry.) at some point soon, but if my body is just bad with piercings I don't want to waste the money.

**TL;DR** 3 times of getting my ears pierced, they didn't heal (done with gun, no sea salt soaks because walmart/claire's is dumb), nose took longer than average to heal and is still sensitive after 4 months, is it worth trying to get another piercing?

First time poster here, and I'm glad I stumbled upon this subreddit. I've admired Body Modification from afar for years, and I've decided its time I actually buckle down and do some solid research into getting work done on myself. I don't plan on doing anything myself (normally I'm totally a DIY'er, but with something that's this dangerous/permanent/meaningful I'm definitely seeking out a professional, no worries there).

I have always wanted a big back piece, shoulder blades / upper torso area, and I'm working on nailing down the artwork for the tattoo portion. However, after learning more about scarification I'm wondering if it would be possible to get a slightly raised portion underneath. I'm still very unfamiliar with the terminology of body modification so here goes nothing.

The next paragraph is the ideas behind the scarification/tattoo combo, feel free to skip it if you're not interested. I thought it would be best to include it to give some direction to the questions that follow.

What I'm looking for is a scarification that would best create a light raising of the skin (keloid?) to add some subtle definition to the tattoo. The scarification would be two lines about an inch or two away from my spine on either side with small cross lines through each of them (not crossing the spine). A sort of angel wings that have been amputated look. I'm very attached to fallen angel symbology and this would be a perfect undertone to my tattoo which is conglomeration of magical/occult symbols that are important to me and create a collage of my beliefs and life philosophies.

So on to the questions! (I hope I haven't bored or scared anyone off!)

1. First and foremost, would having a slightly raised (keloid?) scarification be possible with a tattoo?

2. Assuming it is indeed possible, would it be better to get the tattoo first and the scarification afterward or vice-versa? (adequate healing time in between of course)

3. What would be the best technique of scarification to use to create the slightly raised lines that I am looking for? It would be straight, solid lines, two longer slightly thicker lines crossed by a few shorter ones. I'm hoping to create an ""amputated wing"" look. More symbolic that natural, hence the straight lines. I've done a little reading of techniques, I think a laser would work?

4. With these pieces being on my back and not a less flexible area of skin such as a forearm or calf, I'm assuming there is a danger of stretching/deforming, where should I look for some care instructions? I will of course be talking with the professional about this in addition to any information given.

It's somewhat a good idea, but the piercings should be a no since they can be ripped out and cause damage. Plus I thought they had to be removed when entering the prison. Tattoos? Yes. As long as aftercare is provided too.

But for free? Well obviously they cannot pay for it, but they should be sentenced to a series of tasks or something so they can work up to earning a tattoo. It helps with the prison punishment and if they comply they can have a reward. The government/prison would have to pay the tattoo artist, though. I know they are given free things as it is, and some say they shouldn’t even have the right to earn them, but they can work towards having a shorter sentence or be eligible for parole, plus it can keep medical expenses down if they’re professionally done.

EDIT: If free piercings are not offered they could end up doing them themselves, but since piercings being ripped out is a potential risk, they should be educated on why doing it themselves (with no knowledge and it being unsanitary) is a bad idea.

This is my only piercing, so I'm not entirely sure what is normal and what isn't. There are 2 issues that I have questions about, if anyone could offer any insight.

1) There's some scar tissue (or something) on the underside causing a little volcano-like protrusion. The offending tissue is a happy pink color. Oddly, the extra tissue is unevenly distributed, with more on one side, pushing the piercing off-center. Not sure if it is blowout or migration or other. It will grow a little bit if agitated, and when I remove the jewelry for cleaning/salt soak/etc, it feels like the whole piercing wants to swell shut. There is no liquid coming from it aside from minor buildup of crusties. Any idea what this is? and is there any chance of getting rid of it or reducing it over time with massages, etc?

2) Sometimes, when the jewelry gets bumped, it causes a VERY sharp pain, as if it were tearing tissue apart, but there is no blood or evidence of any damage. The piercing grips the jewelry rather tightly, so I not sure if it is drying out and losing lubrication, or if the small amount of dried crusty material that gathers is sharp enough to cause that kind of pain. In my most paranoid moments, I worry that there might be a metal splinter or something from the jewelry. Any thoughts on this?

It'd be a bio-hazard symbol, nothing too intricate. However, I'm having a hard time figuring out where to go, who to talk to, and what method to use. 

From what I've seen, it looks like electrosurgical is best for intricate designs, with a lower chance of the scars blowing out of control. I'm not sure what I'd do about the smell. I've been around the electrocautery stuff at a burn unit, and JESUS CHRIST it stinks- it's a nauseating smell. 

Cutting is an option, but from what I've seen the scarring is iffy sometimes. It always looks great fresh, but I suppose it depends on your artist and your body on how it heals. 

My main problem is that I can't find anyone in my area, (GA, USA) who even offers these services, so I can't even go in for a consult and talk to someone. I feel like talking to an expert who has experience with several different methods would be best. 

 My experience in body mods is very limited, I've had some surface piercings, and had a temporary corset thing that was with skin staples instead of needles, but that's it.

Had my right ear pierced at a 16g in the top corner, nothing too fancy. I wear a small stud in that one. Had my left ear pierced at a 14g kind of like a 'snug' but higher on the large ridge of my ear. I now wear a 16g small curved barbel in it.

Its been over a year and they're both still not fully healed. The right ear is mildly swollen and I sometimes find dried blood on the back when I clean it. The left ear is swollen on both sides with scar tissue on one side. This one normally secretes a yellow liquid and feels inflamed at times. I currently clean them with H2Ocean spray a couple times a day, and use soap with 0.3% triclosan when in the shower. Sometimes (and I know I'll get shit for this) I'll clean them with rubbing alcohol if they look infected.

Any tips on how to get them FINALLY healed up/reduce swelling and keloids? 

Other information that may be useful- I cleaned them regularly for a month or two after getting pierced, then lived in the woods for a while and only cleaned them semi-regularly.

My friend then got her rook pierced, and then we left. Later that night, I was cleaning my new piercings when I notice something is off.

i made it to 5/8"", and stopped there because i thought it was a decent size for the personal shape of my head.  another factor was that at that point in time, that's where jewelry started getting super expensive if you wanted ornate designs.  

i was at 5/8"" for two years until i had to be admitted into a psychiatric facility.  the facility itself didn't care about piercings but i do assume it was not the most hygienic of places.  after 5 days there, i came home and immediately started having an immune system reaction - lymphing, pinkness, tenderness - in my lobe piercing.  i took them out and left them out for another two years.

i recently bought some single flare (mayan cut) 00g rainbow flourite from oracle and the first day, they were snug, but every day following that they would fall out in my sleep or if i moved my head the wrong way.  this of course led to me losing one of them and having no other replacement.

**my question is:** have any of you experienced extreme elasticity with your piercings after letting them shrink down?  i'm apprehensive about getting bigger jewelry if this is just going to happen every time.  i'd like to get back up to 5/8"", and it's not that far to go.  will i have to eventually just wear weights?  or will i be confined to double-flare jewelry that's impossible to get in at first?  

sorry about the wall of text, i just found this subreddit and thought i'd get some other opinions.  i know it sounds shitty to say but i don't know anyone else IRL who has had their lobes stretched long enough to know about what i'm asking.

I am coming here to ask about Ear Pointing, as my title describes. I am a crazy cat lady, I love fairies, I have been told I have elf/faerie like qualities (I'm small, free spirited, loving and compassionate about nature, my face has been described as fairy like, etc.), and I love Star Trek. So what I really need to know is;

Where would I get a procedure like this done? (I live in NY State)

What would be the cost?

I would rather go about this in a surgical manner, not that I don't trust body artists, but I don't trust the scumbags in my red neck town to do something of this nature. It takes practice, the knowledge of sculpting cartilage, and, for me personally, a good reputation. No one where I live has a reputation, they workout of their garages for the most part. I do not mind having to travel for this procedure, but I do have a distance preferred. I'm willing to travel 6-10 hours from where I live in the Adirondack Mtns. Which means I am willing to go to the city, Vermont, Canada, Pennsylvania, etc.

Any information at all is much appreciated and please, I know a lot of people this this is Fucking stupid, but its my taste not yours so keep your opinion to yourself, it wont change my decision, so don't waist your time trying to sway or insult me.

i am also considering a tongue piercing a month down the line when i am healed and want personal experiences from people who have tongue piercings. I heard the swelling makes it difficult to speak..in what way? I don't expect it to be to bad. I am planning it a month before i start classes again so i should be able to talk but what is the average time for the swelling and how long should i expect to talk with a swollen funny tongue?

 What was the first thing that turned you on to body modification? 

Here is my story;

When I was.. I dunno, twelve? Thirteen? My grandfather died of cancer. At that time, I didn't give much thought towards tattoos or stretching, even though my ears were pierced, but I thought ""How could I commemorate him, and the way he died?"" And I thought for a while, slept on it and then looked at my mother. She had tattoos. One of them said ""In loving memory, Jared Paul."" (My stillborn would-be older brother.) And I thought that that was a very permanent way to remember something, or someone, and so I started thinking of a message. I didn't want an ""In loving memory of"" because I figured I would lose a lot of loved ones over my ears, and I wanted to relate also to my grandfathers suffering, and his death. In the end, after about three months, words came to me. ""Liberum Mortis"" It translates in Latin to 'Free Death,' but means freedom in death. I thought for a while and I knew that was appropriate, and eventually, after several years, I now have it. A photo will be provided, probably in comments. 

TL;DR My grandfathers death inspired me at a young age to create a permanent memorial - on my flesh. ",,False,,t5_2qj5t,False,,,True,t3_vo4vr,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodymods/comments/vo4vr/the_day_i_got_turned_on/,

So enough background.  Today after 3 weeks (because my piercings felt good and I could put double tapers in without pain) I tried to stretch up to 0 with stainless steel tapers.  I did it after a shower and lubricated everything up with water based lube.  Both ears felt fine with no pain, then without much force I felt them pop and I think they blew out a little.  They also started bleeding.  I immediately went back down to 2 (literally, I took the tapers out, waited for the bleeding to stop, then put the 2s back in for some support. 5 minutes tops).

Lately I've been feeling the urge to stretch up. I've decided to ask some questions this time around because last time I definitely did it wrong. So here are some questions:

* I've looked around, and taping seems to be the agreed upon best way to stretch. What kind of tape, and where is it available to buy?

* 
When I last stretched I sort of messed up one of my ears, it's not totally fucked up, but the bottom has a sort of irregularity ([Shitty Camera Pic.](http://imgur.com/TRBzj)) Would stretching exacerbate this problem?

* 
Related to above: I've seen a lot about jojoba oil and the like, would this help with the messed up hole?

* When I first stretched I was told and convinced that after like 00, that it would never go back to a normal hole. I've seen somewhere on reddit about people having taken out much larger sizes and the hole going back to normal, I'd just like to know if there's any truth in that?

Really I'm just trying to get any information that would be helpful about safely stretching and any possible preventative measures I should take. Thanks for any and all help

This may not be the best subreddit to ask about this. I'm having a hard time finding real accounts and details about people who've had this procedure done though so I was hoping somewhere on reddit a few people have had experience with this.

I love the look of a properly split tongue, and I have been considering getting it done for a few years now, but the one thing that is currently stopping me is my job.  

Now I currently have several readily visible tattoos, but that's it.  My bosses don't mind them at all, one of them actually, sort of, helped me to get the job.  But they are an elderly couple and I have a sneaking suspicion that having a split tongue would be on the list of things that could cost me said job.  So my question is, after you get the process done, how obvious is it that you've had your tongue split while just having a conversation with someone?  During the healing process and after it is full healed.  Is it blatantly obvious without you actually making an effort to show someone that you have had your tongue split, or does it look fairly normal?

I typically fancy myself as someone who doesn't care what people think about me at first glance, but when it could possibly cost me my livelihood, I feel like it may be, ever so slightly, irresponsible for me not to look into the matter before really researching local (Or not so local) shops and such.

I hadn't been wearing my plugs for a while though, and had my 8s for about two weeks before my tapers came in the mail. I started with the left and after the second day I was able to push the taper all the way in, although I had some swelling. Yesterday was the 4th day and I fell asleep on it wrong, and I guess I tugged on it. I woke up this morning with a lot of pain and when I removed the taper It was bleeding pretty bad. I put my 8 taper on and have had it on since. Its still very swollen with some whiteish discharge coming off every once in a while when I clean it. It hurts a lot. This is the first time I've ripped my lobe due to stretching.
So here's my dilema.
1&amp;amp;amp;gt; How often should I clean it?
2&amp;amp;amp;gt; Should I slowly turn the taper to prevent it from getting stuck (tip from the lady who pierced my daughter)
3&amp;amp;amp;gt; I know I should put oil on it to prevent scar tissue, but when? Right now or wait till it stops bleeding?

THANK YOU!

**EDIT** so last night I stopped spinning the taper almost immediately after posting this, and have since supplied myself with Vitamin E oil. I cleaned my lobe for the last time and did a warm saline soak and -you might get mad- cleaned the taper and put it back on. 
I was much better off sleeping tonight, as my husband started his work week and, since he works night shifts, wasn't able to shove me around the bed. 
My lobe is no longer tough or swollen (whoopee!) and it doesn't hurt at all UNLESS it touch it. Which then it hurts very little. I will do another soak mid-day and one more at night.

My right ear has fully healed. I do saline soaks daily and really try to not pick at them. However, my left ear just hasn't been doing well. Its been the problem ear this time around. It keeps oozing a yellowish liquid that hardens to a crust that I have to pick off. Saline soaks actually have started to hurt. I really don't want to take the jewelry out of my left ear but I feel like that's what's going to have to happen soon if it doesn't start healing. 

I'm wearing steel eyelets that are double flared that were inserted by the piercer. They have a screw on backing to them, if that helps. 

EDIT: 
Since I've been leaving the ear alone the swelling has gone down considerably. Its been healing a lot and it doesn't really hurt anymore.

Nipples: Pain? Process (like, is it awkward), what helps? Bra or no bra and any particular kind (like padded)? Do you think it's worth it?

How do they work/what makes them so dangerous? Is it just that having a rigid bar isn't the brightest idea on such a commonly-stretching and shrinking area of skin? If that were the case, wouldn't about a millimeter of extra bar length and a slight curve fix that problem?

I certainly do, and a few of them are giving me trouble.

The one that bothers me substantially is the hole left from my 10g triangle piercing. It was pierced at 10g right to start, but i never found jewelry that was comfortable (only tried rings) so i just took it out because it became more trouble than it was worth. Well, that was 6 years ago. Nowdays the scar tissue is just itchy as fuck, all the time. I have tried lubing up the area with coconut-oil-based-salve, or plain jojoba oil, because i think friction itself might be part of the issue (i ride a bike almost every day and my labia is generally on the dryer side), but it's not curing it. Since it was pierced at 10g, i imagine there's some goo in there that would be nice to clean out. Do you have any suggestions for how to resolve this issue? It's just uncomfortable and distracting. I'm entertaining the idea of seeing if any jewelry will fit in there and maybe keeping a barbell in (i only ever tried various shapes of rings before) so at least it would be easier clean. Or perhaps just getting some tiny tapers to get in there and push out any buildup. I assume the hole is still open, or mostly open, because it was pierced at 10g, but i have no idea.

I have a similar problem with my navel piercings, but they are just mildly unappealing from an aesthetic and olfactory perspective; they don't bother me physically. I have 4 navel piercings which i haven't worn jewelry in for years as well. If i pinch them just right, i can squeeze gunk out of some of them. The gunk appears to be dirt and old skin cells. The dirt part is black and just looks dirty, the skin part is white and stinks. Do you have any tricks for how to clean these up? I'm not as motivated to put jewelry in them or spend a lot of time/money cleaning them, because it's not as big of a problem as the triangle.

I have an apadravya piercing going on almost a year. I've ordered 2 anatometal titanium barbells in 3.2mm (8g) and 4mm (6g) respectively. How did you go about stretching it? I know PA's more or less self stretch over time. Is it the same for apadravyas?

Ideally I want to just slide in the jewellery. Want to stay away from basically forcing it (tapers etc). I'm hoping the fistula has loosened over the year. When I get the jewellery gonna have a hot bath and see. Won't have the jewellery until maybe late January.

So, I've planned to get Tongue bifurcation since I first saw it on TV years ago, and I've yet to find a place doing it with scalpel where I live (Norway). I've found a shop doing it in Sweden and I plan to take a trip over and get it done there, but that brings me to the question:

I want the split around 1/2 my tongue, or at least as much of the visible part as possible, and what things can I do to prepare myself? And what do one do about the frenulum to maximize the depth?
I've currently got a tungue piercing and the piercing guy just put it on one of the sides of the frenulum, and it looks silly bellow.

Also, the piercing is about 1,75/2cm in on the tongue, my initial plan was to do the fishline method, but the piercing dude somehow didn't understand the ""as far in as possible"" thing so that's kinda not possible now...",,False,,t5_2qj5t,False,,,True,t3_12ynlk,http://www.reddit.com/r/bodymods/comments/12ynlk/tongue_split_and_lingual_frenulum/,

Thinking about getting my nipples pierced soon. For those of you (male or female, though I'm the latter) with both done, did you get them done in one go, or wait a while? I was sort of imagining the asymmetry would drive me mad, though I'm also afraid of the second one hurting more because of lack of adrenaline.
