The center circle represents number 1, as it makes a complete rotation every tick.  Number 2 is represented as an arc that makes a complete rotation every 2 ticks, number three as an arc that completes a rotation every three ticks, and so on.  The horizontal line shows the factors of the current number by bisecting the arcs that represent them.  

The current number is at the far right end of the horizontal line, and all its factors (if any) run along the line to the center circle (number 1).  Numbers with no factors (primes) are marked red, while those with factors (composites) are marked white.

Arrow keys up/down for zoom in/out, and right/left for faster/slower.

**EDIT**:  

*There is a bug I am fixing that results in some arcs not turning red when they should (FIXED)

*Also, I will be adding more features:

-Pause, Forward, Backward, Play

-Mouse over display to tell you what number each arc represents


**EDIT#2**:

I have received a ton of suggestions and ideas, and I will be placing the source code for this in GitHub, as I've already seen some feature additions implemented by others.  If you want to help out with features, let me know!  Also, this is actually my first javascript/html5 project, so if you are more experienced with these and have suggestions about the coding, feel free to let me know, thanks.

Also, you guys can do whatever you want with this, so share away.  


**EDIT#3**:

*I updated the simulation with a few feature requests (still working on stop/step forward/step backward)

-once numbers are discovered as either prime/composite, they remain their respective colors

-you can view the number and path of the arcs now by moving the mouse

*I setup a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/quantumtunneling/Number-Simulation) for this project, and submitted the latest version.

She was young, she was pretty, she was funny, and she was absolutely brilliant. She was an excellent teacher often forced to bow down to bureaucratic interests, to the loss of everyone involved. But like any teacher worth her pay, she never stuck to the lesson plan, never restricted her teaching to what would be on the AP test.

When I was in her class there was a two-page comic strip on the wall next to her desk, drawn by her then-fiance, later husband, featuring my teacher as Math Girl. Math Girl went off on an adventure to rescue Dr. Andrew Wiles from his Chinese captors, flying her mathcopter through Hilbert space to reach China in 8 attoseconds. Recognizing that here I had found a math teacher who knew far more than her teaching position would suggest, far more than any of my previous teachers, I stayed after school, between classes, talking with her, learning about topology and n-spheres and all sorts of things you'd never learn from a teacher in a public school in class. I kept up with her after I graduated, working with her on multivariable calculus problems that were a challenge for both of us, and eventually introducing my little brother to her as someone he could trust to act on what was right, not necessarily what the administration or other teachers were forcing upon any given situation.

She made quite an impact on my life, giving me a renewed interest in mathematics and introducing me to some fields I'd never heard of before. She was what I'd hope every math teacher could be. My classmates and I all loved her and her class, all her humorous anecdotes, and her frequent sympathizing with our frustrations with the administration. My fellow classmates are now attending the American University in Paris, St. John's in New York, UPenn, Princeton, Rice, Cornell, and many other prestigious universities, and even in those places their knowledge of statistics is remarkable among their peers, thanks to her tutelage. Her sudden death was a terrible shock to all of us. She will be missed.

I never got to say goodbye. Her funeral will be 2,400 miles away.",,False,,t5_2qh0n,True,,,True,t3_rqtcm,http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/rqtcm/eulogy_for_a_high_school_math_teacher/,

-----------
The internet needs a place to go and learn advanced maths, *true mathematics*. Khan academy and patrickjmt are great, but they stop at Differential Equations.

I'm going to try my best to do it. I bought a FlipVideo, [a mic setup](http://imgur.com/OTXfJ.jpg), and [a domain](http://thisismath.org). 

But I need your help. I am finishing my BS in Mathematics in December, so I am an amateur mathematician at best. I need to be corrected when I am wrong, and supported when I am right. Will you help me with this /r/math?

I will be teaching all of my courses on University of Reddit, starting with: [Introduction to Advanced Mathematics](http://universityofreddit.com/class/216). I will be uploading my videos to a Vimeo account, and cross posting them on UReddit and my site thisismath.org.

I want to start this now, and continue to build on it until I get my PhD. This is my new life; it is not half-hearted.

I am prepared to teach 6 courses:  
Introduction to Advanced Mathematics  
Elementary Analysis: Calculus Theory I  
Elementary Analysis: Calculus Theory II  
Complex Variables: Introduction to Complex Analysis  
Introduction to Abstract Algebra I  
Introduction to Abstract Algebra II

I appreciate any help or advice you can provide me; I want this to succeed more than I want to avoid hurt feelings, so please be constructive and honest.  
  
edit: You never really know how a post will be accepted. Frankly, I am flattered. Currently I am in need of honest criticism of the site thisismath since it will be the permanent aggregation of content-- hows the name? hows the look? is it cluttered? what pages should I include? what can I make better? etc.

It's a pretty simple game, none of the math is really complicated or anything, but a lot of the feedback I've gotten has indicated that I should make an enhanced version that could be used an educational game to teach math. Perhaps something on tablet interface, like an iPad or Andriod.

I guess I kinda see it, but I wanted some opinions to see what you all thought. It suppose it could be a fun way to reinforce basic addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. It could also touch on the concept that the order that certain operations are performed is important.

Do you think that an expanded version of this would have educational value? Could you think of any other mathematical concepts that it could be used to teach?

I just graduated with a 4.0 at a great (top 10) school as a Math major. I've been a TA for two and a half years, tutored for as long as I can remember, and I love teaching. I've had a passion for it for years. I would love to go get my master's in math education.

But I won't.

Top graduates like me who would love to  be teachers, and should be teachers, are instead going to more lucrative careers like marketing, actuarial sciences, software development, and professional schools (medicine, law, etc.) It's not even about selling out. It's about wanting to get paid even a remotely reasonable salary to attract us top graduates. It's about wanting to be respected in a field. It just boils down to wanting a good job, like any reasonable human being would want.

Teaching is not that job. Instead, just as an anecdotal example, old acquaintances who barely passed their math classes in high school are becoming math teachers because it's one of the only things they can do. Quality of teaching suffers, and hence people lose faith in the education system, further perpetuating this vicious cycle. Then, people want to slash education budgets even more.

Obviously, not every teacher is this. There are excellent teachers who still go through all this hell and are willing to take the hit. But the fact remains that there are a multitude of terrible teachers and the system is driving away top graduates like me. I know at least five friends out of my group of about eight who would easily be teachers if it weren't such a terrible job.

I wish I could become a teacher. I just want what you want as well; a job I love that can support a family and garner the respect that a teacher truly deserves. It's unfortunate that teaching will not fulfill this.

I'm sorry, children of tomorrow. Obviously, losing me is not that big of a deal (I don't meant this to sound like I'm an amazing end-all to education). But you've lost a plethora of would-be-excellent teachers due to the stupidity of the American education system.

I guess this isn't as math specific, but I feel like math needs the highest quality of teachers and suffers the most.",,False,,t5_2qh0n,False,,,True,t3_yjzxo,http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/yjzxo/math_education_in_the_usa/,

I allotted 5 minutes for ""what a professor does"", a few minutes to talk about the mandelbrot set, and the rest of the time for two activities; the Wolf-Goat-Cabbage problem, and the odd + odd = even etc. problem.

I passed out the first of four color mandelbrot pics (I made copies for each of them) and they went ape.  Excited yelling that had to be quieted by the teacher, a thousand questions for me, etc.  Then I passed out the second picture, where we zoomed (and they laughed when I called the second bulb of the set the ""butt"") and I pointed out the miniature copy of the set embedded therein.  They GOT IT.  They went NUTS.  (I got some good color pictures, and made bright color copies)  After picture three of four went out, I had to tell them that their teacher would pass out the fourth after I left, because they were getting bouncy excited out of control.  Questions, questions, questions.  Then I mentioned some research problem I worked on this summer, in passing, and they wanted to know all about it, and were floored that I worked ALL SUMMER on ONE PROBLEM!  And when I mentioned that after all that I didn't solve it, they laughed their asses off.

No activities, just talk about Fractals and a bit of other math research, happy children, and a teacher who didn't mind that we went over time.  

Afterwards, I've been told by three parents that their kids came home and wouldn't stop talking about the talk in general, and the Mandelbrot set in particular.  One kid is begging his mom to frame the pictures I passed out.  My own daughter said my talk was ""good."" but she gets this stuff all the time.

So... YAY!  Thanks for talking to me in my time of panic.  And if you ever have to talk to kids, now I can tell you what worked for me!

However, looking back on things, any success I had was due to egotistical exuberance more than anything, and there are a few things I wish someone told me at the beginning of my course. It would have made life so much easier. All of these statements come with the disclaimer ""if your course is anything like mine"", which means fairly rigorous, with an 80% exam at the end of semester. I'm also in Australia, so it might be different in other countries.

- Every class has roughly 100 techniques, theorems, etc that you will have to learn. Plan for this and know what they are. Don't let yourself wait until a week before exams to figure out which parts of the course were important. Keep your own list, and just fucking *know* them. Roughly 25 of them are things that are your bread and butter, and will use again and again for questions in the course. Know them inside and out, until you dream about them in your sleep. These are the things that you're paying your expensive-ass tuition for, and you're only cheating yourself if you don't know them.

- Show up to the damn lectures and practice classes. It doesn't matter how sharp you are: catching up on lectures is an uphill battle, and can guarantee you a mediocre to low grade. Practice classes are even more important, and directly correlate to knowing how to answer exam problems. Sooner or later though you'll miss something, and it's way better to miss a lecture than a practice class. Practice classes help you, well, practice, and are generally far more efficient at increasing your proficiency.

- In first year, pay attention every time you hear the word ""proof"". That shit's gonna take off in a big way in the next few years. You'll want to be comfortable reading and writing proofs, and will save a lot of trouble if that happens early.

- Don't let your eyes glaze over when lecturers show their work. It's easy to ""skip to the end"" and get the result of the theorem, but you will learn *so* much more when you take an extra two seconds and understand what they're actually saying and why it works. It's up there for a reason.

I think that's it. Hope it helps some fellow struggling undergrads.

Here is the skinny. First of all, most important, GO LEARN ALGEBRA. Seriously, I know you think its bullshit but its the most basic skill in some ways that any mathematician should know. Second learn Calculus: Single and Multivariable. If you are still interested here are some things to go onto next:

(1) Discrete mathematics: This includes equivalence relations (probably one of the most important things for you understand ever), propositional calculus (logic) proof techniques (induction) and some basic combinatorics (Pigeonhole principle). You can literally find any text book and start reading. The theory is kinda a hodge podge, but those are the major themes. 

(2) Linear Algebra: Again, one of the most important subjects you will ever study. Once you understand this, you are really on your way, and this stuff comes up everywhere. Many mathematicians have said many of the biggest proofs in the world come down to ""just some linear algebra"". The major point here is to understand that there is only one vector space for each dimension over a field and understand how a linear transformation becomes a matrix only after a choice of basis. Here equivalence relations come up again!

(3) Differential equations: Unless you're focused on engr math or serious applied stuff, don't worry too much about this. Seriously, its not that integral (haha get it!). 

(4) Complex Analysis: Yes, mathematicians and engr. actually do study ""imaginary"" numbers, but there is nothing imaginary here. This is serious stuff, do it. 

Okay, so now you're about at a sophomore/junior level place in mathematics. How to finish it off? Its not that unclear:

(1) Abstract Algebra -- Grab any book read about groups, rings, fields, vector spaces and modules. Proofs will be difficult here but work through it. There are so many books here, avoid Lang (good book but not for starting out), Dummit/Foote is okay. As a ugrad I had a good time with Rotman's An introduction to abstract algebra. 

(2) Analysis -- Grab Baby Rudin. No seriously, Grab this book, sit in a room for a semester and just fuckn' read it. You will basically be ""redoing"" calculus. This is a trial by fire, go!

(3) Topology -- Grab Introduction to Topology by J. Munkries. Its so well written it might as well be a coffee table book. 

There now, you basically have done everything a math major would. Yes there are lots of things that are missing, arguably the most important things depending on what your goals are. Typically one studies Num. Theory along with Abstract Algebra, or studies Analysis and Differential Equations together or Analysis and Topology. Seeing the links across different topics is important, but I'm just giving the overview here. 

Not every mathematician studies logic deeply and there are LOT of fringe topics that I'm omitting (including some of my favs: Projective Geometry, Varieties, Lattice/Order theory, Combinatorics, Elliptic Curves, Coding theory, Harmonic Analysis, etc). However, none of these are required courses at more than a 1% of programs. 

Stop asking for a ""good book on blah"" or ""I'm a novice and want to learn more"" because these questions are either (1) easy/clear to answer from literally 10 seconds of google/reading older posts or (2) is too vague to be of use. in order for the community to help you, its important for you to state why you want to learn what you want to learn. Stop trying to learn a topic about some buzzword you just found out about. Its probably not that important. Go to wiki, read the basic pages and get an idea. Then pick one thing and study it deeply for a while. Typically finding a book is easy, finding a study partner is hard. The latter is what the community should be for, not the former. There is no reason anyone in the world ""has to learn measure theory"" -- period. Or Galois theory, or anything in mathematics, unless you are becoming a mathematician or a professional in a mathematical field (abstract theoretical academic computer science for example, NOT programming/web developing). 

If you're just learning to learn great! Lovely! Pick up a book and start going through it! Don't skip the basics and don't pretend like this is the most important thing ever, it just what you find interesting. I would be more reactive to someone saying ""So I'm reading measure theory and I don't quite get why this part of the definition of this is stated this way"" or ""What do they really mean by almost""? I hate answering questions like ""I want to learn measure theory"" because that whole statement is just crap. If you do, start learning and ask a more meaningful question. 

TL;DR: I'm trying to address all posts like this at once. 

EDIT: Thanks to all who have upvoted to get this post to the top and to Shimei for addressing the concerns. Hopefully this is a small step towards more meaningful discussions on the front page (of /r/math).

I realize that as this community grows, it becomes harder to filter through the crap, but I feel it is our responsibility to keep the discussion alive without resorting to posting our feelings about how awesome 'e' is. As a community we are, more or less, able to keep the homework problems from getting upvotes by being polite, downvoting and directing them to /r/cheatatmathhomework. I think we can do the same with all the imgur and ""favorite theorem"" posts by sending stuff like that to /r/casualmath. I'm sure they'd love to get more traffic and subscribers,  the community was made to eat up stuff like the Collatz Conjecture, the Fibonacci Sequence and [Dance Moves for Mathematicians](http://www.neatorama.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/math-dance-moves.jpeg). But, its not up to just me or the mods, its up to everyone here to help keep this a *discussion* forum for mathematics. Let's try and do our best!

**TL;DR** So that we can keep this a place to discuss actual math, start downvoting [garbage](http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/s2l0r/lowercase_xi/) [posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/rusqa/my_teacher_put_this_on_the_board_took_me_a_second/) and send them to /r/casualmath.

**EDIT**: Some people seem to have misunderstood my motives, thinking that I was saying that if a post doesn't require a degree in math to understand, then it doesn't belong here. That is not at all what I was saying and if I wanted that kind of environment I would stick to /r/puremathematics. What I am saying is that this needs to be a place for mature mathematical discussion, of *any* level, and we need to discourage things that get in the way of discussion such as ""Hey guys! Sec(c) sounds like sexy, HAHAHA!"" The more we tolerate that kind of behavior, the closer we get to becoming a Reddit cesspool like /r/funny, /r/atheism or f7u12. So I mean mature in the ""I'm a grown-up"" sense, not the ""Mathematically Mature"" one. 

 If some middle-aged guy who hasn't done math since high school notices something interesting while adding some fractions together, we need to be a place where he can post about it and find some answers or spark a discussion, without being drowned by garbage like ""DAE think that lowercase xi is hard to draw?!"" If there is the occasional discussion about Monads, I won't complain, but we need to be open to mathematical *dicussion* (of *any* level), and not be a place where people who are looking for karma can post about how silly Taylor Expansions are.

Also, I may have gone too far with the ""Favorite Theorem"" stuff, but they're all the same with very little new discussion and people only mention buzz-theorems like Brower-Fixed Point or Godel's Incompleteness Theorems, so it's more of a circlejerk than a discussion. And I'm just tired of hearing about the Fibonacci Sequence and the Collatz Conjecture, so I may have been a little short with them. So they're cool as long as it is an actual discussion and not a ""DAE notice that the Fibonacci Sequence is awesome?!"" type of thing.",,False,,t5_2qh0n,True,,,True,t3_s3ejb,http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/s3ejb/a_disturbing_trend_this_is_not_rcasualmath/,

A property holding modulo primes is considered as ""local"" by number theorists, so you might succinctly say that a rational number is a square if it is a square locally almost everywhere.  It's a pretty powerful statement - from local information, we obtain something global about rational numbers.

One interesting aspect of this theorem, besides its statement - there was a period of 15 years where an error in Grunwald's original proof went unchecked.  In the late 1940s at Princeton, Wang (as a graduate student) found a counterexample to what was perhaps then known as ""Grunwald's Theorem"" - that an algebraic number is an nth power if it is an nth power locally almost everywhere.  This is mostly true, but 2, being the oddest prime, is ultimately responsible for some counterexamples.  Tate was a witness to Wang's discovery:

&gt;Some days later I was with Artin in his office when Wang appeared. He said he had a counterexample to a lemma which had been used in the proof. An hour or two later, he produced a counterexample to the theorem itself... Of course he [Artin] was astonished, as were all of us students, that a famous theorem with two published proofs, one of which we had all heard in the seminar without our noticing anything, could be wrong.

Wang's counterexample developed into his thesis.  

For all the details, see the [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grunwald–Wang_theorem).  For more of the mathematics and history behind the local-to-global principle and some of the algebraic concepts surrounding the Grunwald-Wang Theorem, I recommend this [excellent article by Roquette](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.72.4101).

Ok, so the store I manage has quite a few school pizza contracts, meaning we supply pizzas to nearly all of the schools in our area at least once a week. For example, tomorrow we are supplying three different schools with over 300 pizzas total.

So...what I could use some help with [**is this.**](http://i.imgur.com/mjKIb.jpg)

Basically, I'm looking for some equation that I can use to accurately estimate the amount of time to cook any given number of pizzas (Schools will typically get 40-65 pizzas per run, and receive as many as 4 different deliveries at different times) . As you can see in the picture, we use a double deck conveyor oven. Each oven can fit 2 pizzas side-by-side. However, the ovens don't like to provide identical results with identical settings, so they are set to different temps and different conveyor speeds. I think I've provided any other required info in the picture. Thank you for any help.

**EDIT: Thanks to DadMcFatherton and everyone for your help.**

I know it's not terribly interesting, but [this is what over 200 prepped boxes looks like](http://i.imgur.com/fksHo.jpg). Those stacks are two deep. And here [is the other 90 boxes](http://i.imgur.com/REfQ1.jpg). Not that exciting I know :) This is my life for the last 16 years though.

The cutter is ""the equalizer"". All slices have to be identical in size, so the kiddies don't get upset.

It took me about four months but I finally got the solution. Here is the problem:
Consider a standard chessboard with 64 squares. The Devil is in the room with you. He places one coin on each of the 64 squares, randomly facing heads or tails up. He arbitrarily selects a square on the board, which he calls the Magic Square.
Then you have to flip a coin of your choosing, from heads to tails or vice versa.
Now, a friend of yours enters the room. Just by looking at the coins, he must tell the Devil the location of the Magic Square.
You may discuss any strategy/algorithm with your friend beforehand.
What strategy do you use to do this?

I know all the formal definitions, and most of the exercises are pretty easy. We haven't done metric spaces or doughnuts turning into coffee cups yet, though.

It's just that... for most things in math, particularly real analysis you have the formal definition, and then you have an intuitive idea that keeps you from getting lost (or at least knowing whether or not you were lost.) Also my professor (who is pretty cool guy) is super russian, and it is hard to communicate the desire to have an intuition.

Wikipedia seems to suggest the idea of open sets as connections between elements in the sets, such as [in the seven bridges of konigsberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg), and this also fits into the idea of a closure of a set and disjoint sets being unconnected, but then you get silly things like bridges that go from an element to the same element, and a super bridge that goes everywhere is required by the definition of a topology.

I made a few slides introducing some of the material from Galois Theory. They are quite unrefined and no doubt contain errors; they are also very incomplete. I was wondering whether there were other redditors who would be interested in informal instructional materials to introduce Galois Theory (or other mathematical topics beyond the core requirements of an undergraduate math major).

Alternatively, would anyone else be interested in refining these and/or continuing them?

----------

**Additional Details:** I originally envisioned this as being a sort of storybook, starting with a single point and then moving on to increasingly abstract ideas. If you are disappointed it ended where it did (note: I am too!) and would like to develop the story further, I would welcome any assistance. If this could be a collaborative reddit effort that would be great, though I'm not quite sure what the best way to structure such an endeavor would be. In any event, consider what I posted to be in the public domain - with adaptation and extension highly encouraged.

He is getting his PhD in physics now, but coming straight out of college he joined the Navy, and in particular he applied for a special program at the Office of Naval Reactors, which designs the Navy's nuclear reactors for their subs and ships.  For historical reasons owing to Admiral Hyman Rickover's extreme obsessiveness (arguably a good trait in someone designing a nuclear reactor), since the 1950s all prospective applicants to the Naval Reactor's officer program have been interviewed in person by whichever four star admiral is in charge at the time (after a number of other interviews).

During my colleague's interview with the admiral, the admiral looked at him and asked, sternly, ""Could you please explain why you got a 'C' in algebra?""  As it turns out, our poor interviewee had taken a graduate level abstract algebra class and had worked his tail off for that C.  Unfortunately, his transcript simply listed the class as ""Algebra"" and he was forced to explain that it was, indeed, a difficult class, and a graduate one to boot.  The admiral looked at him and said, ""Hmm...well, I got an 'A' in my algebra class,"" and proceeded on with the interview (which my friend did indeed pass to get the job and the commission).

After the interview, my friend snickered about the admiral and his great math skills to get an A in ""algebra,"" until one day, when he was talking to another officer at work, and the other officer let him know that actually, the admiral had been a math major, and probably knew exactly what he was talking about during the interview.

For a little background, I am a third-year college student currently enrolled in an undergraduate Real Analysis class in the US.

So often, I feel that I am learning mathematics backwards. A professor will start a lecture (or a series of lectures) with a complex definition; and then he will go on to prove results about this seemingly arbitrary definition that materialized out of nowhere. Soon, theorems are stated and proven and often this sheds light on the reason for the definition, but this is not always the case. To make things worse, often times theorems themselves seem arbitrary and unmotivated.

Eventually, after a lot of painstaking effort on homework assignments or studying for exams, the definitions and theorems will make perfect sense and I will fully realize why everything is formulated the way it is.

The problem though, as you might have guessed, is that all this confusion and lack of motivation could be solved if everything had been taught/shown in the opposite order. If the professor/textbook had started out explaining what our goal is, what tools we have at our disposal, and how we plan to get there - there would have been many fewer ways to get lost or overwhelmed by information. This is because this is the completely natural way to form intuition and ideas. When we learn some thing, we gain an understanding of the concept, and only then do we attempt to express it formally.

My question is then, why is math taught this backwards way? I have seen it time and time again in multiple classes at multiple schools. I am really curious to hear others' opinions on the subject and if others have had similar experiences. If so, are there ways we can remedy the situation? Other opinions?

* What is there to research in math?

* What do you even do in higher-level math?

* What's the point of theoretical math?

in social settings such as parties, dates, small talk, etc.

Some strategies I've found are:

* mention applied math or physics first, which are more relatable. ""There's a lot of things you can do; for example, my roommate uses math to model populations of animals or spread of disease. I'm more interested in the theoretical side of things."" or ""Physicists seem to think the universe is 26-dimensional, so we're trying to better understand 26-dimensional shapes.""

* suppress the urge to be technically correct at all times. They aren't going to remember what you said anyway, so it's okay to say ""topology"" instead of ""geometry"" or lie about the conditions necessary for a theorem.

* talk about your general field first, rather than your specialization; for example, if your thesis was on equivariant cobordism of toric orbifolds, just say you study geometry. Try to give layman-accessible descriptions: ""I try to take ideas from one area of math and adapt them to work in others"" (category theory), ""study shapes by breaking them down into simpler shapes"" (simplicial methods), etc.

* give a cool real-life interpretation of a theorem. ""If you stir a glass of water, there will always be one molecule in the same place as when you started"" (cf. above about lying).

* if you get the ""I hated math in high school"", you can say that almost everyone does; real math is to high school math as composition is to learning note names. Be sure not to come off as condescending when explaining this.

* for justifying theoretical math, you can talk about applications, especially when there was a long gap between mathematical discovery and commercial applications: GPS (Riemannian geometry), online banking (number theory), and so forth. If talking to artsy people, it's more okay to say you study math for its own sake, the same reason people pursue music or art (cf. above on how real math is more creative than what people think math is).

* change the topic as quickly as possible, unless the person is interested (rare). Avoid talking about math in large groups or across a table/room.",,False,,t5_2qh0n,1368038259.0,,,True,t3_1dy3jn,http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1dy3jn/pure_mathematicians_how_do_you_talk_about_what/,

Please don't ever say this.  Ever, again, as long as you live.  Why is that?  Because it's a self-defeating statement.  When you tell yourself you're not good at math, you never will be.  So what can you say?  Well, how about this? *""I haven't had good enough teachers nor have I put in enough time to be good at mathematics.""*

Because really, that's just about all there is to it.  Teachers and time.  Right now, I'm an undergraduate on a math scholarship at a good public US university.  I've heard the words ""Oh, you're pretty good at mathematics,"" a lot, and I hate hearing them *every single time*.

I can identify no less than five points in my life (excluding where I was born, even if my parents aren't very mathematically inclined) where had things turned out differently, I wouldn't have been where I am now, and might not be planning to be a mathematician.  And all five were rather low-probability events.  All five were also due to having teachers who were ready, willing, and able to help me achieve at a high level in mathematics.  Did I get lucky?  You better believe it.

Then there's the time.  I started thinking logically about math probably around seventh grade, thanks to math competitions.  With homework and math done outside of school since then, I would guess that I've put in over seven *thousand* hours of thought into mathematics since then.  This is the real reason why thinking you're not good at mathematics is self-defeating - why put time into something you're not good at?

And I'm still only an undergraduate student, and an okay one at that.  I know a decent portion of those reading this will have heard of Malcolm Gladwell's ten-thousand-hour hypothesis.  Keep in mind that I've been doing mathematics for nine years now, and I'm still a long ways away from hitting that mark.

So next time you meet somebody who seems a lot better than you are at mathematics (and believe me, there will always be people like that) ask them how much time they've put in over the years.  The answer will probably surprise you.  Then talk to them about the teachers they had.

And then remember *three hours a day for a decade* is the amount of time most mathematicians have put in once they finish their PhDs.  Talent won't cut off more than a year or so of that.  So when you see a post like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/egwri/ask_rmath_end_compactification_and_calgebras/) and bemoan the fact that you're not ""that good at math"", remember those ten thousand hours.  (Also remember that 95% of math majors won't have seen the term C*-algebra as an undergraduate either, so that might be a bit misrepresentative...)",,False,,t5_2qh0n,False,,,True,t3_ehrn7,http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/ehrn7/im_fed_up_with_a_recent_trend_here_on_rmath/,

What I mean is if we assume another universe (that could be working with completely different laws of physics), would our maths still be applicable there ? What about if there was no universe at all ?

With physics, you have to discover the laws that are applicable in your universe and then work from there. In mathematics, we can start with any set of axioms we like. The only thing it seems to depend on is the ability to define those axioms, and a concept of true and false.

What do you think ? I am even making sense, and if not, why ?

Edit : For the people saying that as the universe is everything, considering another universe is silly. I see the point, but in this case just imagine ours doesn't exist and there's something else (different in some ways) in its place.",,False,,t5_2qh0n,1368652075.0,,,True,t3_1edjc6,http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1edjc6/is_mathematics_independent_from_the_universe/,

It is basically the distributive law. Example: 
108\*32 = 108*(30+2) = 3240 + 216 = 3456.

I know you guys probably know it but I feel very excited since I was able to figure out why we multiply like that.

I guess I must mention that I was never taught ""why"" it works in elementary school. It was just some algorithm they threw at me which happens to work.

Lastly, although Differential Geometry is very popular, it is a very messy and pictorial course that would be harder to teach clearly online. Although I recommended a first course in analysis as a prerequisite, the Measure Theory and Lebesgue Integration could should be accessible to those who have taken Calculus 1-2 and have some basic familiarity with metric topology. If anyone would like to step up and teach a course on Differential Geometry, or any other subject, please let me know. Thanks for you comments, votes and opinions!** 

**Here is the [link](http://ureddit.com/class/205) to the class page at UReddit. Here is the [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/MTALI_Summer_2011/)** to the course reddit.


In theory, many of us would like to read through a math textbook over the summer and better educate ourselves. That being said, it can often be daunting to work through a large book or pdf file, which have a tendency to be dry, terse and unmotivated. Additionally, there are those who are deciding what courses to take next fall, and might want a glimpse of what different branches of math are about.


To that end, I thought it would be a good idea to have an introductory ""crash"" course that consists of 2-3 pages of material at a time, presented in a more expository manner than would generally be found in a textbook. One or two interesting exercises might also be included. I imagine that the course would be similar to the topology course offered earlier this year, although less intensive and problem-based. 


I believe that there are many here on /r/math who would like to learn something different over the summer, and also many seniors/grad students who would be interested in sharing what they know. 


Personally, I'd be interesting in running a course on one of the following: 

(Update: I'll be tabulating how many people are interested in each course)

(1) Measure Theory and Lebesgue Integration (7)

Prerequisites: A course in Real Analysis, covering Riemann/Riemann-Stieljes integration.

(2) Topology (5)

Prerequisites: mathematical maturity. 

(3) Differential Geometry (5)

Prerequisites: Calculus 1-3, some Linear Algebra

(4) Real Analysis (4)

Prerequisites: Calculus 1-3

(5) Upper Division Linear Algebra (Inner Product Spaces, Orthogonal/Unitary Operators, Spectral Theorem, Jordan Form, etc.) (10)

Prerequisites: Calculus 1-2, A first course in Linear Algebra

(6) Complex Analysis (3)

Prerequisites: Calculus 1-3


If you are interested in other branches of mathematics, let me know, and I'm certain we can find someone on /r/math who would be excited to teach it. 


If you think this is a good idea, and would like to participate, please comment. If you think it is a bad idea, please share your opinion. Thanks!  

---

**UPDATE: It appears that Measure Theory and Lebesgue Integration, Differential Geometry, Topology and Upper Division Linear Algebra are the most popular. I'm going to take pmoney's advice and post a comment for each one, which will be an easier way of deciding which is the most popular.**

**UPDATE 2: Differential Geometry and Measure Theory and Lebesgue Integration seem to be getting very popular. I've uploaded sample syllabi for [Differential Geometry](http://www.mediafire.com/?9q7yzdg8wg27snb) and [Measure Theory and Lebesgue Integration](http://www.mediafire.com/?kvmh9ieeshy5626).

It would be an introductory course, and cover the basics of category theory: categories, functors, natural transformations, duality, (co)-limits, representable functors, adjoints, and maybe monads. Could also have bonus topics at the end: higher/enriched categories, topoi, homotopical algebra, etc.

If you're interested:

* what topics would you like to see covered? (e.g. interested in monads for programming, abelian categories, etc.)
* what media (handouts, video lectures, Skype sessions) do you think is best for this?
* what is your level of mathematical education?

**UPDATE:** It seems like one or two people are interested. I'll post again in the summer when it starts up. Since this is an introductory course, we may not get too heavily into the bonus topics (future course?).

A number of people have asked what the prerequisites for this course are. I think the bare minimum would be:

* set theory: know what products, coproducts (disjoint unions), etc. are, know the paradoxes, know what posets are, know what injections/surjections/bijections are and maybe a bit about cardinals. This is pretty much just language/history and can be picked up in an afternoon or two on Wikipedia.

* algebra: know what vector spaces/linear transformations are, ideally know what groups/monoids are. Knowledge of module theory definitely a plus. Know a few kinds of homomorphisms (linear transformations, ring homomorphisms, group homomorphisms, etc.), and **understand the concept of isomorphism**

* mathematical maturity: probably the most important; basically remain calm and carry on when all the mathematics you've ever known and loved gets abstracted away into dots and arrows.

Of course, a lot of examples will come from high-tech stuff like homological algebra and algebraic topology; however, you can still understand the theory with very basic examples (I myself learned category theory concurrently with my intro point-set topology course, and before learning what modules were).

**Even if you don't have all the prerequisites, I think it's still worthwhile to follow along casually.** There's no evaluation or anything, you don't have to invest anything but time. It's a good experience to get exposed to higher mathematics, and a lot of the time I'll be talking about the ideas / intuition of category theory, which is extremely valuable and ought to be accessible to everyone.

I think that the moderation team should take a much more active approach and that simplistic posts about math below the basic college level (calculus), such as ""what is 2.4/19"", be removed.

This is Zach from SMBC, and I have a math question you may find of interest. I only mention who I am because it relates to the idea.

I had an idea for a comic about gerrymandering. As you may know, gerrymandering is a significant social problem, in that it stifles voters' opinions. So, my idea was this: Why not make a rule that perimeter/area always has to be under a certain value.

I figured this would limit how salamander-like the districts could be made. Then, I tried to figure out the math of this on the assumption that it was a simple calculus minmax problem. It seems not to be...

The biggest problem I'm running into is how to formalize the idea of a shape being weird. My intuition tells me that the lower perimeter/area is, the less weird the shape. I.e. a wacky snakey shape designed to get several populations will have a higher perimeter/area than a more reasonable district shape, which should be vaguely rectangular or circular.

But, I don't know how to mathematize that. If that could be proved, you could probably figure out a reasonable ratio.

Thoughts?

I call it ""The Garage Door Problem""",mpavlofsky,263,74,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/15g5ng/im_not_a_mathematician_by_any_stretch_but_i/,"Hey /r/math, I thought of this one today after I couldn't figure out the garage door code at a friend's house. I don't know if it's particularly challenging, but I thought you might enjoy it, and I'm interested in knowing if there's an answer. 

Visualize, if you will, a garage door opener. Typically, they require a 4 or 5 digit passcode to open, and you usually have to hit ENTER to send it. Because of this, the maximum number of keystrokes required to brute force the door code is 50,000 (10,000 combinations from 0000 to 9999 times 4 strokes to enter each one plus an ENTER each time). 

Now take away the ENTER key requirement, and program the door such that it will open once the correct 4 keys have been pressed in order; that is, if the code is 4567, and I start guessing numbers in order (1234567), it will open as soon as I hit the 7 key. 

Instinctively, the new maximum number of keystrokes required to brute force the garage door opener is 10,003. Going back to the previous example, I have guessed 4 unique combinations in 7 keystrokes (1234, 2345, 3456, and 4567), so if each additional keystroke creates a new combination of 4, all possible combos will be entered in 10,003 keystrokes. My question is, *is this possible?* Can the keys be pressed in such an order that no 4-digit combinations can be repeated? If not, what is the 'smallest maximum' number of keystrokes required to guess all 10,000 combinations? And, can this solution be generalized to an X-digit keypad, an N digit long passcode, or even possibly a situation where the hacker doesn't know the length of the passcode itself (just that he has a 10-digit number pad)?

The most (in)famous example is the choice of pi in the circle related formulas. The choice of tau = 2 pi would simplify most formulas: volume of the n-sphere, Riemann sums, Fourier transform, Cauchy's formulas... Given how often they appear, imagine the gain in ink alone! However, pi has be used for centuries, is used by most mathematicians and is in thousands of book. Gaining a factor 2 might not be worth the hassle...

Well, the situation of pi is surely not alone. So, if you had the occasion to start mathematics from scratch, and could replace freely any notation or convention you wish, what would you do?

**Edit**: Just to be clear: the ""pi vs. tau"" paragraph was not intended as propaganda, but as an example what I'm looking for. I also thought that, by mentioning pi and tau in my post, I would avoid a dozen answers about pi and tau, but perhaps was I optimistic...

For any modification proposed here, I'm sure we can find somebody who thinks the current notations are better.

I also think this exercise would have some pedagogical interest. Some subjects are hard to learn, and the notations are not always helping.

Lots of you probably already know about this but it was the most mind-expanding/mind-bending thing that has happened to me in a math class in awhile, so I figured I'd share in case anyone hasn't seen this.

It turns out that instead of looking at the Fibonacci sequence as a recursively defined sequence (apologies for my lack of TeX-fu) 

    f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(n+1)=f(n-1)+f(n)   n &gt; 2

You can look at it as a matrix operation as follows (double apologies for lack of TeX-fu—if anyone reads this, is there some kind of tutorial page or something so I can figure out how to do this prettier?):

    [1 1] [f(n)  ] =  [f(n+1)]
    [1 0] [f(n-1)]    [f(n)  ]

Which was mind-blowing enough for me. Again this might seem really basic and obvious to a lot of you, but just learning this stuff for the first time, it really makes you realize how much math-beauty there is in the world that you haven't seen. But then it gets better. If you let

    A = [1 1]
        [1 0]

    u = [f(1)] = [1]
        [f(2)]   [1]

The f(n) can just be computed as the top entry of A^n-2 u, which ends up being 

f(n) = (√5)((1+√5)/2)^n - (√5)((1-√5)/2)^n

Which made me go *what*??? So instead of a recursively defined Fibonacci sequence, we have (I guess) a non-recursively defined function that was derived by matrix operations. I could hardly even believe it at first (although it makes sense) so [I had to try it out](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%28sqrt5%29%2F5%29%28%281%2Bsqrt5%29%2F2%29^10-%28%28sqrt5%29%2F5%29%28%281-sqrt5%29%2F2%29^10%2C+fibonacci%2810%29%2C+).

I've begun to study logic on my own now (as a sophomore seeking a degree in Electrical Engineering) and to me it seems as though it should be taught much earlier, before even basic mathematics.

My argument relies on harnessing the innate curiosity of the individual. I *think* that if we first teach young'ns the way to *prove* something, not only to others, but to themselves, the average student will feel themselves empowered with the addition of each new mathematical operation or concept further down the road. Things will be demystified, in a way.

Am I wrong? Why?

Would love to hear any other puzzles that seem undoable on first sight.

A room has 100 boxes labelled 1 through 100.  The names of 100 prisoners have been placed inside the 100 boxes (1 per box).  Each prisoner will in turn, enter the room, look inside (at most) 50 of the boxes in an attempt to find his/her name.  They then leave the room and the room is returned to it's original state for the next prisoner.  They cannot communicate once this starts, but beforehand they may collude to come up with a strategy.

If **all** prisoners find their own name, they live.  If even one fails, they all die.  Clearly if each prisoners picks 50 at random, the probability of success is (1/2)^100 , rather small.  Find a strategy that gives them a better than **30%** chance of survival.

I'm employed as a mathematician, I have devoted my life to the pursuit, even if I'm not the 'best' or in the 'elite'. I very often on /r/math see the same type of post, things similar to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/l66um/a_which_schools_offer_undergraduate_classes_in/). 
 
Please, for all of you prospective majors, current majors, interested parties, graduate students, etc, etc, understand this. There is no single area of mathematics that is 'better' or more 'special' than any other. Its fine to get excited by some tantalizing idea that someone exposes you to and to learn more, I think that is what this community is about. But, if I may, I would like to discourage the following behavior. Don't just follow something because it got 'name dropped'. Meaning, if you hear someone say 'category theory is the *real* mathematics', I'm sorry but they are wrong. Category theory wasn't even developed until very recently on the mathematical historical scale and many great and deep thinkers didn't understand categories. Its not required to do research, its not required to understand the most interesting problems in mathematics. This problem persists on pretty much every level! If you are an undergraduate, you are not getting yourself better prepared for grad school by learning the definition of a measure, nor are you left out if you enter graduate school and have never heard of Galois theory before. 

There is no short cut to mathematics and no holy grail. Each of these 'fancy' theories are designed for specific purposes. If you don't have the background or the aim, then it might be worse preparation to learn them! Also, you can get a good idea just by reading some things online rather than 'taking a course' which can be a waste of time if you are only taking it because you think it will be the 'important' mathematics. 

Please, if you are not being challenged in your program, or you want to learn more than what is offered, do a reading course with a faculty member at your school. Don't just post a question like ""where can I learn really cool awesome world changing math in 5 secs"" here after only a couple minutes thought and no reading. Save yourself the trouble. 

Better yet, instead of telling you not to do something I will tell you to do something. There are tremendous and important problems, which are able to be made clear at all levels. Here are some ideas for the interested student to read more about:

[Pythagorean triples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple), [Congruent Numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congruent_number) and their relationship to rational points on [algebraic curves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_curve). 

[Dual spaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_space) are incredibly important and are usually not covered at most undergraduate linear algebra classes. 

How about understanding [Green's theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green's_theorem) and differential forms or the failure thereof on the punctured plane (for example) from the perspective of [de Rham theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Rham_cohomology)?

Have you thought about classic problems related to [Analytic Continuation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_continuation)? 

All of these topics (and many many more!) can be phrased accessibly to undergraduates and can be viewed as the important principles guiding the biggest current theories being studied now (mondronomy, Hodge theory, rational points on abelian varieties, Riemann Hypothesis, problems concerning various machineries and cohomology theories, etc etc). 

I'm sorry, but no matter how 'big' you think those big ideas are, I assure you there are techniques more abstract, bigger and even more unaccessible. Your program is not necessarily deficient if it does not offer certain topics  like categories or measures. There just isn't a short cut in mathematics, and all these special big theories are best appreciated when one has attempted to understand the root problems in their core context. 

TL;DR: Get good at the basics and learn more about the basic theory instead of spending a semester or wasting time learning definitions about abstract mathematical tools that won't help you in graduate school! In other words, go find a giant and stand on its shoulders before you try to see the tops of the clouds. 

Downvote away.

Some of my friends in the math department here at my university like to give each other some clever math puzzles to do in our spare time, and I'm afraid I've run out of new ones.

My personal favorite was one presented by one of our professors which was a variant on the prisoners and hats puzzle. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_and_hats_puzzle

So, 10 prisoners are arrested for a crime, but the jail is full and there's nowhere to put them. The jailer then comes up with a solution. He tells the prisoners that tomorrow he will give each of them either a white or a black hat and then place them in a line so that the first prisoner can see all the other prisoner's hats, the second prisoner can see all the hats but his own and the first prisoner, and so on. They will then be asked, in order, to state the color of their hat. They may only answer ""white"" or ""black"". If they correctly state the color of their hat, they may go free, otherwise, they will be executed. They are then allowed to communicate with each other and come up with a plan beforehand, but no communication besides guessing their hat is allowed once the test begins. How many prisoner's can definitely be saved, and what is a plan they could use to save them?

When we came up with that answer, we where then asked to consider a more general case with m prisoners and n different hats. Then countably many prisoner and n hats, countably many hats, and uncountably many hats.

Edit: To clarify, in the general cases, the prisoners can only speak one time, and it can only be a valid type of hat, not just ""black"" or ""white"".",,False,,t5_2qh0n,1365024489.0,,,True,t3_1bksoo,http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1bksoo/what_is_your_favorite_logic_or_math_puzzle/,

(For people who don't understand how Secret Santa works: everyone in the group writes his/her name on a scrap piece of paper. Names get put into a hat, and you randomly draw a name. The name of person you draw is the person for whom you have to buy a gift. If anybody gets their own name, there has to be a redraw.)

So, of course the obvious question came up of how often does a redraw happen? How often is it the case that someone in the group will get his own name, and everyone has to draw again?

(End of question)

My colleague and I wasted a ton of time trying ridiculously unsuccessful ways to come upon the solution. We tried to work it out purely through math, and arrived at such answers as 1/6, 5/6, 1/1, and 66.

We then brute forced listed by hand all the possibilities. We found that with two people, failure rate was 50%. With three people, failure rate was 50%. With four people, failure rate was 15/24, and there we were stumped.

We then tried the empirical method by actually drawing straws (for a scenario of 6 people). We gave up after 10 tries: 5 fails (at least one person got his own name, so there has to be a redraw), and 5 succeeds (no person got his own name).

Then my friend asked one of her friends (who is in engineering), and he said 2.5% chance of failure. He then said, wait...that's not right...I have to think about this.

So I turn to you r/Math! What the hell is the answer?

I'm having trouble advancing in math (specifically 3D math) because I can't accept complex numbers as a valid part of computation. I don't understand how a formula can be solved with more than one undefined variable. For example, if I have (primitive equations, just proving a point):

x = y * 3

... I can solve for 'x' with no problem, I can even solve for y by reversing the equation, just depending on what variable value is known. As long as there is no more than 1 undefined variable in the equation, we can solve it.

So how in the HELL can mathematicians say ""it doesn't look like it should, but this 'just works' "":

x = y * i * 3

... where i is the undefined complex number (square root of -1). There are now two unknown variables here, how am I (a human) supposed to solve that? I know that it works because the majority of 3d math uses it all the time, but I don't understand WHY or HOW it works.

I've googled and I've googled, but nobody seems to offer an explanation of this beyond just ""trust that it works"". Maybe they did and I just didn't understand it. But either way this is proving a pretty big stumbling block to my advancement because I'm coming to regard higher level math as bullshit, as a result of this confusion.

In case you don't know: Homotopy Type Theory is a synthetic approach to Homotopy Theory. What this means is that we postulate something about how certain classes of spaces work (in this case CW Complexes/infinity-groupoids) and work in that theory. This lets us do several interesting things.

1. The tightest reflexive relation is homotopy equivalence. In other words, equality *is* homotopy equivalence.

2. The above obviously requires proof-relevance. In other words, not all proofs are equal. For example, the set {0, 1} is equal to itself, but there are two distinct proofs of that. In fact, propositions are considered equal to CW Complexes (unless you are using silly tricks).

3. HoTT will (probably) let us extract information from proofs. That means that if you prove ""exists x such that phi(x)"", then you can actually tell what x is. In fact, every function is (probably) computable.

4. To enable the properties above, HoTT is constructive; it doesn't have excluded middle, proof by contradiction, or any such 'silly' things. The lack of proof by contradiction does not mean you don't have proof of negation; saying that P is false because assuming it leads to contradiction is valid. Additionally, you can get classical logic back in multiple ways. Being constructive isn't bad: when was the last time you heard a category theorist say ""To prove that this diagram commutes, let us assume that it does not...""?

5. It makes computer-validated proofs a lot easier.

6. There's already talk about applications in programming.

7. Really, it's quite elegant: you get to say 'equal' instead of 'isomorphic', you get *very* systematic axioms, etc.",,False,,t5_2qh0n,False,,,True,t3_1hdvmx,http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1hdvmx/what_in_your_opinion_is_the_most_exciting_new/,

When I was in middle school I was at a restaurant and my waiter was dividing 5 digit numbers by 1 digit numbers (e.g. 17695 / 4) faster than we could put it into a calculator. Of course, of the 10 one digit numbers, 7 is the toughest to divide. After all, fractions are really easy to come by for 2 (.5, .0), 3, 4, 5...etc...everything is easy except for 7. 

I began to do what he did, with 3 digit numbers at first, then 4. I showed off to him next time I was at the restaurant and he showed me this REALLY nifty trick for dividing by 7.

The first thing you need to know is that 1/7 = .142857 (repeating, all of these are repeating .1428571428571428571..etc) ... now notice that there are 6 digits of that repeating decimal. There are also 6 ways to get a fraction when dividing by 7. 1/7, 2/7, 3/7, ... , 6/7.

Also notice that the 6 numbers are different. 1,4,2,8,5, and 7. 

1/7 = .142857, 2/7 = .285714, 3/7 = .428571, 4/7 = .571428, 5/7 = .714285, 6/7 = .857142 (All repeating). 

The trick: of the 6 numbers 1,2,4,5,7,8, 1/7 has a certain sequence. 2/7 has the SAME SEQUENCE, but shifted over to the 2nd highest digit (2). (.285714, which is .142857 shifted over to where the 2 starts). 3/7 is the same, you go to the 3rd highest number: 4; and start from there: .428571. The rest is the same. 4/7: 5 is the 4th highest number, so .571428..etc.

I thought it was a great trick, and now I can divide in my head pretty fricken well.",,False,,t5_2qh0n,True,,,True,t3_90ts0,http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/90ts0/is_this_trick_for_dividing_by_7_popularly_known/,

bacgrkound: This man has been coming into my work for the 2 years i've been working at this convenience store. After expressing some interest in math to him, he as taken it upon himself to attempt to explain mathematical concepts and number games to me, of which i understand very little. I do enjoy math, but have no understanding of much beyond basic algebra. I have told him numerous times that much of this was over my head, yet he continues to make diagrams and charts and formulas for me to look over. I told him I would take a picture and see if the internet could help me to understand so i could at least chat with him about it.

I know it has to do with groupings of numbers that add up to another number. He gave me an example by placing 6 marbles on the counter and showing me the different sets of marbles that add up to 6. 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, or 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, and so fourth. I'm pretty much lost after that, but i believe something in the nature of those groupings is related to the groupings that compose the next higher integer (7 in this case).

**What is the point of him doing this? is it a number game? does it prove anything? would this be fun if i understood it? does it make sense?** The  man mumbles and speaks softly so i have a hard time understand him at times. Help me r/math.

I've just written a short article about Matrix Calculus. This is not the usual Vector Calculus: it deals with the differentiation of expressions which involve matrices and vectors. For instance, you might want to differentiate the multivariate Gaussian distribution with respect to the covariance matrix.
There are some tutorials and books that deal with this subject, but I feel that my article is still unique in some respects:

* it is self-contained and concise
* it isn't just a collection of formulas
* it explains *how* to compute differentials and derivatives
* it covers some of the theory needed to really understand things

Please let me know if there are points in the text which need some clarification, or if you find any mistakes.

Hi r/math, 

Alright, so although my background is in EE/DSP, (heavy math no doubt), I am not a full blown mathematician, but versed enough to be dangerous. 

That being said, when I learn new concepts in math, (especially involving vector spaces, etc), I usually draw myself a nice 2-D example, and work from there. If I 'get it' in 2D, I can then verify that I also get it in 3D. If I get it in 3D, then I can easily be content that my visualization/intuition that has taken me this far, applies that same way in hyperdimensional N-D, even though I cannot visualize it. 

This has served me very very well for very long. In fact, nothing I have come across has failed me thus far. 

I am currently taking an optimization course that has led me to new concepts in N-D, (polyhedra, etc), and once again, what I 'get' in 2D/3D, I easily get in ND. 

So my question is, is this a good method for me to use/be using? Put another way, if there any concept that does NOT generalize from 2/3D into ND? What might such a thing, if it exists, be? 

Thanks in advance! :-)",,False,,t5_2qh0n,False,,,True,t3_1ateut,http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1ateut/are_there_any_concepts_that_dont_generalize_from/,

Anyway it was just an interesting thought problem that popped into my head the other day. What I mean by ""explicitly referred to"" is either spoken out loud, written, or explicitly used for some ID. I say explicitly because I'm sure there's various databases with very long IDs that auto-generated, but I wouldn't count those because it's not people using them specifically. ID numbers that are directly used by people *do* count though -- phone numbers and UPCs for example.

I know the US uses 10 digit phone numbers, so pretty much any 10 digit number has probably been spoken, dialed, written or typed at some point by somebody. (That seems reasonable to assume to me, but I welcome thoughts. That is 9 billion unique numbers, but even the ones that have never been assigned to any phone line may have been misdialed, misspoken, or used as an estimate for world population at some point).

I do think it's safe to assume that all numbers up to some certain point have simply been spoken out loud before. Certainly every number up to a million, and I think it's likely up to a billion. That's tough to prove either way though, I'd like to see someone's logic on that. The number of digits in phone numbers of other countries could be a factor for 8-, 9-, 10- and 11- digit numbers. UPCs are 12 digits, but I don't think that necessarily covers all 12 digit numbers. In fact I'm sure UPCs alone, even with all previous mistakes and typos writing them out, do not cover all 12 digit numbers. Are there other common uses of 12 digit numbers that might make the order of magnitude of the smallest yet-unused number higher? For now, that's my guess, would love to end up being wrong though.",,False,,t5_2qh0n,False,,,True,t3_199vpt,http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/199vpt/what_do_you_think_is_the_order_of_magnitude_of/,

Not like I can pull out Euclid or Kiselev ( http://www.amazon.com/Kiselevs-Geometry-Book-I-Planimetry/dp/0977985202 ) with (most of) my students, but the modern American math textbook is a bloated piece of crap.

Why do people not like math?  Its because they remember it as being presented as boring facts to memorize and ridiculous ""real world"" applications in 25 pound books that jumble topics so poorly that you learn the distance formula before the Pythagorean theorem and the Pythagorean theorem before area.

1330362911.0,151,self.math,q8art,I just received an email from Elsevier.  Looks like they are finally responding to the protest.,weaselword,186,35,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/q8art/i_just_received_an_email_from_elsevier_looks_like/,"Here's the letter in full:

**A letter to the mathematics community.**

We are writing to let you know of a series of changes that we are making to how the Elsevier mathematics program will be run. Some of these are new initiatives, and some reflect changes that we have been working on over a longer period.

We have been listening actively to the community and we see a number of issues that we need to address, not least being open to what the community has to say:

Pricing
Mathematics journals published by Elsevier tend to be larger than those of other publishers. On a price-per-article, or price-per-page level, our prices are typically, but not always, lower than those of other mathematics publishers.

Our target is for all of our core mathematics titles to be priced at or below US$11 per article (equivalent to 50-60 cents per normal typeset page) by next year, placing us below most University presses, some societies and other commercial competitors. Where journals are more expensive than this, we will lower our prices, as we already have in recent years for journals such as the Journal of Algebra and Topology and its Applications, among others.

We realize that this is just part of the concerns about pricing -and we will seek to address concerns about the nature and composition of the large discounted agreements, through which most Universities now access journals - but addressing the base line pricing is a necessary first step.

Access and Open Archives
To make clear that we are committed to wider access, we have made the archives of 14 core mathematics journals open, from four years after publication, back to 1995, the year when we started publishing digitally. All current and future papers featured in these journals will become free to read, for subscribers and non subscribers alike. This initiative is part of a number of open access publishing options we have available which give researchers the freedom to choose to open their research beyond the academic community. For more information about Elsevier's open access options, visit [www.elsevier.com/openaccess](http://mail.elsevier-alerts.com/go.asp?/bESJ001/mHDM9Z4F/qQDVIZ4F/uQ1WQC2F/x4Q3CZ4F).

We are a founding partner in [Research4Life](http://mail.elsevier-alerts.com/go.asp?/bESJ001/mHDM9Z4F/q84M0Z4F/uQ1WQC2F/x4Q3CZ4F), a public private partnership providing journal content to researchers in the developing world. More than 1600 Elsevier journals, including our mathematics titles, are available in more than 100 developing countries.

Our position on RWA
Elsevier has announced today that we are withdrawing our support for the Research Works Act. In recent weeks, our support for the Act has caused some in the community to question our commitment to serving the global research community and ensuring the best possible access to research publications and data. We have heard concerns from some Elsevier journal authors, editors and reviewers that the Act would be seen as a step backwards for expanding options for free and low cost public access to scholarly literature. That was certainly not the intention of the legislation or our intention in supporting it. Please read [our full statement](http://mail.elsevier-alerts.com/go.asp?/bESJ001/mHDM9Z4F/qHD4IZ4F/uQ1WQC2F/x4Q3CZ4F) online.

Moving forward
Now that we have explained the steps we have taken so far we want to stress this is just the beginning.

We will create a scientific council for mathematics, to ensure that we are working in tandem with the mathematics community to address feedback and to give greater control and transparency to the community and we will engage actively with leaders in a number of countries to ensure that our mathematics program is meeting the needs of the community, globally and locally.

There are many other issues where we wish to engage with the community, including our efforts to improve digital rendering of mathematics, the use and misuse of citation measures for the discipline and our efforts to ensure high standard across all of our journals.

We welcome your views on these and all our efforts at: mathematics@elsevier.com

    Show that, for all positive integers n,

        [; \frac{1}{\sqrt{4n+1}} &lt; \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{6} \cdot \,\cdots\, \cdot \frac{2n-1}{2n} \leq \frac{1}{\sqrt{3n+1}}. ;]

    Can you improve this approximation?

If you'd like to do this problem yourself, you should ignore my post in r/cheatatmathhomework where I give a solution.  There are a couple different ways to do it that I see, so after you've found one you should try finding another!

Now, what interested me was the challenge to improve the approximation.  After staring at the bounds for a long time with no results I decided I it might be helpful to take a break and [look at a plot of the situation](http://i.imgur.com/jPi4H.png) (the product in the middle of the inequality was made continuous by using the [gamma function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function)). The upper bound seemed pretty good, but the lower bound definitely had room for improvement.  So I put my years of experience to work and... started plugging in numbers at random to see what would happen.

In these plots I change where we are on the n-axis a bunch so don't be alarmed.

* [(4\*n + 1)^-1/2 ](http://i.imgur.com/c2GDu.png) - This is the lower bound from the original problem.  Let's see if we can narrow that gap.

* [(3.5\*n + 1)^-1/2 ](http://i.imgur.com/Lsvtl.png) - Hey that's a little better.  Can we go further?

* [(3.1\*n + 1)^-1/2 ](http://i.imgur.com/4ddM4.png) - Oh, that's too much, it crosses the blue line.  Increase it a little bit...

* [(3.2\*n + 1)^-1/2 ](http://i.imgur.com/EXDnj.png) - Hmm, so 3.1 is too low but 3.2 seems to be fine this far out... could it be?

* [(Pi\*n + 1)^-1/2 ](http://i.imgur.com/1E2VL.png) - Now I'm on to something.  Whenever you see Pi you know it wasn't an accident.

So, can I prove it?  Preliminary investigation of bounds of the form (c\*n + 1)^-1/2 showed that my method for verifying the original inequality could do no better than the given (4n + 1)^-1/2 , so I was out of luck there.  Try and try as I might, I just couldn't seem to get the result to fall out, and I had a gut feeling that a proof of this new lower bound would require some heavy machinery.  It was at this point that I posted the question to r/cheatatmathhomework in the hopes that someone would have something applicable in their toolbox.  Liberalkid suggested using Stirling's approximation, which I think has the potential to reveal a bound of a different form, but I'm too tired to try to work through it tonight--maybe someone else would like to have a go?

After posting I turned to google to see if I could find anything useful, and I discovered that the problem had a very interesting history!

In 1956, D. K. Kazarinoff proved that

        [; \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi n + \pi/2}} &lt; \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{6} \cdot \,\cdots\, \cdot \frac{2n-1}{2n}, ;]

which is slightly worse than my guess of (Pi\*n + 1)^-1/2 .  His proof also revealed where the Pi comes from: [Wallis' formula](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/WallisFormula.html).  This bound was sharpened to less-than-*or-equal-to* by G. N. Watson in 1959.  In 1985, the bound was improved by J. Dutka to

        [; \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi n + \pi (n+1)/(4n+3)}} &lt; \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{6} \cdot \,\cdots\, \cdot \frac{2n-1}{2n}. ;]

The next year, J. Bustoz and M. E. H. Ismail [wrote a paper](http://www.jstor.org/pss/2008180) which set out to show exactly *why* these types of bounds existed.  It turns out that it is entirely due to the monotonicity of a few related families of functions involving the gamma function.  Finally, the best possible bound of

        [; \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi n + 4 - \pi}} \leq \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{6} \cdot \,\cdots\, \cdot \frac{2n-1}{2n} ;]

was found by Chao-Ping Chen in 2006 ([PDF of paper](http://math-res-pub.org/content/cma/abstr111.pdf) and [Google reader link](http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:ksgDTDNUklgJ:math-res-pub.org/content/cma/abstr111.pdf)), who used some heavy-duty calculus and the convolution theorem for Laplace transforms to find the final answer to a fifty-year-old question.

It is interesting to note that there is an upper bound for the expression, and it had remained unchallenged since its discovery by Kazarinoff in 1956 and was confirmed by Chao-Ping Chen to be the best upper bound possible:

        [; \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{6} \cdot \,\cdots\, \cdot \frac{2n-1}{2n} &lt; \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi n + \pi/4}}. ;]

So, what book was I reading?  [Geometric Inequalities](http://www.amazon.com/Geometric-Inequalities-New-Mathematical-Library/dp/0883856042), by **Kazarinoff**.

* There's a proof that you can't do this

The third meaning is at least heavily implied anywhere this phrasing is used, the second is the ""natural"" meaning, but unfortunately the first meaning is very common. Is there some way to know, from context, when it's worth looking for a method to do something even when some text says ""we cannot""? Is there some way to be sure that it's really not possible?

But that embarassment aside, I was never taught how to take square roots in school and for my entire life, I had relegated it to the mysteries and the magic that is the ""sqrt"" button.  Finally overcome with shame, I opened a browser to go online and look up the answer, but  stopped myself and decided to figure it out instead.

The thing is that it took me 3-5 minutes to come up with an answer.  Isn't that funny?  I was apprehensive and even scared to solve something for the majority of my adult life; something that when I actually attempted it took me no more than 5 minutes.  There's a lesson in that...somewhere

Without further ado, how to solve squareroots (yes I know this is probably the dumbest way to do it and you all already know it; furthermore you mathematicians have come up with far more clever algorithms, but let me enjoy my victory for just a few minutes):

sqrt(x)

1. Factor out a known square root (4, 16, 256, 324, 10,000, etc), called F1 such that: sqrt(x) = sqrt(F1) * sqrt (x/F1)

2. Repeat process with sqrt (x/F1)  until satsified with precision (generally this needs to be done 3 or 4 times to get a minimal level of precision).

**warning, when doing long division by hand, it is best to carry it out to at least 3 or 4 decimal places

Perhaps an example would help, lets take the sqrt of 1354:

= sqrt (400) x sqrt (1354/400)

= sqrt (400) x sqrt (3.385)

= sqrt (400) x sqrt (3.24) x sqrt (3.385/3.24)

= sqrt (400) x sqrt (3.24) x sqrt (1.0448)

= sqrt (400) x sqrt (3.24) x sqrt (1.0404) x sqrt (1.0448/1.0404)

Well you get the idea, so I'm going to stop repeating step 2 and ignore the last term (obviously reducing the level of precision).  What you get is:

= 20 x 1.8 x 1.02 = 36.72

Using a calculator sqrt (1354) = 36.7967...

Not bad, clearly, had I kept going I would have come closer and closer to the calculator answer.

In conclusion: yes I know it is nothing earth shattering, and in a way I should be ashamed for not knowing this, but I just wanted to share my glory with everyone.  Heck there may even be a few of you out there who like me, never learned how to take square roots (unlikely), but here you go!!

Edit: corrected error pointed out by dp01 (hangs head in shame :)).  And replaced asterisks (*) with exes (x) to denote multiplication; reddit was using it as a trigger to italicize

1358661591.0,148,self.math,16x1up,"As a relatively novice mathematician, I found this quite amusing: The sum of the first N odd [natural] numbers is simply N squared.",pimp-bangin,238,90,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/16x1up/as_a_relatively_novice_mathematician_i_found_this/,"I'm imagining that many of you folks already know this; as mathematicians you likely find amusement in more complex relationships in number theory / discrete math. But as an engineering major (CS) in his second semester of undergrad, the fact that I came up with this discovery on my own made me feel all tingly inside.

So, for those who haven't already thought about this, here was my thought process:

Back when I was around 6 or 7, when I first learned multiplication, I was laying in bed one night and thought the following:

    1 X 1 = One.
    2 X 2 = Three more than one, which is four.
    3 X 3 = Five more than four, which is nine.
    4 X 4 = Seven more than nine, which is sixteen. 

_Wait, the amount we are adding to the last result increases by two each time! That's so cool!_ \*falls asleep*

Fast forward a good ten years. Last night, I was having trouble sleeping (4am), and I randomly recalled how cool that was. I start to think about it again like this:

    1^2 = 1
    2^2 = 1 + 3
    3^2 = 1 + 3 + 5

    n^2 = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 3) + (2n - 1) 
    n^2 = Σ [j = 1 to n] (2j - 1)

Then, I was in a restaurant the next day and continued thinking. Here was the best ""proof"" I could come up with (as an informal mathematician). Each summation (Σ) iterates from j = 1 to n.

    Σ(2j - 1)
        = 2Σj - Σ1
        = 2 (n(n+1)/2) - n
        = (n^2 + n) - n
        = n^2 

I also managed to show, in much the same fashion, that the sum of the first N even [natural] numbers is N^2 - N.

Fast forward to tonight; I am interested in others' thoughts on this matter. I find this neat article online, which includes a graphical representation:

http://www.9math.com/book/sum-first-n-odd-natural-numbers

So that is the story of my _relatively_ epic journey through extremely basic math.

After screwing around with the algorithm for a while, I decided to try jumping a quarter of the way towards the vertex instead of halfway. Some ugly images ensued. I tried some other ratios, 1/3rd 1/5th, 3/5th, etc. Tiring of the discordant results, I decided to try the good old standard of classic aesthetics, the golden mean. I was surprised at what I [found](http://i.imgur.com/gdxpM.jpg). This is probably a couple hundred thousand iterations, each one slightly shading the point it lands on a little lighter. The image took around 45 minutes to generate, and I regret not putting in an iteration counter to check how many jumps the finished result consists of, if you guys are really interested I can add it and run it again.

What I'd like to know is this: Is this already an established fractal? Can anyone tell me anything about its properties or why this worked in the first place? Can anyone help me find an easier (computationally less intensive) way of generating this image? A higher quality, less grainy image? You'll notice that the brightness fades as it approaches the vertices. The closer the point approaches to a vertex, the more times in a row it must have randomly chosen that same vertex. There must be a more consistent function for drawing this. Pardon my long-windedness, I'm just a little excited. Thanks in advanced!

I have always found math fascinating and profound.

Recently, I have been trying to rectify that loss by watching videos from sources like youtube.com/education and freevideolectures.com.  This led me to the goldmine of Khan Academy.  

Then today, I watched the Khan Academy videos on Benford's law.  Watching these, I got a feeling like the ground falling out from under me.  When Sal plotted the powers of 2 on a logarithmic scale, I actually felt a little dizzy, got chills up my spine and had to fight the urge to giggle.

I am a Mathematics professor at a liberal arts university looking to improve my lectures.  I think that I tend to do a fairly good job of explaining concepts, but one question that gives me some trouble is, ""Why do we need to learn this?"".  I have a few stock answers to the question, but not of them are very satisfying to me.  So, I decided to turn to Reddit.  I am teaching Calc II this semester, so I wanted to start with the question of why someone needs to learn integration techniques (such as integration by parts, partial fraction decomposition, and trig substitution).

I know several engineers and computer scientists, but few of them use much calculus in their day-to-day lives.  And if they ever did need to find an integral for some reason, Wolfram Alpha would probably satisfy their requirements.  

So Reddit, what are your thoughts?  Why would someone ever need to know how to integrate?  Do any of you ever find yourself needing to calculate an integral by hand?  Even if you don't, do you have a good answer to this?

**Additional Information**

The majors of my calc students are as follows:

* Around 1/3 are Chemistry or Biology majors.
* The rest are a mix of Pre-Engineering, Pre-Med, Computer Science, and Math majors.
* The Math majors are mostly going into secondary education.  There are a few that focus on actuarial science.  Very few are interested in grad school in math.

**My Standard Answers**
&gt; You will need it in your (Engineering/Chemistry/Whatever) classes.

This is probably true, but how often they need it later in their careers?

&gt; If you are a future teacher, you might need to teach this to someone some day.

Okay, but why will that someone need to know it?  What does the future teacher say when their student asks?

&gt; Even if computers can do this sort of work, it is important to know what the concepts actually mean, and how to apply them.

I agree with this, but you can have a complete understanding of what an integral is meant to calculate without knowing how to do partial fraction decomposition or trig-sub.

&gt; Passing a Calc class shows future employers that you are intelligent.

Probably true, but I it makes the material sound pretty worthless on its own merit.

It's rather fun in itself and I'm sure many of you will enjoy it. But alas this wouldn't be an /r/math post without something to ponder.

Right now the level generator guarantees levels will have a solution. If no such restriction existed, what is the probability of getting an unsolvable level? What is the probability of there being 2 solutions? 3 solutions? n solutions?

Many of you want more difficulty. I might do so if I think of a good mechanic to add. But in the mean time, I direct you to the other games I've made.

I like the elitism and the complexity on /r/math because it gives the forum credibility.

However, I'm good enough at math to know I'm not that good at math but I still have fun with it.  I wanted a place to discuss math ideas that have probably been solved many times in many different ways but are not understood by myself.  

Therefore I created a sub-reddit for casual math discussion as to not clog up the pristine nature of /r/math. It is aimed for those with a strong high school math or undergraduate math education.

It doesn't give any official certifications or college credits, yet hundreds of people all the way from high school students to professors gather during summer months to enjoy tinkering with mathematics there.

The village is run by a foundation that provides home for destitute children. As can be expected, they don't have the financial means to provide many scholarships for math lovers of poorer backgrounds, although they try to accomodate as many of them as they can each year.

Here's where you come in. 

Turkey's [Scientific and Technological Research Council](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/T%C3%BCbitak), which is supposed to sponsor exactly such efforts, is refusing to support the Math Village, because the head of the effort, Prof. [Ali Nesin](http://alinesin.org/), **criticized the council for backing anti-evolution theories**. Please join us with this protest petition demanding the end of discriminitaion against the Math Village:

I really hope the campaign can make a big splash.



**TL;DR**
World's only Math Village is denied support for political reasons. Sign the **[petition](http://www.tubitaki-protesto-ediyoruz.net/index_en.php)** and continue being awesome.

He started by explaining a random walk on the integers (positive and negative to infinity) starting at 0. So you have 50% chance to move right or left. The question is what is the probability of returning to 0 given an infinite amount of time to do so. The answer is that there is a probability of 1 to return to 0 at some point. Seems obvious.

Then he moved onto a 2 dimensional lattice. So you can go up, down, left, right with 1/4 probability. Again, the probability of returning to the origin is unity.

Analagous concept in 3 dimensions (i.e. 1/6 probability of moving in any direction). But here, as though by magic, the result is about 34% probability of returning.

It's even worse in my Linear Programming course.  My teacher will write things and I'll read our book, and I'll accept it but I don't really know what is going on or why it is that way.

It's making me feel like I've picked the wrong major, like I'm not smart enough to finish it.

So does anyone else feel like this and how do you get over it?  It's really eating me up inside at the moment (studying for midterms has made me realize how much I don't know).

I'm a senior in high school in Denmark (shout out to my friend Lauge, who I know uses this subreddit, if he by chance reads this!) and we're writing a big 15-20 page academic report (or something of the sort) this winter. We have to combine two different subjects and one of them, in my case, has to be math. The other can be pretty much whatever, as long as the two subjects can be tied together in some way. Physics would be one of the obvious choices, but I'd like to try something different, so I'm most likely going to choose English as my second subject.

This is where I'd like your help (if you're willing to give it to me):

I'm looking for short stories or novels where math is important for the plot in some way. Science Fiction would be great, since that is one of my favorite genres, but recommendations in other genres are of course appreciated just as much.

The math itself has to have some sort of substance on its own. It doesn't necessarily have to be overly complex (seen from a high schoolers point of view), but you should be able to write a good amount about it.

I figured I'd tell you where I am right now mathematically, to serve as a guide. We have done some relatively basic Calculus and some Linear Algebra, where we most recently covered planes and spheres in three dimensional space (angle between planes, distance from point to plane, all that jazz).

*The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time* has been both recommended and advised against, since it supposedly would be a good combo (I haven't read it), but it is the standard choice and very ""safe"" - I'd like something different.

If you have any ideas I would really appreciate it if you would comment below. Also, I'm sorry if this is not appropriate for this subreddit, I just figured that this is where I'd have the best luck. Upvotes are of course more than welcomed if you want to help this get noticed by more people.

Thank you so much for any ideas you have, I really am very grateful if you want to help me out. 

Edit: Of course you can't edit titles.. ""a bit OF* an unorthodox question""..

My school is, however, humanities/social science oriented, but it is filled with nerds who are passionate about what they're learning. So when it comes to meeting people in general, as well as with the intention of getting laid, people's discussions tend to revolve around what they're studying. Everyone has some sort of decent conception of pretty much every field, but math, and their conception of math tends to be high school-like math. I only get three reactions when I say I'm a math major: ""Oh I hated math"", ""I could never do math"", or ""Why?""--or a combination of the three. And let's say someone feigns interest in math (or perhaps I'm too jaded and someone actually is interested), I have to lay out a bunch of definitions, which probably make no sense to the person no matter how hard I try to simplify it (since people here tend to hate math enough that they don't really want to put effort towards thinking about it), and then explain the theorem whatever class I'm in is revolving around. And then they may say ""cool, what's the point of that?""...""Uh...to prove more theorems?""

For instance, if you want to be a good tennis player, you could just play a lot and you'll pick things up, but it's more efficient to set yourself tasks and make a conscious effort to drill and improve at the fringes of your ability.

So, what's the analogy for pure math?

I think the gut reaction from most people will be ""do proofs"".  But this is like ""go play tennis"".  What are we supposed to be focusing on when trying to do the proof?  Visualizing it or checking necessity of hypotheses to develop intuition?  Applying it to examples?  If I've learned and memorized a lot of group theory results, I probably don't gain much by going back and writing them out repeatedly from memory.  So there must be something more specific going on.

Also, just trying to prove theorems that appear as exercises isn't quite the same skill as research mathematics.  You might just be very good at taking nicely laid out definitions and theorems in a book and piecing them together.  This helps, but it misses something.  It doesn't directly train the ability to conjecture new, likely statements for example.  Or to get a good grasp on a horribly disorganized new field.

So, I think I'm asking two things:

1) **What exactly are the skills you need to be a successful research mathematician?** (I'm more interested in the non-administrative points here.)  I would guess we could eventually form a nice list of basics to advanced skills, analogous to how in, say, hockey, you need to practice skating, then stick handling, basic puck handling and passing, shooting &amp; positioning, then more complicated play formation, developing a sense of how the other team is moving, then more extravagant skills.  In math you need to have basic mental focus, reasoning and language skills, memory and intuition for some basic areas, etc... eventually somehow you're publishing papers (i.e. scoring on a give-and-go in the playoff finals).

2) **How do you train those skills in a focused way?**  In sports, coaches develop little practice drills to run: you dribble between cones, you pass and run, you shoot at the corners of the net, you practice drop shots, etc.  We have well defined tasks and clear reasons for them.  It's not as clear for me with math.


Note: I'm not asking for a shortcut to become an awesome mathematician.  I'm trying to figure out efficient ways to go practice hours a day for several years and become an awesome mathematician.  Both for myself, and for trying to help out other people.  It just doesn't seem clear to me what or how to practice the skills we need, though some of the basic ones are obvious, or some of the advanced ones are known skills but it's not clear how to practice them effectively.

**Edit**: Some people have asked what kind of math I'm interested in or what my background is.  To give some more context to see where I'm coming from: I'm already engaged in research, vaguely in a small subfield of geometry.  But trying to figure out how I got to this point, and how to help someone else get to this point leaves me a bit baffled.  A lot of hard work, for sure, that's a given.  But it seems like I picked up some non-clearly-defined skills along the way that sum up to an ability to do research currently.  I don't know targeted ways to train those skills, and I'm not totally sure what they all are.  I'd like to figure that out, because it will certainly benefit me and others.  So, I'm seeking to identify particular skills and generate ideas for ways to train them in order to more efficiently progress in mathematical ability.

**Important side note** The current top rated response is in direct opposition to the spirit of this question.   The relevant answers have been the ones providing ideas like trying to generate counterexamples to theorems with some hypotheses removed to try to train intuition for the role of different properties, etc.  IMO, these specific tasks you can assign yourself are better for doing focused training.",,False,,t5_2qh0n,1356215108.0,,,True,t3_154kpo,http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/154kpo/what_are_good_ways_to_practice_pure_research/,

1300376658.0,130,self.math,g5vsp,Bayesian Approaches to Uncertainty: The Case of Reddit Comments,wren5x,163,33,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/g5vsp/bayesian_approaches_to_uncertainty_the_case_of/,"Currently Reddit comments are sorted by ""best"" by default. What this means is that they are sorted in order by the lower-bound of the 95% confidence interval over the percent of votes that are upvotes (I will explain what that means in plain English in a moment). You can read details [here](http://blog.reddit.com/2009/10/reddits-new-comment-sorting-system.html). 

This is basically a way of dealing with uncertainty. If a comment only has 2 upvotes and 1 downvote, we don't really know much about how good it is (or, minimally, how well it will play to the Reddit audience). However, there is some probabilistic information there. If the comment is really bad and would eventually be downvoted by 99% of Redditors, then the current data are somewhat unlikely. They are much more likely under the assumption that 2/3rds of voting Redditors will upvote it. 

The current approach asks the question, ""What range are we 95% sure the real ratio lies in?"" and then assigns it the value at the very bottom of that range. This is based on the assumption that votes are independent and identically distributed -- which probably isn't true, but I would guess is close enough. 

What I want to point out is that there are actually a multitude of ways that this uncertainty could be dealt with. You can form a probability distribution over the percent of votes that are upvotes using a [beta distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution). So if you assume that all percentages are equally likely before we see the data, then you can just add 1 to the number of upvotes and that will be alpha, then add 1 to the number of downvotes and that will be beta. The probability density of the true percentage is then given by a Beta distribution with those parameters. 

If you go to Wolfram Alpha, you can play around with this. Start by typing in Beta Distribution (3,3). This corresponds to a comment with 2 upvotes and 2 downvotes. You see how it's a very wide distribution? This represents how little we know about the comment. (But you see how it still assigns very low probability to some percentages?) Now you can change it to Beta Distribution (101,101). Same ratio, but much more information. As such, there is less uncertainty and a very narrow distribution. Cool, huh? 

The bottom-bound of the 95% confidence interval is the current way to summarize this distribution. Basically, if you start at the left and work right until you've accumulated 2.5%, that is what the comment is assumed to have as its true percentage. One of my main points here is just that you could pick places on that distribution in many other ways. It has a mean, a median, a maximum (mode), an upper-bound on the 95% CI (confidence interval), a lower-bound on a 90% CI, on and on. It's impossible to find a theoretically best summary because anything will lose information in some way. 

You could even just *sample* from these distributions. That is, draw randomly from every comment's Beta distribution, then rank comments by those draws. This would mean that comments where we have a good amount of information are likely to get very stable draws, but comments with little information will fly around more. This would mean some people seeing bad comments at the top sometimes, but would decrease the bias towards newer comments (even further). It would also mean that two comments in a dead heat are going to be seen in both orders (comment A on top, and comment B on top) by about half of Reddit. This makes sense in a certain way; if we're not sure, then why not just hedge a little? 

The other big thing that we could do is use prior information. We know before a comment is submitted that it is unlikely to either be a rockstar nor an obvious troll. Note that I said *unlikely*, not that we know for sure. What a prior does is nudge the Beta distribution in a the direction that we think most comments will go. Critically, this nudge is fairly large when we have little information but vanishingly small once we have some built up. So it will just serve as a rough guide until we have more info. I want to be clear here; this is not an *early decision* on the comment. It's just using what we know based on our experience with most comments to make the best judgment we can when we know very little about the specific comment.  

I think a reasonable prior would be a Beta(3,3). This basically just says that most comments are likely to get about as many upvotes as downvotes, but a good spread still happens. The calculations are pretty easy. Now you just add 3 to the number of upvotes to get alpha and 3 to the downvotes to get beta. If a comment has 4 upvotes and 1 downvote, then the Beta over its percentage of upvotes is Beta(7,4). 

This is an interesting situation because there are a *huge* number of comments already in the database, so the prior could be specified very well. We could look through the database and estimate empirically where most comments end up. Then the prior could be adjusted to nudge comments that way.

Of course this isn't going to be perfect but there's just no helping that. Dealing with uncertainty necessarily means that we are going to get it wrong sometimes. 

So hopefully I've piqued your interest in this kind of approach. I thought r/math/ might enjoy thinking about these ideas. If you want to read more, I'll leave some links here. I'll try to answer questions in the comments.

1291672798.0,125,self.math,eh9f7,"Math undergraduates, doing this will improve your schooling experience tenfold.",acetv,174,49,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/eh9f7/math_undergraduates_doing_this_will_improve_your/,"Give talks/seminars on math that interests you.  No, I'm serious.

Over the past couple months I've been giving a lecture series on topology at my school, and I NEED to tell you how much I have enjoyed doing it.  Each week I learn the section I'm going to speak on and develop the notes for the lecture.  At the end of the week I give a short hour-long lecture on it to a small group of interested students who ask interesting questions and have a genuine passion for math.

I feel like, after taking so many math classes which made me rage about the presentation or the professor or the progression of the topics, I was finally able to think about and communicate math (especially any intuition) in a way that makes sense to me and to my friends who attend the lectures.  We don't care if lectures get sidetracked--in fact we revel in following tangents and exploring the boundaries of our understanding.  To me this is guerrilla math education.

Of course I'm not only talking about extended series of lectures, and I intend to start giving one-offs next semester.  It recently occurred to me the huge number of topics ripe for these types of talks, the requirements being that they're reasonably accessible to an undergraduate and necessitate a minimum of background or setup.  If you've ever studied anything outside of class, it would probably be a perfect topic for a lecture.

Some topic ideas I had recently, including some I haven't thought through so they may be rubbish:

* Infinite surds.  I definitely suggest working the problem out on your own if you haven't seen it before because it's pretty neat.  I think this would be a perfect first practice lecture.  Essentially, if we have a positive number *a*, we can take its square root: `[; \small \sqrt{a} ;]`.  Let's call this `[; \small a_1 ;]`.  Define `[; \small a_2 = \sqrt{a + \sqrt{a}}, \,\, a_3 = \sqrt{a + \sqrt{a + \sqrt{a}}}, ;]` and so on and so forth.  The question is, does (or when does) this sequence converge?  What if we use cube roots?  Fourth roots?  What if we let *a* be complex?  Bonus points for this last one if you make pretty graphs in mathematica/sage/matlab to show for what starting values in the complex plane the sequence will converge.  Actually I don't know if you'll get interesting pictures here, I've never tried it.

* Building off of the last one, you could do a talk on drawing fractals.  Newton's method, the Mandelbrot set, and Julia sets (and how they're related) are all pretty standard but it would probably be more interesting to talk about less popular fractals and the algorithms which generate them, along with any unique properties.  Bonus points for writing actual code to draw them (C, python, etc.)  Higher level lectures might talk about the dimension or connectedness of a fractal.

* Recurrence relations and generating functions.  There is an amazing free book on this called [generatingfunctionology](http://www.math.upenn.edu/~wilf/DownldGF.html) which I highly recommend.  The background required is just single variable calculus!  I plan to give a presentation or two on this eventually

* Continued fractions.  The books I've read on this topic tend to be a little terse and I've wanted to see if I could make the concepts a little more intuitive and the material a little more fluid.  A one-off talk on this topic might begin with their standard form, giving some examples, and move on to talk about other forms, and the representations of pi.  Talks might also focus on the more esoteric [Khinchin's constant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khinchin's_constant), or the application of continued fractions to [Pell's equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell's_equation).  Of course I have to recommend Khinchin's book on the subject; there's a Dover edition which sells for under $10.

* While we're at it, diophantine equations.  Not really my area of study but seems to be begging for this kind of talk.  I'd probably cover the history and discuss the classes of equations without going into too much detail.

* Graph theory.  Planarity, Euler's formula, colorings, there's just SO MUCH HERE that doesn't require much background.  Just draw some dots, draw some lines connecting them, and run with it.

* Orthogonal polynomials.  There's a lot of freedom here; pick a single class (e.g. the Laguerre polynomials) and dive deep.  Or, maybe talk about the 6 major classes and how they're related.  Yeah, interesting, huh?  There are essentially only 6 families of orthogonal polynomials originating from differential equations.  There are a bunch of interesting results on general orthogonal polynomials as well (the recurrence relation, interlacing of roots, etc. I feel like I would want to cover a proof of one of these.)

* I recently came across this paper by David Gleich called ""Finite calculus: a tutorial for solving nasty sums"", which can be downloaded [here](http://www.stanford.edu/~dgleich/publications.html).  I really, really, really want to do this one.  Handy methods for solving tricky sums?  I'm so down.

* I gave a talk not too long ago on Euler's proof of a special case of Fermat's Last Theorem (when the exponent is 3).  There is tons of information on this online, as well as a decent book unfortunately titled *Fermat's Last Theorem for Amateurs* by Paulo Ribenboim.  To me, following his arguments and exploring the background of the problem developed a connection to the past genius that inspired me in ways I can't really explain.  Very little physically remains of Euler but the immensity of the mark his ideas left on modern mathematics cannot be overstated.

* Set theory.  Cardinals and ordinals are always interesting.  The relationship between and importance of Zorn's lemma, the axiom of choice, and the well-ordering theorem would fill an entire talk.  The history of axiomatic approaches and their motivations would be another good one, and could lead into independence and incompleteness.  Timothy Chow's paper [A beginner's guide to forcing](http://www-math.mit.edu/~tchow/cv.html) might serve well as a basis for a more advanced lecture.

* Discrete convexity and optimality.  There has been a lot of work in discrete optimization in the past half century and there is so much interesting information out there.  A talk might bring up various problems and explain how the methods of the field can be applied.  Or, a more theoretical talk might focus more on the topological aspects and the mathematical foundations.  Sadly I just became interested in this stuff so I don't have any sources of information to recommend.  Perhaps someone could give some pointers in the comments?

* Got any puzzles you've solved?  Any competition problems you find interesting?  Talk about your approaches, any trouble you had, and epiphanies.  That kind of thing.

* Physics stuff.  Applied math stuff.  Simulations.  Simulations are an especially good topic because usually you can show pretty pictures and talk about the math in a hand-wavy manner, which will allow for a broader audience.

That's all I can think of for now.  Hell I'm not even sure what's good from that list, but you get the idea.  Pick something you think doesn't get good exposure in your classes and expand on it.  Show your classmates some math that they might not have seen otherwise.  If you have any other suggestions please post in the comments.

Remember that your main goal is to make the material accessible to your peers.  Don't just write a bunch of calculations on the board, don't just hand over the answer, and don't go into too much detail on the more mundane aspects of your topic.  Do give motivation, do talk about the background of the problem, and do your best to communicate all the intuition you can.  Even if they don't remember the content of the lecture when they walk out the door, the intuition will remain, and that's more important.

Probably the best thing about all this is that teaching something is, in my experience, one of the best ways to learn it.  You can't just read something and regurgitate it; you are forced to actually develop a deep understanding of the topic.  If someone asks a question, you want to be able to at least start an answer for them, and perhaps point them toward where they might find the solution.

Well, that was long.  Anyway, to close, I'll leave you with three things to keep in mind when speaking:

1. Be passionate.

2. Don't rush.

3. Don't talk to the board the entire time.",,False,,t5_2qh0n,True,,,True,t3_eh9f7,http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/eh9f7/math_undergraduates_doing_this_will_improve_your/,

And even as far as undergraduate degrees go, quantitative reasoning actually isn't applicable to all that much. Certainly critical thinking is needed in a lot of professions, but you can pick that up even through a humanities degree if you take it seriously. And the professions which do require quantitative reasoning almost all require specific training in engineering or computer science as well.

I would chalk it up to people subconsciously conflating engineering with science and math in their minds, but I hear this sort of thing from actual scientists as well.

1351715219.0,118,self.math,12f1wo,Doesn't anyone teach recreational math anymore?,Bryan_Wolf,170,52,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/12f1wo/doesnt_anyone_teach_recreational_math_anymore/,"The Doctor Who episode titled ""42"" introduced its viewers to the concept of Happy Numbers.  Briefly, you take a positive integer and separate and square each of its digits, then sum the squares to get a new number. Call this operation a Happy Sum.  Repeat the happy sum until you either reach 1 or reach the repeating sequence 4, 16, 37, 58, 89, 145, 42, 20, 4.  If a number reaches 1, it's a ""Happy Number.""  If it doesn't, it's not a happy number.

e.g. 129 becomes 1^2 + 2^2 + 9^2 = 86.
86 becomes 8^2 + 6^2 = 100.
100 becomes 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1.
So 129 is a happy number.

An open question is what percentage of all numbers are happy numbers.  Thus far, percentages have been calculated and published up to 10^122.  That's a phenomenally large number.  How was the number of happy numbers from 1 to 10^122 calculated?  By realizing that the order of the digits in a number doesn't matter. If 129 is a happy number, so it 192, 219, 291, 912, and 921.  Likewise, so is any variation that only inserts zeros, such as 1029, 90210, etc.  With 122 digits, there are only 23,640,810,986,000 unique selections of digits.  Each of these combinations was tested to determine if it's a happy number.  If so, the number of ways to arrange those digits into a number was added to the count of happy numbers with 122 digits.  Computing the number of happy numbers at N digits this way is O(Log(N)^9).

But, there is a much faster way to count happy numbers.  It relies on two realizations:

1) If 86 is a happy number, then every number whose happy sum is 86 is a happy number.  129 is a happy number it's happy sum 86 and 86 is a happy number.  Likewise, 911111, 555311, and 66321 are happy numbers, because their happy sums are all 86.

2) Appending a single digit to an number increases its happy sum by the square of that digit.

With these, we can now write a formula for the number of numbers with N digits which have a happy sum of X:

H(N,X) = 0 for X &lt; 0
H(N,X) = Sum for i = 0 to 9 of H(N-1,X-i^2)

We seed the count with H(0,0) = 1

In the first iteration we get
H(1,0) = 1
H(1,1) = 1
H(1,4) = 1
H(1,9) = 1
H(1,16) = 1
H(1,25) = 1
H(1,36) = 1
H(1,49) = 1
H(1,64) = 1
H(1,81) = 1
H(1,X) = 0 for all other values of X

For N digits, we only need to calculate H(N,X) up to X = 81N.  Each computation of H(N,X) takes only 10 operations - collecting and summing the 10 values for H(N-1,X-i^2).  With the counts known, the final operation is to add all the counts where X is a happy number.

With this approach, the number of operations to compute the number of 122-digit happy numbers is reduced from 23,640,810,986,000 to 6,077,430.  Generally, this approach counts the number of happy numbers at N digits in O(Log(N)^2), instead of O(Log(N)^9).

I have used this approach to calculate the number (and percentage) of happy numbers up to 6,900 digits (that's just where my PC ran out of memory).  I expect that others who have more time to work on this problem, and access to more computing power, will take this approach and extend the calculations much, much farther.

The interesting thing is that the percentage of happy numbers doesn't seem to converge.  It oscillates between the extremes of 11.38% and 18.58%. The rate of oscillation seems to decrease as the digits increase, but with an infinite number of digits to add, the percentage can oscillate ever more slowly without ever converging.

The data is too large to include in this post, but here are a few sample values.
