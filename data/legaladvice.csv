I've worked at this place for the past year and have always had my suspicions but they were confirmed when the ""principal"" typed up our ""accreditation"" on Microsoft word and I found out we are not accredited at all.

I remember seeing an AMA about a guy who used to work at ITT Tech, and I noticed a lot of similarities. This ""Private Home School"" offers people a ""REAL High School Diploma"" in just 2 weeks. 
All they have do to is pay $425 and take a test and that's it. 

The ""Principal"" is a lying, manipulative, horrible person. All she cares about is money. They take advantage of older people and Hispanics and tell them that this diploma will be accepted everywhere they go except private schools.

That is NOT true. Pretty much only community colleges accept it. Major Universities don't accept it, the army doesnt accept it, and employers don't accept it.

I have seen countless people come in, pay over $1,000 for classes and to get their diploma, only to come back in tears screaming because it wont get accepted anywhere.

There is a Texas Home School law that says that home schooled students are protected and this is the law that they use to operate. this is not a school. It is a business. A business that makes its money from preying on the uneducated and the elderly who are trying to get a diploma to get a higher paying job to support their families.

The"" curriculum"" is a complete JOKE. Everything is full of typos and it is all 8th grade level.

1356303580.0,100,self.legaladvice,15cftv,"Do not talk to the police, it will *never* help you.  ",critropolitan,116,16,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/15cftv/do_not_talk_to_the_police_it_will_never_help_you/,"People still seem to think that talking to the cops is a good idea in cases when they are or may be a suspect.  Some think that sometimes it makes sense to lie to the cops to protect someone.  Others think that they should tell the truth to the cops and sell out their associates in order to protect themselves.  

You should do neither.  Unless you were the one who called the cops, you should instead *refuse to talk to the cops* in all circumstances with the following exceptions:

1. If the cops demand you identify yourself you should do so.  

2. If you are asked any other question, you should say ""am I being detained or am I free to go?""  If the cops say you're under arrest, proceed to #3, if the cops either ignore your question or say 'no, you are free to go, I just want to talk to you' then say ""alright I'm leaving then"" and walk away.  

3. If you are under arrest you should tell them that you are are requesting a lawyer and will not answer any questions except on the advice of a lawyer.  

Do not say *anything else*.  

For example if a police officer asks ""do you know this person"", do not say ""yes"" or ""no"" say ""am I free to go""?  If so, walk away, if not, say you require assistance of counsel to proceed.  If a police officer asks ""are these your drugs or your friends drugs"" the answer is neither ""mine"" nor ""my friends"" it is ""I want to speak to a lawyer and exercise my right to remain silent.""

It is your right (in the United States) to remain silent and adverse inferences against you cannot be drawn by your silence.  

The police are not looking to exonerate you, they are looking to build a case against you.  If they already had enough evidence to arrest you and charge you with a crime, instead of questioning you, they'd just arrest you.  

If they have already arrested you, further questions are aimed only at giving them more evidence with which to obtain a conviction.  Never allow the police to interrogate/""interview"" you, always demand a lawyer and state that you are exercising your right to remain silent. 

If they make some kind of false promise that they'll go easy on you and make things go away if you tell them everything or name names, don't believe them, they are lying, which they are allowed to do.  If they tell you that once it goes to the scary prosecutor its out of their hands and they can't ""help you"" anymore they are lying - any legitimate deal is negotiated by your lawyer and the prosecutor it isn't offered to you by the cops.  It is the judge and the prosecutor who controls your case once you are arrested - the police don't and are in no position to offer any deal or protection or whatever.  

Moreover, if you demand to see a lawyer then police officers are ordinarily required to stop interrogating you and if they continue to do so you can have evidence obtained in such a way excluded at trial so it cannot be used against you.  Thus demanding to see a lawyer is a way of protecting yourself against the police obtaining additional evidence from answers you give them.

Don't give the cops evidence against an associate or potential co-defendant even if you want them to be convicted for un-selfish reasons.  The first and most obvious reason is that doing so often provides more evidence against yourself.  If blaming someone else is part of a strategy to either provide evidence against your guilt or to negotiate for a plea bargain, these tactics must be done through your lawyer, not through the cops.  If you tell the cops everything they need to know without having secured a negotiated plea bargain with the prosecutor via your own lawyer, then you will have nothing additional to give up in negotiations apart from your own guilty plea.

1370710352.0,90,self.legaladvice,1fxlij,"Guidelines for reading, posting and responding to questions in /r/legaladvice",thepatman,105,15,115,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1fxlij/guidelines_for_reading_posting_and_responding_to/,"All - 

/r/legaladvice has seen a large increase in readership in the last few months.  This is great, and we're happy to help you all.  However, there are some recurring issues that keep popping up, and we'd like to address them.

Below are a series of guidelines for reading, posting and responding in this subreddit.  These are not all-inclusive.  They are intended to help you all understand how best to interpret what goes on around here.  In many cases, these guidelines are expansions of topics already in the sidebar.  

If you have questions, feel free to contact the moderators.  

____________________________________________

GUIDELINES FOR READING /r/legaladvice:

1.  /r/legaladvice is here for simple questions and basic understanding about the law.  Your best bet is always to get a local attorney and give him or her the full set of facts in your case.  

2.  /r/legaladvice is primarily read by legal professionals from the USA.  As such, questions about other countries can be difficult to answer.  Do not take this personally; laws differ wildly when you cross borders, and none of us want to give bad advice.

3.  /r/legaladvice will tell you what the proper legal answer is.  You may not like that answer.  You may disagree with that answer.  Heck, **we** may not like or agree with the answer.  But it's the correct one for our legal system.  If you want to debate the law, there are other subreddits for that.

4.  /r/legaladvice is not your lawyer, and never will be.  We do not have a full command of the facts in your situation.  We will not appear for you in court, write you letters, or do hundreds of hours of legal research for free.  We're here to help clear up some of the mystery and confusion surrounding the law, and to help people better understand it.  

5.  /r/legaladvice is intended to help everyone.  Do not delete your posts or comments after you write them.  If you're concerned about being found out, use a throwaway.  The discussion in your post may help someone else.  Please leave it up.  

6.  Always remember, **you** are asking **us** for help.  We do this for free, out of our own personal time, and we owe you nothing.  We are happy to help, but if you become demanding or insulting, we have no problems ignoring or banning you.   

7.  Sometimes, legal advice is also life advice.  Don't take the answers here personally.  We are telling you what the law says, and what it will do in your case.  We will also give you advice on how to stay on the right side of the law, so you don't encounter the legal system in the first place.  We're not making judgment calls - we're telling you how it is.  

8.  We cannot tell you what **will** happen in your case.  At best, we can outline the best, worst, and average case scenarios.  No one can predict the future.  

GUIDELINES FOR ASKING QUESTIONS IN /r/legaladvice:

1.  Search the subreddit before posting your question.  Many questions get asked over and over and over again, and you'll save your time and ours by looking historically.  If the posts do not answer your question completely, then post away.  

2.  **Always include your location.**  Country, at a minimum.  If in the USA, definetly post your state, and consider posting your county or city.  If the activity occurred in multiple locations(i.e. you live in Colorado but were arrested in Arizona) post all the relevant locations.  If you do not feel comfortable posting your location, then this is not the appropriate forum for you.  If you post without posting your location, we reserve the right to answer your question as if you live in Saudi Arabia.   

3.  If asking about a criminal charge, post the exact charge and statute number.  Saying you got charged with ""having weed"" is useless; there are many possible charges there.  Saying you got charged with ""Possession of a controlled substance"" is better, but still not definitive.  Saying you got charged with violating ""720 ILCS 570"" is best.  Your ticket or charging documents should have this.  

4.  Be succinct.  A paragraph, maybe two, will suffice in almost all cases.  We can ask followup questions later if we need to.  Don't apologize for a ""wall of text"" - rather, don't post that wall in the first place.  

5.  Write properly.  We're not going to pick apart your grammar here, but we need to be able to read and understand what you are asking.  Use full sentences, paragraphs, whitespace and punctuation marks.  ""I'm posting from my phone!"" is a poor excuse for being unreadable.  

6.  If asked a question, reply to the person asking the question.  Don't post a new top-level comment to answer it.  It breaks the flow of conversation and is difficult to read.

GUIDELINES FOR RESPONDING TO QUESTIONS IN /r/legaladvice:

1.  Do not represent yourself as having more knowledge than you do, having experience you don't, or being something you're not.

2.  Avoid being absolute in your answers.  Rarely is the law black and white, and your answers shouldn't be either.

3.  Do not get defensive if other posters disagree with your answer.  Often, a different poster will have a different view on the subject.  It's not personal.

4.  If you disagree with another's answer, do so respectfully.  Don't make it personal.  Insulting other poster's careers or knowledge is discouraged. 


COMMON QUESTIONS AND COMMON ANSWERS(USA):

1.  ""Don't the police need a warrant to search my x?"": Not necessarily.  Police need probable cause, but that doesn't necessarily have to be in the form of a sworn warrant.

2.  ""Isn't this entrapment?"": No, it's not.  

3.  ""I'm being sued!  What do I do?"": Get a lawyer and respond to the suit.  Failure to respond will lead to a 'default judgment' - in other words, you automatically lose.

4.  ""I want to take my child away from my babydaddy/babymomma and not give them visitation ever!"": That is unlikely to happen.  Cutting a child's parent out of their life completely is very very rare.  

5.  ""The policeman was rude to me, can I get my ticket thrown out?"":  No, there is no law that says they have to be nice to you. 

6.  ""The policemen made a mistake on my ticket, can I get it thrown out?"": Probably not.  Clerical errors don't usually invalidate tickets; more, even if you were to win it, they can simply re-issue the ticket with the proper information.

7.  ""My friend told me this sure-fire way to get out of trouble, will it work?"": No.  Unless your friend is an attorney practicing in that field, then he likely has no idea what he's talking about.  There are no magic tricks in the law.

8.  ""I was arrested and the police didn't read me my Miranda rights!  I can get the arrest thrown out, right?"": Likely not.  Miranda warnings are only required if you are in custody **and** being interrogated(questioned).  In many cases, you are not being interrogated post-arrest, and the warnings are not required.

That's awesome, and I know contributors here are happy to help anyone we can. Welcome, new folks. It's nice to meet you.

I want to take this opportunity to direct your attention to the sidebar, as a reminder that this is the internet, and even more so, it's reddit. While some of us are attorneys, we are in no way a substitution for someone you meet with in person, in your jurisdiction. 

I've had over 100 PMs in the last few hours asking a series of questions that are similar. I'm going to answer a few of them here in the hopes of clearing it up for as many people as possible at once. I'll also include some general information about what to expect here.

**What's with the stars?**

Stars are given to people who have given consistently strong answers to questions over a period of time. A star doesn't necessarily mean someone is an attorney... just that they generally know what they're talking about and that they've proven it. I'll also note that there are specialties within the legal world. As an example, I'm in family law. I can't tell you a whole lot about criminal law, beyond the basics. We have people with experience in many areas, but we're all on at different times, so your patience is appreciated.

**I'm from X country, can you help me?**

Nearly everyone who contributes here is in the US. We have a couple people from Canada, and one very occasional poster from the UK. You may or may not receive assistance if you're outside the US. Sorry about that.

**What we will and won't answer**

We'll explain laws to you and point you in the right direction in most situations. We won't help you break the law, skirt the law or hurt someone else. 

We can't tell you whether or not you should plead guilty, other than general information like pleading guilty at your arraignment is probably a stupid thing to do. We can tell you how the law applies to your situation. There's a fine line between advice and direction. We try not to step over that line. 

**Be careful!**

Remember, the internet is publicly accessible, and there's no such thing as anonymity. You probably don't want to confess to anything here. 

**That girl was pregnant by her BROTHER?**

Yeah. Wait until you get to the one where the 20 year old claims he licked the vagina of an 8 year old because saliva has anti itch properties.

**General heads up**

We here at /r/legaladvice strive to remain as nonjudgmental as we can, though sometimes, as you can see in the best of legaladvice link in the sidebar, it gets too absurd to help being judgmental. Outright rudeness to people asking honest questions isn't ok. Racism, sexism and homophobia aren't tolerated here. Lastly, while a certain amount of commentary is ok, our purpose is to offer legal assistance, and if you have none to offer, please refrain. :)

1368889721.0,81,self.legaladvice,1ekukp,My girlfriend died and her parents are keeping my son in a different country from me indefinitely. I just need some guidance.,CoCork5,96,15,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1ekukp/my_girlfriend_died_and_her_parents_are_keeping_my/,"I know that young accounts aren't tolerated here, but my true account has some of my personal information attached to it. I'm not sure where to start, but here it goes... Sorry if it's so detached.

Last spring semester I met my girlfriend, we'll call her Megan. She was 20 and studying abroad in my country (Ireland) for the semester. I was 25 and she was my everything from the day we met. As corny as it sounds. I've never encountered another person as caring, ambitious, and intelligent as Megan. We were sexually active, and admittedly not as careful as we could have been. She found out that she was pregnant a few days after she returned home in June, and could only tell me over skype. I never got to hold her and tell her that everything was going to be okay. I was able to tell her that I would support whatever she wanted.

Money is and was very tight for me. I'm back in school and working part time, but I had some money saved up. I knew that I wanted her to keep our baby, but those were my morals and I didn't want to impose them on her. I told her that if she didn't want her parents to find out, I'd pay for her to get an abortion if she could find somebody to take care of her before and afterwards. It would have been 
impossible for me to go over to America to be with her during this time.

She told me that she wanted to keep our baby and I was pretty overjoyed... despite all of the speed bumps. I looked into transferring to an American college, or getting a work visa. When she told her parents I met them on skype and told me to finish school (I had one year left), and then they would help me move to America to be with Megan and our baby. They were actually very supportive initially; they are a very wealthy, prominent, yet Catholic family, and were pleased that their daughter chose to keep our child. It seemed perfect; It sucked I had to wait so long to be with them, but I knew that it would be worth it to finish my degree and be able to provide for my young family.

For the next few months I skyped my girlfriend everyday, and saved every penny so that I would be able to fly to America for the birth. But, of course, things never go as planned, and Megan went into premature labor this past January (the baby was due in Feb). It's hard to type this. She died giving birth to our son. I wasn't contacted by her parents, and know everything from her best friend, Luke.

Her parents blame me for the death of their daughter and have taken custody of my son. Luke said that they gave him their last name. They refuse to let me see my son, and threaten to have me arrested if I try and travel to come and see him. They want me out of their lives.

Some of you might be thinking that I have dodged a bullet with this crazy family. But I don't give a shit about them. My son is my blood, and one of the only family members I have left. He's my last reminder of Megan. I've told her parents that I would move to America, and that I won't take him from them. I just want to meet him and be at least in the same country of him. Of course, custody is my main desire, but these people have so much money.

I've talked to one lawyer, but he doesn't deal with international paternity, and I can't find one who does. He said that it is probably hopeless, unless they agree to a DNA test (they won't). Is this true?

My only ally is Luke, who has sent me pictures and videos of my son. He said that if I want to travel to the states I can stay with hi. He said that his brother is a lawyer and will be able to help me. I'm scared. All I want is my son.

* Yes, I plan to go to the doctor later today, and no, I will not be saying anything about this whole situation until I speak with the attorney my brother trusts on Thursday.
* No, I am not aborting unless there will be known health issues for either me or my child. Which is why I will eventually (soon) need to tell medical professionals about all this.
* The father is my brother, everything was consensual and we are both adults between the ages of 20 and 30.
* We live in Missouri and are not in a position to move elsewhere if at all possible. I would abort if needed to avoid moving.

My questions, I'll be asking on Thursday too, I just want to get a feel for how all this is going to pan out.

* Are doctors required or likely to say or do anything in these cases.
* My brother has better health insurance than me, is is likely that his insurance would cover all the additional testing me and him would require. If getting insurance companies involved in all this would cause problems we can pay in cash.
* is it likely that we would ever be able to live ""normally"" without needing to hide behind legal shenanigans.
* If SHTF, what will happen to me and him legally. I understand that ""committing incest"" is a class D felony, what does that mean? I have never dealt with the law or cops before, so this really scares me a lot.

edit: I have decided to abort for the legal reasons and the overall evidence supplied below that it is likely that the baby would be born with birth defects (even though I am only ~75% sure they are right, mostly due to the small sample size, among other things).

I took both the 2012 and 2010 printouts of the court cases to talk to the prosecutor and he dismissed my case pretty quickly.

One thing: he used google street view to confirm where the lane ends. I wasn't expecting that and only had a vague notion of landmarks and signs surrounding the area. We couldn't find it and he ended up giving me the benefit of the doubt and gave up looking for it.   

Because I'm anal, I came home and looked it up myself on Google Earth and found it almost instantly and it matched up to the block written on my ticket so I'm not sure why we couldn't find it there.  Me saying ""No wait, go back...no wait, go forward"" probably didn't help.  Anyway, just a heads up to anyone else fighting tickets - you may want to go in knowing exactly where it is on google street view. It killed me not being able to find it with the guy there trying to help me.

1375976605.0,59,self.legaladvice,1jym2a,I called the police out to my mother's home due to self destructive behavior and they willfully chose to leave her there. She's been found dead and I can't get a lawyer to listen to me. Can someone explain this?,throwawayformom12,74,15,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1jym2a/i_called_the_police_out_to_my_mothers_home_due_to/,"***New Jersey***

**Backstory:**
My mother (51, NJ) began speaking of moving out of state once my younger sister came time to graduate high school. After years of growing more and more religious, she secretly stopped paying her bills and maintaining her home under the ""direction"" of God and Jesus. She packed up all of her possessions in moving boxes and placed them in our garage. She then started to eat less and less frequently to the point that the house was empty. Due to us pointing out the progressively strange behavior, she cut off contact with my sister (19) and I (26) via email. We were the only people she had contact with at that time. 

We requested, due to the severity of the situation, the police come out to her house as her behavior seems obviously self destructive. Upon their arrival and inspection of the house (banging on all of the doors for 20 minutes and shining their lights in the windows), they stated that, due to the fact their were no flies on the windows or any other signs of suicide, that the house was probably empty. 

I explained to them that she was most assuredly in the home in her bedroom with her bible and not much else. I explained to them my mother would starve to death if we didn't get her some sort of help. I was very clear to not temper expectations due to the severity of the situation. I also provided them documentation showing her mortgage had been in arrears almost $40,000 due to her personal neglect. 

I asked them, since their analysis went from suicide to runaway, if we could hire a locksmith to open the door and have them clear the house so we could at least file a missing persons report. They agreed and we returned the next morning with a locksmith. The police came out once again and loudly knocked on the door. With no response, the locksmith gained access to my mothers house through the garage door (where the contents of her home are boxed up). The cops enter through her packed garage a home without electricity, food or hot water and find her in her bedroom, sleeping on her couch next to her bible. They come out and tell me that they've found her upstairs alive. I run upstairs and I see my mother emaciated and half conscious from malnutrition. She demands I get the fuck out. 

The police escort my sister and I downstairs and say ""There is obviously something wrong here but she doesn't want you in the house."" so we are escorted out of the home. They say to us that we should leave and they are going to make arrangements with her so we can check on her well-being while maintaining her wishes to not see us. According to the police report, they were only on the scene for about a half hour. No mental evaluation was performed at any point. 

I contacted the police to see what arrangements were made to check on her well-being and I am connected with an officer who was on the scene the first time. He tells me that her determination was to not speak with us and that as far as he was concerned the case was closed. I reiterate once again that she is going to starve to death in this house if we don't get her out of there and he confirms nothing further can be done. 

She was found dead in her home on the 23rd of July with a listed natural cause as ""failure to thrive"".

**My case:**

&gt;New Jersey Statutes 30:4-27.6. Custody.
&gt;A State or local law enforcement officer shall take custody of a person and take the person immediately and directly to a screening service if: 

&gt;a.     On the basis of personal observation, the law enforcement officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person is in need of involuntary commitment to treatment.

It seems like willful neglect for them to have left her in that home. There was no other recourse as far as getting her treatment for an obvious schizophrenic episode but I can't get a lawyer to speak with me, at least to explain why I'm wrong or why nothing can be done.

1349744828.0,57,self.legaladvice,11656q,"The NYPD attempted the search me, then beat me under the pretense of ""resisting arrest"" after I refused to consent to the search.",dontfriskmebro,70,13,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/11656q/the_nypd_attempted_the_search_me_then_beat_me/,"Hey there, reddit. I'm stuck in a bit of a pickle here.

On the night of Friday, October ~~6th~~ 5th*, 2012, I was approached by three police officers of the 62nd precinct of the NYPD. They asked if I had any drugs on me. I refused to consent to a search. One of the officers quickly replied with, ""oh well, we're here to frisk you for weapons"". Despite being aware of my rights when it comes to a stop-and-frisk, I again stated that I refused to consent to a search. Rather than explain my situation in a courteous, professional, and respectful manner, the officer proceeded to try and frisk me. I took a step back, with my hands still in the air, while saying ""what the hell, man, I didn't consent to this"" when I was promptly tackled to ground. The three officer took out their batons and started whacking at my arms and legs while shouting, ""STOP RESISTING, STOP RESISTING."" Prior to this, they made no mention of me being under arrest. During the whole fiasco, one of the officer pretended like I hit him. I lay completely motionless (aside from my cries of agony as my right arm and leg were beaten to a bruise) while the continued to beat me for a good 30 seconds.

One of the officers began to act like I had hurt him. When ""backup"" arrived and they asked if he needed paramedics he said that he just needs an ice pack. I never even laid a finger on any of them. As I was loaded into an unmarked police vehicle (which they tend to use for drug searches around my neighborhood, NOT stop-and-frisks), one of the officers told me that ""this is what I get for trying to be a smartass street lawyer."" I was found with a small bag of weed on me (which I would've gladly taken the ticket for). As I sat in the back of the car the officer whom I allegedly attempted to assault was putting on a scenario. To myself, I began say ""wow what a load of bullshit I can't believe this is actually happening,"" when the officer turned back around to me and started putting on a whole scene saying things like ""YOU PIECE OF SHIT YOURE GONNA ROT IN JAIL FOR TRYING TO A HIT AN OFFICER WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG YOU"" with a face redder than Rudolph's nose. The acting was impeccable, I could swear this man had Hollywood experience.

When I was taken to the precinct, my arresting officer tried to make me sign a police report stating that I began to violently flail my arms at the officer. As soon as I was handed the form, I began reading over it when the officer told me that it's just routine paperwork and that I don't need to read over, while trying to conceal the above mentioned statement. I duly refused. Later, when my mother came into the precinct, they tried to make her a sign a blank form containing only my name and address (which she also duly refused to sign).

So, now I'm scared shitless. These officers were making a bullshit charge on me for attempted assault on an officer (which is a felony). During my arrest, I had three of my friends on the scene approximately 3 feet away witnessing the whole thing. I was worried about a ""my word vs. theirs"" type of scenario. I had to spend the next 24 hours in central booking. I was looking at the possibility of the following charges:

* Marijuana Possession (citation in NYC)
* Obstruction of Justice (misdemeanor, this was the only thing written on my property voucher)
* Resisting Arrest (misdemeanor)
* Attempted Assault of a Police Officer (felony, this is a completely fabricated accusation)

I was relieved at my hearing where I was charged with a disorderly conduct (~~misdemeanor~~violation*) which will be expunged from my record after 6 months of no incidents. My understanding of this verdict is the following:

* Having refused to be searched, the marijuana found on me was illegally acquired evidence.
* Resisting Arrest wasn't brought up since it was never explicitly stated that I was under arrest (and there were eyewitnesses at the scene who could testify to this)
* Obstruction of Justice (I can't really rationalize this charge nor why it was dropped, can anyone shed some light on this)
* Attempted Assault of a Police Officer (the officers probably didn't go through with this since I refused the sign the police report and there were three eyewitnesses who would testify against it and the last thing these officers want to do is blatantly perjure themselves.

Having consulted with an attorney, I was told that the bruises and subsequent difficulty I now have walking is not sufficient for a lawsuit, seeing as they hadn't broken any bones or anything like that. However, shortly after the whole situation began, my glasses had fallen off my face and I couldn't see neither the police officers' names nor badge numbers. As I was carried away I had asked that one of the officer retrieved my glasses for me. They were never retrieved, and upon my release I came back to the place I was arrested and found the frames broken in two places and one of the lenses missing. I would really like to do something about this, however the only identifying information I have left is the first and last name of my arresting officer which was written on my property voucher which I memorized. I had (stupidly) given this voucher to retrieve my cell phone and keys before writing down the badge number of my arresting officer.

I wish to go the CCRB regarding my poor treatment by the officers, however I'm wondering about the following caveats:

 * Can I walk into the precinct and ask for the badge number of my arresting officer by name? Also, do I have the right to ask for the names and badge numbers of the other officers present during the arrest (I don't know their names nor badge numbers). As I mentioned, this was during the nighttime and I had no glasses.
 * Can I do any of this without fear of retribution of some sort? This particular precinct is, evidently, quite corrupt.
 * If I go to the CCRB and explain my situation (and mention the marijuana which I was not charged for) is there a chance that it would be added to my record, thereby breaking the ""6 months good behavior"" (as it is a new charge after the 6 months began).
 * Is there any other way I could be compensated for my injuries and emotional trauma? I really don't have the money to gamble on a lawsuit.

I should probably also mention, that I am 17 years old and have had no previous criminal record of any kind.

He was raised by his grandparents until he was 9 and he doesn't even know his mothers first name. There is no one living who was at the birth, in fact he has no living relatives at all. He grew up on the family farm and whenever he worked off of the farm it was for cash. He's never had a bank account, or a drivers license. He was home-schooled by tutors who were ever changing and therefore he never bothered to remember their full names.

He has tried in the past to get an ID however hit quite a few impasses including being told he had to name the doctors at his birth (there were none). His grandmother and a midwife were the witnesses however both are long since dead. 

We are also currently living in Washington and he hasn't been back to Kentucky for at least 5 years. Kentucky Common Wealth law used to have a stipulation where you could bring in two credible witnesses who would attest to the fact that you are who you say you are and then you could get a delayed birth certificate. But of the two people that have known him for a long enough period of time one also doesn't exist and the other is a multiple felon. So that kind of bars both of them from being ""credible"" people. However he is pretty sure that stipulation doesn't exist any more anyway.

* I am an active duty Marine, and I live 7 hours away right now.
* I'm 23, mother is 22, daughter is 4.

For example, last night a 20-year-old posted that he got an MIP. A user proceeded to give him the advice that if the bottle is closed the state has no case. The user then ""advised"" that OP should contest the charge because a police officer's word against his shouldn't be enough. This person is clearly not even trying to research or give advice from personal legal experience. It makes this sub degrade in value when people get layman, speculative explanations. They may as well just ask their buddies for advice. 



EDIT (MY SOLUTION): My main suggestion is flagging and removing (seriously, r/history is a great example).

That's awesome, and I know contributors here are happy to help anyone we can. Welcome, new folks. It's nice to meet you. Please bear with us, because on weekends, we tend to drink and sleep, doing most of the question answering while we're pretending to work.

I want to take this opportunity to direct your attention to the sidebar, as a reminder that this is the internet, and even more so, it's reddit. While some of us are attorneys, we are in no way a substitution for someone you meet with in person, in your jurisdiction. 

I've had numerous PMs in the last few hours asking a series of questions that are similar. I'm going to answer a few of them here in the hopes of clearing it up for as many people as possible at once. I'll also include some general information about what to expect here.

**What's with the stars?**

Stars are given to people who have given consistently strong answers to questions over a period of time. A star doesn't necessarily mean someone is an attorney... just that they generally know what they're talking about and that they've proven it. I'll also note that there are specialties within the legal world. As an example, I'm in family law. I can't tell you a whole lot about criminal law, beyond the basics. We have people with experience in many areas, but we're all on at different times, so your patience is appreciated.

**I'm from X country, can you help me?**

Nearly everyone who contributes here is in the US. We have a couple people from Canada, and one very occasional poster from the UK. You may or may not receive assistance if you're outside the US. Sorry about that.

**What we will and won't answer**

We'll explain laws to you and point you in the right direction in most situations. We won't help you break the law, skirt the law or hurt someone else. 

We can't tell you whether or not you should plead guilty, other than general information like pleading guilty at your arraignment is probably a stupid thing to do. We can tell you how the law applies to your situation. There's a fine line between advice and direction. We try not to step over that line. 

**Be careful!**

Remember, the internet is publicly accessible, and there's no such thing as anonymity. You probably don't want to confess to anything here. 

**That girl was pregnant by her BROTHER?**

Yeah. Wait until you get to the one where the 20 year old claims he licked the vagina of an 8 year old because saliva has anti itch properties.

**General heads up**

We here at /r/legaladvice strive to remain as nonjudgmental as we can, though sometimes, as you can see in the best of legaladvice link in the sidebar, it gets too absurd to help being judgmental. Outright rudeness to people asking honest questions isn't ok. Racism, sexism and homophobia aren't tolerated here. Lastly, while a certain amount of commentary is ok, our purpose is to offer legal assistance, and if you have none to offer, please refrain. :)

I live in a generally commercial area, between a U-haul place, a 7-11, a dry cleaners, and then a small (6 unit) apartment complex. 

When I moved in, one group of neighbors in the apartment complex, in the unit that directly faces/looks into my house, began making trouble for us. My house had been sitting empty for a while, and he'd been parking his car in front of it so that he could see it from his apartment window (I'm guessing that's why, anyway--it wasn't closer to his door than the apartment complex lot would be). The day I moved in, he came out to his car in ""his"" parking spot and screamed profanity at us (I guess because he was angry that someone was living there?) which made me and my other roommates very uncomfortable. That night, he spent his time peering into our windows and taking photographs of us from his apartment window. He also spent about 6 hours just standing at his window, staring into our house. 

The next day, I talked to my landlords, a bunch of shit went down including death threats, and he was forced to move his car since it was on private property. He specifically told us that ""he would call the cops on us every night until we are evicted or arrested."" True to his word, the police have come to my house twice in the past two nights, for 1) someone quietly talking on the phone outside and 2) I had to jump my car last night and the ""engine was too loud"". 

Now, we haven't been cited, and explained the situation to the police, but I didn't sleep last night and I'm really getting scared. I bought a security camera last night, but I'm really sick of all of this. I love my house, it's really big and nice for a really cheap price, but I feel harassed and threatened and I don't feel like I have any real options to make it stop...

What can I do?

We've talked about some of these cases here in the past, and if people are interested, we can talk about them now. The landmark cases in question are: 

US v. Windsor: DOMA. 

Hollingsworth v. Perry: Prop 8 in California, a same sex marriage case.

Shelby County v. Holder: Voting Rights Act

Fisher v. University of Texas: Affirmative action specifically as it applies to college admissions but with far, far broader reaching implications. 

Of particular note to me is a family law case, Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl. I've followed this case quite closely since it was in the state courts. It involves tribal law and adoption outside of a tribe. It's a heartbreaking case.

The insurance was able to get a hold of them.

Her justification - that she texted me a day later with no response from me and didn't even bother communicating with me even after two weeks after the incident. So her phone suddenly starts working once the insurance calls her. After a conference between the insurance, her, and I she agreed to pay the money. However after the call, she calls me up and asks if I can be nice and reduce the amount and get the money in two different payments. I said Hell No!

I was in the right lane on the freeway when my lane ended and I merged to the left.

A cop pulled me over and cited me for failing to signal. I told him since I was merging, I wasn't aware I needed to signal. His jaw dropped like I had said something idiotic and he then gave me $200 ticket which I embarrassingly thanked him for.

I looked up the nuances of merging and signaling and found a TX Court case called Mahaffey v State in which a court ruled that you do not need to signal a lane change when your lane ends.

So should I fight this? I just started going back to school and I'm struggling to pay my school bills and do my school work while holding down a full time job.

I wrote the following comment:

&gt;I just downloaded this, and I am editing it to within an inch of it's life.

A couple of hours later I received the following message:

&gt;Without Prejudice 
&gt;
&gt;I noticed your comment on one of my watermarked images. You admitted downloading and editing the image. I have a screen grab of that comment. 
&gt;
&gt;Copyright law is simple. You have admitted to breaking the law. Please confirm that you have deleted any downloaded copies of that image and any versions of it. 
&gt;
&gt;Please also remove that comment and refrain from commenting on any of my photographs, my page, my blog or any other aspect of my business. 
&gt;
&gt;Attend to this matter now or I will respond in the strongest possible terms.

I replied as follows:

&gt;Oh my goodness! You made me laugh so hard just now! It was a JOKE! Obviously!!!! This is the Internet. You can't seriously expect people to obey an instruction like that can you? Seriously man I wish you no disrespect and I'm genuinely sorry that I wasted your time but the fact that you couldn't tell that I was being sarcastic really worries me. There was a very big story recently about a photo of the singer Beyonce during a performance at the Superbowl that looked a little unflattering. Beyonce's people issued instructions to sites hosting the image to take it down immediately. This had the reverse effect and the photo went viral. If you put a photo online and do not put a ridiculous comment like ""Don't download this"" then nothing will happen. But by sticking this antiquated message on there it's like red rag to a bull. The Internet is full of idiots. Your photograph is beautiful, and you are very talented, that's obvious. But you don't even realise that the mere fact of viewing a picture online means that it's been ""downloaded"". Your message is the equivalent of saying, ""Warning, don't read this"".

I thought the matter would be closed once I pointed out that I had been joking but he didn't let it go. He sent me the following:

&gt;Copyright law stands online as in any other situation. I have significant evidence to suggest that you have overstepped the mark, including your most recent comment. 
&gt;
&gt;please feel free to research this. 
&gt;
&gt;i will prosecute you if you do not follow my previous request. 
&gt;
&gt;this is my business, and I will protect it. 
&gt;
&gt;you are a very stupid person if you even think that copyright law is something in the same ball park as 'do not read this' 
&gt;
&gt;please be warned that I will seek the fair commercial rate for your breach of copyright. 
&gt;
&gt;Let me tell you that under all western world copyright law that the copyright for any photo belongs to the person who took the picture.
&gt;
&gt;Comments on my pictures like you have made opens the way for other people to do the same. 
&gt;
&gt;this only ruins it for the people in the pictures who pay me to take them. It belittles their exclusivity, and the fact that they want to show off one of the best days of their life. 
&gt;
&gt;do not even think that I will understand where you are coming from on this one.

After I read those messages I decided that the best thing to do was stop talking to him. I thought that arguing wouldn't help, and so I just wrote:

&gt;Thanks for the info.

He responded with:

&gt;I'm sorry, you do not seem to understand what I requested from you. Read all again. I will take you to court.

I said:

&gt;Yeah, I got it.

He said:

&gt;Good!

I would love to hear your opinion of this. Am I actually at risk of being prosecuted here if I don't remove the comment? Can't he just delete the comment himself since it's on his wall anyway? What is the legal standpoint on ""downloading"" an image? Isn't it only a breach of copyright if I actually do something with the photo? Simply looking at it doesn't break any laws does it? Even if I *did* download it and edit it to within an inch of its life, what law am I breaking? 

I want to answer this man, but don't feel clued up enough to do so. Should I just leave it? Should I be the bigger person and let it go? Am I being silly here? Should I just say, ""I'm really very sorry, I assure you I haven't downloaded or edited it"" and remove my comment""

Management says there's no way one of their employees are involved &amp; wants to charge us to replace the locks. Not sure what to do.,hiddencamwtf,43,7,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1k91eh/ca_found_a_hidden_cam_in_my_apartments_bathroom/,"I live in an apartment with my gf &amp; room mate.  It's a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment in a relatively large building.

About 4 or 5 months ago my GF and I had noticed that a power strip and 2 AC adapters had suddenly showed up in our room.  We thought it was odd, but the cable box that controls basically all of the cable in our apartment is in our room, so it didn't seem like something that couldn't happen.  None of us had let anyone in or given consent to enter the apartment, but we didn't really think much of it.  We threw away the AC adapters, and left the power strip (having an extra one around the house can be useful).

Fast forward a few months, and we were all going out of town for an event.  My girlfriend and I drove out there, and my room mate flew.  When we got back we noticed a new wall power outlet had been installed in the bathroom shared by my gf and I.  We didn't really think much of it, other than that it was a bit odd that they installed a power socket so close to the shower.... whatever.

Fast forward to a few days ago and my gf tries to plug something into this socket and discovers that it is a fake wall socket.   We popped off the fake top and found a hidden recording device underneath with ""HD"" (720) recordings.  The device records to an SD card, which means the perpetrator clearly had to have some kind of access to our apartment.  Obviously this brings up huge concerns.

We immediately called the cops, who told us to wait for detectives to contact our apartment complex, and took the device and power strip away in evidence bags.

After leaving a message for the apartment complex the detective called me and said we were OK to contact management request new locks ""but that obviously we shouldn't pay for anything"".  So I went down there to ask for new locks.  The manager on duty basically just told me ""there's no way this is our responsibility as we have an electronic key check out system,"" and that we would have to pay $50 to have the locks replaced.  Obviously I'm pretty livid at her response.  I've called her regional manager, and left a message.

Anyways, enough of the back story, onto the legal questions.

1. Is this grounds to break our lease?  We don't feel safe in the apartment, and we want to move out as soon as possible.  Our current lease doesn't end for over 4 months.
2. Is there any recourse against the inaction of our apartment complex?  It seems ridiculous that they would try to charge us to replace the locks considering the situation.
3. Is there anything else I should/should not do or anything I should know in this situation?

The er doctor seemed very taken aback by this and said I should really look into it.

So, is there anything I can do? I find out tomorrow about surgery and stuff. Would there be any personal injury case or anything here to cover my medical costs?

We verbally agreed on a (quite reasonable by US standards) compensation, but did not sign a contract which should have listed the amount of compensation, that I relinquish child custody and other important points. Since egg donation is illegal in the UAE, the fertility clinic began the treatment in Dubai and for the extraction we flew to Lebanon. They also did not administer psychological tests and other common procedures (the doctor is also licensed and has a clinic in the US). 

During the procedure the recipients treated me as if they are doing me a huge favor. We had to stop half-way through because the wife miscalculated her cycle and they were going on an extended holiday while I went through a ""menopause"" for a month (hot flashes, nausea, headaches around the clock). They did not ask once about my wellbeing, then bullied me to continue through the treatment. I had to argue with them to get a separate hotel room in Lebanon, because they insisted we share a room while I recovered from the surgery and to get a plane ticket leaving a day after them (they went earlier to explore the city) so I would not have to take more time off work than was necessary. At this point the husband said that I was beginning to cost them a fortune. Then in Lebanon he yelled at me for eating a Kitkat from the hotel bar (I was fasting for anesthesia since the night before and felt famished after the surgery). A huge amount of eggs was extracted (over 40) leaving me with a severe case of OHSS. Never did the couple say so much as a ""thank you"".  

They are now 5mo pregnant with twins and are ignoring my requests to pay the compensation. My questions are such: can I sue the couple for the compensation despite that the agreement was only verbal? Obviously, this is a sensitive subject in the UAE so I would prefer to proceed in the US, would this be possible? I tried to seek legal advice in Dubai but so far could not find a lawyer willing to assist. And lastly, since there is no contract, can the couple request that I pay child support and alternatively, can I legally claim child custody?

We pulled down the driveway where the bus originally picked us up and found them sitting around.

What can I do?,ShitTickets,48,8,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1ii5qd/my_employees_dismantled_my_business_and_opened_a/,"I own a tattoo shop. I had the body piercer renting space from me, and I had a tattoo artist paying me commission. The rent situation was not working and the piercer never purchased the piercing business from me (though he claims he did, I found our contract and he only bought equipment)...so I left him a document outlining my proposals for re-structuring our arrangement and went on vacation. Which, I may add, I desperately needed.

I had a weird feeling in my gut, and I included in my letter that none of this was to be discussed with anyone, and specfically named the other employees. I also took my personal equipment to my boyfriend's house.

Anyway, I was camping in Montana, waaay out of cell phone range. I let everyone know that I would be out of reach for most of my vacation. On my way home, my phone came back on and I had weird messages from my landlord about everyone having packed up and left, so I called EVERYONE. 

The story, according to the piercer, was that he desperately tried to get ahold of me (I had no texts or voicemails from him) because he didn't like my proposals and feared losing his job...so he showed the letter to my whole staff, told them they were all going to lose their jobs because I didn't pay the rent on the building (not true, I left them a check for the landlord) and walked off with my business. They unplugged all my neons and told everybody I was closed. My boyfriend went down to their new place to say ""WTF"" and they told him that I'd be beaten up if I went over there.

There's no way this was not premeditated, you can't just open a new business in a week.

About $1500 worth of furniture and equipment were stolen, as well as stupid things like all my office supplies.

They also did not return the key to the shop's mailbox.

I filed an informational report with the police but I haven't actually gone through and pressed charges. I am devastated and won't be able to keep operating for long--I lost two week's worth of income during the peak season after they shut the place down, which adds up to about $15,000 in credit card sales alone if you check last year's numbers.

This is the time of year I recover from the winter slow season and I'm not going to make it trying to run this place alone, and I have no money to pay anyone.

I can't afford to hire a lawyer. But this is a shady person we're talking about--I'm almost positive that the name he gave me wasn't real. (We have a lot of fugitives in this industry, you just don't ask too many questions.) And I know he can't open a bank account or deal with the IRS in any way, I'm hoping that bringing the law into this damages him as much as it damaged me.

1359563548.0,39,self.legaladvice,17kfzm,Police kicked in my door thinking that I am a drug dealer.,Ziaki,44,5,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/17kfzm/police_kicked_in_my_door_thinking_that_i_am_a/,"Yesterday evening my boyfriend and I were getting ready to go visit a friend when we heard a loud bang at the door. We were confused and thought we were about to get robbed. Then the door crashes open and a bunch of cops ran in with their guns pointed at us screaming at us to get on the ground. We did what they said and cuffed us. They took my bf outside and they sat me down in the kitchen.

They started asking me where the drugs were and I had no idea what they were talking about so I told them about the little bit of pot I had in my spare room but thats not what they were after. They kept saying that they know I have been dealing drugs and that if I lie to them they were going to tear my house apart and kept telling meni was going to jail. When i kept telling them that i didnt have any more drugs the one called me a liar and refused to talk to me. Maybe I should have prefaced this with the fact that I am not a drug dealer and besides the little bit of pot there were in fact no drugs in my house. 

They kept looking in my freezer and like three different cops asked me why I had frozen rats in there to which I pointed out the giant fucking aquarium directly behind them with the giant fucking snake in it. They took pictures of the inside of my freezer including my snake food and some frozen meat.

While they were searching I asked if the handcuffs were necessary.  I was crying and I was really uncomfortable. They said yes and that I was under arrest at which point I wanted to remind them that they hadnt read me my rights or shown me a warrant but I was scared shitless and was afraid of antagonizing them.

Im not really sure how long they were here but it didnt feel like they looked very hard. Mostly they dug through our desk drawers and kept looking in the fridge and freezer. Apparently they were looking for shrooms i finally found out when I saw the warrant.

Finally they finished. Of course they didnt find anything except the pot that I was completely honest with them about.  Then they gave me the warrant and the report and told me to expect something in the mail and left. On their way out I heard the one that had been questioning me say ""probably nothing is going to happen"" but I wasnt sure if he was talking to me or one of the other officers. The same one told my boyfriend that they were going to come back with another warrant but I think he might have just been trying to scare him because he had called the cop a liar when they tried to tell him I was a drug dealer. 

Some of them left in a green van and we put two and two together. The trailer next to ours had been empty for months but that green van was almost always parked there. Apparently they had been watching our street for months. We had seen cops on our street before at other peoples houses but we live in a trailer park so we never thought anything of it.

I just cannot fathom how they could have thought I was dealing drugs. I work a full time job and a part time job. I come and go from my house to go to work and sometimes run some errands. In the little bit of free time I have I sit at home watching tv with my bf. We never have people over. Most of our friends are married and have kids and we dont see them much.  

So anyways now my front door is busted and the only clue I have as to what isngoing to happen next is ""expect something in the mail"" and maybe they will come kick down my door again with another warrant. I am just so fucking freaked out. I have no idea how they could have thought I was a drug dealer and its driving me crazy. Im so scared that I cant sleep or eat. I dont even feel safe in my own home right now.

I have already told my dad and told him that I might need a lawyer.

I guess my question is what should I expect?

 And do I have any legal means of finding out how the fuck they could have possibly thought I was a drug dealer?

And what could happen if they decide to do anything about the pot considering its my first offense and have an otherwise clear record ?

UPDATE
Looking at my warrant it says on the warrant that there should be a signed affidavit attatched which there is not. Maybe that is what they intend on sending us in the mail?

There are 4 felonies myself and my room-mate have been charged with. I requested and have been appointed an attorney by the court this morning at my first appearance. The charges are PWIMSD a schedule VI (marijuana), PWIMSD a schedule IV (mushrooms), manufacturing a schedule VI (marijuana), and maintaining a dwelling. I did not speak to the police when arrested and expressed that I would like an attorney present.

Essentially, what I am posting for is to simply gauge what the best-case scenario could be as well as the worst case scenario. At my first appearance this morning the judge simply asked, ""You do realize these are serious felony charges and you may be facing years of prison, right?"". I replied, ""Yes."". So, like I said, I'm just curious what the best and worst outcome could be.

I have no prior record, have a good job, and am a 24 year old white male. There was SUBSTANTIAL evidence found in our home (which both of us are renting) and I'm a co-defendant with my room-mate.

I have been advised by a friend that it may be best to request we be tried separately since he has a record, no real character witnesses, can't trace his money, has a sketchy job, and was in a vehicular accident with growing equipment in the vehicle which led to the search warrant for our home. Is it wise to make this type of request? Would it help me or hurt me in any way?

Any input on this from anyone in any way shape or form would be greatly appreciated. I am fully prepared to spend years in prison, unfortunately, but I'd just like to hear what others (hopefully those with legal knowledge and experience) have to say. Thank you all so much.

 He has been ignoring us completely until Thursday. My son accidentally knocked a watering can into his backyard. I tried to get it back by knocking on his door but he didn't answer. The next day the watering can was back on our deck, the spout had been cut off and the pail had been stabbed with a knife several times. I called the cops, they filed a complaint. 

Saturday night he got drunk, started yelling at someone over at his house, then started yelling at me. Calling me a bitch, calling my husband an army piss ass, saying that I ""know what I did"". I called the cops, they talked to him, he went back into his house. The cops filed a complaint.

Sunday night similar thing. He got drunk, he went outside and started yelling at me, calling me a bitch, saying my son defaced public property with his chalk, saying ""I know what I did"", egging me on to come outside, hitting his own car. I called 911, 6 cop cars came and after 20 minutes of him yelling and arguing they took him in for drunk and disorderly. 

I'm now very, very scared. I am at home all day by myself with my very young son. My neighbor works from home so he's also home all day. I've contacted my HOA to see if they'll clear my name or provide legal counsel (since I'm a volunteer). We live in a town home so I literally share a wall with this person. 

On the advice of the deputies who came last night, I'm filing for a protective order today.  But I'm asking myself, will this really make me feel better? Is there any other legal course of action I can take?

 I want to move to just get out of the situation, but again, I'm 7 months pregnant and my pregnancy has been complicated (I've literally been sick this whole time, I see 3 doctors just for my pregnancy), and I don't know if I can move before the baby comes (I have to deliver a month early due to complications). Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: my neighbor thinks I turned him in to HOA, causing him to verbally abuse me on several occasions. Cops have been called several times. Can I do anything besides get a protective order? Oh and I'm 7 months into a complicated pregnancy.

*UPDATE* thanks for everyone's help with this. I was granted an emergency protective order today. This lasts for 72 hours. Tomorrow I'm going to my district court to file a petition for a preliminary protective order. This lasts for 15 days, and there's a hearing where my neighbor will not be present. After that there's another hearing (where my neighbor will be present) and if I win (don't know if this is the right word) I will get a two year protective order. 

*more questions*  I don't have a lawyer, should I seek one? If so, how does someone even find a lawyer (I don't want to use those TV lawyers with the jingles)?

The night of my Arrest.................... I spent 10 hours in long  beach far from my home.  I can document when I arrived, left, stopped for food and to reroute a way home.  I passed tons of CHP because of work and freeway detours.  The cop who stopped me said I was doing 80mph on Beach Blvd and swerving.  Google Maps put me 1 minute ahead of the eta from Del Taco to where I was stopped.  That makes 80mph hard to believe, and no ticket for 80 in a 45 zone.  One of my passengers earlier in the evening dropped a marijuana pipe under the front seat.  The cop showed me a piece of Marijuana about the size of a certs.  OK so its in my car, I figured I would get a ticket but when I was arrested it led me to think this is because of Alcohol.  Ive maintained all along I was not drunk but as you can see I was beginning to think I was drunk and like every drunk driver thought I was ok to drive.  I'm not worried about the drug test showing illegal drugs but the day before I took 1/2 Vicodin.  Looking at the information provided on the internet the cop is going to testify he believed I was impaired, he stopped me and claims he smelled weed, I failed the Field Sobriety test in 4 inch heels (walking and dancing 10 hours in those shoes).

The arresting officer is a Drug Recognition Expert and he must maintain a log that shows what drug he suspected and if that was supported by a chemical test.  In order to become a DRE a student needs [75% lab conformation rate](http://www.ci.la.ca.us/lapd/traffic/dre/drgdrvr.htm).  See footnote 43.  This makes me somewhat nervous the cop might alter his report to fit the results of my chemical test.  He must have suspected Marijuana how could he suspect a Vicodin if I did not even admit or know they counted that as drugs?

I send my faulty set in, then I receive a replacement set 2 weeks later, totally damaged, parts missing, etc. Looked like they were used and the retailer just threw some random broken speakers in a box and sent them to me as a ""replacement"". 

I call the retailer and tell them I am not happy. He blames it on Fedex, that they ""dropped them"". I really doubt this.

Divorce and child custody case.,throwitawayforlegal,39,3,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1ck26b/my_lawyer_basically_just_gave_me_an_ultimatum/,"In July 2012 in my state (NV) I retained my lawyer and my case was filed.

My lawyer has his own practice and I originally assumed I would be represented only by him. In the first meeting he introduced a younger man as his associate and requested that I copy the associate in anything I sent to him. My case was very complicated and so many things were happening. Every call I made or email I sent would only be responded to by the younger associate. The first hearing was attended by both, but the next two hearings only the young attorney showed up. I was confused and questioning what was going on but wasn't sure what to do. He seemed inexperienced, unsure, and meek in the courtroom. The judge even chastised him at one point for not knowing what he was talking about. But he was the only one who would return my calls.

In March I got a call from the original, senior attorney. It was the day before the next hearing. He said the man was no longer with his office. I went to meet with him. He said as far as he could tell, nothing had been accomplished with my case. He didn't have some of the copies of court rulings and asked if I had them. He accompanied me to a fourth hearing, in which my (soon to be) ex husband's lawyer and he LAUGHED about the incompetence of the former attorney. 

I was told there was a great chance that my ex would have to pay my attorney's fees. I had been a stay at home mom. I had been counting on that (perhaps too much). My last payment was a month and a half ago. I have paid $4,000, and owe $3,800 more currently.

Today, I got a call from the secretary/wife. She said a payment is two weeks out, and she would have to ruin my credit by taking it to collections. Her words. I was stunned into silence for a moment, and she said ""BUT, I talked to (the attorney) and he will resign from your case right now and forgive the remaining debt."" She gave me a day to think about it.

I have no idea what to do. I feel like nothing has been accomplished in my case, and I am so mad at some of the things that happened. I would be so appreciative of any advice at all. Sorry if this turns out a wall of text, I'm on my phone. (No Internet anymore, I've cut out most unnecessary expenses) Thanks so much to anyone who can advise me.


Edit: I was planning on making a payment Friday, before she called. I know it's late. Just in case anyone thinks I was just being irresponsible and trying to get out of my debts. I was doing the best I could. What do I say to them, she gave me a day to decide?

Edit 2: Thank you everyone, I will start calling around to talk to another attorney.

Over a 10 minutes confrontation, the customer slapped her hard across the face 3 times and kicked her 3 times, while making her apologize.

[More details inside]",Boorish_Bear,43,7,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1kccq5/my_car_was_involved_in_an_incident_a_month_ago/,"Note: I live in the UK. 

So about a month ago I took my car in to a garage to have an MOT carried out. Unfortunately my car failed the MOT and the prices quoted to me to get the issues fixed were inordinately expensive. 

I have a friend that works at the garage, and he mentioned that a colleague of his (let's call him ""Dan"") would be able to do the work for me at a much cheaper price at his brother's garage. 

We made arrangements for my car to be dropped off by myself on the evening of Friday 19th July at my friends garage (where I had the MOT undertaken), and from there Dan would drive the car up to his brother's garage, have the work done and then drive the car back on Monday morning. 

Now all the work was carried out fine,and I met Dan on Monday morning before driving happily off to work. Foolishly, I didn't check the condition of my car when I was with Dan, and it was only when I pulled up at work and walked around the front of my car that I realised the front-left area of the bumper was damaged. 

It had clearly collided with something, so I made arrangements to meet with Dan later that evening after work to discuss what exactly had happened. Upon meeting with Dan he denied all knowledge of any accident, and refused to accept any responsiblilty for the damage. He did volunteer to install a bumper for free, but mentioned that I would have to buy the bumper myself. 

I wasn't best pleased as you can imagine. However seeing no other choice I left it there.

Now I've been contacted by my insurance company today who have told me that they have received reports of an incident on Friday 19th July. They say that they have no details of the incident (I think they're purposefully obfuscating facts so as to ascertan an unbiased version of events from me), and have asked for information on what happened. I babbled that I was with a customer at work and that I couldn't talk until this afternoon and promptly hung (I know, not the best thing to do but I was panicking and didn't want to say anything I might regret!).

Now the problem is that I have no idea what happened that evening as the car wasn't in my possession. The car was with Dan.

So I'm really worried here, what should my first steps be? How do I deal with the insurance company? I've never really dealt with anything like this before and would really appreciate any advice you could give me.

Long story short, they got in an argument with the state about whether they were allowed to have copious amounts of marijuana in our apartment. Because my name was on the lease, I got myself into hot water too (it's not like I was behaving like a model citizen myself - there's plenty of blame to spread around). I was about to go to grad school, so the courts agreed to let me go out of state if I agreed to the ""intervention in lieu of conviction"" program, which I think is a standard drug court thing - I agreed to waive my right to trial (and thereby plead guilty) and go on probation, and in exchange they would drop the charges and seal my record once I'd finished probation.

Shortly after I pleaded guilty, the sheriff's department in my county posted my picture and name on their facebook page with the caption ""CONVICTED OF [the charges I'd pleaded to]."" Inaccurate, but it seemed nitpicky to make a thing of it.

Fast forward to now. I'm off probation, my records are sealed, and life is good. I lost a job offer because of the mess, so I'm motivated to make sure this never sees the light of day every again. Problem: my photo is still on their facebook, and since they've stopped updating it, I'm still pretty close to the top. I don't want to make a big issue of it, but I want this picture gone. I'm going to message them and ask for the picture to be taken down, but I can't imagine they will be particularly motivated to do so. 

**My question is:** does my request have any teeth? Can I MAKE them take it down, if they ignore me?

For years, the theater has allowed the employees who work in these positions to keep the tips they were given, and these positions were regulated like any other bar, in this regard, through tip-share - that is, until sometime in 2008 when an incident occurred where, apparently, a few of the employees stole from the company and, after much investigation and litigation, those employees were fired and it was decided that the employees would, for the forseeable future, not be allowed to keep the tips they were given, as well as the tip-credit option, and it has remained so during my tenure at the company. That is to say, we still receive tips from the customers, but none of it ever goes to us. They still pressure us to try and obtain tips, however.

 These are, instead, taken and given to charity or used to fund small company parties, as far as we've been told at least although even then the letters of thanks from the charity stopped long ago, without the employees' consent or the customer's knowledge. These tips are placed into a plastic tip-jar, as is tradition for a barista, barkeep, et. al., but at the end of the night, they're placed into a metal box and locked away into a safe. The managers often threaten the employees with termination if they ""steal tips,"" among other things. When an employee asks about the legality of such practices, they are told some variation of ""our company is not legally obliged to give you tips,"" ""your lawyers couldn't beat our lawyers, we'd like to see you try."" Many of the employees, like myself, are very incensed about this, because we are, most of us, genuinely starving artist-types. The managers also refuse to explain the reasoning behind these practices.

 Is any of this legal, and if it is not, what kind of action can I take?

(Also, there is other stuff - there is one manager in his early thirties who continually hits on this new batch of teenage girls who are here for a summer job or whatever, and threaten to not give them any shifts if they don't go along with their advances. And another of the managers has outright, physically, sexually harassed many of the employees numerous times, but it has so far gone unreported.)",,False,self,t5_2rawz,1367438064.0,,,True,t3_1di1r8,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1di1r8/the_movie_theater_i_work_for_is_not_allowing_its/,

I work in Rhode Island for a public university. 

1. I was working for $10/hr
2. At some point they tried to cut my pay, without notice, to $9.50. 
3. Instead they upped it accidentally to $19.50
4. Yesterday they notified me that I owe them money equal to $10*the number of hours I was paid $19.50. In short, they are trying to institute the pay cut retroactively.

I can't find anything in the law that says they can't cut my pay without notice, so I don't think I can challenge them there. http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/Statutes/title28/index.htm is the RI title on labor and employment. 

But I'm guessing that they can't cut my pay for hours already worked - I can't find a source for that.

This is what I assume:
1) I have to pay some amount back to them,
2) the amount I have to pay back is the # of hours I worked during the mistaken period times 9.50. Basically, I pay them back for the hours I worked, but as if I was making $10 and they hadn't cut my pay. (I think this because from this subreddit it seems like you can't cut pay for hours already worked).
3) They have to present me with a schedule for repayment that is reasonable.

I was pulled over a block from my place of residence for a busted headlight, and blew a 0.125. I stayed in the drunk tank overnight on the night in question, and made it to work the following day. I've made two court appearances over the following years to clear it up. My last court appearance was in 2004.

My license has been revoked. I paid multiple fines, did a class, and community service, and thought I had the case cleared up but recently found I still have a bench warrant in Yolo county.

I contacted the Yolo county public defender, and after he pulled my case, he informed me that I have to do 2 days in Jail, but couldn't really articulate why. He is going before the judge on Tuesday on my behalf, and has asked me to tell him if doing the 2 days is an option.

I am starting a new job on Monday, and am very worried about taking time off so early into the job to get this resolved. This job is very important to me, and strangely enough, I even passed a background check / drug test to get it.

(Virginia)",OliveShmolive,40,8,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1ftr9p/i_have_been_emotionally_abused_at_work_for_over_a/,"This has been going on since day 1 on the job. Beth (the one who assaulted me) has been rude and pushy, demeaning everything I do, calling me names (cunt, bitch, nappy-headed cow etc...), talking about me to my coworkers. I've been isolated and I'm alone. My family says I come home from work sad daily. I feel like everyone is just talking about me behind my back everyday at work and I'm constantly watching my back and keeping my eyes to the ground. Beth is the groomer at the animal clinic where I work and has been for 12 years where as I've been there for 1. She brings in quite a bit of money for the clinic. For some reason she's got it out for me. 

  There have been several verbal altercations that were immediately reported to my boss (the owner of the clinic) by me. Whether by text message or by phone. My boss always says she'll talk to Beth but nothing ever happens long term. She does talk to Beth but it doesn't do any good and actually seems to make things worse. 

  Today was a normal day, the boss was having a day off and I was going about my business like usual, me and the receptionist got lunch. I noticed that it was noon and the sick kittens that Beth had brought in a couple weeks previously had not been fed or had water the entire day. Their cages were filthy and no one had done anything for them. It's not my responsibility to care for the animals that other employees bring in, it's that employees responsibility. It's not my responsibility period to care for the clinic cats or any boarding animals, only hospitalized patients. Another employee spoke to Beth about why the kittens weren't cared for and Beth replied to that employee ""Well where the hell is Oliveshmolive?"" Implying it was my job to take care of them. Despite this, I got to it anyway because not doing it out of principle would mean the kittens went hungry and thirsty and sitting in their own filth. I did however text my employer to let her know that Beth was not doing her job. 

  A short time later, I was in the lab cleaning up a fecal test and I see Beth come stomping towards me, slamming the door. She cornered me in the lab and starts cursing me, telling me it's not her fucking job to take care of the kittens, I took care of them and I'm a fucking bitch for telling the boss she wasn't doing her job, calling me a know it all cunt and sloppy cow and a fat bitch etc... I replied ""You're not doing your fucking job"" and she yells at me ""I'm the fucking groomer it's not my job to take care of the animals."" I told her that if she brought them in their her responsibility. I don't know what she said here but after quite some times of abuse I eventually said ""Why are you such a bitch?"" and her face is so close to mine she's spitting in my mouth as she yells at me. Then she bucks at me and I back up against the counter and she pushes me by my shoulders. I immediately took out my phone and dialed 911, I told the operator all that had happened. While I'm on the phone she's saying she wished I would hit her so she could beat my ugly face in. All of the other employees claimed to not have seen her push me, they're her friends after all so why would they admit to seeing it. 

  When the police arrived, I was out back smoking with another employee. I don't normally smoke but I was very shaken. The police took my side of the story and then went and took her side of the story. Since no one admitted to seeing it there was nothing they could do but they told me if I wanted to I could file criminal charges with the magistrate. I was told by them to leave work, despite me not causing the incident. I have the feeling they didn't believe me. I went to the magistrates office and filed a criminal report and was awarded an emergency order of protection and a warrant was put out to serve Beth with assault charges. 

  My employer later contacted me by phone. It was a 30 minute conversation and I don't remember what she said verbatim but the gist of the conversation was that if I wasn't to come back to work until the protective order was gone, that I'm not as valuable of an employee as Beth, I was obviously overly sensitive about people talking about me because of something that happened to me in childhood (which we have never even talked about), and that I would be fired if I refused to drop the protective order. I told her that if she were to fire me, I would be taking legal action against the clinic as whole. 

  I have an interview at another vet clinic tomorrow afternoon and if I'm offered the position, I intend to take the offer and not give a two weeks notice to my current employer. Regardless of the amount they offer me, it's not about money anymore. It's about my mental well being. I feel terrible about myself and my self esteem has suffered huge blows due to my treatment at work. I was diagnosed with depression as a teenager and have been on medication since, which has always been fine but my depression has severely worsened since working there. I intended to leave the clinic I'm at anyway but I didn't want it to happen like this, I was going to quietly give my two weeks when I found a suitable position and be done with it but that's become impossible in light of recent events. 

  My questions are: Do I have grounds to take legal action upon my termination? Do I have grounds to take legal action if I quit, since I'm quitting to leave a hostile work environment? Am I making a bad decision by pursuing the assault charges? What would any of you do in my situation? 

Thanks in advance for any replies. I plan on consulting with an employment attorney asap but I want to be prepared and I want to know if it's even worth it to pursue this.

Here's the deal, the kitchen sink in my apartment backed up with a clog 4 months ago and flooded the whole kitchen. I called maintenance, put in a request, and they came and solved the issue. I wasn't charged a dime. I never looked into my housing contract, so I assumed the maintenance was my apartment office's responsibility since they owned the complex.

Well, it happened again yesterday, for the second time. The kitchen flooded again. This time, my pregnant girlfriend came home and did not know it had happened. She slipped on the water, fell, and landed directly on her stomach. I was at work, she called me and I told her to get in touch with her OBGyn and they told her to go to the emergency room. She and the baby are okay, thank Odin.

I felt that, because this is the second time, and my girlfriend had a serious accident that required her to visit the emergency room, that the corporation that owns our apartment complex should at least pay for the copay of her visit. I called the office after the incident and explained the situation. I wasn't mad, I wasn't disrespectful, and I felt I handled it with tact. They told me there was nothing they could do until the manager comes in today.

When we came back from the hospital, there was a note on our table saying they had taken care of the plumbing problem. They snaked it, and found rice had clogged the pipes, and the note also said $50 will be charged to my account.

The thing is neither my girlfriend, nor I, ever eat rice. Also, we have never been billed the cost of maintenance services before. Is this them prepping for a legal battle after I had called the office to explain the situation?

When it comes to situations like this, I am pissing in the dark. I pride myself on my ability to read and learn about problems in order to find a solution, however, the legal system, my rights, and my contract with my apartment complex are like a foreign language. I am not asking for legal council, but I am asking for advice on the path I should take from here. Do I have a basis to ask them to pay for the hospital copay? What are my rights here?

I hope I can get some positive advice here. Even if the answer is that there is nothing I can do, at least it's an answer. Thanks guys!",,False,self,t5_2rawz,False,,,True,t3_1cmgl1,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1cmgl1/came_here_because_i_am_totally_lost_on_what_my/,

Somebody requested an update on this and what has happened since. Short version: nothing really.

Long Version:
We called the police department several times trying to get a hold of the dick bag that kicked our door down. They kept telling us that they would have him call us back. He never did so we kept calling. 

We finally got a hold of him and asked if we could have the affidavit or at least some explanation as to why they thought I was a drug dealer. He said ""I don't have anything to say to you. You'll find out when we take you to court. Maybe you should get a lawyer."" and hung up on my boyfriend.

My boyfriend had already contacted his lawyer but he was pretty slow to get back with us. When he finally did he told us that he had found that the police department has no legal obligation to give us an affidavit or even an explanation. (At least here in Michigan anyways.) He advised us to let it go as further harassing  the police department wouldn't get us anywhere and maybe even make the situation worse. So we've pretty much given up.

We have since had to put our door together with bolts and put in a new door knob since we can't afford a new door. [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/Fh0k3go.jpg)

We now lock the deadbolt and the doorknob even while we are in the house. We know it won't keep them out if they decide to come back and terrorize us some more but it still makes us feel a little better. (It boggles my mind some times to think about how I've never worried about being robbed but now we lock our doors because we are terrified of the people that are suppose to protect us.)

We now check the mail everyday. The last time I had to appear in court (for a fender bender ticket) I didn't receive my summons until AFTER the court date and they lied about when it was sent out. So not only did i have to pay the ticket but I had to pay a fine for not showing up to court. So now I'm paranoid as fuck they they are going to pull the same shit. 

My sister's husband who is also an attorney said that that if there is an ongoing investigation that could explain why they refuse to give me any information. I find this fairly likely since they raided the house across the street from us just a week or two ago. (I swear they are just going door to door kicking people's doors down because we live in a nice neighborhood and they don't have anything better to do.) 

I am now on several medications to manage my anxiety. For about the first month after the incident I was taking 3- 5 xanax a day because people kept bringing it up and wanting to talk about it and every time I did I'd have a severe panic attack. I had to take a sleep aid every night (some times I still do) because I couldn't close my eyes without reliving it in my head. 

I feel absolutely and utterly violated and it will haunt me to the day I die that I as U.S. citizen have no right to know why the police felt the need to kick down my door, handcuff me, threaten me, blatantly lie to my face, and to my boyfriend, and tear apart my house. 


If anybody has any further advice for me it is definitely welcome.
I live in Michigan. It was the Macomb County Police Department that raided my house. I have a warrant but no affidavit. If anybody has any idea as to how to get them to tell me why the fuck they thought I was a drug dealer I would love to hear it.

Long story short, she found her wallet, and the police thankfully didn't buy her story. All of that isn't really relevant though, but perhaps you were curious.

I have an aggressive nature, a while back I broke some dishwear and it was brought up. I wouldn't hurt my mother, the police weren't sure (I'm not faulting them) and they told me I should stay with a relative for the night (they said if I returned tonight I would be arrested).

None of that is the issue, I am just about ready to move into an apartment of my own, but the issue is that all my belongings are at my probably former residence.

Am I allowed to return to gather my belongings? Can I knock on her door (apartment) without being considered trespassing? I have a key to the place but of course I'm not going to use it if it's against the law to do so.

What frustrates me the most is that had this happened eight months ago, my mother as my legal guardian would have to let me in. That being said, I think she still collects taxes on my behalf or something like that.

Is this something I should pursue?",Knight0fNew,39,6,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1ke494/testicular_cancer_misdiagnosis_testicles_removed/,"Location: Florida, USA

I feel awful even posting this, but my entire family is telling me I should sue the doctor for medical malpractice. I really liked the doctor, and it feels like an awful thing to do, but I'm looking into it just to see my options.

So, I went to the ER with testicle pains and a fever. They did an ultrasound and the ER doctor immediately told me I may have cancer, and to see a urologist asap. He referred me to one, but I did not have insurance, and so I went through another hospital who took me under charity care. The urologist they referred me to was a young guy, probably mid-thirties, but super nice and I really liked him. 

After seeing my ultrasounds, he did a quick examination and concluded I have testicular cancer, bilateral in both testicles (which is VERY rare). He sent me in for a CT scan two days later to see if I had any swollen lymph nodes, to check if it had spread. He also sent me for blood work to check for tumor markers (this came back negative). A lymph node in my pelvis was swollen, so he said that it spreading was a possibility, and that the next step was a orchiectomy (Radical Inguinal Orchiectomy), and then we will deal with the lymph node. Within like 5 days I was on the operating table and had them removed. 

After the procedure (and before I woke up) he came out and told my family that the first testicle he pulled out had no signs of cancer, and that he sent the other one off to pathology to check. Even though the first one he took out had no signs of cancer, he still removed the second one. A few days later the pathology came back and neither testicle was cancerous, they just had some sort of small necrosis. He seemed really embarrassed when he explained it all to me at the follow-up, though he never directly apologized. But he looked guilty, and I felt bad for him.

Basically, the whole thing was done within 10 days, from the ER visit to the surgery. Apparently time is a very big factor in this situation, so it was very rushed. 

Now here's the complicated part: I'm transgender (male-to-female, obviously), and have been on female hormones for 5 years. I still live as male, and I had not made any plans to remove my testicles at this point. I was keeping my options open, though when I was confronted with having testicle cancer, I obviously had no problems with him removing them. It just turned out afterwards that I did not have cancer.

My entire family is telling me I should sue the doctor, because I am ""too young (early twenties) to understand the consequences"" of never being able to have biological children. I'm debating whether or not suing him would make me an AWFUL PERSON and a scumbag, because really, having them taken out was beneficial for me anyway in my transition. And because one of my parents ended up pushing me into disclosing my transgender status to my doctor before-hand, I worry he may have taken out the last testicle for me as a favor, even! And how much of a scumbag would I be to turn around and sue him for that? But at the same time, I now am locked into never being able to have biological children, and before this I was keeping my options open. I was put into a position where I thought it was risking my life, or having biological children - so of course I chose life. I was also in the middle of a very close family member dying (and subsequently did die a few weeks later) of cancer, so my family and I were very aware and literally watching someone die of what the doctor told me I have.

On top of never being able to have children, I'm now almost 10k in debt to various medical people. While the hospital itself waived all my fees, the pathologist, the ER, ER doctor, ER radiologist, anesthesiologist, etc are all charging me. I do not have anywhere close to the money they want from me. 

In the end, I just don't know if I have a case. All the literature I find on the internet says that really, he did everything by the book, and I can't see any sort of mistake he made. He didn't biopsy my testicle at any point, but he did do blood work to check for tumor markers (this came up negative). So I don't know if he actually made any mistakes, and if my case holds any weight. 

Sorry, I know this was a long post. I'm just really distraught at the moment and unsure of what to do. If you all can give me any advice, I'd sincerely appreciate it. Also, how bad is a malpractice suit for a doctor? What repercussions does that have for him? I just don't want to ruin his career... 

Thanks again.

Rochester, NY",jrteeter,36,5,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1jemkg/our_landlord_likes_to_snoop_around_our_apartment/,"We've lived in this apartment for 1 1/2 years.  The location is good for us as we have a young 6 month old son and his pediatrician is within walking distance as well as being in a good neighborhood.

We've noticed that our landlord is more and more ""off"" over time.  Overly curious as to what is going on in the house and finding reasons to want to go inside and check out the apartment.  We have nothing to hide, but this is getting crazy creepy and annoying.  

4-5 weeks ago the landlord starts showing up at the house without giving notice or asking permission to do minor repairs around the house.  Sweeping leaves, weeding the flower garden, blocking the driveway with his van (I can't even get the baby stroller around it to get in the house) etc.  In total he shows up without notice 5 time for about 3-6 hours each day.  At the end of the week he calls and leaves a message saying he wants to inspect our first floor apartment on Friday ""whether we like it or not"".  My wife talks to him and gets him to move it to Saturday because we want to be home at any time someone other than us is in the apartment.

The more we think about it the more we realize his pattern of not giving notice, not asking permission and then demanding something from us.  Usually his demand is to inspect the apartment.  We decide enough is enough.  When he arrives we give him a copy of the Tenants Bill of Rights produced by the attorney general of NY.  We ask him to read it and understand that he is not following the rules of being a landlord.  This entire interaction is recorded and can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfMsbOzzvk8&amp;feature=youtu.be

The police are called, I ask him to leave and he refuses, the police and the landlord end up walking through the apartment because we couldn't get either to leave.

Today the real estate agent who represents the landlord gave us an unofficial eviction notice essentially asking us to leave by a certain date.

What can we do?  And in watching the video is there anything that he says or does that is illegal?",,False,self,t5_2rawz,False,,,True,t3_1jemkg,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1jemkg/our_landlord_likes_to_snoop_around_our_apartment/,

To cut a long story short he had visible swelling and etc and a trip to the ER found that his collar bone is broken. He and his twin brother identified a certain child that hit him with a large rock.

The daycare had no idea that my son had any physical injury even though a break like that has obvious signs. It is not the first time that the culprit has injured my kids, but it is the worse case so far.

So, what options do we have in making this right, i have no doubts that the parents involved will do close to absolutely nothing in this matter, their parenting technique seems to be akin with Ned Flanders parents, they've done nothing and they are all out of ideas.

While i don't want to make a big stink for the owner of the daycare, its a small town and we know them they are good people and she has only been in business for a year and is serving the community well etc. The course of action we may take is to make a claim for injuries against the daycares indemnity (or similar) insurance. Hopefully this will make them consider a strong action regarding the offender rather than just our complaints.

So, how do we set-up this type of claim? Is there any web sources that give this sort of information? We certainly don't want to be getting litigious about this, we are just looking at options.

Posted this on r/jobs and thought I could get additional advice here. Background: I graduated last year, majored in science, have been working in a lab 10 months. Currently in Alaska.

1. My boss is emotionally unstable, highly volatile, unprofessional, and immature. 

2. My boss was dishonest with me. My boss led me to believe, by having me draft my own job description, that I would be a research tech in a permanent, benefited position. My position evolved into that of an administrative/personal assistant on an indefinitely temporary line (I was never offered a written contract). I don't have much of a paper trail on this because my boss refused to communicate about such matters via e-mail, but from speaking with an HR consultant my boss was clearly telling them and me different things when I was employed.

3. When I expressed concern about the change in my position, and the fact that I was never consulted or informed until after the fact, my boss told me this was the only job for me and that if I wasn't satisfied I should apply to other jobs.

4. I applied to other jobs, heard back from one, got through 3 interviews, and was unofficially offered the position. While I provided other references, my potential employer insisted upon speaking with my boss. My boss flat-out told me that she wouldn't support me or give me a good reference. My boss said: ""you told me you would leave when you applied to graduate school, and this isn't graduate school."" I urged my potential employer to speak with my other references. SIDE NOTE: Yes, I did inform my potential employer about my current situation with my boss, citing ""personal and professional differences"" and ""a realization that my current job does not align with my career goals.""

5. I found out today that I didn't get the job. I asked my potential employer if a discourse had occurred with my boss that caused this employment decision and she said ""There  were some concerns raised that I felt I could not ignore"" and basically that my other references were not sufficient to mitigate these concerns.  Potential employer also said ""I want to tell you confidentially that I think you deserve a supportive supervisor and mentor...""

I've spoken with HR and they are trying to see if they can place me in another lab.

To give a quick run down of what happened, I was hired on April 2nd, told I would need to train for 3-6 weeks entirely unpaid. I was told that the length of the training period would be dependent on how much time I was able to commit, so of course I committed to six days a week, eight hours a day to get it over with. After my third week of training, I was told that I would be in training for another three weeks. I made the decision to resign, as it was costing me time/money to be there, and it was becoming apparent that it would interfere with other (unrelated) work. I was required to sign a year long contract on my first day of work, so resigning was obviously a breach of that contract. My previous employer demanded $1500 to be paid to the company within 7 days to compensate for my training period, or ""legal action may result"". As much as I want to be taken to small claims (I don't), I'm wondering what my options are. How can I get out of paying this? Is there any options as far as counter-suing goes?

This thread is about Hollingsworth and Windsor, the two same sex marriage cases having their opinions announced today. There's another one being announced today too, involving the Hobbs act, but I doubt many of us will be thinking about it today.

Discuss away and ask whatever you'd like. 

**FAQ**

1- Does this make same sex marriage legal in the US?

**No. It means the federal government must recognize same sex marriages that are legal in any state.**

2- Can I file taxes with my spouse next year?

**Hell yes you can. Woo! In fact, you now receive every benefit of marriage afforded to opposite sex couples by the federal government. Congratulations!**

3- I don't know what Hollingsworth v. Perry means. 

**In a nutshell, the court decided that the petitioners have no standing here and that the circuit court in CA must dismiss the case. Once that happens, same sex marriages in California will resume, as the lower court ruled that Prop 8 is crap.**

4- Does my marriage in Massachusetts have to be recognized in NC now?

**No. Not yet. The question before the court in Windsor was specifically about the federal government recognizing same sex marriage. The court wasn't asked about other states (we'll call this the full faith and credit question) and they chose not to answer that question.**

5- Can my spouse and I file an amended tax return now?

**Earlier, I answered ""no"" to this question, but I've since looked into it more, and the answer is maybe. The IRS can issue their own ruling saying that they're not going to apply DOMA retroactively, but they haven't done so yet. So as of right this minute, yes, for 2011 and 2012, that can absolutely be done.**",,False,self,t5_2rawz,1372273464.0,,goldstar,True,t3_1h3vmo,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1h3vmo/supreme_court_decisions_625_discussion_thread/,

Condo owner in Ontario.

Our 15 year old, 250 unit condo has defective water pipes.  These pipes are in the owner's suites, not the common elements.  The piping has caused a number of major leaks to some owner's units and condo hallways.  

The corp wants us to replace the piping in all of our units.  The owners are in agreement with this because a) we don't want our unit to flood; b) we don't want to flood our neighbors; c) we don't want insurance companies to drop us.

Because the defective piping lies in the units, the corporation cannot use the reserve funds.  As such, they've put an application before the courts to force a piping replacement project at the expense of unit owners.  The corporation will pay a sole contractor to replace the piping in every unit.  The unit owner must pay the corporation for the cost of the project.  Failure to do so will result in a lien on the unit.  The unit owners are in agreement with the corp's legal action, because this will ensure that the project is completed.

**The Issue**
The corporation's chosen contractor (Company A) has quoted us $15K to do our unit.  Our neighbor's quotes range from $12K to $20K.  We felt these numbers to be ridiculously high, so a number of owners went to obtain quotes from other companies.  Those other companies' quotes came in at $5K to $7K.  These other companies aren't some joe-blows in their basement, they are legitimately large companies that do only commercial work.

We want to have the board explain to us why they are using Company A, and not one of the many others with cheaper costs.  Repeated requests to the board for clarification on Company A's pricing have been ignored.  Likewise, they won't even meet with us.  The only options the corp has given us is to submit and affidavit to court in a few days, and attend the court date.  

The majority of us unit owners feel shafted here.  We're being forced to pay WAY over market price, and it doesn't seem like there's much we can do.  Fighting it in court seems like it will incur a HUGE expense whether we win or lose, and we don't have enough time to dissolve the board.  The corp wants to start the project in the next two weeks.

Legaladvice.  We have a petition of 100+ owners that have voiced their opposition of the corp's tactics.  What can we do?

----------

**EDIT** 
So the board's argument is basically this:  ""the unit owners aren't going to do this unless they're forced to.  The board has an obligation to do this work because the unit owners won't do it.  We don't know if this is legal because the pipes are in their units.  We think we should be able to.  Judge, tell us we can.""

So here's what I want to: add an amendment to their order.
""the unit owners just found out a few weeks back that we need to do this.  We haven't done it because we just haven't had the chance yet.  How about you give us a month to do it ourselves, then you step in?""

As I was walking, I saw flash of light from a flashlight, and all of a sudden I was on the ground with a knee on the back of my neck.  I didn't fight back immediately, I tried to get the guy to identify himself, but he replied with ""Don't worry about it"" every time I asked.  He didn't have handcuffs either.  The guy had me pinned down on the ground, I asked him to identify himself once more, he refused, so I spun him off me, we wrestled around for a few seconds and I took off.  When I got to where I felt I was safe, I sat down to call the Police to report the incident.  Luckily for me (or so I thought), a cruiser rolled up, and I was arrested.

I had been drinking, so I probably didn't handle the situation to the best of my abilities.  However, I have a completely clean criminal record, I've been running youth outreach programs since I was 17, I even ran for City council a few years ago.  I know I fucked up, but I'm hoping I can convince the judge that I'm not actually a bad person, it was just a big misunderstanding on my part, and try to have the assault charge dropped, or lessened.

They took a statement from me when I was brought in, but I was still intoxicated and need to somehow retract my statements and give proper ones.  I realize I've fucked up really badly, I'm not looking for a get out of jail free card, I just don't want a mistake like this fuck up the rest of my life.  Any help would be really appreciated.

 I am a tipped employee. My company pays me 6.00 per hour. As i make my tips they go into a lock box that I can not open. At the end of my shift the employer opens the box and takes 10% to create a pool for a group of employees that can't receive tips.  I get no part of this pool.

 After they have taken the pool for the employees that do not receive tips they take another 35% of my tips. They claim that this goes to taxes and to help cover insurance and other deductions. This does not seem to make sense though because these deductions and taxes are being taken out on my check as well. So at the end of the night I take home 55% of what I was tipped for the night.

 The next issue I have is that they have us do other duties that do not pertain to our job. These duties are not tipped and we are still making 6.00 per hour while doing them.

 Keep in mind my employer has hundreds of people that are in my position following these same set of rules.

Alright, hoping someone can help me with this one.

The building I live in has an empty office space up front, while I rent the apartment in back. I have been paying $500/month to live in this, basically, a large studio apartment. I do not, nor have I ever, had access to the front (business) part of the building.

The bills are, and have always been, in my name. 

Last week I pay my rent electronically like any other month, receiving a ""payment confirmed"".

So yesterday I wake up to someone pounding on my door. They ask why I am there, claiming to be the owner of the property. I show them my one year lease, of which I am in the 7th month. The person at my door says they bought the property from foreclosure, and gave me a number for a bank.

I call the bank who says they did foreclose on the property, and that the property was listed as vacant. 

I call my landlord whose number has been turned off. 

From what I can gather from the various phone calls:

* The previous owner (my landlord) went into default then foreclosure.

* The landlord claimed the property had no one living there.

* The person who knocked on my door is the current owner of the property and is unwilling to have tenants as he wishes to live in the apartment in back.

The current owner says that he is planning to move into the apartment, and has told me if I am not out of the property in 3 days (By Tuesday) he will have me escorted from the property and will basically throw my things onto the street, as I am not ""supposed"" to be there.

The current owner also states that my lease is basically toilet paper as it was with the previous owner, not him, and so I have no claim on the apartment.

I have no way to get in contact with the previous owner, as the numbers I have for him have been disconnected and I went to his address, and it is For Sale.

**The Questions**

Do I have any claim to stay on the property? At least until I can find another place?

Any suggestions on how to find the old owner (my landlord) so I can get my security deposit/rent back?

I didn't realize the bank could foreclose/sell a property so fast, as well as that no one would inspect the property before listing/selling/buying it. Basically, this whole thing seems shady to me. Should I report this to law enforcement? As what?

Thanks to anyone who can help me.


**Update - Mon April 8**

I got home today to find my stuff out on the streets, the current owner's doing. I call the cops, showed them my lease, etc. and they straight up moved my stuff back in (thank god). Talked to a lawyer too, and like the comments say, I have 90 days AT LEAST to get my shit together and move out. 

The officers helped me document all of my things, and photographed damages, etc. as well as telling me that my old landlord was already being searched for as he ran out on the bank and several other debts. 

My lawyer says that as long as I continue to pay rent, I can stay until the end of my lease, but I am not going to do so. I am looking for an apartment to move into right now (or very soon). My lawyer also says that I may not get my security deposit back, or that it may take a long time to do so (It was only $500 and it may cost more to fight for it than to just drop it, so oh well). 

The officers called the current owner and had a talk with him, and basically it is MY apartment - he is not allowed in, it is trespassing (just as someone below said). He is allowed in the business part (up front, not mine, never was) but not in my apartment. 

Moved all my absolute valuables to my job (my boss is really understanding and is letting me have some time off with pay to work this out.) 

Thanks for all the help, I am looking at apartments now, and will update again when everything is resolved.


**Final Update**

So I have found and moved into a new apartment! I am also (hopefully) going to be receiving my security deposit from the new owner with compensation for my broken property.

This is going to be a long post, but I want to provide the full story in hopes of getting some helpful advice.  Thanks in advance.

I live in a house with 2 roommates, our neighbor is a single lady with a dog that barks incessantly.   She leaves her dog outside in her courtyard alone a lot and since our neighborhood has lots of people walking in the mornings, walking their dogs, etc, her dog barks its brains out at all hours of the day and early in the morning.  This has been going on for years.

Initially, we tried to reason with her and encourage her to get a bark collar for her dog, but she took no action and since then the barking has gotten continually worse.  We along with two separate neighbors have filed complaints with the city and she's been fined multiple times.  About three weeks ago, one of her friends (they are both in their 50's), came over obviously intoxicated.  I had a few people over and answered the door, her friend accused me of harrassing her and asserted that she'd been staying with our neighbor for 2 weeks and had never heard the dog bark, which of course isn't true.  There are about 6 people that witnessed this interaction.  It's become a serious battle.

Fast forward to last Friday, my roommate, who had been the person putting his name on the dog barking complaint was served with a civil suit alleging that he's been harassing her with incessant phone calls, texts, etc.  He hasn't personally contacted her in at least 18 months, which can be proven by his phone records. She also alleges that she now feels unsafe in her home due to us, and she's suing for $25,000 in punitive damages.

Now there is no case in court, we know that and she knows that, but simply defending this is going to cost a significant amount of time, money and stress.  I've been researching anti-slapp motions, but this is beyond the scope of what I really understand legally.  

So lawyers of reddit, any advice?  I could sure use some.  I've already contacted a couple attorneys, so the tab is already running, but I can't believe that due to complaining to the city and following their process, that we've become subject to a suit like this.

I headed to the door to get my wallet, and was stopped by Walmart loss prevention because I had completely forgotten that I still had the chicken in my hands. I apologized and stated that I was on my way to my car to get my wallet to pay for the items, and the security guard said he understood and that we just had to fill out some paperwork in the office. He repeatedly said that Walmart was treating this as a shoplifting case, but they weren't going to press charges, and weren't going to call the police.
Shortly after arriving in the office the police showed up, and arrested me, and charged me with ""criminal convergence"" (and I'm still not positive exactly what that means).
It also may be worth pointing out, that the total cost of the food from the deli was under $6.
I spent the last week looking for a lawyer, unsuccessfully I might add, as I was unable to find a lawyer that would take the case. They all acted like it was a waste of their time.
Today I had my arraignment, and was formally charged with ""criminal convergence"", which apparently is a class a misdemeanor and carries a maximum sentence of one year in jail, and a $5000 fine.
I was appointed a public defender, because I was unable to find legal consul, but it will be another week before I am able to meet with them.
I am seriously at a loss here, what's my next step? I have never in my life stolen anything. But how am I going to convince the court that I was going to pay for the food?
I'm a nurse in a hospital, and a firefighter and I will lose both jobs over this if I am convicted. I am just at my wits end.

I'll put the important stuff in bold.*

-----

A few years ago, I transferred from a public, state university to an expensive **private college in Illinois for a single semester**. I really disliked the move to the new school and ended up with the worst grades of my college career. So I decided to pack up and head back to my home state.

That semester cost me $20,000 (it was dumb, I know). Anyway, **I paid for this school entirely with federal student loans**: a couple subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans, and one supermassive Parent PLUS loan, which was listed in my parents' names.

When I left this private college, their **Financial Aid department had me fill out a ""loan adjustment request form,""** to cancel the loans as I would not be returning for any future semesters. I filled out the form they provided ([and I have uploaded here it for you to see](http://i.imgur.com/i5MWQcf.png)).

Note the second sentence on the form: **""If the loan has already disbursed, the borrower may cancel a loan within 30 days from the date it is disbursed to the student's account.""** *When I had filled out this form, the semester had already ended*. I had already completed my finals and was packing up to leave. **The loans had been disbursed MONTHS earlier.**

I left the school and returned home and thought everything was good. I called to request a transcript six months later — they inform me that there is a hold on my account for $20,000. **They took the money that was provided by my federal student loans — for a semester that I had already completed — returned it to the lender, and then left me with the bill.** Needless to say, I was shocked to discover this. 

The reason they did this, according to them, was because **on that form, I checked the ""cancel"" box for the fall semester that I had already completed**. It hadn't even crossed my mind that, even though the semester had ended, even though it had been months after the loans had been disbursed, *even though the form itself says a loan can be cancelled only within 30 days of the disbursement*, because I checked that one fucking box, I got screwed over.

I contacted the ombudsman group at the Department of Education, who claimed there was nothing they could do because several months had passed before my knowledge of the situation. It was just too late.

Now, I've got collection agencies trying to get me to pay off this debt, when I have a crap job that pays me $10/hr. **Now, I cannot get accepted to any other colleges or universities because, without the transcript from that school, they refuse to accept me (or give me financial aid). And the school refuses to give me the transcript because there's a $20,000 hold on my account.**

Do I have a case for anything? Or should I start considering bankruptcy? I will do anything to get done with college. But I can't do anything without that transcript.

-----
**TL;DR**: Attended a college for one semester, paid with federal loans. Leave said college, they have me fill out a form to cancel said loans since I wasn't coming back. But they also cancelled the loans for the semester I had *already completed*, gave the money back to the lender, and left me with the $20k bill.

I had the router listed for $75 and we agreed on a price of $60 through email. The person asked me via text message whether the router works well or not because this brand is known for dropping wireless signals. I said it works well, but occasionally the wireless signal gets dropped and it's just the nature of WiFi. We meet and complete the transaction, but when he gets home, he texted me saying he had a problem with being able to connect to the router. I gave him some advice on what to do and he came back saying everything works after he installed the new firmware. Two days later, he texted me saying that the router drops signals and that he wants his money back. He accused me that I knew about the problem and I sold him a faulty router (it isn't faulty and I told him the signal can drop sometimes). He calls me a few hours later and leaves a voicemail saying that if I don't give him the $60 back, he will use my cell phone number to get my personal information and take me to court (he doesn't have my name or address as of now). He also threatened that he ""studied law"" and I would be liable for triple damages of the cost of the item and his lost wages. He ends the message saying that I should expect something in the mail soon.

I haven't responded, but I'm worried about his threat. I don't feel that I did anything wrong because the router worked well when I was using it and I was honest with him that the signal sometimes drops. At this point I wouldn't even want to risk my safety by meeting him for a return. Am I obligated to respond to him? Is he able to take me to small claims court over this and win?

I am a 39yr old father of three amazing boys, who are aged 10, 7 and 6.  I am an American living in Canada.  All three children were born in the United States.  Their mother, Karen, is Singaporean.

Karen and I were married in Travis County, TX in 2002. 

In 2010, we moved to Canada and began the process of becoming permanent residents.

In May of 2011, we separated (not legally, but we moved into two separate places 10 minutes away from each other).  We had amicably reached a verbal separation agreement, but were still legally married.

The day after we separated, Karen got a call from Singapore informing her that her father had been diagnosed with Stage IV bone marrow cancer.  She wanted to take the children to Singapore right away to see him before he passed.  I felt the same way.

On May 3, 2011, Karen and my children got on a plane to Singapore with my permission.  We did not know how long they would need to stay there, but we had agreed that the children would have to return by August 15, 2011 in order to be adjusted in time to start school in September.

Later in May, Karen's father died.  Two weeks after that, she told me that she was going to relocate the children to Singapore.  I disagreed vehemently, but could do nothing - the children were already there.  She simply did not return.

Karen filed for divorce in Singapore - a process that I did not cooperate with.  The divorce papers (for whatever they are worth) stipulated that I could visit the children whenever I liked, and that Karen would not take them to church (the church part was important to me... her sister let her own daughter go blind, trusting God to treat her baby's eyes rather than see the doctor.  I didn't want my children raised in that environment for their own safety).

I contacted the US State department in 2011 to go over my options.  They said that there was nothing they could do, because Singapore had not signed a child abduction treaty with the United States.  I contacted the police in Vancouver to report them kidnapped, but they referred me to the US government.

I consider myself fortunate to see the children on Skype on Friday nights.  Some nights they don't show up, and I am in a panic that their mother may have decided to cut off all access.

Today, however, they are online.  Gabriel, the 6 year old, showed me the children's Bible that Karen's mother gave him.  I then asked Clayton, the 10 year old if they'd been taken to church, and he said that they went to church sometimes, and that his grandmother reads the Bible to them regularly.

In May of 2012, the US and Singapore did sign the Hague Convention on international child abduction, but the State Department told me that since the children were abducted before the agreement was signed, they cannot pursue the matter.

Reddit... I'm at a loss.  I tried to move past my anger and accept that the children have been taken, but the Bible/Church situation has brought all of the feelings up again, and I want to get my children out of there and back home.

Her dad ran out on her when she was 6 and her mom went through a long line of men..who treated her varying degrees of sucky. She met her own winner when she was 16.

Javi was 20 and a high school dropout who didn't work regularly- she was pregnant within 6 months. They had two boys- Alex and Adrian- and, while he never treated her well, by the time Adrian was born he was physically abusive. Of course, with two small boys, and being only 18, it was hard to leave. It took her jaw being wired shut before she realized she had to go.

She knew that if she stayed he'd kill her one day. And she was beginning to fear how he treated their toddler, while he could mostly ignore a baby when he didn't want to show-it off, toddlers weren't so easy. He was already trying to spank Alex-the two year old-with a belt and locked him in a closet for spilling a cup on the carpet (this was what started the fight where her jaw was broken).

So she packed up her kids and left. It was very hard and a very brave thing to do. Since then she's become a dental hygienist and is raising two wonderful, all-around great kids.

I met them a couple of months after she left, when she still flinched from sudden movements and was bruised and scared. We dated date until a year after that. And we got married a year after the dating. It was just right. I had never pictured raising someone else's kids or settling down young but we all fit together so easily. They call me daddy and I feel like their father. There isn't anything I wouldn't do for those kids..in fact, I do everything for them-and their mother.

But...the problem came when Javi found out we were getting married. The idea of somebody raising his kids infuriated us and he filed for custody. The guy's dirt broke, but his large extended family all pooled together.

The thing is...Javi got to see the kids. About once a week they go off to their Abuela and play with their cousins. She doesn't want to keep them from their family--she just doesn't want them with an abusive father. Sometimes he stops by, not often, and is given the opportunity to see them in a way Rachel is comfortable with. She doesn't trust him with our boys in the slightest--and I can't blame her.

But after a very long legal battle, the end is near and it's not looking good. We've drained our savings, begged and borrowed, but we are losing anyways. He never hit the kids and that's all they give a damn about. They see the kids at his mom's house as proof he ""has retained reasonable contact and is a father figure in the children's life and of benefit to remain one"".

I grew up with a dad who beat the shit out of me for everything. For responding too fast, too slow. He broke my arm twice and I remember hiding in the woods so he wouldn't find me. Rachel's life wasn't much better. I can't resign my boys to that... they are bright, funny kids who deserve better. They shouldn't have to go life with their Papi- who Adrian can't tell apart from his uncles- and who Alex is scared of.

We are considering running. Legally, if we leave before the court order, it's better for us. I have a cousin who lives across the country we could stay with. And I'm an electrician, so it's a fairly decent field. But even if I don't get a job in my field, I don't care. I'll clean toliets if it means they don't have to live with a guy who breaks women's jaws.

Then again, it's not easy. We have our whole lives here and this is kidnapping. We could get into a lot of trouble. I think Rachel will go regardless, leave the husband she loves, the job she worked so hard for, the friends she made at the house of ruth, she feels bad about separating the boys from their paternal family but she has no doubt he'll abuse those kids. I just don't know what else to do. Are we doing the right thing?

tl;dr I(24m) am a stepdad to two great boys(4/5). Now their abusive father(26m) is likely getting custody, as he only abused their mother and not them--at least not on any record-- my wife(22f) and I are terrified and considering fleeing.

Both insurance parties have my pictures of the damages as shown above (without the blurring of identifying information).

Today the other party's insurance emailed me this:
&gt;Thank you for the photos. I have attached the incident form, please be as detailed as possible as my insured contends that you back up into his vehicle.

My insurance isn't helping in this because my plan doesn't include damage coverage. They said to deal with this with the other insurance directly.

**I have a front facing dash cam that recorded the incident showing that I was stopped and did not back up at all.**

Not going to play that card just yet though, wanted to ask here first.

What should I do? Should I contact an attorney?

I've been told that the estimate is over $7,000.

I'll try to sum up the situation as concisely as possible, but it is pretty complicated, as these things often are.

This all happened in the state of Delaware.

My father molested my older sister (his step daughter) beginning when she was about 3 and continuing until after I was born, when she was around the age of 13.  When I was about 6 or 7 years old, she told a friend about it, who told her parents, who told my mother.  My mother separated from him, and apparently required him to turn himself in.  He did so, but was told they could do nothing unless my older sister pressed charges, which she didn't want to do.  She didn't want to break up the family, take my father away from me and my younger sister, etc.  My parents got back together, my older siblings moved away as soon as they could, and for many years I didn't know what had happened.

I found out about all this when I was 16, two years after my parents separated for good.  My father moved back in with his parents.  As far as I knew, this had only ever happened with my sister, and I suppose I deceived myself into believing this was an isolated instance of regressive pedophilia, and that while it was absolutely horrible, it was not going to happen again.  My mother made it clear that we needed financial assistance from my father, and I continued in a strained relationship with him until after my grandparents (with whom he lived, and who had played a very large part in raising me) died.  Around the time they died, it came out that my younger sister had also been molested.  I cut off all contact with my father, and called a lawyer in Delaware to see what could be done.

At this time, the statute of limitations has apparently passed on the offenses committed against my older sister.  My younger sister has some years left in which she could still bring charges, but has been extremely resistant to the idea.  My older sister, upon hearing what had happened to my younger sister, sent the Delaware police a letter my father had written to her years before, essentially apologizing for what he had done to her.  The cops couldn't use it.  

So she flew to Delaware, broke into my father's house, and got on his computer.  She discovered thousands of files related to child pornography, and filled a USB drive with the first 1000 or so.  She took this to the cops, who said they could not use it, and that the things she had found did not meet the apparently rigorous standards for actionable child porn.  She told me the photos she saw were all of clothed, but eroticized children.

The lawyer I spoke with basically told me there was nothing I personally could do about this because he never abused me sexually.  One of my sisters would have to bring charges.  We also talked about the possibility of my older sister bringing a civil suit against him.  Since my younger sister does not seem to be remotely ready to bring legal action against him, I tried to support my older sister in doing something.  She has been greatly destabilized by these latest revelations, and had to put the civil suit preparations on the back burner.

I personally am left enraged and deeply concerned that he might do something to other children.  His parents, who I imagined were keeping some sort of eye on him (I know this is unrealistic) are dead now, and he is estranged from much of his family.  I feel he is free to do any number of horrible things without much risk of detection.

I feel desperate to do something about this, but feel that the legal system has failed several times, and I don't know what to do next.  I also feel that this is a nightmare that just continues to unfold, and I won't personally feel any closure until my father is dead or incarcerated.",,False,self,t5_2rawz,False,,,True,t3_1gqsra,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1gqsra/my_father_is_a_child_molester_and_i_am_looking/,

I moved out of my parents house on August of 2008 as soon as I turned 18. I left on not good terms with my mother, but ok terms with my dad and siblings. I have lived in SF ever since, with roomates who always had the PG&amp;E in their name. At the end of July of this year, they moved out, so i had to put the PG&amp;E in my name for the first time in my life.

So when I called, they told me that I had a bill of $3,200!! I was confused, so i asked them for the address where the bill was due. The Address that they gave me was from the house my parents moved into after I moved out. The dates from the $3,200 bill are Sept 2008 to June of 2009.   

So since i moved out in Aug 2008, My parents literally waited 1 month for me to move out to do this. It was completely planned. My mom has my birth certificate and all of my info, and I had JUST turned 18, so she was able to put the PG&amp;E in my name and not any of my other siblings.

June 2009, my mom cheated on my dad, and they got divorced. So the only reason it didn't go on for longer, is that they broke up and both moved out.
 

My mom has always been a scam artist, and master manipulator. So I'm sure it was her idea, and my dad just went along with it as he always did. 

So the PG&amp;E person that I was speaking too, transferred me over to the fraud department. 

I gave them my moms name, and she said that she would just transfer the debt over to her account. 

But then she said she kept running into walls, trying to find my mom. I guess she is sneaky enough to not put anything in her name.

So I gave her the name of the guy she cheated on my dad with, and is now living with and they found him. But since he was not involved at all, they cannot transfer the debt to him. 

Then they told me that they were going to send me a fraud packet, which i believe is some form of police report. They said the packet would explain what kind of documents I needed to clear this up. 

So my question is, what can i do? I am BEYOND furious, that my own freaking parents would do this to me. I want them to pay for this. 

Should I wait for the packet to come in and just follow the directions? Should I go to the police station and file some sort of report?

Also, is there any chance they will go to jail? I am terrified that they ruined my credit, and I am also scared that my mother will keep using my information to keep scamming.

Would a restraining order be a good idea?

I would appreciate any help, advice, resources available to me.

The university had been all Corps since it's founding up until the 1960s as a senior military college. Now, being in the Corps is voluntary, but they're still over 2,000 cadets on a campus of 50,000. The Corps prides itself on developing ""well-educated leaders of character."" Half of all cadets go on to be commissioned officers in the US military, while the other half graduate with leadership certificates. This is a leadership and military oriented organization directly a part of the university. This is not a religious organization what so ever.

All cadets eat breakfast and dinner together at the same time every weekday. At some point in the middle of all meals a cadet will come on the loud speaker and say, ""rest for prayer."" This 'rest' means that whatever you are doing it is expected of you to stop talking, stop eating, and absolutely stop walking if you are up getting food. Everyone is expected to stand still no matter what you are doing, praying or not. So the prayer will begin and it is never a non-denominational prayer or an all-faiths prayer, it is a very long prayer that evokes ""Jesus Christ"" multiple times throughout. 

I really have no problem with the fact there is a prayer or that it is not so inclusive, but I do have a problem with people being forced to 'stop' in place for this prayer being made. For example, several other cadets and I, have been walking around getting our meals during the prayer and a student 'staff' member or military supervisor (retired NCOs) will approach us and tell us to stop for prayer or you will face punishment/disciplinary action. My question: is this a violation of my rights to be forced to essentially take part in this mass prayer at a public institution in a school-run leadership organization?

After everything was replaced (new wiring, new meters, etc), I began noticing my bills seemed a little light. Since the first six months of this time they only ""estimated"" the bills, I figured I'd get hit with a reasonable bill once they came and read the meters. HOWEVER, my first ""Actual"" reading bill was also quite low. I figured maybe they had wired it to be more efficient or something and went on with my life....

Yesterday, I received a bill which has re-assessed every bill I've received since September 2012. Apparently they were doing something incorrectly when coming to read the meters, so their response to the situation is giving me just shy of a years worth of bills to be paid in 2 weeks (Approx. $2,000, which is not what I would consider ""walkin' around money""). 

So my question is, can they legally do this? I'm sure I have plenty of my previous bills from these months that state the meter HAD BEEN READ by someone, and I paid those balances fully and on time...will this be to my advantage at all? Is it worth calling a local lawyer, or should I call the power company (NYSEG) and try to work something out?

What's really outrageous to me about this is the fact that I work in customer service...and I KNOW if I had been doing MY JOB INCORRECTLY (which is EXACTLY what has lead to this situation, NYSEG doing improper work) for almost 2 years, I would not only lose my job, but my company would eat that loss of money and NEVER CONSIDER punishing the customer for something I screwed up. 

I haven't called the power company yet to complain, as I feel I'm still far too hot headed to do so with any tact, and the last thing the poor person on the phone needs is for some lunatic to verbally take his frustration out on them.

They sent the company a certified letter telling them to pay us in full within 5 business days or face fines.

We had decided to relocate to Colorado and she gave a written notice of resignation 10 days prior to resigning. It wasn't until her final payout that she discovered that 50% of her accrued vacation (limited carryover to 80 hours) had been deducted from her final paycheck.

She and her coworkers were unaware of any policy change that had been made but it was discovered that there was an included change in the employee handbook to address the policy of reducing the accrued liability.  The actions that she would have taken prior to resigning would have definitely been different with a knowledge of potentially losing half of her ""nest egg"" of 5 weeks PTO.

My question without getting into too many details, is this a legal action by her employer to limit the amount of carryover and then deduct a portion of the accrued liability when an employee has been employed more than a year (or two some research suggests), not knowing of any such policy change, and given appropriate notice?

She has been in contact with the state labor commission, attorney generals office, and I have been in contact with an attorney friend who is generously looking into it without making the cost/reward benefit disappear.

As a background, this is a single member LLC with just the one employer and controller/HR manager.

There were approximately 20 numbers on it. The goal was to hit the highest # twice and the second highest once in 3 tries.  Something about the wheel seemed a little off.  When the highest # came around the wheel would speed up past it.  If the # almost crested the top the wheel would actually go backwards a # in the front.  If the wheel was correctly balanced this couldn't happen(there were pegs between each # and a fairly sturdy rubber pointer that hit the pegs). I inspected the wheel. They had plates on both sides, BUT there were a few small 1.5"" squares that would allow you to peak in. I moved the wheel and looked around. What I found is that on the inside there were 2 silver counterweights that just so happen to be above and below the highest #. The wheel moved very fluidly for how large and heavy it was. When someone would spin, it would generally go around 15 times on average. It had to make it 5 times around to count. Anyways, I calculated that there were about 300 spins on this wheel over the course of 2 months. There was approximately 20 #'s on the wheel. Over those 300 spins not a single person landed on the highest #. 

My job was to repair or report any abnormalities on the Casino floor.  I reported this wheel to my super, his manager(she actually spun it and it was perfectly coming around on the highest # and the wheel sped up for her and went past...her head fllung around behind me and gave me this look of disbelief, but I knew she saw it too now) then finally a lottery official. The lottery official seemed pretty interested as he had me take him to the wheel and show him. He said he was going to file a report and ran into the lottery office. I never heard anything back from him.  Lottery officials are anal.  If a button doesn't work correctly we had to shut that game down.  3 weeks after the wheel was gone they were following me looking for a reason to fire me(I believe). I'm allowed a 30 min lunch that I must punch for and (2)15 min breaks(no punch). They recorded me playing a game on my phone during my 15 minute break and accused me of stealing company time.  I also issued some free play for the machines to someone that I knew, but it was for a valid reason(it was only $30 and we were allowed to issue a max of $100). I followed our training rules. We were advised in training that nobody would ever be reprimanded for writing them and they encouraged us to. I was a good employee who scored higher than most in my department. I had never been reprimanded for misconduct. I drover 35 miles each way for a worthless $10-13(raises over 3 years) wage. Anyways they suspended me and fired me a week later.  Then I get my unemployment and they appealed it and won somehow.  Now I have no job and owe unemployment $1200.  My house/car payment is coming due soon.  I was working on finishing my CCNA, but now I'm probably going to have to put that on the back burner so I don't lose my house.  I feel like I was targeted due to informing lottery about their weighted wheel. The casino I work for is very dirty with the way they treat workers. I was told by a higher up that front line people were ""expendable"". These people hide in their offices all day and couldn't last one day on the floor with angry customers.  I tried to get public defender to help me, but they denied me.  My wife makes $22 an hour, but they don't take into account there's only one person paying for food, mortgage, 2 cars, utilities, taxes, etc.  When I explained my story to them she stated that it sounds like discrimination.  I studied discrimination and there is a branch regarding whistleblowers. We usually only have 1-2 people in surveillance during this time, so why would one of these two people be watching me in my office? They were even zooming the camera in on my cell phone reading my text messages(that's how they knew that I knew the person that I issued the freeplay to).  This all happened in my office off of the gaming floor.  The camera that they used was always focused on the door which was away from where I was.
So, basically I'm nearly broke, owe unemployment 1200(I'm filing an appeal, so hopefully they'll reverse the decision into my favor), my car/house payment is due and I have no job. I am an ethical person and it disgusted me knowing that people were coming there and playing their hard earned money to earn entries for spins on the wheel to win $500k, but little did they know the game is rigged.  I also found that they new system we installed has the ability to change the percentage on a machine depending on what person's card is in.  I said something to the manager and she pulled me aside and said not to tell the attendants because they'll tell the customers.  I don't want to say any names because I think I might go to a lawyer, but at least I think I'll go to the newspapers about the wheel. 

They sent screen shots for the unemployment hearing(was over the phone) and the guy running it said that all he saw was black squares(sent via fax).  They said they'd send him in color pictures.  I asked for a copy of their evidence.  I received a copy with nothing but black squares.  On the determination the times were wrong(I wasn't even at work during the time the judges paperwork says).  What they accused me of was ""gross misconduct"".  There's stuff listed for being intoxicated at work, arson, theft, larceny and assault listed.  Really?  They said I was ""inappropriately playing a video game at work"" and the free play was ""theft and is a deliberate disregard of the employer's interest"".  Everything that I did was by the books that night.  I believe that I pissed someone off real bad by catching their weighted wheel and they wanted rid of me.  

One more thing...when they pulled me in the office I did play dumb at first, but I was truthful with them after a few minutes.  I really had nothing to lie about, but when you get pulled into the office with the security director and he interrogates you it's a little unnerving.  

Sorry for the length, but I wanted to explain myself in depth.  I would be most thankful for any help or suggestions that someone may have.  I invested 3 years in that place and got nothing but praise from coworkers and customers.  I even have cards from the same people that fired me with thank you notes from customer compliments.  I also voluntarily came in to take the managerial classes that they offered(unpaid).  There were 20 classes @ 2 hours each.  I completed 3 before this happened.

A couple weeks back I was out to dinner with my girlfriend, her friend, and a buddy of mine.  We had a few drinks and went back to my place and were hanging out having some more drinks.  We played strip poker for a bit then my buddy left for the night.  My girlfriends friend went to our room and got in bed, and we followed suit as it was late.  My girlfriend and I started getting into it and we asked her friend if she wanted to join.  She didn't say anything so we said we'd leave if she was uncomfortable.  She said no she didn't mind.  We decided that was kind of awkward so I got up to head to a different room and the girl asked where I went and said to come back.  So I came back and started doing things with my girlfriend again, and asked her friend if she wished to partake.  She agreed.  I performed oral sex on her and was also kissing on her body.  I then had sex with her very briefly before we called it quits and all decided to sleep.  I did not ejaculate.  The entire time any of this happened we asked repeatedly if she was OK and everything was fine, she said yes.

The next morning she remembered it and was completely fine with me and my girlfriend.  We discussed it as adults and she expressed concern over telling her boyfriend (he has cheated on her in the past so she wasn't sure if she was going to tell him or not).  She left a bit later and we thought nothing of it.  The next day she was texting my girlfriend asking her for advice on telling her boyfriend. She even expressed that ""she was going to die some day anyway"" and she could ""cross that off the bucket list"".

Now, today (over a week later) she texts me accusing me and my girlfriend of taking advantage of her and saying she said no to me.  This is a lie, but none the less that is why I am here.  My girlfriend has saved the text conversations between them where they agree on the story that I just wrote.  She now claims otherwise. I'm assuming she feels guilty and is now trying anything to do anything so her boyfriend doesn't think she agreed to partake with us.

The reason I'm here is, although I highly doubt this would happen, could I seriously be accused of rape for this,?

She went on a trip around the world and her mother offered to send me with her, I declined saying I could not afford it and would not ever be able to pay her back. But she insisted and sent me. She gave me roughly 10 grand. While on the trip my girlfriend had to pay for everything recreational and spent a little over one thousand dollars on me. It was verbally agreed I would pay my girlfriend back for any of the money she spent on me and I told her I didnt want to come on this trip because I couldnt pay her mother back.

Everyone made it sound like she was paying for it because she wanted her daughter to have someone she could trust traveling with her, and even her mom said things like ""just pay my daughter back""

Well when we got back I worked very hard and paid my girlfriend back and everything seemed good. 

Throughout our relationship her mom would just go and spend money on me like I was her son or something. I had a computer die and she bought me a new one without even telling me.

Well we had a messy break up and now shes demanding all the money she wasted on me be paid back.

**EDIT1:**

Thank you for the humor, in addition to the sound advice.


     
**Edit2:**

Here is more information on it.
This is an action seeking unpaid wages for an employee of an “employer” for the equitable relief pursuit to that of the Fair Labor Standards Act, and to recover penalty wages under the Louisiana Unpaid Wage Statute.

As more fully shown in the accompanying memorandum, this is a simple case. MATHIS clearly demonstrated that wages are due, has made multiple demands for payment and that BOOMTOWN has failed to pay upon these demands. La. R.S. and FLSA, listed herein, require timely payments of wages, and also mandates that “every employer shall pay” its employees the minimum wage.

Things have kind of gone south, and I've chosen to look for other opportunities. I have a few interviews lined up, so I'm mentally preparing myself to quit my current job. The thing is, this clinic has been under a microscope for other legal issues that I don't want to get in to.

We have not undergone a HIPAA audit yet, but would not be surprised if we did soon. Since I'm in charge of all IT-related stuff (the EMR software, networking, etc) I have assumed the responsibility of ensuring that all IT/software related things are HIPAA compliant. I also manage the off-site backups for the server. Things are nowhere near where I would like them to be in terms of compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security rule. I have pushed for clinic policy to become more stringent towards HIPAA (at least I think I have), but to no avail. 

So a few questions:
- Who is responsible after I leave for security breaches that risk protected health information? I know this question sounds silly, but think about this: What if I made a mistake (security hole, weak passwords, whatever) that was simply exploited later. I would have been responsible had I been on the job, so wouldn't that make me responsible later?

- What is ""best practice"" in handing these responsibilities over after I quit? Personally, I highly doubt my boss will hire another in-house IT guy. Instead, he'll probably let the dust collect until something breaks - then outsource the IT work to a third party. I don't want **any** knowledge of  the passwords once I leave. That would literally involve changing all of them. I can see some auditor/the government accusing me, (the guy with all the passwords) of the source or reason of a security breach.

I know I probably sound like a paranoid weirdo, but after the law enforcement comes in, it kind of leaves you a little shaken up.

I was hired to manage the content of their websites, social media sites, and whatever misc tasks they gave to me. At the same time, a web designer was hired to redesign their websites. The business had an office in my hometown, but they preferred I come out to their headquarters in a town around 45-50 minutes away. The office was open from 8-6 ( except some Fridays when they leave at 5), and most employees worked 9 hours. I only worked 8 and was salaried, but made the same as a 12.00 per hour employee. (they even messed this up on the papers I signed when hired, which said I made enough money for someone working 9 hours. Some guy had to scribbled out and changed it with pen....) I asked my manager, the owners son, when I should come in; from 8-5 or 9-6? He said I could come in any time between then, as long as I get in my 8 hours and try to keep the time consistent enough. I thought this was also because I was driving far to get in compared to just going to the other office close to me.

When I was laid of, the owner told me business was slow, but I did a good job, I was a good employee. He even suggested maybe I could come in on a ""part time"" basis.

Later in the evening, I sent my manager an email detailing everything I was working on, what they could start do, and thanking them. I also inquired about working part time, like had been mentioned. He emailed me back saying my ""professionalism and due diligence had been demonstrated"" and it was a ""pleasure"" and that he would reach out to me tomorrow. No one ever reached out to me, and my company email was terminated the next day. No one responded to me from my personal email, so I just I filed for unemployment.

I was denied at first. Now they were saying I was fired for being late. Luckily, I had all my company emails saved on Outlook on my laptop ( I used it for work), even though they deactivated my email. So sent unemployment the exchange I had with my manager before being laid off, and also pointed out that while they might be supplying arrival times of employees, that they never recorded when anyone actually left the building.

After that, I was allowed unemployment. But now they are appealing again for the same reason, and I have a phone interview. I read online sometimes they do this just to see if you don't show up, but even if I don't, they continue the hearing without me. If they don't show up, they just throw out the appeal.

What should I do? How should I prepare? Do you think I have a case?

1. Arrival times, but no depature times

So, my dad has a small used car dealership (just him and another guy, usually around 15-25 cars on the lot).  He sells used cars and, frankly speaking, his customers are working poor.  The busiest time of year for him is in the spring, when his customers use their income tax returns to put down payments on cars.  

However, lately a small albeit significant number of his customers have been declaring bankruptcy after making 1 or so payments on the car, meaning they can still drive it and he can't reposes it as they make no payments on the vehicle.  (This is where he might be leaving something out/not know what to do/where I would like some advice) What should his course of action be once one of his customers declares bankruptcy?  He says that 99% of the time he doesn't get the car back after the court proceedings and, if he does, they've trashed it so bad that he's lost a majority of what it's worth.  Is there anything he can do or is this just something he has to deal with?

I ask this because my dad's business is everything to him.  He grew up poor (had to work to pay rent on his mom's house when he was 14), didn't go to college, and has worked 6 days a week for 20 years to keep his business strong.  Used cars are super expensive these days (thanks, cash-for-clunkers) and, while his business is doing ok, times aren't the best.

1367384527.0,23,self.legaladvice,1dgqt0,I'm being falsely accused of sexual abuse. Please help.,needsadvice2013,27,4,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1dgqt0/im_being_falsely_accused_of_sexual_abuse_please/,"This is obviously a throwaway account.

My girlfriend is involved in a bad custody battle with her ex husband over their young daughter. In a dirty attempt to gain ground in the battle, he called child protective services to say that I am a risk of sexually abusing their daughter. This has thrown my life into a crazy whirlwind and I really need some sound advise.

My girlfriend's ex husband is a really bad person. At 18,  he was involved in two porn videos. Throughout my girlfriend's relationship with him, he was high every night (weed), drank and partied excessively and was verbally, emotionally and sometimes physically abusive with her. He made her move out of her parents house and live with him and his family (7 people living in a small, 2 bedroom apartment), and not have any contact with her family. She was 'in love' and this made her abide by his rules.

He eventually joined the army for a brief time, but came to her and said he was cheating on her consistently while away. This caused their marriage to begin failing and she was going to leave him. He went AWOL from the army to ""save his marriage."" When home, all he did was party with friends and continue cheating on his wife (my gf). She eventually left him, so he went to an army psychologist and was deemed unfit for service and was generally discharged from the army. They still ended up getting divorced.

Fast forward some time, I went through a similar situation of. Ring cheated on and divorced, and we found each other again. We knew each other when we were both 13, so we had a history. We fell in love,  and I was always there for her and her daughter, whom she has shared custody with her ex. I drive her to meet with him and exchange her daughter every week (and I mean EVERY week). I have a good job, so I can buy my girlfriend and her daughter things. I'll take them to Chuck E. Cheese. I'll buy her daughter cartoon Dvds, toys, and many things that a 3 year old would need.

When I'm in the house with my gf and her daughter, I make sure to never put myself in a situation that can be interpreted as a bad situation. I was raised in a Christian home and I spend every weekend playing music for my church on Saturday and Sundays. I created a non profit cancer benefit foundation to raise money for families struggling with children with cancer. I have a bachelor's degree and a great job. I pay my bills on time. I take care of my business. I have a great family with a good background.

Getting back to the daughter, if my girlfriend ever bathes her daughter with me in the house, I never enter the bathroom with her in there. When she gets wrapped in a towel and my gf has to carry her to the bedroom, I leave the room. If my gf is changing her daughter,  I leave the room and stay as far from it as possible. She's not my kid, so I don't have any reason to be near her when she's being bathed or clothed.

I do play with her outside and inside with her mother in the same room. I read to her. I build things with her and her Legos. I play video games with her (Dora games). We hit golf balls outside. We chase the dog. We ride the golf cart; we do light hearted stuff that a child of 3-4 years old does. I feel like I go above and beyond for my gf and her daughter. I would never put myself in a compromising situation with her. I've only had to babysit her one time out of emergency because my gf has to work late and her mother (who always watches my gfs daughter) wasn't around. All we did for the 2 hours was watch TV. If she wanted something, I got it for her. That's it. It was a one time thing about a year and a half ago. There was no more instances after that.

Getting back to my girlfriend's ex husband, he got another girl pregnant about a year and a half ago. He left her,  so she filed for full custody and he was only allowed to see the child supervised. Eventually they got back together. They're not married, but still dating. His mother, whom he still lives with, is more manipulative than he is. I believe during the time they had the daughter, his mother was coaching the daughter to say things like I made her pull down her pants in front of me. These words would never come out of her mouth without someone making her. Mt gf's mother told her about how the ex's mother acted like her granddaughter was here's. She was apparently always taking her from my gf, and making her feel inadequate as a mother. This shows more of how my gf was controlled by this household.

There were a time we had the daughter and my gf was bathing her, and the daughter would say, ""Daddy hurts me down there (crotch region)."" My gf asked her what does she mean. Then the daughter responded, ""But daddy loves me."" We should have known to report that but we are both young and would never dream something like this could be going on with her daughter. There was also another time we picked up her daughter and asked her who told her to say that I made her pull down her pants, and she said, ""Grandma made me say that, but you didn't make me pull down my pants, (my name). Grandma made me say it."" This was suspicious but we were too stupid to realize what was actually happening.

Fast forward to last week, her ex had the daughter for a week and was supposed to exchange her Saturday. He called her an hour before we were supposed to leave and says he's gonna keep her til Monday. My gf agreed because he said he wanted to take her to some Sesame Street show. Monday comes around and an hour before we were supposed to leave, he calls her saying he's keeping her til my day. My gf was furious, crying like crazy... Being hysterical. He said he was going to give her back that Wednesday, so she sucked it up and made it to Wednesday. On Wednesday, an hour before we were supposed to leave, he calls saying he's keeping her until she gives him an answer about her and her daughter moving back to his area so the daughter can be in school full time starting September. My gf told him that she doesn't have to give him an answer and that we're going to court to her the daughter back.

The next day we get in court and get a hearing. The ex shows up 5 mins late with a 'confidential' envelope. He takes the envelope to the judge's office and we find out that he called child protective services saying that the daughter is ""at risk"" of sexual abuse by me! This is outrageous. I have nothing to do with their custody battle. I was just supportive of my gf in this. We were together for 2 years and I wanted to show her that I support her in getting full custody of her daughter.

So, I am being accused of sexual abuse of their 3-4 year old daughter. I never touched her inappropriately. I never put myself in a situation that could be interpreted as inappropriate. I feel he is accusing me to just try and win this court case at any cost. No one else was accused. I received a letter from child protective services saying they have 60 days to investigate. The daughter is apparently 'at risk'  of sexual abuse. I see that as it didn't happen, but they are investigating because they got the call. I have my whole life ahead of me. This is outrageous.

So, I am currently doing whatever I can to prove my innocence. I will take a polygraph. I have 3 reputable people writing character reference letters describing how good of a person I am. I am actively seeking a good PA lawyer. I want to prove my innocence before the investigation even starts. I am willing to cooperate with any investigation. The letter I received is civil action, not criminal.

Please let me know what I need to do to prove I'm innocent and those charges are false. Her ex knows these are false. I want to take the fight back to him. I would love to sue him for false accusations, and build a case for my gf to get full custody. I truly want this bastard to pay.

I will answer any question I can as long as it doesn't reveal personal info. Please help!

TL;DR Read all of it, but if you don't want to to, I'm being falsely investigated for the risk of sexual abuse of my girlfriend's daughter only because of my association to her. But seriously, read all of it.

1367362887.0,24,self.legaladvice,1dfzk7,Texas: Aftermath of cleaning a hoarder's house,blackwolf555,30,6,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1dfzk7/texas_aftermath_of_cleaning_a_hoarders_house/,"A few days ago my friends and I helped clean out a hoarder's home. Our old high school friend's parents were out of town for the weekend and he wanted to clean his house. He had warned us and we did our best to prepare ourselves with supplies.

The first thing that hit us was the smell. For 10 years the carpet was bombarded with cat urine and feces. There was even a blood stain from a cat in heat or a cat that had a litter. The carpet was absolutely ruined and the Rug Doctor we rented did nothing. There were piles of stuff everywhere and barely a clear space to even sit. What furniture there was, was covered in a good layer of dust.

The kitchen was worse. The fridge was packed to the brim with expired food.  Not only was most of their 'food' expired but there is a major roach infestation. As we worked to uncover the floor, roaches fled to the closest shadows. Their feces litter the floor and cans of food. The pantry had shelves bowing under the weight and a door that couldn't close due to it's contents overflowing. Pots and pans are being stored inside the oven and washer and dryer. Their garage is piled high with boxes and they had a deep freezer that was blocked and filled with more 'food'.

The severity of the situation prompted us to invite over my roommate's friend who works in animal control since our friend owned cats and there were 22 strays living in the backyard (His mother actively fed them). He took note of the house's condition and the health of the cats. Drawing from his experience he told us that the house, if reported, could be declared condemned and the homeowners could face a citation for each cat that was on the property including the strays. He left shortly after due to having a prior engagement.

The things that were thrown out was trash. Papers from years gone by, sitting in boxes gathering dust, spoiled food, and items that no longer worked (they had five vacuums). It took two days and a mini-dumpster but we managed to ease the clutter and make the kitchen usable again (they could only use a crockpot, the microwave, and mostly ate fast food).

Despite all this, when his parents got home all heck broke loose. His mother did not understand or see how bad the situation had gotten and his father refused support.

My friend was trying to do the best thing for his family and called us for help. He especially thought that his father would support him. His father is asthmatic, aging, and has trouble moving around with his bad back and knees. My friend's own health is being affected as he's starting to develop a skin condition. They had each expressed wishes to clean up the mess, instead my friend found that his father sided with his mother who is a raging alcoholic (The loss of a loved one had greatly impacted her, sparking the hoarding). We assume he did this to appease his wife but his son and our friend is absolutely crushed. After a stream of verbal abuse he was unceremoniously kicked out. 

We understand that the residence needs to be reported to the city through the proper channels but we're trying to allow our friend to recover emotionally before his house before doing so.That night till present he has been receiving abusive texts from his family.

His mother initially wanted $5,000 from him to buy more food. The food that was two years expired, covered in roach feces, and practically inedible. Now his parents, want all who we're involved to collectively give them $10,000. They've even threatened us with trespassing!

Though we doubt they will actually pursue charges since that would mean inviting someone into their home, we are worried. We're young, money-strapped college students who were trying to do the best thing for a friend in need.   Do we face any legal consequences for our actions?

1374735755.0,23,self.legaladvice,1j0iet,"Bought my first house last year, and because the previous owner failed to disclose one problem it has costed tens of thousands of dollars.",dquizzle,28,5,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1j0iet/bought_my_first_house_last_year_and_because_the/,"I bought my first house last year in southwestern Illinois.  Earlier this year my basement flooded multiple times.  There was no sump pump installed when I moved in but the house inspector advised to install one in the sump pit.  I thought the first time the basement flooded was a result of the sump pump being hooked up to a pipe that I dug up and found was broke outside so all the water just kept building back up through the sump pit.  Well after a couple months of a hose going from my sump pit to my yard outside it was finally starting to get dry and we noticed that every time we flushed the toilet the sump pit would fill up.  Turns out the sewer line is connected to it and all of the ground water empties in to the sewer, which I was told is illegal in my county, but the house is old and I guess that's how they used to be built.  Turns out the sewer was clogged outside of the house.  

This is how I found out the sewer was clogged - I found some receipts from the previous owner to a plumbing company and they said that they had been out to this house multiple times in the past.  About every 6 months to a year they have to unclog roots that are growing through a crack in the pipe.  The plumber told me he recommended that the previous owner fix the pipe but he was selling the house and did not want to spend the money to fix it.  This happened after the 3rd time it flooded, and the 3rd time was bad.  I had to tear out all of the carpet from the finished part of it, and now a couple months later mold is visibly growing on the wall. It's inside the dry wall and it's in the insulation in the ceiling above the basement.  A guy came out and estimated that it would cost about $15,000 to clean up.  

Now in my contract to purchase the house, one of the questions specifically asks if the owner knows of any existing sewer problems or any other problems and he checked the box for ""no"" (blatant lie, right?), although he did check the box saying it has flooded in the past.  There is no way I can afford to pay $15,000 to remove the mold, not to mention the 10 - 15 grand to replace the carpet, dry wall, insulation, ruined furniture, and the sewer pipe outside.  And $400 apparently to test the air before and after the cleaning is done, possibly have to be tested more than twice.  I have about $3,500 in my name so I talked to a real estate lawyer about my options.  He said I had a very good case if I took the guy to court but he doesn't believe I would end up getting any money out of him - it was a long explanation involving the fact that his wife's name was not on the title to the house I bought but it is included in the title on their new house.  The previous owner seems to be well off, he just bought a house for about 300,000 and his loan was only about 260,000 or something (this is not cheap for southern Illinois).  My lawyer's best legal advice was for me to quit paying my mortgage until the bank takes the house back over.  After the bank sells the house, if they try to hold me liable for the difference in what they get and what I owe I would have to file bankruptcy.  This just seems so unfair that I could have to spend this much in damages on a house that I have not even owned for a full year yet because the previous owner lied about something on the contract and if he had just told me that a) the sewer is hooked up to a sump pit, since other plumbers said they had never in their lives seen a setup like that and b) told me the sewer line needs to have tree roots unclogged about every year, then this would have never happened.  


Other notes: 


- My lawyer told me not to mention to the bank that I was going to stop making my mortgage payments.  It seems like if I tell them they might be able to help me out, since it would be in their best interest for me to continue making the payments rather than take a way bigger loss themselves if they have to sell it as a foreclosure.  

- My insurance company does not cover mold damage, apparently common in this area among insurance companies.  

- I am paying someone to come by next week and test the air for mold and to take samples of the mold to see if it is dangerous to live here.  This isn't a problem I can just put off.  

**Thank you so much to anyone that tries to help me out!**

TLDR; Because the previous owner of my house blatantly lied on the contract to sell it and didn't mention that my sewer line needs to have tree roots removed about once per year, it is going to cost me close to $40,000 in damages that would be impossible for me to pay for.

Because I was only 21 at the time CPS took my daughter away and made me prove I was financially stable enough to care for her. During the year it took me to get things squared away with cps, my cousin who was about 55 at the time or so kept her for me. When I got my daughter back (no chargers were ever against me, I just had to go through protective parenting classes and family violence therapy to get over everything and learn from my mistakes in choosing a partner) my cousin was devistated that I was moving an hour away and to calm her I explained I would drive my daughter to her every weekend and let her keep her. I kept my promise. I drove the 4 hours a weekend to take her out there and back for 7 years. Almost every weekend. Also, the last 3 years I let my cousin have her for the summers. Since I work at night and it was easier for me anyway. Well this year my mother was living with me and came down with skin cancer and decided she didn't want to stay with me anymore and help me by staying home at night while I worked at night. It was December and school break was going on and I decided to let my mom move out and reach out to my cousin. I asked her if we could switch, for one semester, that my daughter would stay with me on the weekends, and out there on the weekdays, for 1 SEMESTER only. She agreed, and then told me the only way she could legally enroll her in school was if i signed joint custody over to her. We agreed we pretty much already had this so no biggie. I looked over the papers and signed them. Didn't notice it said ""every other weekend"" or that it never specified who got her for the summer. I signed my doom. After I signed giving her mon-fri everything changed. She said that my daughter needed more social outtings and that I was no longer a priority in her life. She started scheduling sleep overs and fun things for my kid (8 year old girl) to do every other weekend. Narrowing me down to a lowsy 4 days a month with  my daughter. In the last 4 months she's had my daughter i have bought a semi new car, rented a nice town home with a big room and extra play room, (have always her entire life provided medical insurance and done all the driving), got a great job pays 15 dollars an hour with tons of benefits and have everything perfectly in order for my daughter to come home just as I said I would. My cousin is a 62 year old millionaire that hasn't worked since the 70s. She married into wealth. I work hard in security have great work ethic always have and make about 27,000 a year. I am recently pregnant, i've been with my spouse for a year and he's a wonderful guy. He makes average income and is very excited about the baby. Together we have a great balanced schedule to care for both children. My cousin says the reason she won't give my daughter back is because she doesn't know ""this guy"" and that I can't handle having a baby and shouldn't have gotten pregnant. She says my daughter needs to go to the best schools and be around ""white"" children. My daughter is a quarter native american she's not even fully white! I'm not a bad person. I've done nothing wrong. My daughter has had lice 8 times in the last 4 months..basically the whole time she's been over there I'm the only one treating it every other weekend when I see her. I guess the white millionaire kids have lice. Go figure. What should I do? I know they say be peaceful, try to work it out on your own, don't involve lawyers unless you absolutely have to...So that's what I've been doing. I keep telling myself, give it a year. Prove to her how great my boyfriend is and try to convince myself that she just wants the best for my daughter. But I can't shake the feeling....that she has no intention no matter how well I'm doing of giving my child back. She tells me daughter she can't come back to live with me every time she asks. She doesn't say, ""not right now"", she just says, ""no"". She show cases my daughter like her own at community events, etc. She always wanted grandchildren and didn't end up with one anywhere near her hers lives 4 hours away. My daughter does not like living there and begs to come home every time she sees me. Is there anything I can do? I'm the only real parent, I have my life together fine, can I appeal our court order and get full custody back? This was a huge mistake and it's hurting my daughter and destroying me...

That can't be legal, can it now? We're looking in to getting a lawyer but the fact that the land management and broker are holding almost $4000 of our money is making it a little tight, so I figured I'd ask here first.

What happened is this: 

January: boyfriend and I find an apartment in a new building in Queens, see it, sign a lease with the broker stating that move-in is March 1st. Pay him a broker fee and the landlord 1st month + deposit. ARE SO EXCITED.

Late February: hear nothing from nobody, call to see when a good time to pick up the keys would be. Are told that we can't because there are delays and the building won't be ready til mid-March. Understandable. A week later that becomes April 1st. Still understandable (construction just wrapped up).

Late March: Haha! Now it's May 1st, guys. Now we're really pissed, but we have so much skin and time in the game that we decide to hold out. Stupid idea. Boyfriend has been making insane commutes to school, as I have been to work.

Late April: Haha, hahaha! June 1st. Closet inspections and then it will be fine. We check the Department of Buildings' records on the building and see that there are a ton of things to be signed; they assure us that's happening in one shot and it's just sign offs. Deep breaths.

Approx a week and a half ago: Broker says it's ready! Come pick up  the keys next week, they passed the inspections!
We call land management co. to ask for an updated lease with the real date and our keys. They say oh no, we're not ready! we have to have the plumbing and electrical inspected and we don't even know when! Aren't these fun, these games? We think they are fun. Are you not amused?

Today: Boyfriend goes to the office of the land management co and the broker is there too, coincidentally. When he asks for a full refund of our deposits and broker fee, they shake their hands in his face and tell him no, they're not doing that until they are able to rent the unit to someone else. 

Does anyone know roughly what our rights are? I was reading about the rules concerning delaying possession of a property in a rental agreement or more than 30 days = voided agreement. This would logically mean that they are behooved to give us our money back, wouldn't it? Please say it does?

EDIT/UPDATE: AND the broker is now trying to say his fee is non-refundable, even though we never moved in to the apartment he 'brokered' for us and he basically ignored us and pointed us to the management company whenever we asked him anything. I filed a BBB thing against him and he wrote that we just killed our (our?!) chance of him trying to rent out our unit, so basically explicitly threatening that we wouldn't get our money back because we complained that he's doing something blatantly illegal.

Heres a little recap:

I was traveling South on a highway crossing over another highway and had a green light. The lady who hit us ran the red light going east. After the impact my truck was facing North East.. she was going between 50 and 60 and did not hit the brake or swerve at all. There were 3 or 4 witnesses that attested to the same story.. My green light and her completely running her red.

My father was in my passenger seat which was virtually hit head on by the woman.

We were both wearing our seat belts and neither of us were seriously injured, although my pops did take an ambulance to the emergency room. At the hospital they took x-rays on both of us. Luckily our x-rays came back negative on broken bones, but I think he has a separated shoulder and may require surgery.. I will know more about that tomorrow after his orthopedic surgeon takes a look at him/the x-rays.

I am asking because it is our intent to sue the lady who I think got a DUI. Someone on the scene saw her doing the walk the line test and then shortly after did not see her around. I'm not sure if she has insurance but she drove a GMC Envoy Denali so I have my fingers crossed.

We own a condo in metro Detroit, Michigan. There have been non-stop water issues coming from the condo upstairs, six to be exact, since we purchased our home in 2009. 

This recent leak has caused the ceiling over our shower to crumble in (for the second time) and our association sent maintenance here to remove the wet drywall so that it can dry, whilst the upstairs neighbors have the plumbing fixed upstairs in a reasonable time frame. Here's [a before picture](https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/p480x480/943441_10151404906317096_438557970_n.jpg) and here's [an after picture](https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/p480x480/942839_10151405199812096_1848203402_n.jpg) of their work.

The upstairs condo was recently purchased (within the last month) and the gentleman seems to be a huge asshole. We've had little-to-no direct contact with him, as he is currently fixing up the unit for rental and not actually living in it. He was friendly enough to us, when he came to discuss the leak yesterday, but when our maintenance man told him today that he believes the pipes were messed with by the new owner and that he would be responsible for all costs that accrue from replacing our drywall, new owner went ballistic and hung up on him. New owner then proceeded to drive to our property management company's office and threaten lawsuit if they try to go after him for anything. So, basically, dude sounds like a bit of a loose cannon.

**TL;DR - the question:** While it's a huge inconvenience to us to have our bathroom all jacked up, the reason I'm posting this is because I noticed at around 4:30pm that there was a *light* coming from the hole in my ceiling. I poke my head behind the curtan, look up and see *my neighbors toilet*. There is a panel in the bathroom that can be unscrewed to reveal the pipes. Apparently either the owner, or whatever idiot plumber he called, decided that there was no need to screw this panel back on when they finished the work, even though you can see *DIRECTLY INTO MY TUB*. Considering his level of vengeance against the property company for simply informing him that if it's his fault, he needs to pay, I'm seriously thinking he might've left it open to just be a dickhead.

I called the property management and they were pretty upset about it. They told me they would contact the owner ASAP and tell him to get his ass over there to seal up the hole. It's been three hours, he hasn't come and from the way he's behaved thus far, he doesn't seem like the sort of person who has any interest in our discomfort or understandable annoyance. If this panel, which would take all of 60 seconds for someone to screw on, remains open for an extended period of time (say, 24/48 hours), is there anything we can do legally? I am not a fan of ""rocking the boat"" but opening up a fucking peephole into our shower, after flooding our fucking bathroom, and being a dick to everyone because you fucked up when trying to be a handy man ... well, let's just say we're pretty fucking frustrated.

They have admitted fault. Instead of paying or not paying, they avoid contact with me. What can I do?**

On May 13th, 2013, I took my car into the local Grease Lightning shop for a routine repair on a part they replaced. It is now May 21st--eight days later--and I still don't have my car back.

On April 12th my wife took our 2008 Toyota Corolla in for an oil change. The mechanic told her she needed badly needed a new serpentine belt and urged her to get it replaced as soon as possible. A couple weeks later, on April 26th, she took it in to have the belt replaced. She said all the mechanics were polite and professional. They showed her the old belt. she said it was in awful condition. For some inexplicable reason, they also gave her a ten dollar discount on the work they performed. They said if it made any noise to bring it back and they'd fix it.

Two weeks later it started squealing. Lightly at first, but getting longer and louder over the next few days. on May 13th I took the car into the shop to have the belt adjusted. The mechanic worked on it for 45 minutes while I sat in the car. At that point I got out of the car. The mechanic saw me and waved me over. He showed me the tensoner--the part that keeps the belt tight--and pointed out the hole on the part where it bolts to the engine block. He said the mechanic who replaced the belt broke off the bolt in the engine block and never said anything. Just let my wife drive away with a broken car. He said he couldn't get the bolt out with the tools he had on-hand and he would need to run to an auto parts store to get the right tool. I asked how long that would take. He said about 45 minutes to an hour. I asked if I could leave the car there and have my wife pick me up in our other car and would he call me when it was done? He said yes all of that was fine.

An hour before they closed I called them for a status. They said they still couldn't get the bolt out of the engine block. They hoped to have it fixed by closing. Closing comes and goes, and still no call. I call them. They say they are close. Forty-five minutes. Two hours later I call again. They say they have broken all their extractors and can't get the bolt out. They plan to take it to the dealer the next day. I say fine, I will contact you in the morning.

The next morning I contact them, and they have decided not to take the car to the dealer, but continue to try to fix it on their own. Every couple of hours I call for an update and it is always the same: forty-five minutes. This continues for another day and a half. Finally, on Wednesday, May 15th, I decide it is time to call the corporate office. I look up the number on their website and call. After two rings it goes to voice mail. No auto-attendant, no IVR, no options, nothing. I begin leaving a detailed voicemail message when, after 10 seconds, it cuts me off and goes to a busy signal. At that point I decide I need to get my car back, so I go down to the shop. There are two mechanics on duty, both very young, and although I was expecting resistance when I told them I wanted to car towed somewhere else, they both seemed very relieved.

I had the car towed to Dobbs, an auto service chain in our area. They initially said they needed to order a part and it would be saturday (May 18th) before they could get it fixed. So I wait two more days. On Saturday I call them and find out that the Grease Lightning district manager had been there trying to get my car back! After looking at it more closely, the mechanic at Dobbs actually refused to work on it, saying it was too damaged and needed deep engine work to get fixed.

The mechanics at Grease Lightning not only damaged my tensioner and broke off the bolt in the engine block, but when they finally got the bolt out, they ripped out all the threads in the block, making it impossible to put a new bolt back in. ""Mangled"" is the word they used.

I decide to have the car towed to the nearest Toyota dealer. That was late Saturday. I called the Toyota service center and they said they were about to close but, if the car was dropped off over the weekend, they'd get it in first thing Monday morning. That is what happened. When the service manager at Toyota called me Monday morning, I discover that the mechanics at Grease Lightning broke my car so bad--the service manager used the word ""mangled"" just like the guy at Dobbs--that they can't repair it, and it needs an entire new engine block. They quoted me a price of $6,000.

That was yesterday. I spoke to the district manager of Grease Lightning and he said he would submit everything to the company insurance to pay for the repair. I said if I didn't hear anything by 9 am the next day (May 21st--today) that I would call him. He said that would be perfect.

I've called him twice. He lets my call go to voicemail.
On their receipts, it states that if Grease Lightning damages your vehicle, they will gladly pay someone else to fix it if they have a chance to inspect it. I have a document stating Grease Lightning had my car for three days trying to repair it. This document is from Grease Lightning.

Grease Lightning severely damaged my car, and now it seems they are refusing to pay for the damages. In fact, they are now avoiding contact with me.

We have left three voicemails with the corporate office, as well as sent two emails via their ""Contact Us"" form. We have heard nothing back. 

Everything above this line I posted on the company's Facebook page today (the post has since been deleted). As a result of this, I received a call from someone in the marketing department. He said all of their corporate executives were out and some director had just quit. From him I got the email and phone number of the franchise owner in my area. I sent the above message in an email at 3:30 Central today and have heard nothing back from anyone at Grease Lightning.

It would be one thing if they flat out refused to pay, but instead they just don't communicate. Any thoughts on my best options at this point?",,False,self,t5_2rawz,False,,,True,t3_1esxzd,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1esxzd/mo_car_shop_causes_6000_worth_of_damage_to_my_car/,

However, they don't make everyone an employee because converting contractors to employees costs about $1000 and they would rather keep that money and hope to not get audited. 

Additionally, when it comes to payroll,  they expect me to send them an invoice instead of a time card. This invoice needs to include every hour of the week and what was done in that time. This ends up taking about two hours of my time every week and is redundant to what is in the job reports for each customer. 

Now I know that they want to know how my time was spent so that they can bill the customer accordingly, but if they look at job reports in the computer, this will tell them that information.

Last week I didn't submit an invoice that met their expectations and they have withheld my paycheck. I told them if there were any questions, they could look at the job report. They said they shouldn't have to because including it on my invoice is part of my job.

* Though there are aspects that aren't necessarily correct within the decision, I am satisfied with it and will go with this new direction. I took enjoyment in the notes in the footnotes.


* I also decided to post the Decision because there was a lot of confusion regarding why the Complaint was allowed into Federal Court. The Judge explains this.


* More or less this is just an update because there was a lot of insight and contribution in my previous post. I again thank you all, and as I said before, this discussion gave me new faith in the law and lawyers.  Well done. Ya'll were splendid.

The whole investigation seems odd.  He abruptly left work here to go to a huge chemical company, and has changed jobs again recently.  I *think* that the investigator was hired by the large chemical company which has a reputation for being legally active.

TL;DR:  How do I protect myself when being asked questions by an investigator?  I don't want to paint a rosy picture of a terrible person but I don't want to get into any legal tangles either.

Not an exciting query, but would appreciate insight.",buffalo442,27,7,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1jpzal/hotel_staff_taking_pictures_of_occupied_room_and/,"OK, probably a bit of an unusal (and boring) question here.  Will try to keep it as concise as possible.

I am working a 10 week internship this summer.  My employer is paying for us to stay in an extended stay hotel.  This is in the Cleveland, Ohio area.  The employer set up the lodging and payment.  They reserved the rooms in our names, and are paying for it.  I have a credit card on file for incidentials.  Myself and a roommate (employer doubled us up in rooms) are the guest names for the rooms.

Our rooms are naturally a bit messy.  Not dirty, not unsanitary.  Just a bit messy.  Clothes on the ground/backs of chairs, papers tossed all over the desk, etc.  It's a small room for two people and they only have one dresser, one closet, etc.  But that's not important except as background.

Anyway, the housekeeper apparently became upset with the condition (messiness) of several of the rooms.  This hotel provides basic housekeeping (changing sheets and towels) once a week.  Apparently, she complained to her manager that the rooms were too messy, and the manager came in and took pictures of the messy rooms and sent them to our employer.

My boss mentioned this today.  He doesn't care, and frankly he shouldn't.  But I'm a bit bothered by the fact that the hotel staff took pictures of our belongings and sent them to our employer.  The employer is paying for the rooms, but is not listed as a guest or anything.

So my question - are they legally allowed to do this?  I know they are allowed to enter at will - and expect them to do so for housekeeping, maintenance, etc.  But I'm bothered by the fact that they have photographed our personal belongings and sent those pictures to our employer.  That does not seem right to me, and I'm wondering if this is allowable.  We did not consent, nor have any reasonable reason to believe, that this would happen.

I won't be pursuing legal action either way.  But, we have a number of complaints about the hotel and this would just add to them, plus I'd like to tell the staff to stop.

We signed a lease and gave our deposits already (last march i believe). We already contacted the police and they are writing up a report as we speak, they said this report should be available next week sometime.
So we come in to our new house yesterday, and find that it has been abandoned/trashed. There are notices on the door saying that the previous tenants were evicted because they did not pay rent or utilities since may. Essentially everything is still there, it seemed like the previous tenants got up and left in a hurry (there was rotten moldy food on the stove). Also, the doors directly to the garage and the basement were broken into.
The basement is where the grow op happened, some equipment and such was still there (Police confirmed). The neighbors said there was mold in basement.
I would like to talk to property management today and try to break the contract without penalty. I would like to argue that, the house is a health hazard (mold), the fact that there were narcotics there is a health hazard or something, they didnt check the house for bed bugs, mold, damages, or even bother to clean it up like they stated in their contract. In addition, i am terrified for my life because i dont know what happened that made these people just get up and leave.

Essentially I would like to argue that it is uninhabitable in its current condition and thus the management company has breached the contract, giving us grounds to break the contract without penalty. I am still concerned with the deposit too. 

Any advice?

Me and my dog (a 2-year old border collie/aussie mix) were walking down the sidewalk, when two pit bulls charged us from someone's front yard and attacked my dog. The pit bulls were not on leashes or behind any kind of fence or enclosure; just left loose in their front yard which goes straight to the public sidewalk where my dog and I were walking. 

Myself and the owners of the pit bulls struggled with the dogfight for several minutes to finally get them separated. By the time they were separated, my dog had sustained some serious injuries (I have pictures, veterinary descriptions, and a hefty bill from the veterinarian). Their dogs were uninjured, as my dog couldn't fight back much. One of the owners of the pit bulls was bit on her forearm at some point in the struggle. It's unclear which dog bit her. She says my dog, I say hers. Obviously that's all just her word vs. mine; however, my dog is a non-violent breed and has never hurt anyone, and her dogs are the ones who attacked us in the street in the first place.

I was, fortunately, uninjured.

My questions:

1.) What legal route do I take to have the owners of the pit bull pay for the veterinary bills for my dog?

2.) Is there any legal route available to have the dogs removed from their (obviously incredibly irresponsible) owners?

3.) The owner of the pit bulls, who was bitten in the scuffle, is claiming that I am responsible for my dog biting her. I don't think my dog was even the one that bit her; but even if she was, do I have any legal responsibility for the bite, since it was her dogs that attacked us in the street, unprovoked?

Any advice would be appreciated.

His parents have wrongfully claimed him on their taxes every year anyways (partly his fault- he didn't know any better and trusted his parents). He has always owed money from his taxes and never received anything. He is still paying last years taxes. 

Okay, so the year of 2012 we moved down to TX so he could take a diesel course at school and we did ask his parents for minor help with bills the entire 8 months we were there. In total they helped us out with about $800. We assumed it was gifted as they never asked for us to return it and once even said not to worry about it, hell yeah, nice people right?! Yeah I thought so. Then we moved back to IL and he filed for himself because my mom helped him with his taxes and didn't see why he wouldn't claim himself, ya know? 

Anyways his parents just sent him a packet for amended taxes that he would have to pay $350 and his parents would get $5000. He would see none of that because that's what his parents ""deserve"" -his mom said. He, in no way, depended on her to live and he never lived in her house since 2010.

This is tax fraud isn't it? Can I possibly get him reimbursed with all the money they have stolen from him since he started school?

The bill came out to be $45.26, I hate having cash, so I decided to pay $35.26 + generous tip in cash and $10.00 on my debit/credit card. The check arrived and it clearly said $10.00 on it, I signed it and crossed out the tip area.


The next day (July 14) I checked my transaction report online to see that I was around $100.00 short of what I thought I had. At first I thought I just overspent on the steam sale, but when I looked at the individual transactions I noticed that there were two seperate charges that I had no idea where they came from.


The first was by IHOP directly for $45.26 (the price of the entire bill).
The second was by a seperate company name (withheld incase it's against some sort of rules) for $35.26 (difference between the $10.00 I wanted to pay and the $45.26 they charged me for)


So I assumed what happened was they mischarged me ($35.26 too much), tried to reverse it by adding the $35.26 back to my account, but instead of adding it to my account they charged me another $35.26


resulting in a total charge of $80.52 for a charge I approved of $10.00...
So the first time I called I was trying to be nice, I got someone at the front desk and they told me to call back in 15 minutes because their manager was on the line.


So I waited 15 minutes, and called back to get not the manger or anyone in charge of credit card transactions, but just the shift supervisor. So I told them what happened and they said they had no idea who (company name removed) was but they said they found my $10.00 signed bill and told me to call back the next day at a certain time to get an actual manager.
when I googled the company name, the first 5-6 results were all the IHOP that I went to, it turns out it is owned by this company


So I called back the next day and got the manager who said they would reimburse me both charges ($70.52) and not to worry. I checked today and see a reimbursement for only $35.00... This really got me upset because not only is it not the two charges ($70.52), it's not even equal to one of the charges ($35.26)...


I have no idea what to do. I don't want to call them screaming and look like an idiot, but at the same time I don't like getting conned like this, and I can't help but feel this is a con. I feel like they are just hoping I won't be bothered enough over the extra charges and they pocketed the cash themselves and charged my card full... Any help/ legalities would be greatly appreciated...


Thanks...


Not that it matters much but the tip was over 30%.

**The Long Version**
I'm primary. We have expanded standard as agreed upon in mediation. She told me she liked how we had weekend visitation in the schedule set in temporary orders so I agreed to let that continue (nothing in writing). She called saying she wanted to keep her visitation on my weekends but didn't want me getting visitation on her weekends. I didn't agree and she said its either her way, or no one gets weekend visitation. I said fine, no more weekend visitation. She got mad and told me all communication needs to go through her lawyer from now on. My son has pink eye and as per her being a joint managing conservator or whatever I am to inform her of such things.

It seems like such a waste of his time and I find it absurd and childish. Its their business, I guess, so I have sent him two emails, one yesterday about our son's health, and one today about how the daycare called and asked that I pick him up for health reasons (pink eye) and that I got an appointment. Now I would like to email him about what the dr. said and ask for her opinion on his treatment.

I do not drink. Ever. Not even a sip. I am, however, a somewhat shitty driver, because I am overly cautious on the road. I was recently pulled over on a highway while driving friends home from the bars at 2am. The officer told me that I was driving well below the speed limit, and changed lanes several times (drunk buddies kept changing their minds about where to exit for fast food).


Now, I do not blame the officer at all for being suspicious, as I am sure that my driving looked suspicious. He ran my license and plates, asked me if I had been drinking, and when I said that I do not drink, he told me not too drive so slow in the future and sent me on my way without a ticket or written warning. 


My question is this: if the officer had (understandably) asked me to do a field sobriety test or blow into a breathalyzer, would there have been any legal risk to consenting? As I said, I do not drink. However, I've heard that field tests can be subjective, and breathalyzers can give false positives. Assuming that they arrested me (either for a false positive, or refusing the field test/breathalyzer), a subsequent blood test would show a .00.  Would that result clear everything up? Is it better to just do the field test when you're pulled over? I'm just curious about the best course of action.

I looked up the shop online and verified via an online posting that was about a month old that he worked there.  On 5/2 I met up with him at the car rental agency and gave him my vehicle and a check made out to him for the amount of the estimate.

Several weeks pass by.  He has missed deadlines for when my car was supposed to be done.  He is my only point of contact until 5/21.  I contact the body shop directly and come to find out that this person was fired from the shop about 3 weeks ago, right around when I gave him my vehicle. 

I eventually had to track this person down to their home (or what I thought was their home address).  This happens on 5/24.  The last words I spoke to this individual on 5/24 was that I wanted my car and money back to have the work done elsewhere.

Because I showed up to what I thought was his residence (his grandmother answered) he is upset with this.  He has told me that I have 2 options.  I have him finish the work, and I give him the supplemental check or he returns my car and keeps the insurance money.  I find neither of these options acceptable.  The vehicle is not at this residence and I do not know where it may be.

I have gone to the police and they believe this to be a civil matter (despite the value of my vehicle being above the $7000 limit for small claims and the misrepresentation on the individuals end) and they cannot do anything.  I went and spoke to my town prosecutor on 5/28 and after explaining the story to him, he does not think my car can be held from me like this.  He makes a phone call to the individual asking how this can be resolved and not involving the courts.  I don't recall the entire voicemail he left, but I do recall the words mechanics lein mentioned.

Near as I can tell, this person is not a licensed business in my state.  In order to get a mechanics lein he would have to go to court as a business and file for one.   The prosecutor cannot act on anything until he hears the other side of the story, which I understand.

At this point, I am wondering what other options I should be looking into.  I'm a little dumbfounded that this is happening and to be honest a little distraught too.  I have told Progressive what has happened, and they haven't heard back from this guy as of yet either.  I also confirmed with Progressive that they supplemental adjustment was performed in the parking lot of the auto body shop, without the knowledge of the shop owner.  It would seem that this individual is defrauding the shop also.  They have been sympathetic to my situation and helpful in any way they can be at this point.

I would very much appreciate if anyone could provide me any bit of guidance that may result in the return of my car.  I feel like I've thought of everything I can do at this point and I am mentally exhausted.  I am hoping that someone out there could think of something I haven't thought of giving me that sort of ah-ha moment.

TIA.

[edit 1828]

I have already filed in small claims court for the amount of the check that I gave the individual.

[edit 1911]

I also did not sign a work authorization allowing for any work to be done to my vehicle.

Her boss takes the same week off every year for vacation and typically just requires the employees take their vacation at the same time.

However, this year he claims he cannot pay (seems he can't afford his expensive vacation this time?) but is still closing the office while he is gone. So this means my wife is unable to use her vacation time and unable to work due to closing of the office. 

My first question is if this is legal, as he is forcing her to take an unpaid week off. My wife has never had any form of warnings or write ups and is an excellent employee. She has been late only one time and has never missed a day of work aside from scheduled office holidays.

My second question is, he is also requiring them to work extra hours this week but is not providing extra compensation for this. Their typical workday is 8am-5pm so this would place her past 8 hours. The specific reason mention this is she is not paid on a typical model, she get's a ""day's rate"" and her weekly (4 work days) paychecks show her being paid at ""4 x Day Rate"". Can he still require her to work more than 8 hours? She is not a private contractor but receives no benefits.

Any advice you can give would be appreciated, him telling us on Tuesday the week before is really putting us in a bind as she has always worked the same 4 days every week since she started there 3 years ago.

1369334193.0,19,self.legaladvice,1ex3aa,At a restaurant servers have to pay the credit card fees on the total bill (not just their tip) - is this legal?,MarkFradl,24,5,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1ex3aa/at_a_restaurant_servers_have_to_pay_the_credit/,"Two restaurants in town are taking credit card fees out of server's tips and I was wondering if that is legal.

To be clear, they're not just taking the fees applicable to their tip (which is clearly legal) but for the entire bill. Another words, if the bill is $100 and the tip is $20 the employer is taking 2% of the entire $120, not just 2% of the $20.

I called Department of Labor (DOL)  and asked but the woman didn't seem to be all that knowledgeable, all she did was read the relevant passage from Fact Sheet #15: Tipped Employees Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and gave her interpretation - the passage is as follows:

""Where tips are charged on a credit card and the employer must pay the credit card company a percentage on each sale, the employer may pay the employee the tip, less that percentage. For example, where a credit card company charges an employer 3 percent on all sales charged to its credit service, the employer may pay the tipped employee 97 percent of the tips without violating the FLSA. ""

http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs15.htm

The woman at DOL said ""Oh, it says ""on each sale"" so they can make the server pay it all"" but I don't think that is right. To me that says you can only take the percentage applicable to the tip, not the entire sale (it says if the fee is 3% you can pay the server 97%, but in fact if you charge 3% of the entire check then in that example you'd be paying the employee only 88% of their tip (2% of the entire sale is $2.40, subtract that from the $20 tip and that leaves $17.60, which is 88%). Is that how you read it?

It might seem a small point, but the other night my friend had to pay $31 in credit card fees.

I also found the Department of Labor's more detailed Field Operations Handbook and the relevant section (30d05) is similar but I think even more clear:

""Where tips are charged on credit cards, WH will not question the reduction of the credit card tips paid over to the employee if the amount deducted is no greater than the percentage charged by the credit card company. For example when a credit card company charges an employee 5% on all sales charged to its credit service, the employer may pay the employee 95% of the tips without violating FLSA.""

http://www.dol.gov/whd/FOH/index.htm   (Chapter 30, specifically section 30d05 )

Any advice as to how I can get a definite answer to this? As I say, calling DOL didn't seem to help because she didn't seem to know the ACTUAL answer, she just gave her opinion.  Attorney General's office was no help, neither was Ohio Dept. of Commerce.  I wrote an email to DOL stating what I said above (in nicer language) and asking for an actual definite answer to the question and all I got was a stupid form letter about tipped employees and minimum wage.

I'm not trying to get the restaurants in trouble, and I don't wish to report them, I simply want them to stop doing this if they're not allowed.

Thanks!

EDIT:  Clarified an abbreviation and added the brief explanation of my intentions

UPDATE:  One of the restaurants was presented with the opinions that this action wasn't legal - they have stopped doing it and are refunding the money back to the servers.  Thanks for the assist, Reddit!

I pay for a tow truck to unstick him, and he takes off!",postposterous,25,5,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1enqt5/mover_gets_stuck_before_even_starting_the_job_i/,"I found a guy on Craigslist to help me move some furniture to my new place, ten miles away.  He has a two hour minimum, which was longer than we'd need, but that was fine.  It would cost $90.

We planned to meet at 5:30pm, at my old place.  I called to confirm at 4:30pm, emphasizing, as I had before, that this was my last possible day to get these things moved.  He reassured me he could be relied upon.

The guy finally shows up at 9:30pm.  It's completely dark. He's driving a massive 26 ft U-Haul truck, rather than his own truck that he advertises.  He says he has three hot tubs in the back to deliver, and that he'd heard things ""crashing around back there.""  Great.  But I was desperate, and just glad he was finally there.  

We left his truck on the street, and walked up the driveway so I could show him what had to go.  He confirmed it would be no problem.  He then proceeded to wedge his truck into the road trying to go up the driveway.  He was blocking half the street, and couldn't go forward or back.  Huge gouge in the road from the trailer hitch, back wheels spinning.  Liquid (not water) pouring out of the back of the truck, which he repeatedly declines to open. 

After 1.5 hrs trying to get him unstuck (me trying, him sitting in the cab, texting), a tow truck came along.  I thought dude had finally gotten smart and called them, but no, the tow truck was called by someone else, apparently.

The tow truck driver (and a random passer by who'd been helping) indicated there was no possibility of freeing the truck by any means other than to get hoisted out by a tow truck.  Seemed obviously true to me, too.  It was 11:30pm at this point.  Tow truck driver said it would cost $80.  Dude said he didn't have $80, but suggested no alternative.  We were blocking both the street, and the driveway of the home I needed to be gone from that night.

So finally, I said to the guy, ""Well, I was going to pay you $90 for the move, so $80 of it's just going to have to go to getting you unstuck.  I'm sorry, but it's not my fault you got the truck stuck....  So.... okay?""  He just mumbled something, so I said, ""These guys are saying there is NO alternative way to get out.  We've tried for over an hour.  What is your solution?  You can't just stay wedged into this driveway, blocking the road.  This is the only solution that any of us can think of.  So, $80 of your moving money is now going to this tow truck guy.""  We were all looking at him, and he just kind of mumbled.  The tow truck driver mentioned that the cost would rise to $140 if it took longer than a half hour, and he'd already been there 15 minutes.

So, I paid.  The tow truck quickly popped dude's giant truck out of the jam.  As he wrote me a receipt, I said to the mover, ""Why don't you just park out front, and we'll just carry all the stuff down the driveway to the truck.""  He nodded.  And then drove away.  This is noted on the tow truck receipt.

The next day, he finally responded to my texts, saying he hadn't agreed to anything, and that he'd still had an option to use his dad's AAA.  This guy (not the dad) OWNS this ""company,"" but he left behind his U-Haul contract, and obviously the dad had rented the truck, not him, so he probably didn't want to go that route because he shouldn't have been driving.

What should I/can I do?  He gouged the U-Haul truck -- I could report to them who was driving, etc.  I can badmouth him on Craigslist.  I can call the BBB and file a complaint.  Small claims court?  We definitely had an oral contract that he'd do the job and I'd pay him $90.

I wasn't even an employee!!,needhelp122,25,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1e7nxm/warrant_for_my_arrest_for_theft_of_service_i/,"I need a lot of help. Basically I have a warrant for my arrest because some employee of my mom's failed business believes me to be the boss of said business. My mother pretty much drove the business to the ground.

My part in all of this is that I passed out the checks for all the times, meaning I would drive to the sites and give them their check and listen to any questions or complaints. Never once did I say I was the boss, even the check itself is signed by my mother. And technically I wasn't even an employee, I never got paid a check or anything for that matter. 

BUT my father also worked there, he was like the manager and dealt with everything (my mother had no clue how to do anything), they are divorced so they don't have the same last name. I am named after my father so our identities get confused all of the time. I THINK my father told her that he was the boss and when he quit he told her I was the new boss, but I don't know, he refuses to talk to me for an unrelated situation.

On the last day I gave her her last paycheck and that was that. That SAME day she apparently filed a police report that I did not pay her and I was indeed the boss of the whole business. Somehow I was told that there was an investigation and I was indeed guilty(wut). So I have a theft of service charge on me for over 900 dollars (she only got paid 450). 

The only reason I found out about all of this is I was browsing online to see who had warrants in the city and my name showed up!! I called the courthouse to see what was going on and the lady pretty much told me off, saying how heartless I was to not pay this poor woman and I would be going to jail for a long time.

I asked my mother to see if she has any paper work to help me and she said that she just abandoned all the paperwork at the office when her rent was due(yeah that's right)

I plan to see a lawyer tomorrow but honestly I have no money, I live with my girlfriends parents and do odd jobs around the neighborhood for a few bucks. This whole time I've been sending in applications and I was denied, and it was all because I have this theft of service charge on my record, she tarnished my name! And to make matters worse I have a two month old baby and I can't even provide for her.

I only have about 200 dollars, my girlfriend said she would help me when she gets money in July but until then I have nothing. I don't think a lawyer will help me out unless I have the money. 

I was thinking of just turning myself in for that way I can get a free lawyer, but my girlfriend is against that, she says she needs help with that baby and I am diabetic.

So please any help? What should I do? Anything is welcome

",Drunken_Black_Belt,28,7,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/18c1en/company_forced_me_to_stay_through_snow_storm_did/,"Ok, long wall of text here, but I want to get all the details in here.  I work in Connecticut. Most if not all of you are aware of how bad the storm hit here.  I work as a security guard. In our contracts it states that inclement weather is not an excuse for missing a shift, as we should plan ahead for it. It is also stated that each site with have contingency plans for guards who can't leave work do to weather or natural disasters.  So I would 8-5 everyday, and my post is the only non 24 hr post on site.  If all the companies in the building are closed, I do not have to be in that day, as I am a concierge guard.  The contract also states that if your relief doesn't arrive, you have to stay at your post until someone relieves you. Meaning if the guy for the next shift doesn't show up, you have to stay. But that they can't make you work for more than two shifts in a row.

Ok, so Friday comes, one company is still open, but they close at 12.  I call my boss and tell him that all companies are closed, and I am going to go before the storm gets bad.  He informs me the 5-9 guard who comes in after me called out. Now we both work at the desk, however they are considered different posts. My post is to assist visitors to the companies here and monitor the lobby.  His post is to give out the cleaner's access cards at night, since the lobby is locked down to visitors.  So I argued with my boss a bit about how it's not the same post, and I have a sedan and needed to get home before the storm got bad, as I live in a hilly, wooded area.  He says I have to stay till 9.  But he told me he was coming back to drop of the night crew (11pm-7am) in his SUV, and that he could give me a ride home if I didn't mind waiting the two hours. I said fine and that I'd leave my car there and come back Sunday for it.  I should mention he used the company gas card on his own vehicle specifically because he told all the guards in an email he would be providing rides to and from work for those who couldn't make it in themselves.

So I stay for the shift. The 3 cleaners who showed up grabbed their access cards from our officer instead of the desk, were here for 30 minutes, and returned them. So I sat here doing nothing. 11PM rolls around, night crew comes in on their own. I text my manager to see if he is still providing rides are he stated in the emails he sent out. No response.  Our air mattress was ""misplaced"" several months ago.  And the mini fridge we had was taken by a guard who quit. So we have nowhere to store food for long periods of time, and nowhere to sleep. The only place we can sleep is in a ""Wellness Room"" provided by one company in the building. So I put on my hoodie and go to sleep there. The cot is old, torn up, and there are dirty tissues wadded up in the corner of the room. The pillow is yellow and covered in dirt. But I make the most of it. I wake in the morning from a phone call from my boss stating that the morning guards can't come in, asking if I can work till 3.  I say ok, I'm here anyway, give the plows a chance to do their work. I asked where he was last night, he said he forgot and didn't hear the phone ring.  

So I work another shift, not food available as the food given to us on friday has spoiled.  My eye starts bothering a bit, I figure I'm just tired.  3pm rolls around, relief comes, and I attempt to go home.  Two towns over the roads are completely blocked, no way to get to my place or any of my friends or relatives.  So I decide to get a hotel for the night.  At this point, my left eye is really irritating and watery.  Not normal for me at all. It's bloodshot and runny.  Sunday morning I wake up and go to the Walk in clinic. I have pink eye.  And its the eye on the side that I always sleep on.  So I get some eye drops and inform my boss.  He tells me I still have to come in on Monday as he doesn't have anyone to cover. I tell him I'm contagious till Tuesday. He says just to wipe everything down with clorox wipes.  At this point I still can't go anywhere since I'll give any friends I stay with pink eye, so I take the hotel room for another night.  

So between hotel room, food for the weekend, medical bills and medicine, I have spent over $450 this weekend because of the storm.  First thing I did when I came in this morning was alert site services about the cot situation. They said they would handle it. I then got in contact with my manager and HR about possibly compensation for my expenses.  I was informed that A.) It was my choice to get a hotel room B.) I should have planned to stay over  C.) It can't be proven I got the Pink Eye from the Cot, so they won't cover the medical expenses, and D.) The manager isn't obligated to provide rides to and from work.  

So what are my options here? I don't want to make a big issue, but $450 is a little less than a weeks pay, all because I was forced to stay .

My car was parked for less than an hour and it was towed. 

* I arrived at the shopping center and noon and left before 1PM. For this reason I thought my car was stolen so I called the police and came to write up a report. After the cop was about to leave after writing the report they were informed that it was towed.  

It was not parked illegally nor where there any other issues. I had to pay for my car to be released and I lost half of my day.


So I started to do some research and tried to figure out why my car was towed. I called the property management at the shopping center. 

* The shopping center consists of 6 small shops/restaurants and one large store that has locations all over CA NV and TX so there is a property manager that rents the store location space and deals with security and parking.

After talking to the property manager he informs me that the security company that authorized to tow my car is not the one that he works with nor does the tow company. He also let me know that they never tow during the day and only do it at night times. I talked to the manager at the large store and he knows nothing about the company that towed my car. 

So after calling the property manager for the shopping center he informs me that it looks like the **assistant manager** for the large store signed a contract with some security company to patrol the parking lots.  He said that he had no prior knowledge and he did not authorized this to happen. The property manager was some what outraged that they took it upon themselves to do this without his authorization. 

I have tried contacting the large company's corporate office and after being transferred about 20 times I have not been able to get a word with them. 

What should I do? How can I go about getting my money back since it wasnt cheap to get my car out of the tow company. 


Here is a copy of paper the person signed to have my car towed http://i.imgur.com/GMbukX4.jpg


I also have the time that was written on the the tow notice and the time I called the police to show how long the car was parked for.

I'm a hopeful college student trying to get my academic career back together so I took the summer off to work and raise money for a laptop and textbooks, so my priority here is getting paid by my employer.

I've worked for this company for close to two months now and only recieved one paycheck, and also signed a document that if I am fired any paycheck I am waiting for will be reduced to minimum wage for the hours worked - and there are a lot of hours and paychecks on the line.

I can't get too specific because I don't know what sort of mess I'm in. We steal city water all over the US, over 10,000 gallons a day. Our boss is fully aware of this and our crew supervisor directs us to do it and does it himself as well.

So - yup, that means I assist with this and I am pretty sure it is very against the law.

How would I report this without myself being charged for the crime? I have plenty of pictures and data, but I'm at a loss on what to do. I'd prefer to stay anonymous.

I managed a chain of computer repair shops in VT and NH for about 7 years.  I left that job about 20 months ago, and my successor created hundreds, if not thousands, of false repairs to computers made by the fruit company (you know the one...they make things with i in the name; i'm just phrasing this way to reduce its google footprint).  He was fired, and several of the techs I hired were fired as well, even though they were following orders from this jerk after I was gone.  I reached out to contacts at said fruit company recently to ensure nothing happened under my watch.

Turns out, during the transition from me to my replacement, we worked together, and he began doing bad things unbeknownst to me.  The response from top brass at the fruit company said I could never again work for them or anyone who sells their products.

I've been self employed since, and doing fine, even better than before - well, I'd sure love me some health insurance though!  But I'm in regular contact with other resellers and service providers, and consult for them all the time.  If fruit company knew this, my clients could face penalties or deauthorization to sell iThings.  So, now I can't have that consulting income and have to explain to clients what happened, which is quite embarrassing even though I've done nothing wrong.

So, I am considering taking this guy who replaced me to court.  I don't know where to start.  What, if anything, could he owe me for this royal ass plowing he's given me? 

**tl;dr** My replacement is a dishonest little shit and eliminated a big part of my income even though I did nothing wrong; what could I sue for?

1372282151.0,17,self.legaladvice,1h4wd9,I was told I'm being served tomorrow and my bank account is going to have a hold put on it. (Michigan),BrokenMasterpiece,20,3,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1h4wd9/i_was_told_im_being_served_tomorrow_and_my_bank/,"Backstory: In late 2008 I had a small overdraft on my checking account (Fifth Third) from my debit card. I didn't find out until a few days later after Fifth Third had already penalized my account over $100 in overdraft penalties. I was young, stupid and unable to pay the fees so I ignored it. Eventually the account closed when the fees hit over $500. 

Now: I got a voicemail yesterday from a blocked number that said I would be served on 6/27 and that if I had any questions I needed to call this 888 number and reference a claim number. I called the number and got the following information. 

Huntington Debt Holdings purchased my debt from Fifth Third. They were be legally represented by Sterling Asset (something) out of New York. I was told that as of midnight tonight any of my bank accounts would have a hold, including all assets, on them due to the inter bank Checksys(sp?) system. I already was unable to open a checking account for 4 years after the incident with Fifth Third. 

I told the person from Sterling that I would be at work at the time the person would show up at my house to serve me. She got very cold and threatened to contact my county and inform them that I would be dodging the summons and to show up at my work (I work 45 miles away in another county.) Also, I did not know this case/claim was even coming. I had no chance to arrange a payment plan to settle the issue. When I asked if I could do that she put me on hold, talked to the ""attorney"" and came back with ""We usually don't do this this far into the process but we can settle all debt if you pay $500 by midnight tonight."" I asked if there was any other option (I don't have that laying around) and was told no. 

Couple of notes: I've been very careful with this from the start as far as making sure it's legit and I still don't know. They had my address and the last 4 digits of my social. Also, when the summons person left me another voicemail today she referred to the make of my car. 

I don't know what to think, what my rights are or what I should do. 

Any advice is so helpful. I'm not in the greatest spot financially right now and I'm worried about my ability to pay my bills and also them showing up at my work to serve me. I can't take time off work to be here and wait for a summons to show up. 

UPDATE: I appreciate all the advice and opinions. This has been tough. I suffer from depression and anxiety. My anxiety is triggered at even the thought of negative confrontation and regardless of logic or common sense it's hard to come down from it. You guys have helped a lot. I got another voicemail today stating that I would be served at my home at 2pm and if I had any questions to call the claims department. I was at work and therefore didn't get served. I haven't heard anything back so I don't know what to think. If it is just them trying to scare me then it's a slow play. At this point I just want whatever is going to happen to happen.

So just today I was at the hardware store.  I parked my vehicle, and made my way across the crosswalk.  Then some jerk off in a pickup truck decided to speed through the intersection, nearly running over myself and a second person.  I jumped out of the car's way, and as he drove by I yelled, ""What the hell, you psycho!"" at his rolled down truck window.

Then the truck driver had the audacity to get out of his truck, and got in my face.  He started yelling a combination of, ""I DIDN'T SEE YOU"" and ""YOU WERE IN MY FUCKING WAY YOU HOMO"" (it was like he was caught between admitting fault and trying to save face in front of the crowd that had gathered.  It was bizarre.)

He kept getting in my face, and to my surprise some of the hardware store's employees got between us, then the truck driver jumped back into his truck then fled.

So, here's my question.  I know that physically defending yourself from an attacker can get sticky.  I'm a trained MMA fighter and I know that defending yourself is definitely a last resort thing to do.  But I'm confident that if the store employees didn't get involved (and if it wasn't broad daylight), he would've attacked me.  He was getting *way* to close for comfort.  In case anything like that happens again, how do you cover your legal ass after you've defended yourself from an attacker?  ie. are there specific things you should and shouldn't say when you're on the phone with the police?

What are my options?!,SOFUCKINGANGRYHERE,26,6,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1e17rn/16f_fl_looking_for_information_on_emancipation/," I am currently living in a really unstable environment. My 30 year old, ex-military brother lives on our couch in our 2 bedroom trailer and my mother is an alcoholic who is letting her alcoholic habbits consume her life. She and my brother have been extremely verbally abusive toward me for the past 5 years and nothing is changing.
 
I am in therapy now because of my depleating mental health status and have been sleeping 13 hours a day. I am not allowed to leave the house, or take walks. My grades are suffering from the stress I have to endure at home. Along with the verbal abuse, I feel physically threatened living in the same house as my brother. He has made comments about slitting people's throats for no reason and he constantly puts thoughts into my mother's head that I am sneaking out at night, hiding things from them and not trying to do well in school. He tries to convince her that I am a drug addict and an alcoholic.
 
The basic things that I need (deoderant, toothpaste, feminine products, underwear, etc.) are not being provided. My mother refuses to spend any of her money on me to get the basic essentials that I need. I had to fight my ass off just to be able to see a therapist. My parent has no intrest in the things that are best for me and does not care about my hygeine or mental health. She mainly wants me here to do the house work. My brother does no housework and leaves chef boyardee cans laying on the floor in front of the couch until they start growingthings in them. The house (if you can call it that) is absolutely disgusting and she doesn't even try to clean up, they leave it to me to clean their mess, then tell me i'm a terrible child if I don't clean it exactly how they would like it done.
 
I am developing terrible panic attacks and I can't take it here much longer, I am looking to get emancipated as easily and as quickly as possible. I do not have a job yet but I am working my ass off to find SOME source of income so I can at least save up to skip out of town if I can't get emancipated. I am so grateful to have a roof over my head but my mental health should not be at risk in my own home. I would rather work two, even three jobs   than live here and be put down and made to feel worhtless everyday of my young life. I don't want to feel like the mother of the house when I am only 16 and trying to juggle everything all at once. 
 I know about petitioning the court, and talking to somebody, but I don't understand how to approach the situation and how to talk to my mother about this. Any advice on ways to get emancipated and make it as easily as possible would be greatly appreciated.

When the dog was exiting my car from the driver's side with the trainer holding him by the leash, for no apparent reason, the trainer straight up kicked the dog in the face, like you'd kick a football off a tee. None of us who saw it happen saw the dog do anything to deserve this, but that is irrelevant anyways. You can't do that shit. The dog calmly laid down with a poor look on his face as the trainer said something to him. 

They resumed walking around to the K9 vehicle. I couldn't see the dog because they were on the other side, but I could see the trainer wailing on the dog with his toy, a tennis ball on a rope, once again for no apparent reason. Everyone who saw this happening kinda looked at each other like, wtf, but nothing came of it.

Is this normal for drug dog trainers to do? Regardless of the answer, it is inhumane to do that. It would be different if he flicked the dog on the nose or gave him a little tap to correct something he was not supposed to do, but no evidence of that existed. 

I didn't think to get his badge number, but I should have. I'll be talking with my aunt, who manages CAD (Computer Aided Dispatching) about this sometime soon and I'll see what kind of civil actions I could take against this atrocity.

He made it clear to me that these dogs are **extremely** aggressive, and will bite even their trainers, and that sometimes they have to be put into their place, or something bad may happen. 

He reviewed the footage from the squad car that could see my car, where the incident happened, but unfortunately my friend was leaning on the hood in the way of the camera, so he couldn't see what actually happened.

He told me that these trainers love their dogs, and they literally are their best friends. When the dogs retire, 90% of them are adopted by the trainers. It would be totally out of character for a trainer to beat the dog because he did not find anything in my car. He may have done what he did because the dog tried to nip at him, chase a car, a person, or another animal that was walking by. But with the information I gave him, it was clear that the trainer used excessive force in punishing the patrol dog. 

We've submitted a formal inquiry to open an investigation, as well as a citizen's observance statement. They will go to the commander, and he will directly speak with the trainer about what happened. Hopefully he tells the truth.

Thanks for the help everyone, I'm glad I got this taken care of. I told the guy that I'd like to be updated with what happened in the case, so I'll give you all that information when it gets to me.

Here's the story: 

So we were in bed when we heard a weird hissing sound from the bathroom and I ran to check. Strong water coming out under the sink. Apartment was flooding very quickly and we were trying to contact the after-hour maintenance number. They said they can't say how long help will arrive. We decide to call a plumber. First one did not pick up. Second one said they do not have authority to come in the apartment. Call back the after-hour help and said they will dispatch someone and to just wait. 

We're on the 3rd floor. 2nd floor tenant came in to ask about the leak and decided to help out. 1st floor tenant come up and helped too, they later call firemen. We were all scooping water and trying to stop the pressured stream of water. 

Got a callback and said that they need $300 to send someone over. I give credit card thinking apartment will reimburse me since it is after-hour help and office is closed. 

Firemen came and can't stop leak. took sink out and toilet. They asked for another truck to come in and they decide to find where main valve is (in a locked access room) and turn it off. They help suck up water from the carpet and left because there is nothing left to do but wait for maintenance.

Maintenance guy came and plumber at same time. Plumber check damage and list that pipe is broken and needs new fittings. Plumber asked maintenance guy if he will put sink and toilet back or if plumber will, maintenance said to do it because it's too hard for him.

Plumber said he can't start unless he gets a signature. Maintenance said to talk to manager about bill in the morning. So we sign it. All fixed now.

We talk to manager in the morning and she said regional seniors won't reimburse because plumber was not allowed to enter premises in the first place and that we signed the form. Maintenance guy should be the one putting back sink and toilet back and replacing valves and pipes. We tell her that **their maintenance guy was the one who asked plumber to do all this job in the first place.** 

Turns out that the plumber who came in is the first plumber we call that no one picked up. They just returned our call and out of panic, we thought it was the dispatch team. And apparently, plumbers cannot come to apartments unless authorized by landlord.

Manager said she will fight for us and talk to corporate during their meeting on Monday. BUT what if we can't get money back. Can we sue? Or is it our loss?

Edit: I should mention that we never touch the under sink valves. They were made of plastic, not metal.

I just had a run-in with the same deputy, who somehow didn't recognize me, and he was VERY aggressive and intimidating, though I had done nothing wrong, and had no truffles in my possession anyway.  He threatened me vaguely, while repeating multiple times that ""truffling is illegal""... which it clearly is not nor has ever been.

1) I have absolutely no income.  I gave up work to be a stay-at-home mom to our two children while my husband works 16 hour shifts at his salaried job.

2) Everything is in his name.  The house, the cars, all bills.  Everything.

3) I'm divorcing because earlier this year my husband told me he had fallen in love with another woman and left to live with her and her children.  I will ask for child support and spousal support until I obtain employment.

4) The original agreement was he would continue to have his paycheck deposited into our joint account so I could pay the mortgage and bills on our house while I stayed here with our children.  He has lately been withdrawing funds leaving us short and hungry.  I fear being on the streets but cannot get government assistance while married to him as he earns too much.

My questions are, and I would be happy to review websites if you can point me in the right direction, as follows.

1) Divorce or separation?  It sounds like separation would still entitle me to his health insurance through work.  Would separation prevent me from collecting government assistance?  Things like rent vouchers or daycare for the kids when I can get a job is what I'm most concerned about.

2) Who pays?  He refuses to discuss separation or divorce with me.  Having no income myself, I'm trying to do this as cheaply as possible for my own sake.  Can I file and somehow have him pay?  If he refuses to cooperate, can I hire an attorney or mediator and sue him for legal fees?

I think those are the two biggest questions I'm having difficulties finding answers to.  I'm still searching the internet about pro-bono lawyers in Ohio.

Here's the long story (posted on askreddit but got deleted I think) and TL;DR at the end:

My laptop was stolen last september. I reported it to the police, followed up. They somewhat refused to help because the original report was put down as ""lost"" not stolen (even though my report stub says ""grand larceny).

The person who had it tried to use the computer's applecare (which I later cancelled and was partially refunded). To do this though they had to give information to Apple. I spoke to an applecare rep who told me he could not give *me* the information but if the police contacted them and used the case number they gave me, they might be able to help (he never specified how).

Fastforward to yesterday I got an email from the genius bar confirming my appointment for this weekend and an Apple store curiously near where my laptop was ""lost"". I went to said apple store yesterday to ask about what I could do/how did this email come to me. I was told they could not get involved because the person might have bought this laptop from someone else which is very possible. That I should go to the police and see what they can do.

The store manager I spoke to also told me I shouldn't show up at the store at the specified time because she didn't want **me** to get in legal trouble.

That said, it's still **my property** which is going to be there and they will know which laptop it is because they'll have the serial number.

**TL;DR:** My laptop was stolen, I know it's going to be at a specific store and when. Store said they can't help. What can I do?

Any help is appreciated

----------------------

**UPDATE:**

1. I have not given up on the police.
2. I am going to the store's precinct this afternoon with my report stub from september and laptop's info.
3. I will not confront anyone on my own.
4. I am grateful for the help/advice.
5. If I was not willing to consider going to the police and/or was crazy/unreasonable I wouldn't be asking for advice before acting, now would I?

I have a problem where I could benefit from the advice of a political science/administration of justice expert.

The story so far:
I have a German flag displayed in the bedroom window of my condominium and the Home Owner's Association is demanding that I take it down. I received letters warning about my ""unapproved window treatment"" and the looming recurring fines if I do not comply. I called their office and met with the board of directors and made clear that I have no intention of moving the flag, but they are standing firm pointing to their CC&amp;R rules which state their authority to arbitrarily approve or disapprove of curtains and prohibit the display of flags. During the meeting, one of the members of the board said he finds the flag offensive because he fought in World War 2 against the nazis. He also interrupted me at one point yelling ""Move out!"" I got a second warning letter after the meeting and so I drafted and mailed a Cease and Desist letter outlining my legal right to display the flag from my window and requested a signed response from the association. Today I got a response, but it was not a promise to stop the harassment, it was a notice of their intent to fine as well as a second letter asking about ""my intentions"" for some potted plants I have in my front yard. This second letter appears to be a subtle threat of increased scrutiny as punishment for defiance.

I surveyed the complex and found several other window curtains of various colors and patterns - rainbows, reds, blues, stained glass mosaics, bamboo mats, etc. There was a curtain which looks similar to the German flag (horizontal bars of different colors) and the homeowner had heard nothing of it. There was even another flag! A torn Jamaican flag with a superimposed illustration of Bob Marley smoking a joint. It has become clear to me that the veteran was responsible for writing the violation not just because it is a flag, or its an aesthetically unpleasing color, but because it is a German flag.

Sure, as some have suggested, I could just take down the flag and be done with this whole thing, but what type of pitiful man would disgrace their self and their fatherland by complying with such demand of prostration? Not the same type of man who would display a national flag. I have told them I would take the flag down if they could prove they have the authority to enforce these rules; anyone can just write any rule they want, but that does not make it legally enforceable.

What I know from my research:
The Davis-Sterling Common Interest Development Act (link 1) protects the rights of citizens to display non-commercial signs and flags within reasonable size and safety limits. The governing documents (CC&amp;R) cited to fine me are therefore illegal and invalid according to California Civil Code §1353.6 (link 2).

What I need:
Since they apparently ignored my cease and desist letter, I need to know the correct course of action moving forward. Should I act passive and let them try to enforce their illegal rules? or should I aggressively prosecute them for discrimination and harassment? How do I get a legally enforceable Cease and Desist Order?

Other info:
It is a modern German flag, not a swastika. I have no sympathy for the veteran's disapproval as Germany is a NATO ally. It is a great insult to project his hatred for the nazis upon the German people.
I have spoken to many neighbors and no one has any objection to the flag. Most didn't even notice it as its on the second story facing away from the street.
The flag has been flying in that window now for at least 10 years.
I am a U.S. Citizen of German descent. I live in California.
My uncle owns the condo, he is my landlord. I do not have his sympathy or support.

Edit: Thanks for the discussion so far about whether or not I should defend myself, but these comments have contributed nothing I have not already considered. The advice I am looking for is the process of enforcing the law when it is broken in this manner. Unless you assume the removal of the flag as an impossibility, then your comments are not productive.

Update 7/22/2013:

People must now solely use personal credit for business and travel expenses.  The problem is that now the company has gone into 30+ days expense reimbursement and paychecks are now in arrears.  This was once paychecks current and expenses reimbursed every 2 weeks.  It was nice.

Do most companies do this?  That is - require their sales, marketing, accounting, etc., personnel to front company expenses?  Not just travel related, but operating, trade show, office supplies, etc.  

I was asked to pay for several thousand dollars (`$6K) in expenses for the marketing department on my personal credit card that was not related to sales travel.   That's leveraging my credit and putting me at risk for something that should be a company operating expense and is part of their budget.

I think it is wrong, however if the company were to make reimbursement within 15 days as to keep employees from incurring finance and interest penalties it could ever so slightly be tolerated.  But the employees are still on the hook....

Being hit with interest penalties if not paid in full before the next billing cycle....with expense reimbursement taking a month at least, why should the employee' be hit with a several hundred dollar finance penalty?  

I feel like we are now loaning the company money/credit at no risk or financial penalty to the company.  The amount of money we're talking about could easily result in $100-500 or more in monthly finance charges. 

I'd like to charge my company interest for borrowing money from me and utilizing my credit as their own.

To date, I still have not received wages.",ImNotAPersonAnymore,20,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1dx1e1/mcdonalds_lost_my_paycheck_to_date_i_still_have/,"I live in California and work at McDonald's (I hope this isn't considered too ""personally identifiable""). In February I showed up a few days after ""payday"" to pick up my paycheck. Two different managers, B and S, looked everywhere for it but couldn't find it. They told me I had to wait until the store manager came back from vacation. A week later the store manager came back, looked everywhere for my paycheck, couldn't find it, and called payroll. Payroll informed her that the check had been cashed, so she asked them to send a copy of the cashed check (and told me that if I'm trying to cash the same check twice, it's not going to work, and i'm going to get caught. I was very offended by this). 

10 days later, a copy of the cashed check arrived and the signature is a blatant forgery. They even sent a copy of a different paycheck with my real signature to compare it with. I asked her what the next step was and she told me I had to sign an affidavit stating that the check is forgery. I didn't have a problem with this EXCEPT that two notarized copies were required and I couldn't find anyplace to notarize for free. This irked me greatly--why should *I* have to pay a notarization fee ($10.00 x 2 = $20.00)  when McDonald's is the one who mishandled my paycheck? (The paychecks had been kept at the bottom of one of the front cash register drawers to make it easier to hand out when employees showed up for them--all employees essentially had access to the checks at all times, especially the employee working on that cash register. Since my paycheck was stolen they now keep the paychecks in the safe in the manager's office.) The store manager told me she couldn't just take $20.00 out of the safe to pay for my notarization fee, and at this point gave me the phone number to payroll so I could deal with them myself.

Long story short, I was highly offended by the affidavit process but paid $26.36 to get my affidavit notarized and mailed to them, even though it was through NO FAULT of my own that McDonald's was negligent in storing my paycheck until I could pick it up. So upsetting to me! I don't have a lot of money and need every penny of it. I ask for my paycheck and they tell me I must pay money to receive it. Insanity.

I mailed the notarized affidavit to them via certified mail with return receipt. They received it on March 25. It is now May 7 and I STILL have not been paid.

Exasperated, I went to the labor board and filed a claim for unpaid wages. A conference has been set for later this month.

My first question is, am I entitled to any penalty, interest, etc. because they failed to pay me on time (or at all)? It has been almost 3 months since I showed up to get my paycheck and they told me they couldn't find it. Granted, 2 weeks of that was me refusing to pay to get my affidavit notarized, but it still seems like an incredible length of time. The store manager for her part was extremely unhelpful; sat on it for several weeks, would say ""oh shit"" every time I reminded her I needed my paycheck. 

My second question is, if I decided to file a claim in small claims court to recover my $26.35 notarization fees + postage for that bullshit affidavit process, what are my odds of winning, based on the facts of this case? I know it's kind of david vs. goliath but I can't fathom how any reasonable-minded person wouldn't see that I have been treated unfairly. If it weren't for the fact I went to the labor board I don't think I would be ever getting paid at all.

This has been a frustrating nightmare for me. Any insight/advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time in reading all of this.

**EDIT**: Thank you SO MUCH for all the help. Here is some more relevant info:

When a crew member receives his paycheck he must initial his name on a sheet of paper (to show he received it). When my paycheck came back clearly forged, I begged my favorite manager to please find the sheet of paper crew members initialed re: that paycheck period so I could have a copy of it. She told me she had already looked for it but could not find it. I'm not sure what to make of that but she also told me ""nobody here thinks that you received your paycheck."" She was the one who told me that since the store keys are virtually always left lying around someplace in the open, passed around amongst employees to restock the bathrooms or open the back doors, etc., that essentially any employee could have unlocked that cash register drawer and taken it.

**EDIT 2**: Well, McDonald's has finally made me whole. After 77 days I finally got my paycheck a week after I filed a wage claim at the labor board. At the labor board conference the McDonald's representative offered to pay me an extra $50.00 to cover the fees I incurred to prove I was entitled to my paycheck. She did a good job of apologizing for everything. Thank you for taking the time to look at my situation and offer advice.

What now?


---

I was attacked by my sister nearly two months ago. She has mental problems and I am her caretaker. She went off her medication, got paranoid, and choked me to unconsciousness. This was not her first time attacking me and the local PD had been called in before - I am on a first name basis with most of them. They know to come right away when I call.

Before the attack she was stomping around screaming and I knew she was about to get violent. She had taken my cellphone, and we live out in the middle of nowhere, so I sneakily opened up my laptop and used Skype to call emergency services. I had to put the laptop on mute, but I dialed the number for emergency dispatch and when my sister left the room, I said ""Please help, I need help at [my address] right away.""

About half an hour passed and nothing happened - I snuck a peek and saw that the call had been disconnected - so I tried again, the exact same call, the same words. Another 45 minutes and no police had arrived. I tried a 3rd time, and she caught me, and then started choking me.

When I regained consciousness she had left the house. I quickly connected my laptop (she had thrown it on the floor, but it still worked once I reconnected the battery), took it off mute, and called dispatch again. I gave my address, the dispatcher asked what my emergency was, and I told them I had been attacked and that I needed help immediately. I stayed on the line with the dispatcher until police arrived.

The officer was someone I knew. He did not believe I had been choked, as I ""was not bruised enough"". (A medical student later told me that not all strangulation leaves bruises) He advised me he would not be including the attack in his report because it would ""embarrass"" me. He did look for my sister and when she was found a little ways away she verbally harassed him and was arrested for that (charged with ""breach of the peace""), then taken to a hospital for mental treatment.

**The thing is, I have an accessory on Skype that automatically records the conversations. I had completely forgotten about it.**

Now I know that when I called the dispatcher the first three times, he hung up on me. He clearly heard me give my address and say that I needed help, asked me for my name, and when I didn't answer, he said, ""whatever"" AND HUNG UP ON AN EMERGENCY CALL. THREE DAMN TIMES.

If he had just held on to the line the third time a little bit longer, he could have heard me being attacked, which (because my side of the line was still recording) is CLEARLY audible.

So now I have a dilemma. Are there any legal repercussions for the dispatcher who hung up on me multiple times, or for the officer who refused to take down my statement? Or would there have been, if I had discovered the audio file sooner?

When he stopped by my house to let me know this, he indicated that he wants his backyard fenced in, but kind of left it open-ended about what we should do.

What is she entitled to?,snn1626,21,4,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1jjabv/dads_new_crazy_wife_what_is_she_entitled_to/,"Thanks for taking the time to read this, just hoping to get a few answers for my dad (completely computer illiterate, the man has ""huntin' and peckin'"" down to a science). We live in northern Indiana, and I know that Indiana only grants an annulment for a few reasons, none of which apply to my dad's situation. 

My dad and mom have been separated, then divorced for a few years now. Most of this time, my dad's live in girlfriend (now new crazy wife- NCW) has lived in my dad's house, the one he and my mom purchased together. 

My dad married NCW in December of last year and claimed her and one or both of her two children on his 2012 tax returns. NCW does not have a job, does not leave the house, does not clean, does not grocery shop, does not do anything a normal, functioning adult does. She has never held a job, just uses her child support to 'pay' for things, even though her online shopping (gotta love that QVC) pretty much cancels out any money she would contribute to the running of the household. 

My dad does not have legal custody of her two children, or anything to really do with them at all. NCW cheats on my dad with her ex-husband. She frequently wakes him in the middle of the night by punching him and screaming at him and doing other NCW things that are normal for her because she is able to sleep all day and not have to worry about it. She physically and emotionally abuses my dad, who would never hit her back, or any other woman, because she's crazy enough to immediately call the police to get him arrested for defending himself (that's not how the police will see it, we all know this). She has chased away all of my dads friends and family, won't allow him to get a second job and uses any money left after THEIR bills, that HE pays, to pay off HER credit card after buying crap online. 

They own no property together, I don't believe that her name is on any of the utilities, but I could be wrong. I'm pretty sure her name is possibly just on her car (if they still have it) and likely his car, but I'm not 100% sure on this. I know they have a joint bank account. 

My dad has had enough, he wants out of this marriage, but is afraid that she will take him for all he is worth, which really isn't much at all. That's why he cannot afford a lawyer to discuss this with. 

My plea to you lovely redditors at /r/legaladvice is advice about how he can escape from NCW with his property still intact. Is she entitled to anything? Especially his house, considering that she had nothing to do with acquiring it? Along with any funds, she has not held a job for more then 2 weeks for this entire period, and that was only like 1-2 jobs that she just quit because she 'can't handle it'. 

I know Indiana does not have alimony laws, thankfully. NCW is convinced that my dad should leave HIS house and continue to pay her bills so she can live there and not have to actually get a job and provider for herself or her demon spawn. Or pay for an apartment for her to live in.

During my visit I was handed a single form, which I filled out in its entirety. Upon being treated I left without being asked for any more information and then was never contacted in any way regarding billing, so I assumed that I had given my insurance information on the form and everything had been covered. 

June of 2013 I checked my credit score and noticed a strange company listed--I looked it up and it turned out to be a debt collector, who also had never tried to contact me. They informed me that I owe $1600 even though I was never contacted or given an official bill. Not only could they not provide an original bill, they couldn't provide me with the original hospital I saw. They claimed the hospital hadn't had enough information to contact me, even though I filled out the only form that I was given. If that form didn't have enough information, why wasn't I given a more comprehensive form so that the hospital would have the appropriate amount of information?

According to the collections agency, the hospital had turned the bill to collections on 1/11/12, which is about a month and a half after my visit. I didn't think they could put a bill in collections so quickly, I thought they had to wait a certain amount of time before doing so. 

Do I have any legal grounds to fight the bill? I don't even live in Indiana anymore, I'm in Arizona, which was my forwarding address at my college so if they had sent something there I still would have gotten it.

According to the collectors there was no insurance information filed, so they billed me as uninsured. My insurance company would have easily covered the visit, but I'm sure it's much too late to file a claim with them now.

Thankfully our names were only in a small group on facebook, not in some of his more egregious posts, though I've received threats of litigation for ""stalking"" and ""invasion of privacy"" from some of the people in that group now. If it matters, the posts are (or were) public, and I took a screenshot before they were pulled down.

Currently his accusations against me are not showing up easily on google, but this is a concern because I am a teacher, and I'm concerned that it might make job searches more difficult.

Is there anything we can request of the judge to put a stop to this? Do I need to get my own lawyer (or pay hers) to send him a cease and desist or work towards defamation or something?  

Since he's ""judgment proof"", I don't want money, I just want him to go away. Will the judge even consider any of this in her next battle for modification? (Already scheduled for injuries to child, not providing information per court order)

**Background**
The back story is really long, but I'm going to leave out a lot of the details. The very short background summary is I've been friends with a woman (we'll call her Abby) who has slowly lost control of her life and has become incredibly unstable financially and emotionally, and is basically falling apart.

**The Legal Situation**
Recently she found a living situation where an older man would give her a place to sleep, feed her, and give her gas money, in exchange for cleaning/running his house and who knows what else. That seemed much better to her than paying rent with money that she didn't have so she asked me to help her sublet her apartment. I kept saying I didn't want to because I was trying to distance myself from her but she begged and then I agreed to do it for a finders fee. I found some folks off craigslist who were willing to pay her rent+$200 extra per month. I took the first $200 and gave her their contact info and everything. I didn't get their last names or emergency contact info or anything, but figured she would. I'm not the leasing agent, I'm just the one who made her house look pretty and took pictures and posted it up on craigslist.

Anyway they paid the first month in full but now it's the second month and I guess they haven't paid her, nor are they responding to her calls. She went and checked up on the apartment and I'm not sure if they're still there or if they bailed. 

Now she is threatening to sue me (and them I guess) since I was the original contact with these people, showed them the house, explained the rules, etc. I gave her their phone numbers, gave her their email, gave her the last name that I am aware of, but that's all the info I had. I never gave them a contract. All I established with them was a verbal agreement and then passed them on to my Abby. It was never clear between Abby and I what my responsibilities of being the finder were, but *I am not a leasing agent or a property manager*, and I was just helping my friend find some folks to sublet. 

**The Harassment**
I've been on vacation for three weeks and shit has really hit the fan. 

* She is texting me dozens of times a day sending me really awful things, insulting my character and insulting everything I do. I have asked her multiple times to please stop contacting me. I have tried ignoring her. Neither of these work. I have a stupid iphone and it won't let me block numbers. I don't know what to do and I'm on vacation!!! I want to enjoy my family without my phone going off like crazy! And I can't leave my phone at home because that's what other family members are doing to escape work calls, etc, and my folks have requested I keep my phone on me so that if we split up in groups, that both groups have a phone. Anyway, the last thing I texted her a few minutes ago was an explanation that I've given her all the info of that I had, and then I requested yet again that she stop contacting me. I also said if she's really going to sue, then any further contact from her needs to be through her lawyer.

* My dog is with a pet sitter while out of town. Abby has been harassing the pet sitter trying to get my dog. She started doing this before shit hit the fan, btw. I think she was trying to steal my dog to hold hostage or something. 

* Abby is best friends with another psycho girl (Cate) who is my boyfriend's roommate. My boyfriend has already given Cate her 30 day's notice to GTFO but legal action might have to be taken there to actually get her out. Abby is not allowed in my boyfriend's house anymore but she sneaks in anyway when he's not home (they have memorized his work schedule). We are really worried that she is going to steal things or plan something violent, but unfortunately Cate has not paid her rent for two months now, and my boyfriend is SOL financially because of it and can't even afford to get the locks changed. 

**Solutions?**

* Does Abby have a case against me? She obviously has a case against the tenants who aren't paying, but can she touch me legally? Even if she does try to sue me but has no case, am I going to have to shell out for a lawyer and all that shit?

* What can I do to stop the harassment? I don't want the texts, I am scared for my dog, and I am scared for my boyfriend and his house.

1372720372.0,16,self.legaladvice,1hgjp0,[NY] My friend is being kicked out of her apartment for looking at other places.,ZombieHomeslice,17,1,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1hgjp0/ny_my_friend_is_being_kicked_out_of_her_apartment/,"She and I have been looking to be roommates for a couple years now and had been casually looking around.

She began renting her current place in April of this year on a 1 year lease. Immediately she noticed that the downstairs neighbors spend all hours of the night shouting at each other, keeping her up at night. She tried asking them to keep it down, and when that didn't work, went to the landlord, who stated that they'd been there much longer and that it was my friend's problem to deal with. She informed him that she probably wasn't going to be able to stay there with the noise, and he said he'd let her leave as long as she gave thirty days notice.

So we looked for apartments. Currently we're waiting to hear back on a rental for the 15th. My friend was just going to take the hit with the two week crossover. Over the last month or so she's left him numerous voicemails stating her intention to move out soon, but he hasn't answered or returned her calls.

Today I got a call from her saying she spoke with her landlord. Turns out our potential landlord called him for a reference. The current landlord stated that he told the potential one that my friend never said anything about her intention to move and said she hadn't paid her rent since the first month (she has records of each month's rent checks, sent and cashed).

He then stated 'Guess I screwed that up for you, huh?'

In addition, he's now giving *her* 'thirty days' but has said he's listing it on craigslist today and she has to be out as soon as he rents it. In his words, 'probably in a week.'

To be clear, we're supposed to be hearing 'yay or nay' from the prospective landlords in the next couple days. We do not have the apartment, and we have not signed a lease. She does not have a place to go either way, seeing as even if we get the apartment, it's not until the 15th.

I understand he definitely can't just kick her out at his whim, but I want to be sure she goes through the appropriate steps so that this doesn't bite her in the ass down the road. What does she need to do to protect herself? Is she in the clear to just tell him he can wait until she's good and ready to leave?

EDIT: Just checked, the apartment *is* listed for rent on craigslist. My friend has already paid for the month of July.

EDIT2: Thanks for the help so far guys. It's looking like we haven't got the new apartment (have not heard back, and it's re-listed) so she definitely has no place to go until probably August, if we can find another place by then.

The cops then say ""because you aren't able to provide identification, we have the legal right to search your bags (purses)"". And proceeded to dig through their bags.

In this message was his first and last name, that his packages had been shipped to him, the number of packages, the shipping date and the arrival date.  At first, it was only one or two, and I ignored it.  But as the semester went on, it got up to 4 or 5 times a week, then nothing.  This 4 or 5 times a week has repeated a few times a month since then, totaling around 5 calls some months, more than 25 others.  Every single time they called, I was in a class, so they just left a message.  I think I've actually picked up on them live only once, and they immediately hung up on me.  They were either calling for Bill to ask a question and ask for a call back, or to say that packages were on their way.  I use Google Voice for my voicemails, so I have a copy of every one of them.

I have never been a customer of this company, and it is indeed a legit company as far as I can tell.  I don't know how the rules work in this sub, but I'm more than willing to share the company name.  They have no social media presence, so public shaming isn't an option.  I am on the Do Not Call list, but because they aren't marketing anything I've been told it doesn't count.

The company says that he must have misplaced a number when putting his in, and that he will eventually figure it out.  It's been over a year, and he obviously hasn't.  They always tell me that it's impossible for them to look up someone by name and number alone, so they cannot change it or even figure out who Bill is.

I just really want them to stop calling.  It's become nuts.  There's no reason for them to not just be able to take my phone number off.  I'd really like to not have to change my number.

Throughout that time we've had to deal with her ex on various issues from child support to his recurring threats of physical harm.  His new rant is that she committed adultery when we first started dating and that she is committing bigamy by being married to me.  His reasoning is that they lived together for years and that makes them common-law married.  I think I have a decent understanding of the Texas Family Code, but I'm no legal expert.  It's my understanding that common-law only concerns common-shared property, such as money, housing, furniture, etc.  He claims that he has spoken to an attorney that has told him that's not true and that they would have to get a divorce for us to be legally married.  I feel that all of this is false.  This only comes up when he gets angry about child support or decides he doesn't like that I am the primary supporter of his children (ironic but true).  Just to indulge the off chance that any of it may be true, here are some various facts:  
  
They were never married via license in Texas or any other state.  

She never represented herself as his wife, or used his last name. 
 
While they did live together throughout the years, they (or he) was not monogamous and he often left to live elsewhere for months at a time.  

During the time when they both resided together (and the time frame he claims the common-law marriage), he fathered a child with another woman (proven by DNA testing).  

It has been more than two years since the last time they lived in the some home.  

He has made no claim in those two years attempting to recover any property she may have still had when they split (property bought by either of them when they lived together).

We just moved into this duplex a month ago. Three weeks after the initial move into the place I started getting bit. We shrugged it off as mosquito bites. Night after night this was happening but we couldn't figure it out, my spouse told me it couldn't be bed bugs because he had a friend who dealt with it and he didn't see signs.

Until we caught one!!!!

Now we've learned we have this horrible problem, we talked to the neighbor and she said the previous tenants complained about them and I'm just astonished at how this went untreated! 

We informed the landlord but he's very passive. He just came in and sprayed some OTC bug spray and apologized. We've been asking him to get an exterminator, now it seems like he's ignoring us.

I called someone this morning and they said treatments start at $2000! 

As of now, I feel extremely overwhelmed just thinking about this. We can't move unless all of our stuff is treated, and I don't know how much is damaged.

I was looking up tenant/landlord laws in Florida, and it says the Landlord is responsible for maintaining the place, and if I write a letter to him saying I want to withhold rent until the problem is fixed I am able to withhold it.

Apparently he no longer wishes to be married . He claims he doesn't want the same things from life as I do anymore.He no longer wants kids, or to buy a house together, all he wants is to come home and watch TV and relax. He doesn't want to have to worry about someone else. He misses the bachelor life basically.

Needless to say I am crushed. I asked him if we could work it out and he said no. I would like to try to make this work, but I am not going to beg someone to stay with me when they clearly don't want to. We live in the state of Florida and have no kids. We have yet to file any paperwork for the divorce and have talked about how we would split things up and for the most part agree on everything. I will be taking the majority of the furniture because most of it was given to us by my parents. He will be taking most of the electronics, because frankly they mean more to him than me.

We would like to dissolve the marriage as painlessly as possible. Getting a lawyer would be incredibly expensive and I'm not sure I could afford one. He makes more than double what I make a year, and life is about to become a lot harder on me. He has agreed to give me a 2,000 down payment for a car, seeing as we only have one. I will in turn take my name off the title of our current car so that his name will be the only one of the title. I should be able to get nicer, newer car with my credit and get the payments down to something I can afford, unlike our old car.

He has agreed to pay to break the lease on our apartment, he will be moving in with a buddy of his. He has also agreed to give me $500 for start up money, and will be helping me with my bills for a bit until I can get a better paying job. There is no way I could live on the money I make now, so getting a better paying job is not optional. We are going to put all of this in writing to make it legally binding. I guess my question is whether or not this sounds like a good deal, or if I am entitled to more.

Everyone I have talked to including parents and friends all seem to think he is low-balling me, because he makes so much more than me. Also I should mention that before we were married he had over $7,000 of debt that I helped him pay off during the course of our marriage. I was helping him make payments on it way before he had a good job, and we were both working 40 plus hours at minimum wage. I never persued a better paying job because the one I have now has excellant health coverage, and is much cheaper than it would be through his job. He is a diabetic and needs high health coverage. I had mentioned I would like to go back to school multiple times to him but he always shot the idea down because it would cost too much. So instead I did everything I could to help him further his career, assuming if I did then someday we would be able to afford the house and kids we had always talked about.  I Now I feel like I helped him pay off his debt, get a better paying job and now he is dropping me. Yes he is giving more than 3,000 dollars to help me get started, but 2,000 is going towards a car...which is probably about what I have put into our current car that we have both been making payments on now that I think about it. I'm not sure what to do, should I take the money and run? Or should I ask for more. Is he being fair, or am I just being greedy. Any input would be helpful. Thanks.

After disgussing it with the guy who picked them up, we decided to report it monday as assault. (she wrecked 50% of my apartment on her way out while i were pushing her).

They felt the girl were a lying bitch and they realised that i dident do shit pretty early, so after 3-4 hours of questioning and medical checks and so on i were released.

A few years ago, I attended some classes with DeVry University, after extensive talks (more like sales pitches) to convince me that their classes were reputable and noteworthy. I immediately could tell there was a severe lack of quality to their education, and received no challenge from them at all. It was a joke, and so I dropped out, especially once I realized that no reputable business would accept a degree from DeVry. This is also about the time that I realized their tuition fees were exceedingly more expensive than previously stated in our conversations. (~2,000 turned into over 5,000). 

Years later, I have now recently been contacted by a CA working for DeVry. They notified me (without verifying my identity) that I was ‘already approved for wage garnishments’ and they would begin soon. However, I have, to date, not received a single court summons, certified mail, or document related to this, at all. They have resorted to calling me at work, interrupting my daily activities. 


I feel they are not entitled to a cent, as their classes were not by any means satisfactory. I have heard of a “Excuse of Performance” defense being used successfully against them on these grounds, but as I have not been summoned to court by them, I don’t know how I can pursue it. I have also heard of numerous class-action-lawsuits against them for these same reasons, but the most recent I could find was one from 2011, and a mention of one started by the Federal Government against them, but nowhere have I found a way to contribute. 


In short, I’m stuck. My family is finally getting out of years of hardship, I finally have a career, and we’re finally getting married this year. For once, in 8 years, we are on our feet. Now DeVry is trying to step in to take my hard-earned money, that they don’t deserve. What can I do, what options do I have, and where can I turn?

I'm 23 and I'm how you say, an idiot.

So I got rear-ended and attempted to sue the person. I didn't file a police report. I got an ambulance-chaser (one of the back of the paper personal injury attorneys).

The other party denied all liability. The case got tied up. My lawyer stopped communicating.

I tried several times to contact her. She basically ignored me. Finally I threatened to file a grievance with the state bar association and she threatened to drop my case.

I got mad. I filed a grievance. Now she's trying to subpoena me.

There is a section in my state's RCW that says (I'm paraphrasing): ""A lawyer has a duty to provide reply to his or her client in a timely fashion"".

I have several emails I sent requesting updates. She simply ignored them for months. 

Is it likely she will be able to win a lawsuit against me for the services rendered. She has dropped my case and is trying to sue me for the expenses she incurred before dropping it. However I think she is in breach of my state's RCW on Attorney Conduct.

If she did win a lawsuit can she garnish my wages? I'm making less than $1600 a month and I'm a college student.

1374346542.0,16,self.legaladvice,1ipi1r,[USA] What happens if a lender cannot provide the original promissory notes for a Student Loan?,cocononos,20,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1ipi1r/usa_what_happens_if_a_lender_cannot_provide_the/,"I have private and federal loans from 2002 that were originally with Sallie Mae.  To try and make this short, there  was a series of shady and fraudulent issues that ended up causing 2 loans to go into default and eventually assigned to other companies. (The others were paid off)  It was continually transferred and Basically it became a total mess because I was making payments to one company all along, and because they would transfer companies with no notice (and still take my payments) I had no idea. And the other companies had no record of my payments and would add their own fees. So now I have 3 separate companies trying to collect 3 different inflated amounts on the same loans.

 I contacted them saying I required the original signed promissory note as well as a total account history (payments, fees, transfers etc) so I could see what the heck was actually owed and to who.

They sent me some 2 page document titled promissory note from 2010 from a company I had never worked with before that contains no amount, interest rates or terms. It just says i agree i owe money. its weird. It has my signature but I never signed it and the date isn't even in my handwriting. It looks like its intended to accompany the original promissory note but without it, there is no info on the actual amount of the debt.

So I tell them this isn't enough. She says the burden of proof is on me, that they do not have any of the original paperwork anymore because its been transferred and that the document they sent it sufficient legal validation of the debt and that the amount owed shows on my statement and they don't need to validate it because the statement is enough.

I know they can't hold me responsible for a dollar amount they have no record of? If this is true then any lender can lose paperwork, make up any amount and you have to pay it?  I agree I owe the loan but due to the mishandling of my payments, unexplained fees, and 10 year period of time I have no clue what I now owe and am simply asking for something that I can work with to figure it out.

If I borrowed any money from any other source and consolidated or refinanced you can  be sure the new paperwork would be just as, if not more involved than the original.  I don't see how they can lose your original documents.

How I can fairly pay this off without validation. What are my legal options at this point?

I work as a security guard in an office building. One night last week a couple of carpet cleaners came in asking to be let into an office, stating they were here to clean carpets for one of our tennants. Normally, I would check our binder of work orders to make sure they were authorized to work, which I did, but this time somehow happened to miss the corresponding work order. Thus I told the carpet cleaners I couldn't give them access until I contacted building management, as is policy. I called building management, but no one picked up the phone, so I told the carpet cleaners they'd have to wait until I got a response. They responded that they didn't have time to wait around and left the site.

The next day I come to work and my supervisor shows me where the work order I missed was, and says that its likely the carpet cleaners will be charging the tennant for arriving on site, which tennant may very well send the bill to us at security for failing to allow them access when the proper paperwork was submitted.

Now my supervisor wants me to sign something saying I am personally liable for any financial repercussions my mistake may have made. Is this legal? What are my options here?

I went to my primary care doctor who referred me to a pain management doctor.  I worked with him getting cortisone shots and doing PT, but the pain kept growing.  I had been unable to work for 7 months now.

He finally suggested that I have surgery and referred me to a surgeon. He ordered an MRI as and after looking it over decided that my best option was to put a wedge between the slipped discs and then screw it all together using brackets.

After the surgery, there was never any pain relief. When I would tell the surgeon at post-op visits he would always say, ""you'll be fine."" I developed a post-op wound infection of MRSA and had to have a PICC line for about 4 months.  They found later that the infection was caused by a sub-dermal suture.  

I lost feeling in the back of my legs and also in my most private area (my husband hates this the most)  I was told that would be temporary, but it's been over 2 years and still nothing.

I finally got to a new surgeon who looked at my old MRI and ordered a new one.  He said that I have Degenerative Disc Disease and it was clear even in the first MRI.  He said the first surgeon shouldn't have done that type of surgery for a condition that is degenerative.  He also mentioned that the first surgery done Haas's a very high failure rate and most surgeons don't do it anymore.

When I had the second surgery, they found pieces of the ""cage"" previously installed, floating near my spine.  That doctor removed them, removed the black discs and then fused the vertebrae together there.

I healed well from that surgery and would have gone back to work, but my husband and I moved out of state, with all of the expense from time off work and surgery costs, we had to downsize. We went from California to Washington State. 

Another unfortunate side effect from the first surgeon's blunder, I was taking oxy-contin for what was supposed to be a limited time, but since the pain never decreased, I was prescribed them for almost 2.5 years. One day I realized that I was completely addicted! I know it sounds lame, but I really didn't think that I would be prescribed something so long that would hurt me so bad.  To be honest, I don't know much about drug use.

It was only this last week that I detoxed off of oxy-contin and on my own.... It was the hardest thing I've ever done.  I'm still feeling its affects on my body.  

I just think that if my first surgeon had really looked at my MRI that this whole mess would have been much less.  I don't want to be the person to sue a doctor, but I really do think he was negligent at his job.

(FL) (x-post from /r/rbi),imbeingstalkedhelp,22,5,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1g9njq/im_being_stalked_what_do_i_do_fl_xpost_from_rrbi/,"Hi. I was told to come here by the nice people at /r/rbi. Here's my story:

I'm an immigrant to the U.S. and I met my future-husband in 2006 and we got hitched in 2010. After we got married, I received a conditional green card (must stay married for 5 years or revoked). Fast forward to early 2012, things were not going so well between us so we mutually agreed to separate (not divorce) for the time being. We both needed time to decide what the future of ""us"" would be. My husband used his separation time to get a girlfriend, so in turn, I got a boyfriend.

I joined a dating site in early 2013, met a guy (we'll call him Al), hooked up a few times, and then due to my unresolved past, he decided to end things with me.

Fast forward to April. Al randomly texts me professing his love and desire to be with me forever. At this point, I had already moved on from my fling and was not interested in his advances. One morning, when I walked outside of my apartment, I noticed my car tires were slashed, and my license plate stolen. Ironically enough, I get a call the very same morning from Al inquiring how I'm doing, etc. I explain I'm not doing so well due to the car, and he offers his help with my car. Being a damsel in distress, I accept his offer to help me with my car trouble, filing a police report, etc. Because I was very stressed, he offered to take me to lunch, and later offers to come back to my place and cuddle until I calm down. So we end up hooking up again.

After our casual hook up, Al kept texting me non-stop, professing his love for me, and ignoring my requests to be left alone (I didn't want a relationship). One day, I received a 5 page letter addressed to the U.S. Immigration Department, in detail, outlining numerous false accusations stating my initial marriage was bullshit (fraud/federal crime). Although false, these accusations could lead to me being deported and my husband being sent to federal prison. The conditions he offered for not sending the letter would be for me to date him and have a family with him. Although I could prove these allegations are false, it would cost a lot of money, time, etc. and I don't really want to make more trouble for myself (i.e. my husband and I are separated. I don't want the govt. looking into it anyways). Al also told me that if he couldn't have me, no one in this country (U.S.) could have me.

As days went by and I didn't respond to his threats, he started to verbally threaten me, saying it didn't matter if I moved away to a different county, state, or country, he would always follow me until I agreed to his conditions. He would randomly come to my apartment and sit on the doorstep awaiting my arrival. He would post things on my social media accounts, tag me in creepy pictures, message me with threats, the most threatening one being he would follow me until one of ""us"" dies.

Around this point, I began to realize that my car tires were probably were not just some random act of vandalism. This also made me realize that if Al was capable of vandalizing my car, he was capable/serious of causing me a great amount of trouble with the immigration department. Everyday, I grew more paranoid because throughout the day I would receive non-stop text messages from him accusing me of lying to him (in general) and telling me he knew where I was at that exact time. More paranoia sets in and even when driving on the interstate, I couldn't stop looking around me out of fear he was following me. Taking my friend's advice, I ended up going to the police and getting the documentation needed for a restraining order. I filled it out and turned it in.

The next day, I was surprised to find the police at my door telling me to grab my stuff and I was being admitted to a mental institution (in handcuffs) because Al went to the police and told them I was stalking them, and I was probably going to go the police station and file a complaint against him. In turn, Al got a restraining order against me, telling the police everything he did to me I did to him. Another surprise was that the person who handed me the restraining order papers handed me the wrong papers and the restraining order was never filed. On top of all this, Al told the police I was unstable and was threatening to commit suicide. As it is in many states, accusations like this are not taken lightly and when the police came and got me from my apartment, I was taken to the mental institution (in handcuffs) for a 72 hour psych-evaluation.

When I got out today, I was contacted by my supervisor at work informing me that a resignation letter in my name had been turned in saying that I'm resigning from my current position because of my mental illness. Even more, Al informed me I should expect for my colleagues to receive photoshopped pictures of my naked self. Despite my ""stalking of Al,"" he has continued to message me on my social media accounts telling me to put everything he has done in the past and begs me to start a family with him.

I've had to re-do my restraining order paperwork, so the police report is pending and I'm gathering evidence for my meeting with the lawyer tomorrow.

* Upon coming to pick up my car, there was significant damage to the front end, as if they had rammed it into a wall.
* The valet guy tried to get me into my car without noticing the damage but I did. Unfortunately, I had already returned my valet stub to him by then, but didn't take my keys back before I noticed the damage. I couldn't get my stub back.
* Valet guys are claiming the damage was there when I brought my car in, but it wasn't.
* I called the cops, they came, but they didn't take a report and said it was a civil matter, not criminal.
* After arguing for an hour with the valet guys and the restaurant to show me video footage they claimed existed that showed the damage was there when I brought the car in, they showed me a grainy video that I would say showed there's no damage when I came in, but it's very low res and someone could argue it's inconclusive.
* This footage was the restaurant's surveillance system, and they claim the video is deleted after 7 days.
* I could not get them to give me a copy of the video.
* There is another business in the same parking structure with their own cameras that would show the area, and the restaurant claims that the other cameras are higher quality, but they were closed at the time.
* The valet guy said he was going to go to the other business tomorrow morning to look at the video.
* I am concerned they are going to delete it.
* The valet guy wouldn't give me any contact information beyond a first name and cell phone number. I could not verify any of the info.

i took as much video and photo evidence of everything i could before touching my car.

I reported the incidence to my insurance, they opened a claim but they may not be helping out. I will probably have to go after these people without them.

To give some background here:

I am a certified Foster Parent in Oregon.

I have no criminal background.

My home has been deemed safe through multiple state workers.

Due to me being a foster parent, I am a mandatory reporter.



So here is what happened:
One of my older sister came to visit with her boyfriend and their son, I saw no issues with them as parents other than the normal ""first time parent"" issues, and they listened when I gave them advice, as I have two of my own and have fostered as well.

Another older sister of ours started becoming involved, as sister A hadn't been around for years. When sister B became involved things started to become problematic. She stirred stress and lied on multiple occasions, causing sister A to think I had stated on no uncertain terms that I was going to call child services on her (I have no intention of doing so as i do not feel that her son is in danger). Also during this time sister A and her significant other seperated although he and I remain friends. These two points led to some serious trust issues on sister A's part and sister B began harassing me, and attempting to blackmail me by saying she would call child services on me if I did not cut off all contact to sister A's now ex, which I have no reason to do.

I have no reason to worry about the threat of calling child services, so that is of no concern, but she continues to tell people that I am threatening to contact child services in regards to sister A, even though I have had no contact with sister B since February. She is using this to attempt to control sister A's parenting methods (sister B has had trouble with child services many times due to improper parenting with her first two, although this was more than ten years ago when I was a teen).

I personally feel due to her aggressive nature that she is a threat to my family's well being, as well as sister A's child and sister A herself, as sister B has been jailed for assault before and also on drug related charges.

These were put under my name in December, and since that has happened one of my roommates has yet to pay me a cent for his share of the utilities. 

I want to take him to small claims court over the backpay he owes me, but I don't know what kind of paperwork/evidence I would need, or if I can even manage a case. We have no written or signed agreement stating that it is expected for each person to pay their share to the utility payer, but it is understood among all of us that this is the case and has been made very clear verbally.

Would statements from each of the other roommates be solid enough or would I need more?

Additional information: I live in Oakland, CA. The amount of money they owe me will be over $400 if they don't pay this months share. Said roommate has also skipped out on the water bill several times but that one isn't under my name. I don't know what else to add.

Within seconds of sitting down, she was handed a letter termination. It doesn't state any reasons for dismissal and offer 4 weeks severance and an extra 500$ for career counselling. Her position was filled with a what we thought was a temp employee when she left. The position above her became vacant soon after she left, this job and her job were then combined from our knowledge and the 'temp' employee has this position now. This happened about nine months ago.

They stated it was this or they would have done it the first week she came back. Vocally stated they are downsizing, however the severance package does not mention that.

It is extremely hard to find daycare where we live and finally found one and have already been paying for 2 months, obviously have to continue as she will need to work and will find something and can't give it up. We are frustrated mainly as they probably knew 9 months ago about the firing and could have a job lined up now.

She was with the company for 3 years and we have not signed the severance offer. We are in Saskatchewan, Canada if that helps as I know laws differ province to province.

Just to give you the story. My boyfriend has a 13 month lease from August 1st 2012 - August 28th 2013 for his studio. However he is planning on moving in with me and we needed a bigger apartment. We asked her if she has a bigger place that we could rent from her, and transfer the lease over from June 1st. She showed us a 2bedroom that we loved and agreed to take it. However, the last minute she gave the 2 bedroom to someone else and left us without a place. We found another apartment and signed a lease from June 1st.

Because his lease goes until August, my boyfriend has been showing the studio and has found several people who will sublease it from him (we have email proof). However, the landlady has rejected all of them, including an African American guy because she is racist. 

Yesterday she came in with a guy Jon, who could take the studio from July. She wanted my boyfriend to split the June rent with Jon. Although this is completely unfair on her part because we have 6 people willing to take the studio from June 1st, he agreed through an email to avoid any issues.She had Jon sign a lease from July.

13 hours ago, she responded positively to his accepting the terms. She said she felt he was the best choice for this apartment and she would return my boyfriend's security deposit when he moved out June 15th.

Fast forward to this morning, this is the email he has (the bold parts are my responses to her claims)

""Max,  

You broke 3 rules in my lease. 

1.  You broke New Brunswick City's C.O. for one person residence having Pretti. **(My name is Preeti. I have my own place but spend the night or weekends at his place. She has had no problem with me in the past and has even come over just to talk sometimes)**

2.  You are breaking the lease. **(We have email communication from her agreeing to release us from the lease if we can transfer it to someone else)**

3.  You brought the dog against all the odds.  I am under NJ State Rooming and Boarding Supervision. **(We are fostering a tripod dog. We emailed her asking her permission before bringing our dog home. We have email confirmation from her saying she is fine with it)**

 I won't put up with your idiosyncrasy and want you to move out as fast as you can.  You know I was putting up with yous for 9 months.  I am so disappointed with you.  You know you are disrespecting your neighbors crowding your room with Pretti and dog. **(There have been no complaints from any of the other tenants.)**

Pest control guy came Wed. and complained about the dog.  The dog will attract more bugs!!!!! **(she had a bed bug problem she didn't fix and they traveled down to his studio. She allowed the pest control guy into his apartment without any prior notice. She is constantly letting people into his studio or coming in without our permission or giving us notice)**

I am so pissed at you.  Move out or I will take you to court for this matter.  I resent what you are doing to me.  I will call NJ Social Service and Animal Control if you don't get rid of the dog. **(bitch threatened my dog. I will kick her ass)**

 I will even send the letter to your company. **(Does this qualify as a threat or defamation)**
Respect the lease you signed.""

We feel that she is doing this just to withhold his security deposit and charge him $1000 fine for ""breaking his lease."" We do have emails from another tenant who said that the landlady did the same thing to her.

We couldn't pay the full amount as it was much more than expected. 

8 months later and we can finally pay, after paying $250/mos to keep it in storage with them because we couldn't meet their original estimate. 

I called to tell them to deliver at the end of April. They said they couldn't deliver until the end of May and want us to pay the storage fee for May because they don't have a truck available...also, the price on our storage is now $4500 but they won't send an email explaining the extra cost or return phone calls. All I know is that if I don't have the money available, the full amount when the truck arrives, they will consider it a whole new move and charge again for taking it back to the warehouse.

On top of that, harassment which went unchecked for years made him suicidal. Help me help him before I get the call from his mom that he's dead.",hiphopapotamus1,18,4,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1dcnji/my_good_friend_and_former_coworker_sustained_a/,"**PA**

While working in a hospital an employee and two coworkers attempt to assist a man from a chair to a bed. The man was 350-400 lbs and could support perhaps 15% of his weight. The employee asks to use a hoyer lift to assist. The nurse leading the lift refuses as he believes its a waste of time. The man drops straight down rapidly. The employee is unable to guide this patient's fall or even let go to protect himself and he sustains an injury.

The injury was such that the majority of the muscles on his back were having spasms and were useless. The employee had to be taken to the ER. After a few hours and some pain/anti-inflammatory meds the pain and spasms were still present but subdued enough for the employee to go home. No tests were done.

The ER in the hospital in which the employee works and received treatment gave instructions to not go to work for at least 1 week for reevaluation. Percocet was prescribed. The very next day the employee was scheduled for a shift. The employee was not able to sleep due to the continued spasms and claims to have taken the percocet at night before bed. He also did not consider it his responsibility to call the floor and tell him that he wasn't allowed to work considering that his work was the entity that told him not to come in from the start. As such he did not call out the next day. In fact he was pretty much knocked out until after his shift was due to start because of the prescribed percocet anyway. Furthermore apparently the hospital initiated a claim with their insurance for him. That means that The ER knew he was injured, everyone who worked that day on that floor knew that he was injured, EVEN THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY knew he was injured and yet they considered him a no call no show. He feels that when it was communicated that the rest of the shift was not to be covered at the time of the incident, it should have also been stated that he would not be coming back due to the injury until one week later. They considered his absence a no call no show and stated that they had no idea he hurt his back. The employee was put on a 6 month probationary period in which a written warning was issued. This allowed grounds for termination should another no call no show occur.

Fast forward 5 and a half months later. No call outs. however the employee cannot work as often as he would like. Whenever he works 3 or more days straight he claims the spasms manifest. He still takes no action against the facility. He simply works as often as he can. Suddenly he gets sick. He's violently throwing up around the time his shift is scheduled to start. He, now being late, calls work and explains that he's was throwing up a bit, he claimed it was back drip/allergies/just getting over a cold, but it only held him up. He explains that he WILL be coming in to work and that he will just be late by about 45 mins. Had he intended to call out the proper protocol would be to call the nursing office at 1. The shift starts at 3. He however was not calling out. The charge nurse then instructed him to not come in since he was retching. He tried to fight it since he needs his shifts but inevitably complies.

Management then considers this a no call no show and terminates the employee after an unofficial two week period in which he was told he was not allowed to pick up shifts.

The employee cannot find a job that invokes his skill set that doesn't require heavy lifting of people (which as per numerous in-services is considered 'never safe' but can be made safer.)

The employee is seeing a shrink for the abuse he received on the floor Apparently an employee who later became assistant manager called him gay in front of his girlfriend while at work, at the nurses station, during visitor hours for everyone to hear. The exact statement was. ""I'm glad you're dating (Name of GF/coworker) because we all thought you were gay. Don't worry, if you cant handle her, (Name of another male coworker) will take care of her for ya."" This statement broke them up, and caused him to get extremely depressed. The depression also coincides with the general feeling of not being liked by a group of maybe 3 nurses who turned the entire atmosphere into High school. Again, the nurse who made that comment is now assistant manager... Inappropriate touching/comments, not documenting things and just saying quite literally ""fuck it"" aloud for other coworkers to hear, treating good nurses like shit because of some extra curricular factor like hobbies, general appearance and anything else man can be a petty little high school girls about. This all plagued my overly sensitive buddy into feeling depressed about the entire world. The small portion of it that he saw depressed him to no end and he doesn't even go outside anymore. He's not AT the point of suicide, he's past that. He's tried numerous times since then and has been seeing a therapist for it. In a span of a year he lost his job and GF and was left with nothing but back pain, an interrupted sleep cycle and depression. He really wishes he never lived.

I work with him and I am furious FOR him. He is too dejected and is pretty much giving up on life. I literally watched an extremely intelligent, physically fit, good looking to the point of envy, socially gifted and naturally funny guy turn into a sack of shit who doesn't leave the house.. I've worked there for 4 years, he's been there for 6. This job was his first he feels like its his last due to his back pain and overall demeanor change. Some of his ""friends"" stopped talking to him since he can't go out and unwind with the rest of them like he used to. I'm just shocked at how someone who I know is better than me in more ways than I want to admit give up on life. I'm pretty much holding him by the hand now and will be helping him get at the very least workman's comp.

Today my wife was served with an eviction notice, giving her until tomorrow morning to have her stuff out of the premises. Her studio is in the arts district of Las Vegas

The reason given is that she violated the lease by painting the outside of her apartment. Something that all 3 of the artists renting from the landlord have done, and something they all did with permission from the landlord.

Yesterday the landlord attempted destructive renovations on the shopfronts of the artist's building. No warning was given for this, my wife prevented the workers from doing this work to her building, as she had just spent money on materials and paint, under the impression that it would not be messed with.


About an hour ago, she found out that a building inspector showed up today, and the landlord believes my wife called them. She did not.


We are aware of why this is illegal, but we have no legal representation. It is also likely that the landlord waited until the evening to issue the eviction notice, to limit the time available to find legal help.

Do my neighbors have a case?,mrturtleneck,17,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/17psgw/being_sued_in_small_claims_court_for_10000_for/,"Hi reddit, a little distraught today.

In september a 60 foot block wall running the length of the side of my house fell. We share this wall with our neighbors to left.

These are the neighbors from hell, we live on a nice suburban street in Los Angeles where everyone takes care of their house and lawn except for these people. The lady is a hoarder, we once called the fire department on her because it became a health and fire hazard. She filled up four entire construction site type dumpsters, and there were rats running through our backyard for a couple months after, completely the fault of her. Her lawn is dead, she has tinfoil over the windows as blinds, garbage littered on her lawn, it's really just disgusting. She lives there with her older granddaughter, in her later twenties, and her young granddaughter probably around 8. Oh and the house was owned by her late father, it has now been put into a trust, so she can live there but she doesn't own it.

When the wall fell, she expected us to replace it, because our trees knocked it down, which was alright because we considered it to be our wall. We are not exactly sure who's property it falls on, but I doubt her brother, who is handling the whole suing process will pay the $2500 for a surveyor. When their father was still alive, he told me that he did not build the wall, and that it was there when they moved in, the brother is now claiming that he did build the wall but has no documentation or proof of any kind, so it's pretty much total BS. When getting rid of the remnants of the fence, we also found that the fence was built improperly without any rebar in it. They insisted that we replace it with either another block wall, which is way out of our price range, or a vinyl fence, which we think looks cheap and bad. So after a couple months of this arguing we just went ahead and put up a beautiful, redwood fence.

Today the brother came by and dropped off a notice to appear in small claims court on March 13. He is suing for $10,000 under the claim that, ""The defendant's trees knocked down our brick wall. I asked the defendant to replace our wall and he refused."" Under how did you calculate this cost he wrote, ""I believe that the cost for a 6' tall at least 65' long after demo and construction will be $10,000.""

The basic gist, AT&amp;T decided to flag my ID for ""porting too fast"" - apparently that's a thing at AT&amp;T even though it is not documented anywhere, nobody in the public knows about it, and no low-level AT&amp;T employee has ever heard of it. My employer was ending their company-paid mobile phones, and I had to port the number to my personal phone if I wanted to keep it.

AT&amp;T told me the only way to do that, was to create a personal AT&amp;T account, move the number from corporate to personal, and then move the number from the AT&amp;T personal to my carrier's personal.

In doing this, I apparently had a flag put on my account that won't allow me to have AT&amp;T service ever again until the day I die. This flag doesn't show up in their credit check system as anything other than a mysterious high-dollar deposit, so the low-level AT&amp;T employees have literally no idea what is going on and aren't allowed to talk to the people that do.

I've talked to AT&amp;T customer care, AT&amp;T corporate, AT&amp;T stores, AT&amp;T executive escalations, the BBB, Attorneys General, and nothing will change AT&amp;T's stance.

I even got an AT&amp;T Executive Escalations rep in trouble for trying to help me.

I've also contacted some local media, but they must have bigger fish to fry.

I just want my name cleared of their mistake. This will permanently affect me attempting to get any kind of AT&amp;T services (phone, Internet, landline, etc.) for the rest of my life. I don't know where I will end up living in the future, I would hate for this to screw me 10 years down the road.

I need to know what to do/expect...,getinthegoat,16,1,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/13huz7/in_need_of_some_advice_my_dad_hit_a_man_with_his/,"My Background: I work in the auto insurance industry and I am very well versed and familiar with auto liability and driving laws but not at a fatality level. I have already handled the vehicle damage issues, contacted the insurance company, police have an ongoing investigation. 

Facts:
My dad was driving to my home to have a short visit. It was 7:30 pm (fully dark), street lights on, head lights on, however where the pedestrian came out from wasn't directly under a light. My dad was traveling in the #2 lane out of 3 northbound lanes (essentially the middle travel lane). My dad doesn't speed and he told me he was going 40 (I believe him because he drives annoying slow sometimes). He had been almost one block away from a major intersection when the pedestrian walked right in front of my dads vehicle. 

The impact on the vehicle (Jeep Wrangler) was the very center grill, up on top of the hood and man went left into the passenger side of the windshield then his body landed in the #3 lane. My dad pulled over immediately into the next residential street which was about 30-40 feet away. The radiator blew and he parked. That is when I got the call and he said the paramedics were arriving.

This area is mixed residential and urban. At the major intersections back there are things like gas stations and shops and a major drug store. Then after about one block that is when you get into the residential. Where this pedestrian was coming from was what looked like a pizza place parking lot and the alley behind the residential homes. It's not the most well lit area and there isn't a cross walk anywhere near it. 

My dad: 69 years old. Of sound mind and body. He can still see good to my understanding. No drugs. No alcohol. Wide awake. He was only three miles from his home and only two more miles to get to my house. I asked him if he saw the person before it happened and he said the man got in front of the vehicle suddenly and he couldn't do anything.

Apparently there are several witnesses that appear to be siding in dads favor. The police allowed us to take our vehicle on our own. No impound. No arrests. I got dad a warm meal and took him home. 

The police originally said the man appeared to be a drunk transient but today I found out he does have family that came looking for him last night to help him with his laundry. 

Now I sit here and wait. Wait for the police report. Wait for a toxicology report (from the pedestrian). Wait for this family to appear and see if they will look for compensation. I am worried to death about my father and our family as my dad did not give him the best limits of liability coverage and no money put away.

To get things started, I rented a room in a house around the area and agreed to a year lease on the house. In the contract it said that AC units are not allowed unless you pay the fee for it (which is about $65 per person in a room per month). Now, my roommate just moved Monday of last week and has brought an AC unit with him. I told him not to install it, unless he wants to pay the fee. He put it in his closet and stored away and not to be used. Now the previous tenet, who is also our friend got a message from our landlord and accused us of using an AC unit. The landlord claimed that there was cold air being generated and there was a pipe vent in our window. Other than that there is no bonafide evidence that it was installed and used. The previous tenet said that there was an AC in the room, but it was stored away in the closet.  

I'm just thinking that the landlord is trying to bully us into paying the fee, and knowing that there is an AC unit loses us the advantage. What do you guys think we should do?


Resolution: I will negotiate with the landlord and just pay the one time fee, (even though we are in the right) just to keep the peace. If anything else comes from it, I will come back to this thread. Thanks guys!

I doubt that there's much that can be done since these are nudes I've posted myself on gw, however have deleted months prior to this message. All I have is a Facebook conversation of a friend who was ""hacked"". They've mentioned they showed the pictures off a workplace computer to numerous fellow coworkers. Which would most definitely be during work hours. They also said in that comment thread that ""x and I showed the photos."" I Facebook'ed x's name who turned out to be a coworker.

I'm worried however that I might be wrongfully judged and even fired for this (I work at a grocery store for almost two years). I'm considering speaking to my manager about this tomorrow. Is there anything I should know or be cautious about so this doesn't go the wrong way.   
**EDIT:** I had drama with an ex coworker (got fired last month) who has led me to believe that he's trying to set x up because x got him fired. I confronted x who is claiming to having nothing to do with the photos and claims that ex coworker was the one who showed the photos off to everyone. A part of me genuinely believes him. Even beforehand, while discussing this drama with friends, their first suspect was that ex coworker. If it is, there's not much I can do since he's already fired unless he harasses me again.

In late May, I was admitted to a local ER with stomach pains. I arrived at 5 am, and the diagnosis wasn’t made until 6 pm. The only surgeon available was “possibly” coming off of a 24-hour rotation, according to the doctor who made the diagnosis, but they wanted the surgery done ASAP. I wearily agreed, and they took me into surgery. Instead of a laparoscopic appendectomy, I was advised to have an open appendectomy; despite being a female in my early 20’s, quite healthy, and thin (open appendectomies are usually advised for obese and/or elderly patients). In addition, my appendix had NOT burst, which is a secondary reason why open appendectomies are performed. It should be noted that, at the time, the surgeon was being shadowed by three or four trainees.

When I came home- less than 24 hours after the surgery- I was given a prescription for Loritab but no antibiotics. As a result, I developed an infection. Approximately 4 days after the surgery, the area had become red and swollen, and the site had grown increasingly painful (I couldn’t sit up on my own, and could only sleep by folding my knees up so that I wasn’t stretching my stomach muscles). I went to the office of the surgeon (from herein referred to as “Doctor A”) but he was unavailable, so I was seen by his associate “Doctor B”. Doctor B advised me that, although the area was red and the incision had grown in size, there was no infection. There was no swab of the area done, he just looked at it for about 30 seconds.

Two days later I returned to see Doctor A, as a schedule appointment in his office to have the staples removed. At this point, the infection has increased, and it has become extremely difficult for me to walk because of the area of the infection and its level of sensitivity. Doctor A states that the area is infected, and prepares to remove the staples. At this point, I ask if I can have some form of pain medication or go to the hospital, but Doctor A refuses. He takes a scalpel and pops open the strained staples (they were strained and distorted because of the increased size of the incision area) and proceeds to cut into my abscess. At this point, I am screaming in agony – I have never experienced this level of pain before- and I’m begging him to stop. Doctor A continues to cut into the abscess, a process that took between 5-10 minutes. I’m crying and screaming, and he finally stuffs my wound with gauze. He tells me that the office will order third party visiting nurses to come and pack the rather deep wound, and that I am not to do it by myself.

Well, the doctor’s office apparently never called the nurses association, so when I called the next morning (Saturday) they had to track down the nurse in charge of scheduling it – something they thankfully did. All was well for two days, when all of a sudden, the nurses stopped visiting. I called and asked why, and they said it was because Doctor A’s office had ordered only two days worth (the wound would take approximately 6-10 weeks to heal). I called Doctor A’s office back, and the nurse stated that I should be able to get someone else to pack the wound for me. I told her that I had no close friends or family in the area (I had only moved to this city two months prior), and that I would need the nurses to continue to visit until the wound got small enough to pack myself. She reluctantly agreed. The nurses continued to visit for another week, when suddenly, it stopped again. It was the same exact problem, and I managed to argue with Doctor A’s office until it was reversed. I was afraid that the infection would re-emerge without proper care, and that I would have to deal with “Doctor Mengele’s” scalpel again.

During this time, one of the nurses – who wondered why I had such a deep wound from an appendectomy- told me that she believed Doctor A was negligent in his treatment. She advised contacting a medical review board, at the very least. In addition, when I told her that the loritab was really not mitigating my pain and I had been taking Motrin instead, she called Doctor A’s office to ask for either an increased strength of Loritab or an alternative painkiller. Doctor A’s office called me later that day and directed me to discontinue the Loritab and instead take OTC Motrin. When I told her that I had been taking Motrin and it was not decreasing my pain levels, she told me to continue that.

About three weeks into the nurses visits, I felt confident enough to change the wound packing by myself. Gradually, the wound has closed, although there’s some amount of tissue damage (one side of the incision is deeply indented. In addition, there is scarring (vertical, approx. 1 inch long) from when one staple was pulled up and through my skin during the removal. 

I feel like my recovery was impeded- multiple times- by the actions of the Doctor A and his office. From doing research online and talking to various nurses, it seems like antibiotics are very often given to patients following appendectomies to ward off infection. I also feel like Doctor B could have easily seen that the incision site was infected, and that Doctor A’s office could have been much more helpful in both keeping the Nurse association informed and in prescribing pain medication. Everyone makes mistakes, but I feel like this might infringe on “negligence” territory. 

What most concerns me, however, was my treatment by Doctor A in his office. I can’t understand why I wasn’t give some form of pain medication (even small abscesses are usually numbed with a local before lancing it), why I wasn’t taken to a hospital operating room for the procedure, and why the doctor continued to performing the procedure after I was screaming at him to stop. I’m not sure if I should pursue this as a lawsuit or report it to a medical review board. I’m not even sure how I can prove my case if it comes down to it, but I’m open to any suggestions because I really don’t want to see someone else go through this. 

Thank you in advance for any help or advice!

**Tl;dr: Had an open appendectomy that later got infected as a result of not being prescribed antibiotics, clear infection is later dismissed by surgeon’s associate. Surgeon cuts me open and lances a huge abscess without pain management and despite my pleas that he stop. Surgeon’s office consistently drops the ball, making recovery from the appendectomy/infection much more difficult. Unsure if I should sue, report my surgeon to a medical review board, or just let it go.**",,False,self,t5_2rawz,False,,,True,t3_1i7p6q,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1i7p6q/ny_do_i_have_a_medical_malpractice_case/,

Me, being the lucky person that I am, was right next to it and my engine compartment caught on fire and blew out the windshield.

P.S. I've already had the car crushed since it was useless and I had to get it out of the wrecker since they charged me $20 a day plus $140 for the initial cost. I received $250 for the scrap.

My husband's grandmother died almost 20 years ago. She had no will when she died, so her house was supposedly given to her five children, so each one had a fifth of the house. Most of them have lived in it at one point or another, and the rest have no desire to. My husband's parents moved out last December, and his Uncle S decided he was going to sell it. We realized he probably couldn't legally do this, but we wanted this house. Everyone else agreed they wanted us to have the house, and all his Uncle S wanted was $6000. Then he told my sister-in-law that he had sold the house, when he really hadn't. So we were going to contact him and let him know we want to buy it(essentially his share of the house), when we find out, he really legally CAN'T. Turns out he didn't have a share, nor do the other four people who supposedly did. It was still on record as being owned by my husband's deceased grandma.

We still want this house, but we're not sure how we'd go about getting it. Since it was never transferred or given to anyone through a will, would it automatically be given to the oldest child?

It took place September 2012.

Story: I was the best man for my buddy's wedding and he paid a professional photographer (with a real site, business, and everything!) for a package that included the hours she was there, an 8x10 print of their choice, and (according to the package details) ""All your hi-res digitals on disc."" He paid in full before the event.

The issues: 

* 1) He has not received his 8x10, yet. 

* 2) The disc she provided was a single layer DVD in which all of the roughly 700 images have been compressed and image resolution lowered down to roughly 2-3MP. All of her images were taken with a Canon 5D Mark II which is a 21.1 MP sensor and raw image resolution of 5,616 × 3,744. The compression is so bad that you can't even print a small portrait for scrap booking without it looking like garbage. Even facebook does a better job at compression.

* 3) When asked for the high-res/unaltered images, she said it was an extra charge per image! He contested that she didn't provide what she promised and pointed out that her contract promised high-res and then....

* 4) She has broken off all communication. She does not reply to email, text, voice, or facebook messages despite actively participating on facebook posts (as in, theres no way she hasn't seen his messages by now).

I know he can probably go after her for the print, but the real big issue isn't that. It's the completely unusable digitals she gave him, and that she's now saying he has to pay extra for the original copies.

In my mind, the argument would be over what 'high-res' implies. To me, that implies un-altered, uncompressed, straight-from-the-memory card digitals, but she apparently thinks however small she has to make them to fit on a single DVD is high-res enough.

Here is a link to the contract document that he signed. I've tried to redact all identifying information on the photographer. In the contract language, please understand the redaction boxes to be ""PHOTOGRAPHER"" or business owner, whatever.

About a week ago me and my brother were out walking at like 2 am smoking a cigarette. The cops came up, we were cooperative cause we were just out for a smoke, understood them wanting to check on us in the middle of the night.

Fast forward to today and I am out for a walk again, around my subdivision, just listening to music on my tablet and smoking. I had a messenger bag around my shoulder just to hold a bottle of water and toss the tablet into when i didn't want to carry it. It was around 300 pm, middle of the day, just out for a walk. 

Again the cops stop me, I was cooperative. I voluntarily opened my bag, because like I said there was nothing in it. They proceeded to check me out, but they asked me for the serial number on the tablet i have owned for months. I felt like this was a step to far, when I was doing absolutely nothing wrong. I don't mind being cooperative, especially in situations late at night were things could seem shady, but when I am walking down the block during the middle of the day, it seems like harassment. There were plenty of people outside gardening, walking, whatever.

They said they stopped me because i had a bag and someone reported me running (I laughed when they said this, and responded that I hadn't done anything active like running since high school) But I really don't want to have to be afraid to walk around my block without being harassed.

We found one on Craigslist that was 6 hours away in another city. We got enough information that we decided we would purchase the vessel. I withdrew a cashiers check from my institution at around 3:11pm on a Friday. The check was post dated for the following Monday because the bank was already operating on the next business day. We drove to get the boat with my twin 4 year old boys. 

All seemed to go well with the transaction. The couple did question the check a little because of the weird date which we assured them was normal. My wife previously was employed with this financial institution so she know all the operating procedures and regulations etc... Here's where it gets good...

We decide to head back home but first stop for lunch only a few exits down the highway from the couples home we just purchased the boat from. About an hour passes and we are finishing up lunch and some small shopping and I get a phone call from the guy. He says ""I hate to do this to you but my daughter left a bag of speed in the boat. Where are ya"". Little did he know we were just down the street. So I told him we were just down the street. He said he would come get the drugs out for us. Very Shady now. 

When they arrive his wife and him rush out of their truck... ""Listen this is the real situation! There are NO DRUGS.. But THIS CHECK IS FRAUDULENT!!! We have called the cops and they are on the way. YOU""RE NOT STEALING OUR BOAT!!

WTF!? So at this point my wife and I's blood is just boiling we're so mad. He proceeds to tell us he called the bank. They gave him our account balances, told him no way that check is good, someone has stolen their identity, and to call the authorities!! His wife is still on the phone with the police giving them our descriptions and letting them know where we are. 

So my wife logs into our account on her iphone and shows him the cashiers check withdrawal, also we still have the bank receipt slip for the check which we show him and my wife also calls the bank and proceeds to first chew them a new ass and then has them explain to these people that the check is indeed legit. 

They go on to apologize, call the police and tell them it was a mistake, etc... and we get on our way. 

While driving my wife calls the bank again to talk with this guys manager. If this guy suspected fraud he should have suspended all our accounts, and notified us. Thats standard protocol. But he didn't. The manager is speechless. The employee even put everything he told those people, like our account balances, our address, names, etc.. in the account notes for anybody who accesses our account next to see. 

Anyhow they called us back a few days later and told us that they terminated the guys employment.

So lets look at the big picture here.. This representative gave out all our account info, our names, verified our address to strangers, then advised them to actually call the cops. All the while never flagging our account as fraud or suspicious activity or nothing. Also had we not stopped for lunch we would have been an hour out of town on the highway with the cops probably chasing us down. We would have been arrested no doubt and our kids would have went to CPS or something. Before it all got sorted it out.

Utilities are included in the rent. I have lived in the apartment since December and will be moving out in June. The landlord was in the apartment showing it to a future lessor. The landlord had also entered the apartment in January for repairs. All of these devices were in the apartment except for the PC and monitor at that time.

First, she listed the following electronics as being in my apartment.

* power strips
* 2 TV's
* major computer monitor
* fan
* 2 laptops
* XBOX
* router
* not to mention the hotplate, microwave, refrig required by us.

First of all, this list she gave me is incorrect. I only have one television (34""). I only have one laptop as well. I do not have a router. I think she mistook the PS3 and Wii U for XBox and router. I have a PC in my apartment which I think she means ""major computer monitor"" by.

On the other side of the apartment I have a power strip with the TV and 2 game consoles plugged in. Are these devices using a lot of power even when they are off?

I have a laptop but do not leave it plugged in when I leave the apartment. The external hard drive is usually off when I leave as well ( occasionally I forget). 

However, just because I have all these in my apartment doesn't mean I use them all at once. The mini-fridge, hot plate, and microwave are in the same area of the apartment. While the fridge is always plug in I NEVER plug the PC, micro wave, and hot plate in at the same time. I always make sure only one of those devices is plugged in at a time. I never use the game consoles and television at the same time as the PC. The laptop is very rarely on if the PC is on. 

The fan is small (less than 12""). I rarely use it and only started using it once or so every night now that it's started getting hot.

Utilities are included in the apartment rent. The section for utilities in the lease says ""Lessor shall be responsible for arranging for paying for all other utility services to the named apartment. Lessor shall provide wireless internet that is for casual use only. Any Lessee with excessive bandwidth usage is recommended to subscribe to DSL, at Lessee's expense."" Nowhere else are utilities mentioned in the lease. 

If I'm using too much electricity than so be it. I've never lived in a studio before so I am wondering if the limits are different than a 1 BR apartment.

My homeowner's association had our community tennis courts resurfaced a few weeks ago.  They then proceeded to put a lock on the gate, with a note saying ""call this number for the code"".  

My wife went down there with my 2 and 3 year-olds to hit some balls with them.  She had rackets, and balls, but no cell phone.  While she was down there, a woman drove up and started fiddling with the lock.  My wife asked if she had the code.

The response was: ""Yes.  I have the code.  But you're not going to take your **kids** in there, are you?""

Well naturally, the level of respect being shown by this woman toward my wife and kids offended my wife.  The woman ranted on about how we have to protect the courts from damage, and then my wife was fuming, so she told the woman she would get the code elsewhere.  

The next day, I called the out-of-state number on the lock, and got an anonymous voicemail.  I sent an e-mail to the President of the HOA, asking him if this person was representing the board in an official capacity, and letting him know that they were quite disrespectful to my family.  And then I asked him for the code, since I was not sure I even had the correct phone number.

His response to me was that this woman was his wife, and that she was *""a well-versed tennis player and probably wondered what value 2 and 3 year olds would get from a tennis court other than serving as a playground.""*  He did not include the code in his reply.

I responded by again asking for the code, and then asking for the section in the by-laws that prohibited members from using community amenities based on their perceived ability, or value derived from said amenity.  

The response was even more offensive:

*The courts are meant for people who are going to use them as tennis courts and be good citizens.*

So now, not only do we not have a right no use this community amenity, but we also are not ""good citizens"".  He then threw in that MY wife was the rude one, and that if we called his wife and apologized, she could issue the code to us.

The rest of the board was copied on that response, so I replied to all, again asking for the specific section of the by-laws that would allow such discrimination.  

Having not received a reply in a week, I am considering next steps.  

Could I possibly file a small claim for that portion of back dues that has gone to this amenity, and get my dues reduced by a similar amount in the future?  What recourse do I have here?  I am in NC, if that helps.

We got out of our cars and she said that she couldn't see any damage on my car and that we should be good. I of course said that I would be needing her insurance information regardless of what she thought. We were both in agreement that she backed into me at the time of the accident. 

I filed a claim the next day with her insurance and my statement was recorded, saying that she backed into me. An estimate put the damages at around $800. A few days ago I heard back from her insurance company that they had completed the investigation, she claimed that I rear-ended her, and I am responsible for the damages.

Here's the situation:

My grandfather lived in Lake Tahoe, California and essentially was letting a woman live there with him for years.  It boiled down to a very rough idea of a caregiver situation, but nothing official.  It was more like a, ""Sure, you can live here, come and go as you please"" sharing a house situation as roommates.  It had also been understood from neighbors and friends that this woman may have been using my grandfather to pay her credit card bills, help her out with a car, etc.  

My grandfather passed away suddenly last week, and my mother/uncle became executors of his Will.  This woman has remained at the property after my grandfather passed, and even moved her friend and child in.  My mother claims there is NO documentation in the Will that she is to stay there; that anything has gone to her from it; and we're fairly certain there is no lease agreement and that she paid no rent living there.

My mother wants to ""evict"" her from the property, since she has no legal right to remain there and was not legally bound to my grandfather in any caregiver or relationship way.  My uncle wants to pay her to leave, so that there is no trouble.  I've been having difficulty finding pouring through Squatter's Rights legal advice because this is such a weird situation.  I've heard that we can give both 3 Days Notice and that we would have to give 30 Days Notice WITH court hearings as well to leave the property before changing locks on the doors.  My mom is also concerned because the woman has started allowing other people to stay there, and our family wants to sell the property regardless and get all the executor duties finalized.

What in California can we do about this situation?  What would be the best way to seek further advice before acting?

Last night I was at a state park lake (after hours) with a large group of friends. There was plenty of alcohol and pot. However, as a DD, I did not partake in either. The Oklahoma State park rangers showed up and asked who the vehicles belonged to, tested each of us with breathalyzer and the ""ballpoint pen"" field sobriety test (drivers only) and promptly picked us (again, drivers) up off the ground and slapped handcuffs on us and threw us into their patrol vehicles. There were a few others who had felony possession within 1000 feet of a school or park slapped on them, as well as some misdemeanor possession charges (the misdemeanors fessed up when asked if they had any pot.) We were all under the age of 21. Everyone who was not driving or did not confess to possessing marijuana (and didn't have the K9 hit on them) was allowed to leave by way of people picking them up, no matter their obviously drunken states.

Additionally, when I was released from county jail this morning, they refused to give me my identification (TX driver's license). Why?

I have a few questions:

* Can I get the charge dismissed for an improper arrest (no rights or anything)?
* Why was my identification not returned to me? 
* How can I be arrested for public intoxication if the breathalyzer blew .000 and I (as far as I know) ""passed"" the field sobriety test?

I am currently facing criminal charges in Indiana. I have hired an attorney who was recommended to me by several people, but over the course of the case I have become more and more uncomfortable with him for several reasons. I will list them out and try to keep it concise. 

1. I have never met with him on time, except for the initial consultation. - Pretty self-explanatory. He will ask me to set up a meeting at his office. I take off work, drive 60 miles round trip to see him and I have always ended up waiting at least an hour past our scheduled time to see him. I then am usually rushed through and out the door, leaving many questions unanswered and left feeling very frustrated. I understand things happen and sometimes run behind, but I've asked the office several times to just give me a call in that case and it'll be no big deal. They can't seem to do it. This isn't a large firm, it's one lawyer and a few paralegals and secretaries.

2. He's missed court twice. - Once he sent another attorney to appear for him, who also did not show up. Fortunately the court just rescheduled the hearing but I had gotten up early, missed work, and then sat in court for 4 hours on something that would have taken 45 minutes tops had he shown up. No one knew and I eventually had to ask a court worker, who then found my case on the attorney's desk waiting for him to show up. The second time was last Thursday. I had talked to him two days before on Tuesday and he told me specifically ""just meet me in the lobby at 10 (my scheduled court time), they change the rooms for these meetings and even I don't know where it will be."" I waited in the lobby from 9:30 until 10:15. I called his cell and he picked up and immediately hung up on me so I called the office and asked about him. His secretary said ""I know ____ is running late but I've emailed him. You should ask where they are doing such and such arguments, they'll tell you where to go"". Finally finding the correct room I waited until all cases were cleared and my name was not said. I was finally able to ask the judge who then looked up the case on the docket saying ""Mr. ______ has already appeared this morning and the date has been rescheduled for xx/xx/xx"" Not only did he not meet me like he said he would, he appeared, rescheduled the date, and left me guessing about the whole thing. Not even his secretary could tell me that he did that.

3. Their record keeping is terrible. - I've paid this guy over $3000 of which I have receipts but still, every time I get an invoice from them it never changes; it still says I've only paid $1000. I've shown them the receipts and talked to him about it but nothing changes. I'm wary of paying any more money to him if he's not going to acknowledge it, but at the same time I don't want him to be upset and think that I don't want to or won't pay him. That's not my intention at all. 

I want to bring this stuff up to him, but I am so afraid of pissing this guy off and having him give up on me. My charges are serious. I'm 24 and looking at 10 years in prison. I'm scared to death but I do not feel like I am being represented correctly or treated like a valued client. This guy was also twice as expensive as my second choice but I chose him based on the good recommendations of others, yet his office can't even tell me that he's rescheduled my court dates.

Apparently insurance companies don't use the same evaluation databases as lenders. The vehicle has been declared a total loss; and, from what I remember of my few legal classes, condition of the vehicle in a ""total loss"" situation is inconsequential. True or no? Aside from this, I don't believe that the insurance company should be able to evaluate the condition of the car and give a fair market value for it if they don't even accept the quotes from databases that many lending institutions use. They told me that if I could provide evidence to support the price I feel should be more appropriate (aside from KBB and NADA) that they would consider making a different offer. And even though its cliche, I did recieve whiplash from the wreck. Not sure it was or will be enough to sue over.

I signed power of attorney to the dealer for my old vehicle.  Then last week I received notification from the City of Chicago that it was impounded.  It had different plate numbers because I took the old plates off before leaving the dealer.  The dealer said that they sold my car wholesale and then it was sold again recently.  The paperwork has not made it's way through the system yet and that is why the car still shows under my name.  

I called the dealer and asked what the hell happened and why the car was not listed under their name considering I traded it in 4 months ago.  They said that since I signed the power of attorney, I didn't actually sell the car to them.  The car will stay registered under my name until the car is actually sold to someone.  The dealer stated I did not SELL the car to them, just assigned power of attorney. 

The paperwork from the city said I can fax the trade in paperwork and I will not be held liable.

However, I have some questions:
1)  Is this the normal process when trading in a vehicle?
2)  Does anyone know who I can call in the city of Chicago to see if I have anything against my license/name since this car was impounded (IE: tickets, etc)?
3)  Depending on how the dealer acts with this (so far it has been sorta shady), can I go after them for negligence?  I have spent quite a bit of time so far trying to figure out of this mess.

Thanks!

Edit:  So far the city has said that the paperwork I have faxed over is not sufficient enough.  I have a feeling I am going to be screwed on this one.

Yesterday his daycare provider called me to say he was throwing an uncontrollable tantrum and I needed to pick him up. I called his mother, who had just finished taking final exams for the day, asking her to pick him up and that we were pulling him out of the daycare because I did not think that his provider was handling his behavior appropriately. She agreed that she also had a very bad feeling about her.  

After she picked him up, she decided to question him about why he acts out at daycare and why he throws tantrums in the morning about going there.  This has been an ongoing issue for about a year.  He told her that he was scared of her, and then told her that she slaps him on the arms.  He then told her that when he was four she touched his penis during nap time.  I asked him about it when I got home from work and he told me the same thing.  

After talking to him some more I looked up the child protective social service agency in my area (MN, Hennepin county) and made a report.  The woman I spoke with said that she would speak with her supervisor, who would decide if a case would be opened or something to that effect.  She said the physical abuse did not meet their criteria but a report would be filed with the child care licensing office regarding her use of corporal punishment, today as the office was closed last night.  She told me I could call any time with questions.  I called this morning and got the supervisors number. I just left a voicemail and I am currently waiting for a call back.  

I don't want to make any mistakes or overlook anything from here, and honestly I'm having difficulty thinking straight.  I don't know if I should also file a police report or contact a lawyer, or if there is anyone else I need to call.  His mother has contacted his pediatrician and is filling out a psychiatric intake form at the moment.  We had visited his doctor a month ago because his behavior changed drastically about a year ago and he began displaying very significant behavioral and emotional problems - he gave us some parenting advice that we had already been consistently putting into action and scheduled a follow up appointment.  His behavior problems and sudden change make perfect sense now, where before I had wracked my brain attempting to understand what was behind it and nearly exhausted myself in my efforts to guide and teach him.  

Any advice would be helpful, anything I may overlook.  I'm sorry if this is a wall of text; I have never posted anything but comments and I'm not sure if I'm doing the line breaks correctly.

About a week ago, I let my brother borrow my car, and he never gave the keys back to me.  Yesterday I confronted him and asked to have them back, as I'd misplaced the spare set I've been using.  He got angry, said I had an attitude with him, and we started arguing.  

Things escalated pretty quickly, and before I knew it he had me in a headlock and was punching the top of my head and arms (he was trying for the ribs, but I blocked him).   I did nothing to defend myself--he's literally twice my size... anything I could have done would have just pissed him off more--and when I managed to get away from him I went straight to the phone to dial 911.  He followed me and continued to try to attack me, breaking a lamp and shoving my head into a doorframe in the process, until I told him I was calling the cops.  

He ran outside and I dialed.  I went to the door to see where he was, and my boyfriend came barreling in, shoved me back, and told me to, ""Get the fuck away from the door and get the fuck on the ground!  He's got a gun!""  The dispatcher answered my call, and I (not at all calmly) asked her to send the police to my house.  

Three other people saw this happen.  My daughter was in the car the whole fucking time, even while the cops had him on the ground in cuffs.

We all filled out statements and told the police what happened. One of the officers took pictures of my injuries, but because most of the blows were to the top of my head, there wasn't much to take pictures of.  I have a small cut on my lip, a bruise on my knee, a lump on my head, and a couple bruises on my arm that, for some reason, aren't at all visible (but, fuck me, they hurt like a bitch).  

The cops said there wasn't enough evidence to arrest him, and that they thought we were ""mutual combatants"" (I guess because we were arguing before he attacked me?)  

This is far from the first time he's done something like this.  The last time we got into a fight, he nearly broke my collar bone, left bruises around my neck, and threatened to kill me.  Hell, he threatened to kill me last week.  But this is the first time I've called the police.  I can't have him around me or my daughter.  He's dangerous.

Was on my way to work, literally about 200 yards from my driveway and a car backs out of a yard into my lane, so in the millisecond I had of making a decision I opted to swerve into a ditch to avoid the car. Took a nice bumpy ride, banged around a bit (yes I was wearing my seat belt), had a nice gash on my head but pretty much felt fine.  Meanwhile the other car is nowhere to be found.


Call police/ems/fire dept and long story short was transported to ER to be checked out. Yes I should have declined transport (called a Signal 93 in SC) but figured to be safe.  Trooper arrives at hospital informed me while looking for my insurance he found my nearly full bottle of Diazapam 5mg. (Was prescribed to me, my name on bottle, in proper RX bottle, was recently filled a few days prior. Directions read: ""Take one pill every 4 hours for muscle spasms"")


Trooper informs me he counted pills and agreed the proper amount was missing, i.e. I had taken the prescribed amount and not abused it. He asks if i had taken it that morning. ""Yes, I have a prescription and take one every 4-6 hours."" He then asks if I would consent to a blood or urine test as I'm being charged with DUI of a controlled substance and if I refuse I will automatically lose my license for 6 months. (Which I believe to be true from my work with my law enforcement friends.)


I consent to blood as I had just urinated for Dr. at ER and had no more to give. He does his ""CSI"" kit, and let me say that he was actually polite throughout the whole ordeal. Upon wrapping up he hands me my summons and tells me that due to my cooperation and my absolute courtesy towards him that he wasn't going to take me to jail, although he could, he felt like the summons was enough and told me show up for my initial court date, plead not guilty, and request a jury trial and things would ""work out"" then he kinda smirks and winks. I repeat his instructions word for word and he against says ""it will work out for you.""


So what the hell? Am I being railroaded? I am most certainly going for a jury trial but what does he have up his sleeve? I cannot afford a lawyer so I want to represent myself. But I am grossly ignorant to the laws of DUI of prescription medication.


Any insight as to what may be going on? Any suggestions on what kinds of defense I should prepare for if it doesn't ""work out"" for me?

I live in Seattle, Washington. I'm the bass player for a local band that I helped create about a year and a half ago with the frontman of the band. In total, there are the two of us, plus a drummer. The drummer was found through a friend of the frontman and although he's 22 years old, he's relies incredibly on his parents and has little independence. Although a strange situation, he fit the bill for our band and was an okay drummer so we used him. 

The frontman and I had been in contact with an entertainment attorney for a few years before the band was founded and before we knew the drummer. We also have a finalized contract that gives the frontman and I 50/50 ownership over the band.

Late last year we decided to record a full-length album at a professional recording studio that the frontman (lets call him Paul) and I had frequented for a few years. The two of us worked night jobs while attending college to pay for the recording ourselves and we asked if the drummer (lets call him Nick) wanted to help pitch in. Although Nick works a full-time job at a restaurant and doesn't go to school and still lives with his parents, he declined, but asked his parents if they wanted to help pitch in. Nick's parents liked our band and agreed to pay 1/3 of the recording cost. 

Fast forward a year. The record is finally done (took forever to work to pay for it) and Nick decides he wants to quit the band even though his parents have invested $1,000 already and were about to pay the final payment of $800. Nick has his parents call me to tell me that he was quitting and couldn't tell me face-to-face and his parents say that if we pay them back the $1,000 they already invested, that they wouldn't press charges or attempt to claim royalties on the album. Since recording started a year ago, Nick's parents have become increasingly hostile because they didn't agree with the band's direction that Paul and I were taking it in. (Nick comes from a hard rock/metal background)

Sorry for the wall of text, but the details kind of matter in this story. It'd be one thing if Nick wanted money back that he had worked for, but this is just his middle-class parents being spiteful, trying to screw over two already-broke college students. We're not even done paying for the work that has already been done by the studio staff, (we're kind of on loan with the owner) and obviously this kind of thing is non-refundable anyways. 

Also, all the songs from the album have been submitted to the library of congress and have already been processed (I have the certificate for them). Nick was listed as a performer and Paul and I were listed as composers/performers. Obviously, we plan on talking to our attorney after the weekend, but our attorney is pricey to consult, so I'd like to be a little knowledgeable on the situation when we talk with the attorney. What are my options here?

She left everything in the will to my greedy uncle. She always liked me, and left me as the Pay On Death (POD) of her bank account. My uncle was furious, but had no claim on the money. I just received a summons to small claims court, for $7800.00. He wants me to pay for the demolition of my grandmother's trailer, and general clean up of the land he inherited from my grandmother's will. Does he have any right to make this claim. And what should I do to prepare for this case?

** Update **
I called the county assessor and asked who's name the property was in currently. Not my uncles... he sold it at a tremendous loss in August of 2012. 

I tried to determine if the mobile home was a part of the sale. I have to wait until Friday to call the county appraiser whom has the information. 

I called the county and asked for the name on the permit submitted for the demolition of the trailer. There was never any permit issued. I had the nice lady send that information in an email.

I have since left a message with the current owners asking if the trailer was demolished by them or my uncle, or if the demo was part of the contract. I haven't heard back, and may not if they demolished it without a permit.

Does anyone know of any court cases that are anything close to this bizarre scenario. I could use some reference or direction to pursue.

*** update #2
Surprisingly I got a call from the new owners. They report that they paid nearly 10k for the job of demolishing the mobile home. I called the construction company and they agreed to send me an official email stating that they did the work.

I am a father on the brink of losing his daughter.

Last night my ex dropped a major bomb on me.  She wants to take my daughter 2,500 miles away to Richmond, Kentucky and she wants to do it by August 14th.  Her husband has a job lined up there and has intents on moving the entire family.  After discussing this over the phone with her she has agreed that they will pay to fly her down every summer, spring break and winter break.  She has agreed that if I drafted some sort of agreement she would sign it and we could go through the process of making it legal if I wanted.  

I may be okay if she moves, so long as I can get a few things agreed upon.  I would like to stop paying her support and instead put it into a fund for my daughter when she goes to college, I feel like this money would do be more beneficial to my daughter if it could be saved for her future.  Also I want her to pay for my daughter's flights back and forth for visitation; I feel that this is only fair considering she is the one moving our daughter so far away.  She already makes almost double what I do and her husband will be starting at around 50k a year.  My household income isn't even six digits and they are edging on 200k.

If she disagrees and things get ugly I may rather try and force her to stay, I can't imagine having her that far a way and never flying to see me.  It would wreck me.  

What are my legal options?



Relevant Information:

We were divorced in Oregon and signed a standard parenting plan.  The plan establishes visitation days being holidays, weekends and summer vacations.  I was ordered to pay $150 a month at the time but have since upped that payment to $300 (verbally).  We now live in Washington and have closed the child support account in Oregon.  Everything since has gone through me to her in the form of checks.  I also am to provide medical insurance if possible which I have for the last 7 years.



Things not ordered that I also provide some of:


Clothes

Music Lessons

School needs

Dental costs




Income:


Myself: 70k a year

Her: 120k+ a year

BP Picked up thousands more USA staff my age, later via merger (Amoco, Arco) and let them keep their richer pensions which are virtually identical to the one BP took away from myself and 600 otherssd.  

We've tried talking to top management about this inequity and they give us the stiff arm.  They don't care  -- but they should as the 600 staff are older and working past their 'natural' retirement in order to have enough to last their golden years.  Several I know have terminal conditions but have to keep working when they could have retired if the pension was worth what was promised.  I understand that the guy at the controls of the Horizon Rig disaster is one such older and infirm worker, and this example underscores the risks BP are imposing on everyone. Watching the TV ads on how BP are 'committed to America' makes me roll my eyes.  

What specifically can we do to get this rectified?  ERISA lawyers say the statute of limitations has expired -- which seems absurd because you could not have even known with certainty the pension value for at least 15 years after the new pension started.

I had a friend living with us that had some ""issues,"" to say the least. She was taking methadone and promised us she was clean, and trying to help her out we let her live in our home and use our car for work.

I had a mental breakdown and ended up in a hospital after a suicide attempt. Upon getting out, I decided to battle my depression and turn my life around. Got a job in Florida at a music festival, $600 for that weekend.(Literally 3 days after getting out of the hospital.) She owed us money so I got her the job as well.

We're driving home one night late (around 3:00amish). I had wanted to leave right after work, but my ""friend"" just had to party. I slept in the car. I woke up to cops in my back window in a TRAILER PARK.

Apparently she had seen a car speeding behind us and pulled into a side road. The cops made her do a sobriety test and I found out her license was suspended, which she had to lied to me about.

They are about to let us go when they spot some blood pressure medication in my cup holder. I was given it to try by my elderly employer for my hot flashes at night. They pull us out and search us both. She has weed on her and a pipe that I wasn't aware of.

They then search her purse, finding a crack pipe (I had to ASK what it was I had no idea.), needles, and an illegal substance they wouldn't tell neither of us what it was.

I was completely clean and sober. Then they get to my center console and find a spoon matted with some green powder, come over to me, and ask me if the car is mine. I said it's my husband and I's (but I'm not on the title.)

I get ARRESTED..... I didn't even know what the substance was and even stated so. My ""friend"" tried lying saying people were in the car. I told them the truth that nobody was in the car, and she was a ""recovering"" addict.

I don't know what to do now. I'm scared this is going to ruin all my job opportunites and my life. Also my husband is in the Navy, which means if I try to fight it and go to trial, he'll be leaving me here alone with no place to live and no car....

I have 5 fulltime employees as well as a couple parttimers, not including myself. Several years ago, on the consensus of everyone working there at the time, I started letting employees bring in their pets to work as long as they met a few basic rules. Rules are pretty simple, the pets need to be house trained (for the most part, accidents happen and if they do the owner has to clean it up), well behaved, and well groomed (no fleas, etc).


Since then I've made it clear to new employees that it was a pet friendly business and it wasn't uncommon to have two or more dogs around. I had no issues with it until recently, in fact everyone working there loved it. 


About 3 months ago I hired a new employee. I went over, verbally, the rules about allowing pets in the office with her and everything was okay until recently. Recently she started complaining about being allergic to dogs, she's even brought in a doctor's note on it. I've made her office a no go zone for pets (dogs already didn't just wander around where ever, but just went with their owners or in the fenced in area outside), but apparently that isn't enough for her and  now says the dogs need to stay home. No thank you.


I was more than accommodating until now and am waiting to hear back from my normal lawyer, but was looking for a wider opinion until then. How far do I have to go to accommodate this employee? Does her bringing in a medical note mean I have to do more? Does it remove my ability to fire her if the issue can not be resolved to her liking (she is refusing to come into work until the dogs go home). While I went over it when she was first interviewed, I didn't have her, or anyone, sign anything saying they understood that this was a pet friendly office. Will that affect the outcome?


Basically I am unwilling to ban pets from my office because one new employee is now claiming to be allergic. I am willing to make certain accommodations (off limit office and even an air purifier for her office), but those changes have thus far not been good enough.

Apparently it's when you lunge at someone in a threatening matter which didn't happen during this altercation whatsoever and if anyone was bucked at, it was me. She unfortunately wasn't dumb enough to admit to assaulting me in the statement she filed. I was allowed to follow the police officer to the magistrates office in my own car even though I was technically arrested. Apparently he had tried contacting me by phone but I hadn't answered because it was from a blocked number. I was told by someone who isn't an attorney but has experience in the legal system that it would probably be dropped because it's not a matter of physical assault, she can't prove it, and it wasn't stated in the initial police report. 

I however would like some real advice on the matter. I have never been in trouble. EVER. The officer stated to me that it was like the procedure for a traffic ticket, but I've never even had a traffic ticket. What going to happen when I go to the preliminary hearing on the 24th? What are my rights? What can I do legally? 

I know I don't need a lawyer for the preliminary hearing. I know I kind of just wait to see what happens then but I'm scared to death and spitting mad, although I wouldn't take any action of retaliation outside of legal boundaries.

2 days after I found her, she was scanned for a microchip (no chip found) and given all of her shots and tests at my vet's office. I felt she should be allowed off my porch and into my home with my current cats as Florida heat is deadly, so I did such.

1370988600.0,15,self.legaladvice,1g5jdb,Landlord evicted me for complaining to HUD?,DaveyTheCat,15,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1g5jdb/landlord_evicted_me_for_complaining_to_hud/,"Hello. Long time lurker on Reddit, first time posting.

I am currently on a HUD assisted rental in WV, USA. Hoping it's temporary aid until my job starts in August.

Today my landlord and his wife came to my door and told my husband that, ""You don't need to come outside for this"". They commenced to scream at him and told him we have until July 31st to ""get out"". My husband tried to reason with them, but the wife was so infuriated at him, he couldn't get a word in since they refused to let him speak.

The reason?

We had a HUD inspector come to our door on the 2nd of June(this month) and he saw a couple unresolved things about this apartment that needed to be fixed but never were. 

1. Electrical box above stove was never covered. Landlord received notification from HUD about that before we moved in. We made note of it to the landlord for two months after, but he dismissed it with either, ""I'll get around to it"", or ""Let me look around and see if I can find something.""

2. Water pressure was poor. The day the HUD inspector came over the water pressure was at 40% of what it is on a good day. The water came out in under half of the holes in the shower head nozzle. There have been days when water has only come out of two holes and we have had to sponge bath and boil water. We've reported this issue twice.

The landlord was infuriated because the HUD inspector wrote them up and gave a report of ""our complaints"". They said, ""HUD don't own us. They can't tell us what to do."" The landlord's wife denied that inspectors check the water. We were scolded for ""complaining"" to HUD(because we couldn't hide the problems from the inspector?). They stormed away saying they would return with the eviction papers. 

The landlord's wife(the owner of the property) yelled at us, saying, ""All you do is complain. We never have a problem with the other renters."" 

We have complained trice about the upstairs neighbor stomping so loudly it makes the glass rattle. The upstairs renters have a child who has lately been running around at 12:30am and 2am. We debated on calling the police, but decided not to. We also decided not to report it to the landlord anymore.

We've also reported to the landlord a few other issues the needed to be fixed or made aware of:

1) Draft in door. Was fixed by landlord.

2) Toilet was leaking and reaching the bedroom carpet.

3) Kitchen floor heater was faint, but fixed itself.

4) Ceiling fan was rattling and just needed a bit of cardboard to prop it.

5) Bedroom floor heater fell off the wall. That was fixed.

My husband and I have kept quiet about the fact there was a mouse in the house and the fact the heating was poor when the bedroom heater fell off it's mount(fire hazard, was touching carpet) so the landlord gave us an electrical box heater. We've refrained from filing noise complaints to the police about the midnight and 2 am stomping. We considered reporting the winter heating issue, but were too worried about getting into trouble with the landlord.

What I would like to know is:
1) Can landlord legally evict people for ""complaining to HUD"" or ""complaining too much"" about issues that need repair?

2) How can I avoid being evicted at all? Do landlord need even the most miniscule of reasons to evict?

3) What should I do if the landlord and his wife come back and yell at us again like they did today? They were so rude, loud and furious. My husband is dealing with depression right now and after they left he  had a breakdown. I have to keep an eye on his medication.

4) How do I prevent the landlord's wife from keeping any damage deposit? She is threatening to keep next month's damage deposit if we don't pay rent for July. I don't know how to protect us from that, or them deciding to ""keep"" some for ""damages""(i.e. the regular wear and tear of small scratches that they might accuse us of doing, or the dent in carpet from chairs)

So I am 23 years old, attending a community college, working and living with my younger brother, my mother and her boyfriend. After a minor disagreement with my mother, her boyfriend informed me that her solution is to change the locks on the residence and bar me from entering whenever the feel like doing so.

Some information on the living arrangements:

* We have been living at the residence for well over a year.

* When we first move here, my mother **refused rent** and would not allow me to pay her rent.

* I am in the process of moving out and we have an agreed upon move out date. (By August 1)

* She has claimed me as a dependent on her taxes


I am under the impression that since the residence is my legal residence, she cannot legally bar me from access the residence. I am also under the impression that since there is no rent/contract/lease, it would default to a verbal contract on a month-to-month basis.

Thank you to anyone and all that responded and helped me through the process of understanding the legality of choosing band names; seems like it's a hard thing to do these days!

That said, I'd like you to read this brief summary of events and tell me if I am legally in the clear to use the name I've chosen:

I thought ""Safaris"" sounded cool, but also realized there was a band in the '60s called The Safaris.  So, I looked on the US Trademark Website and found ""The Safaris"" (musical act/band) trademarked by a Jeff Stewart.  I literally googled his name and hunted down his phone number, and called this now ~65 year old man and asked him if I can name my band Safaris (not use it as a trademark, just use the name).  He said they still do shows occasionally, but he didn't really see a problem with it.

After this, I sent him a full non-disclosed list of press we've gotten, shows we've played, and basically made it clear that I hope to take the project as far as possible.  My motives for telling him all this were that I didn't want him knocking on my door if the project got too ""big"" for his comfort.  He sent me a message back (this is through Facebook messages) that says:  ""You can use the name.  This message serves as confirmation.  Maybe somehow we can both benefit from this!""  For the record, he perform shows as ""The Safaris with Jeffrey Stewart"" and my moniker would be ""Safaris""; a somewhat distinguishable difference, in my opinion, but then again, I have no idea.

So here I am- excited, because I feel like I have this awesome name, but also a bit spooked after what happened (someone contacted me and told me to change my name after months of branding and hard work).  That being said, this guy is doing *way* less musically with ""The Safaris"" than the person is doing with ""The Flamingos"".  Terry Johnson of the Flamingos just got inducted to the Rock-N-Roll Hall of Fame and is still performing.  This guy of The Safaris owns a portrait studio, does a small gig every few months, and has 105 likes on Facebook.

SO: am I legally in the clear?  Do I need to also contact a record label from the '60s, or does written permission from the trademark owner give me legal right to advertise on venues, etc?

Also, just for those wondering why I don't pick a weird, obscure band name: I believe in the power of simple, memorable band names.

I am a Dutch ICU nurse that is living with my wife and two children in Spain.
We used to rent a house of a (Dutch) woman but had to stop that because
she did not do any maintenance. Since we left we are having a lot of 
problems with this woman. Even though she still owes us a lot of money she 
is on our back with the most ridiculous accusations. Recently she even 
threatened to kill my son (2) and me. We found out that she stalked an
English girl (12!) years ago and threatened to burn her. 
Some time ago this woman waited with two male friends in front of
the school of our eldest one. She had no business being there. When
my wife arrived she jumped in front of our car. Luckily my wife stopped.
She then walked to the side of the car and grabbed the head of my wife
through the open window. My wife accelerated and she let herself fall on the 
pavement pretending as if she was hit by the car. After parking the car my wife
spoke to her briefly but was threatened by the two men, so she left.
Apparently the woman was examined in the hospital and the report states she has 
some bruises. My wife and I went to the police straight afterwards and
filed a report. Accompanied by a hospital report stating that my wife had some 
scratches in her neck from the attack.
The case is now in court. We talked to our lawyer yesterday. We have one witness that saw the part when she was next to the open window of the car and let herself drop. The two friends that were with that woman at that moment testified as well. 
They say the woman was dragged 30 meters by the car, which is a blunt lie.
It is very difficult for us to get other witnesses because most Spanish parents do not want to get into trouble with this ‘mad bad lady’. 
Our lawyer told us he cannot garantee that justice will be at our side.
(What is wrong with this world?)
We are in Spain but any advice from around the globe would be very welcome.
What is the best option to proceed in this case?

Thanks a lot.

Forgive me if I trample reddiquette here, I usually comment on league of legends and minecraft posts.

Child custody/support issues are complicated, I'm not going to bother with a tl;dr or summary aside from the title.  I'll try to keep it brief, but it won't be, and I apologize.

My ex has custody of both of our children, I see them every other weekend.

just over 6 weeks ago my ex called me frantic and in tears... ""I can't deal with it anymore, its too much, I need you to take the kids, I don't care about the child support, I just can't do it anymore"".  After calming her down a bit, she revealed to me the following...

1) My son (9), is struggling in school because the teacher refuses to treat him ""special"" due to his ""condition"" (she insists he is severely ADHD and had him medicated for it, out of my control).

2) She can't handle him at home.  He won't do chores, actively talks back and misbehaves, so on.

3) He fights with my daughter (13) constantly and the two are always screaming at each other.  (daughter also refuses to help around the house and is a snotty little brat).

When they are at my house, they are reluctant to do chores, but they aren't particularly snotty or rude about it, just... kids.  They will do them when instructed.  I explain this to my ex and she says I must be living in a fantasy world, to which I ask what kind of rules and guidelines they have at her house.  She explains that she just started giving them chores in the past 2 months (now nearly 4 months ago), and expecting behavior changes from them.  I tried to explain that you can't suddenly drop rules on top of kids who have largely had none for most of their life.  I also explained that I only have them for what amounts to about 4 days of the month, so what little I do accomplish is undone in their time with her, so I understand her frustration to some extent.

She asks me to help her, I remind her I have 3 other children and a wife, so I'll have to take a day or two and figure out what I can offer.  ""That's not good enough"".  After mentioning the school year is almost over, and to hang in there for just a bit longer, she then informs me she's been reported to CPS.

Whenever she (my ex) would do the laundry, she would give it to the children to fold and put away, my son would naturally do what any undisciplined 9 year old boy would do.. he shoved it under his bed.  Under his bed where the household cats would piss and shit on it.  So of course he would wear these filthy ass clothes to school, and eventually someone called CPS.  The truth behind her sudden frantic need for rescue finally revealed, I tell her it's going to take some sorting out, but I'll get back to her in the morning with SOMETHING to sort this mess out.

When I do call her the next day, I offer to take my son full time for a while, to go ahead and pull him out of school a few weeks early and we'd homeschool him and then figure out where to go from there.  Since the bulk of the issues are centered around him, we came up with a plan to help him, but it was made very clear his sister was welcome, and planned for.  She flips her shit and screams ""how dare you try to take my kids away"" and ""i'm the best goddamn mother there is""...so on.  I try my best to talk sense into her over the next 4 or 5 back and forth phone calls, she is absolutely ""no, you can't have them.  You can pay for them like every other asshole that ruins some girls life because he wants to be a daddy.  If you want them so bad, get a lawyer, by the time anything comes of it, everything here will be straightened out and you'll look like a prick, and be stuck with the bill"".  She forgets that my uncle is a family lawyer.  I tried as best I could to calm her down, but ultimately she left me with ""get a lawyer and waste your time"".  So I made a call, he gave me some pretty good advice, but reminded me he doesn't practice anymore and is out of touch with the current laws in TX.

About 2 hours after my lengthy talk with my uncle, she calls back, sobbing apologies for flipping her shit, and asking if my offer to take my son fulltime still stands ""Of course, daughter too if need be""  She refuses to give them both over, but agrees to let my son finish the school week, then pull him out and bring him over full time.  A seemingly small victory in nearly 7 years of bullshit bickering and irrational bitchmode shenanigans.

Fast forward 6 weeks to today.  She texts me asking if I've paid my child support, it's a day late.  I remind her that it is taken from my bank automatically and sent to the state, who then forwards it on to her.  ""Has it come out yet?""  ""Of course it has, thats why I've still not had enough money to get this poor boy some new glasses.  Since we're on the subject, would it be possible to work something on on that?"".

""don't be an asshole.  You have a second income.  I have to pay for everything with credit cards because I can't afford these kids as it is""

She has voluntarily given me full custody of my son, when and how do I go about making it binding, and filing for support?  While I do have a ""second income"" by way of my wife, I also have 3 other children (5 in total, yes you read that right).  We are not on welfare, we are debt free.  Money is fairly tight right at the moment having to pick up all the things my son needs for more than a 2 day visit, and feed him full time, AND pay child support to her... for him.  What seems ""right"" to me may not be what is ""right"" by law, I understand that.  It bears mention my ex makes considerably more than I do, and at the end of the day, brings home just under $2 an hour less than my wife and I combined, so I have zero sympathy for the irresponsible way my ex handles her finances.   We live simply, and on a tight budget, but we manage just fine to stay completely debt free; the last 6 weeks have been extra tight.  All new clothes and shoes for the boy, a bigger, better bed, a desk, and a replacement charger for his laptop have tapped everything we had free to wiggle in.  He's off all those meds she had him on, so his appetite is back and kicking my pantries ass.  It was entirely worth it, but getting the kink of completely destroyed glasses thrown in has left us with 2 options, asking her for an assist (as I have done for her for yearss), or taking out a load/credit card and putting ourselves in a place we really aren't comfortable being.

My question is, her giving me custody of my son, does that hold any weight if I were to file for custody legally, and at what point SHOULD I file, and subsequently file for child support?  I am in DFW Texas.  I can't get a straight answer from the child support office, and my uncle isn't honestly sure, usually custody only changed hands at the order of the court, and he's 10+ years retired.  I'm only looking for a pointer in the right direction, and how I should proceed from here.  I want to just run out and file shit behind her back and slap her in the face with it, but I'm really making a focused effort lifestyle wise to not be an asshole, however justified I may feel it is.",,False,self,t5_2rawz,False,,,True,t3_1es5qp,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1es5qp/ex_couldnt_handle_son_volunteered_him_to_me_child/,

I moved into my apartment on 6/15/12, my lease was to expire on 6/30/13. I pay $950 per month in rent. The building is roughly 100 years old and my apartment was renovated about five years ago. I live on ground level and there is no other apartment directly above my living room, only the roof. The interior walls of my living room are unsealed brick, the floor is concrete, the ceiling is drywall. The living room is large and open. I don't have the measurements with me now, but it's approximately 30 x 15 (450 sq. ft.).

****

**Summary**

* My apartment ceiling has been leaking for four months.
* Since the first leak, most of my living room (285 sq. ft.) has been unusable due to the persistent threat of another leak.
* Repairs were delayed for several months, in part due to miscommunication from my landlord.
* The repairs that have been completed have been absolutely ineffective. It leaks today just as badly as it did in January.
* My landlord has agreed to let me terminate my lease early, but has not agreed to refund the portion of my rent that was paid towards the unlivable living room.

**My Question**

**Am I entitled to recover damages based on the negligence of my landlord?**

**Details**

* **1/30/13** - During a hard rain storm, water comes through ceiling, fast and hard. Water streamed down the west-facing wall, from above the window that looks into my kitchen, and from above the large entry way to my kitchen. There was no property damage -- I moved my items quickly -- but over a 30ish minute period, three large rubbermaid bins were half full with what water I was able to catch. I immediately called ""Alice"", my contact with the company that manages my property. She said there would be someone out to inspect the roof as soon as possible.

* **1/31/13** - Alice calls at 8am, asking for more details on where water leaked through the ceiling. 

* **2/6/13** - I meet the roofer ""Joe"" at my apartment. Without prompting, he says this has been a problem in this apartment before and complains at length about the owner of the building being unwilling to make the necessary repairs. It is his opinion that the walls are the problem, not the roof itself. My west-facing wall (the one that leaked the most) is shared with a two-story building. Joe says that wall needs to be sealed all the way to the top. I email Alice, explain what Joe has told me. She says Joe told her the walls need to be sealed, but she has no knowledge that apartment has leaked before.

* **2/16/13** - I haven't heard from Alice or Joe, so I email Alice asking for an update. Her response: ""I have one quote on the sealing the wall and waiting on another contractor to advise if this is the best approach.""

* **3/21/13** - Unrelated repairs are made to better soundproof a wall in my bedroom that I share with a business. I email Alice asking when repairs for the leak will start. Her reply email: ""We are working with the roofer to get that area sealed.  Currently in line for scheduling.  As soon as we hear back from him, we will let you know.""

* **4/4/13** - I have to make a decision on renewing my lease by the end of the month and repairs for leak still haven't started. I email Alice again asking for an update. Alice forwards my email to ""Eve"", the property owner and my landlord. Eve replies, in part, ""The roofer is special ordering a very unique product that will be applied to the center walls above your apartment and another for the lower part of the side wall."" And, ""The only other option, because you are living in a very old building with old, and porous brick walls, is to sheath the entire exterior wall area with black rubber roofing material.  There is no cost difference but I hate to cover my building with black rubber.  It would be an eyesore from the new park area in the back and my goal is to help downtown Greensboro, not make it look bad."" Note that my apartment is on the back side of my building, facing an empty lot and a bus station. It is not viewable from the street and there is no park. I reply to Eve, saying that I'm happy they are looking into it carefully.

* **4/19/13** - In the nearly three months since the first major leak, there have been several small leaks. On this day, there is another major leak, equal in the amount of water to the first leak. Repairs have not started yet. I email Alice and Eve alerting them to the situation.

* **4/21/13** - Eve replies to my email from 4/19, and says that roofers completed the repairs earlier that week, before the leak. She quickly follows up with a forwarded email chain between her and the roofer, saying, ""Looks like we had a major miscommunication --- mostly my fault as you can see from these emails"". From the email chain, she never followed up with the roofer, who was waiting on her approval to get started.

* **4/24/13** - Repairs still have not started. I have to give my 60-day notice by the end of April. I signed a lease for a new apartment and sent my notice to Alice.

* **5/8/13** - Another major ceiling leak during a storm. I email Alice and Eve. Both confirm that the roofer spent two days working on my roof that week. I was never told he would be there or that he had been there.

* **5/18/13** - Alice emails saying we are expecting a lot of rain over the coming weekend and that the roofer would like to come by during the rain to find the cause. 

* **5/19/13** - Sunday morning, 11 am, my ceiling begins gushing water. I call Alice, get no response, so I email her. She emails the roofer asking him to come by. 6 pm, without notice, the roofer knocks on the door as I'm about to head out. He spends about five minutes taking measurements and reiterates that the walls need to be sealed, just as he told me in February. After he leaves I email Alice and tell her what the roofer told me.

* **5/20/13** - I leave work at 2 pm during a heavy storm. I get home to find that water has been pouring from my ceiling. I email Eve and Alice, asking that my lease be terminated on 5/31 (a month early) and that I be refunded any amount I have paid for the unusable portion of my living room. By measuring that part of my living room and the total area of my apartment, I calculate that amount to be $970.43.

* **5/21/13** - I didn't receive a response to the previous day's email. I try calling Alice but she doesn't answer. I send an other email and get no response. I call Eve. She tells me she needed time to ""cool down"" and was obviously upset that my email said the company had been negligent in assuring the habitability of my apartment. After much discussion she agrees to let me end my lease early (and upon my insistence, puts that in writing) but she won't budge on refunding my rent.

I bought the UN55EH6000 on dells website and my receipt looks like this "" UN55EH6000 Series 6 1080p 240Hz HDTV with $400 PROMO eGift Card""

aweseom! Tv comes and it shows 240 CMR. I googled to see what it was and basically found out the TV was only 120hz. This is where hell started

When i asked dell's "" Customer Service "" about the hz they asked me if i measured the TV horizontally... I said what? no im asking about the hz and he again said did you measure the TV from corner to corner.... Hz is not the god damn measurement.. Customer service was obviously reading from a script or had absolutely NO idea what they were talking about

Moving on they said since dell is just a VENDOR of samsung i had to call them because in dells papers it still says the tv is 240hz. Fast foward to me asking samsung and them having absolutely NO idea what they are talking about either this ends up being the chat log. 

Alex: Do you want to know the refresh rate of your TV?

Alex: We have not heard from you. Do you wish to continue the chat?

Visitor: yes

Visitor: no

Visitor: i dont want to know

Visitor: the refresh rate

Visitor: its 120hz

Visitor: i know that

Visitor: i want my 240hz tv that was stated

Visitor: in the sale and receipt

Visitor: i did not

Visitor: buy a 120hz tv

Alex: Refresh rate of this TV is 120Hz.

Alex: I have double checked it, refresh rate of this TV is 120 Hz and CMR is 240

Visitor: im tired of this run around you are the 4th person ive talked to

Visitor: CMT

Visitor: CMR is not the same as hz

Visitor: ad said 240 hz not 240 cmr

Alex: CMR and refresh rate both are different.

This confirms two things... Samsung also has retarded customer service but it did confirm the tv was 120hz

Now back to Dell. 

I call and ask and LONG 1 HOUR STORY SHORT. The customer service says they can send me a replacement... SAME exact model number. I said no the model number is going to come out at 120hz too i want 240 hz. THESE ARE THE EXACT WORDS OF DELLS CUSTOMER SERVICE REP "" Sir if you google it CMR is same as hz "".. NO ITS NOT, AND YES I GOOGLED IT. then after i said i wanted my replacement they transferred me to returns that said i had to wait at home for them to come pick it up.. SOME OF US HAVE WORK.

Hello everyone,

I'm a university student in Minnesota, sophomore year undergrad. I belong to an honor society called Phi Theta Kappa. They are associated with a group called the International Scholar Laureate Program. The ISLP invited me on a student delegation to Australia to study their health care system, health professionals, and a little cultural extension for about two weeks, all for around $5500 dollars. There was a requirement that one pay for half of the trip on or before March 25th, and the second half on or before April 25th. I paid in full on March 25th.

The person that I spoke to, who I believe was named Travis, or some other 'T' name, worked with me to pay with my bank card. We had some troubles, but T claimed that he worked with citibank previously, and helped me out. After this was all done, I asked if I was to now wait for travel information (I assumed this price included airfare and that I would be mailed tickets and further instructions). T told me that this was correct.

Fast forward to April 25th. I waited because I figured it would take time for things to mail, as things usually do. I had not been contacted in any way, and I was getting rather nervous, as the trip was scheduled to begin on June 2nd. I called the ISLP group, and spoke to a person named Jamal who told me that I had to go to their website, and put in a password that I hadn't been given before.

I went to this website, put in the password, and was brought to a page that I had never seen before. On the page it gave various information like what to pack, what sort of cultural differences there were, and the like. It also told me of the fact that no refunds were given due to cancellation past April 1st, and also that I would have to arrange my own flight to Australia, and gave the information for the travel agency they were booking through.

I contacted this agency, on a friday afternoon. They gave me a list of flights that I would need, highlighted the specially blocked ones in red, and then told me that to book the flights would be about $2294, including fees and taxes. Informed me that I had until monday to book these flights, and that I would need a visa. This email came to me at ten minutes to six on friday. I emailed back immediately, and on Saturday, and then twice today (the Monday that is the time limit) and never got a response. 

I am planning on contacting them tomorrow to ask for my money back. In the event that they refuse, what legal action can I take, if any?

1363644222.0,14,self.legaladvice,1ajvha,"In AZ, thrown in jail for the night for refusal to show identification and urination in public. I didn't urinate, and the cops took my I.D. after arresting me.  Should I fight these charges? ",sanchez1234,15,1,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1ajvha/in_az_thrown_in_jail_for_the_night_for_refusal_to/,"Here’s my story:

On Saturday night (March 16th), I was the designated driver for two of my friends as we all went out to explore some bars.  We left the bar at 2am and proceeded to my car.  I felt like I had to urinate after leaving but all the bathrooms were closed.  I was going to go behind a dumpster, but thought better of it as I took a look behind the dumpster and it smelled horrible and was filled with trash.  I turned around after looking for about 15 seconds and went to meet my friends.  

When I came out from being nearly behind the dumpster, a police officer aggressively rode up to me on his bike and asked me what I was doing behind the dumpster.  I told him I didn’t do anything behind the dumpster.  He didn’t believe me and accused me of urinating behind it and asked for my I.D. so he could write me a citation.

I refused to give him my I.D, seeing as how I didn’t break any laws.  He said if I didn’t give him my I.D. he was going to arrest me and I still refused because I was adamant to resist since I did nothing wrong.  He then cuffed me and pulled out my wallet to search through my stuff.  His partner then told me that in Arizona, an officer can ask for your identification whenever they want as long as they have reasonable suspicion that you broke a law.  This, of course, is thanks to good ol’ SB 1070.

He pulled everything out of my wallet, including my state issued driver’s license, work I.D, and Fingerprint Clearance Card I need in order to teach in Arizona.  Everything he would need to identify me.  They then asked for my social security number and I gave them that.

They still arrested me and threw me in jail for the night. There were two citations on my paperwork: 

1.	Urinating in public
2.	Failure to I.D.

I was not urinating in public. How could I be arrested for this?
I had multiple forms of identification on me, which they saw. How could I be arrested for this? 

I was given the option to go to trial and fight it, to which the prosecutor said I would lose, or enter into an adult diversion program and get the charges removed from my record.  Because I wasn’t sure whether or not I could lose my teaching certification in AZ if I get a conviction, I said I would do the diversion program.  However, I want so badly to fight this and I think I still can if I so choose.

I believe that I was held overnight because of Arizona’s SB 1070 law and to verify my immigration status, and this is where I think it gets kind of weird.

On my arrest paperwork, the arresting officer wrote that my race and ethnicity are white.  I am not white.  My last name is Sanchez, and my skin is very much brown.  If he couldn’t see that when he was standing less than a foot away from me, how could he possibly see me peeing behind a dumpster from 30ft away (which I actually was never even doing)?  

Or could it be that he wrote that I was white on the paperwork because I was arrested for “violating” SB 1070 and the police department wants their officers to record that Mexicans that are being arrested are white so that it doesn’t look like they are only arresting Mexicans that “violate” the law?

I have no idea if mis-recording my race and ethnicity really matters at all, but I really don’t believe that it’s an easy mistake to make, considering my last name and skin color, so I would love to know what some of you think about this.

Regardless, what I really want to know is: 
1.	Should I fight this?
2.	Is it worth it?

Any advice helps.

TL;DR I was arrested for peeing in public and not providing an I.D. when asked.  I didn’t pee in public and the officer took and examined multiple forms of identification from my wallet after arresting me.  I was held in jail overnight.  Want to know if I should fight these charges.  Also, the officer wrote my race and ethnicity as white when I am clearly not white.  I think this may be because they do not want to make it look like they are only arresting Mexicans when enforcing SB 1070.

1359384385.0,15,self.legaladvice,17fhkt,I suspect something is terribly wrong with my children. Husband has custody. I have an appointment with a lawyer this afternoon. I just need some kind of reassurance before then.  Colorado/Missouri,legaladviceme,20,5,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/17fhkt/i_suspect_something_is_terribly_wrong_with_my/,"Apologies for the long title and the throwaway. I wasn't sure of how to title this, and I am using a throwaway so that no one who knows my user name will see this pop up in my history of posts/comments.

Summary Backstory: I divorced my husband 6 years ago. He got physical and legal custody for a time because I was institutionalized for depression after a sexual assault.We had a change in the custody agreement a few years ago, granting me summers and alternating holidays. The girls ( we have two girls, ages 7 and 13) are brilliant and wonderful and I love being a part of their lives again. I remarried around the time the order was changed and moved to Colorado to be with my husband. Here I am stay at home wife to an corporate accountant ( they aren't all boring), and am expecting our first child. I still go to therapy and a rape recovery group. 

My ex and I had a brutal divorce. He blamed me for being alone and getting raped, and  subsequently ruining our lives and the marriage. I asked for the divorce. He fought me every step of the way. I didn't fight him on custody. He was a good father, and I was sick. I couldn't have cared for the girls on my own and recovered. 

Today: I pay him child support ( or my household does), and the girls come to me in the summers and every other December holiday. I would love to see them more now that I am better, but I understand that 5 years is a long time, and that Missouri is their home, not Colorado.

My ex joined a church a year ago.The girls live within some sort of compound that I am not allowed to go inside because "" I committed adultery, and it is pure ground"". Fine. Whatever. I can come see the at another location when I would visit ( I have family in the area that I occasionally fly in to see and would stop by and see the girls) or pick them up ( I would sometimes fly in to get them when it was time for me them to come see me). They came to see me over the December holiday (they attend a church school so it starts back later) and some very bad things were noticed. My youngest repeatedly called me a whore. Not that "" I hate you, you are whore kind of thing"", but an actual biblical whore. She repeatedly told me that I would burn for what I did to my family, and that the baby growing inside me was an "" abomination towards god."" I asked her who told her that. She said her preacher did. I immediately called her father. He said that the church was only teaching her what the truth about the world was, and it was his decision what they learned on his time. A few days later I entered the room to tell her that it was time to go to bed, she immediately started throwing objects at my belly ( I am very pregnant). When I asked her why because she could hurt the baby, she said god wanted the baby to die. 

She also refuses to eat at all on Sunday because the church says they can not eat at all on Sunday. I asked her if she does this routinely and she said she never eats on Sunday. Called her father he denied it. I don't know what to believe but that kid refuses to eat at all on all the Sundays she was with me. 

With my older child, I had none of the above problems but she seemed very withdrawn. I walked in her at one point pleasuring herself to the most violent porn I have ever seen. We installed a security software on the computers to solve the problem immediately, and I sent her to a child therapist friend of mine who could maybe talk to her about why she needed to view those images. I did this mostly because she refused to talk to me about it. The therapist saw her twice in that month, and all she was able to get her to say was that she "" liked it."" My friend wants to continue with the therapy, but her dad is refusing by saying that it is probably just a phase and that therapy won't help her.

Honestly, I am scared, and I don't even know where to begin. I am the last person in the world to criticize his parenting, but I know these girls and they weren't like this before. They use to be happy and now they just seem off. I know my ex thinks I am just trying to ruin his life again. I told him about everything and how we should work together to help them, but he thinks that, like everything, I am just making all this up or a bigger deal than it should be. 

I am very pregnant ( 9 months), and I can't travel to Missouri to get them, if something goes wrong. My husband would have to go. They leave to go back home at the end of the week and I am terrified to let them go back. 

**tl;dr** My ex has custody of my children. I get them on some holidays and summers. They are acting very strange all of sudden. Could be abuse. I will do something. Where do I start? I am a several states away. 

Questions: How do I even start to investigate this further? Do I just tell my lawyer the whole story and let her handle it? Do I need to do anything further? For all I know, the problems could stem from a number of things. I am not therapist. The therapist I have doesn't have enough information to tell me that it is definitely abuse. She needs more time that I don't have. I mean they have been through a lot. A mom who went into treatment for a while. A new family popping up ( my husband and baby). Their dad is dating someone new. There could be a host of problems, but the things that happened seem extra-abnormal to me, but again, I am not a professional. Can I force him to have them see a professional for help?         

This sounds messy so I totally understand if the only advice you give me is to talk to my lawyer. Or if you have no advice at all. That is okay. Feel free to ask questions for clarity. 

Thanks so much! I really, really appreciate it!

Edit: Change am to not because I am NOT a therapist. Just wanted to repeat that to anyone who read it. I forgot the not so to clarify, I am not a therapist.

We were going no more than 25-30 mph when the lady in front of me braked suddenly and it was slippery, so I hit the back of her car.  I was in an 02 Impala, she was driving a 04-06 Lexus RS400 (the SUV).  Her car had basically no visible damage, small scratch on bumper and she thought her tail pipe was hit as well.  No air bags were deployed.  We pull over, she says she is fine.  Cops come, no ambulance was called.  When I asked her if she was okay, she said ""Yeah, I'm fine."".  However, in my state (Wisconsin), it is mandatory to have car insurance and she did not have any so her car was towed.  (Why a woman (white lady, probably 40-55) would be driving a Lexus without insurance is beyond me).  But anyway, yesterday, I get a call from my car insurance company letting me know that this lady is now intending to sue my insurance company and myself for medical expenses.  (Apparently she didn't have health insurance either, I guess).  My insurance company said they are planning on doing an investigation because this raised some red flags for them.  Now, I'm just wondering what can/should I do at this point?

1357836681.0,13,self.legaladvice,16bkhz,My boss keeps harassing me. I've been to HR twice and nothing has changed. Could I quit and still collect unemployment or possibly sue?,Sademployee,17,4,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/16bkhz/my_boss_keeps_harassing_me_ive_been_to_hr_twice/,"I've been employed to this company for the past year and a half and since the first day my boss has been creepy pervert who constantly harasses me, both mentally and sexually.

Some examples: The first day I was hired I was on the ground setting up and plugging in my computer and my boss says to me: ""We usually wait a little longer for our female employees to get on their knees."" He will also take innocent things and turn them dirty. I went to him because I got hurt doing a task he asked me to do. Rather than filing an injury report, he simply said: ""Now you're a workin' girl! .. not like that haha!"" I didn't find it to be funny at all.
Just being around him makes me uncomfortable, but some occasions that made me feel especially uncomfortable are when I walked in on him having phone sex with his wife, and walking into his office to see another female coworker sitting on his lap.

For mental harassment, he pretty much dehumanizes me. He'll give me a new task I've never done before and he will not train me or give me any instruction, but expects me to get it right 100%. If I screw up even a little he yell at me and say things like: ""This task was not hard. A trained monkey could do it. What is wrong with you? Are you really that stupid?""

My boss will also treat me differently than everyone else. Last time we did a supply order, I asked him if I could order a box of pens and a new calendar for the new year and he told me ""No."" All of it would have amounted to less than $20, but I'm not worth that much, but the chick who sits on his lap, she can buy $60 worth of markers, even though she does data entry work.

Last month I finally got the guts to go to HR. They didn't seem to do anything, and I'm not sure if they even filed a report because I didn't have to fill anything out or sign anything. They talked to my boss but the behavior didn't changed much, to the point where I went back to HR. Again no change.

I don’t know what to do about this. I don't want to work here anymore because of it. I'm now suffering of anxiety, depression and self esteem issues that I never had before working here. There are days that my boss is so cruel to me that I just want to lock myself in my office and cry, something I would have never done in the past.

The only issue is, I can't really quit because I need the money. I'm currently looking for employment else where and have been doing so for the past 4 months with no luck. The only way I'd be able to quit is if I am able to collect unemployment. Because this is a harassment case, would I still be able to get it?

I went to a party with two friends, had a few drinks (i'm 21), and some people were smoking a joint. I don't smoke weed and this happens at almost every party so I thought no big deal. 5 police cars, which seems ridiculous, showed up for a noise complaint. They knocked on the door and everyone moved to different rooms. I only knew two people at this party and no one that lived there. A person that lived there opened the door, and said 'i smell marijuana, can i search?'. 

They told the cops they can't search and they took everyone out on the porch and got their IDs. 3 hours passed of them 'waiting for a warrant' and then the people that lived there finally let them search. They found 1 really small bag of marijuana, a scale in the kids room, a joint in the bathroom, and a bong in the basement. I didn't know about anything besides the joint. 

Anyways, they never read any miranda rights and told everyone that they could leave and that only the people living there would get charged.  A month in a half later, my two friends and I get letters saying we're being charged with possession and paraphernalia.  

I had no idea cops were allowed to do this. How can i be charged with possession without possessing something? and charged with paraphernalia that i had no idea existed? especially when i didnt even know anyone at this party. If there is marijuana in the house and no one claims it. Isn't it the person that owns the house's liability?

I already have a lawyer to talk to. I'm just curious why this is possible and if i can get out of the charges completely. I feel completely innocent.

Help!",2catsandadog,16,5,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1jpsoc/got_fired_for_speaking_up_at_a_private_center_for/,"Last Friday, I was fired from a private center for autism in the suburbs of Chicago, IL. The **only** reason HR cited was my ""negative attitude."" I asked her for written documentation of the reasons why she was firing me and she refused. I asked several times (even offering to simply record the conversation with my ipad and was denied every time). To clarify, the negative attitude she is citing is my vocalization of big issues within the school that they did not want to address, such as students not receiving speech for 8 months when their IEP's mandated that they get that service. She also mentioned that I ""bashed"" the school in public, although that was not a reason she cited when I asked on what grounds she was letting me go. Again, the only clear reason she told me was my ""negative attitude."" 
	
By ""bashing"" she is referring to a few weeks ago when myself and a about ten other coworkers went to a restaurant after work and we were ALL talking about issues within the school. Nothing slanderous, all factual events and actions. When she brought that up, I asked her why I was being singled out and she said there was a complaint about me. I'm not sure how truthful she is being because it sounded pretty ambiguous when I questioned her about it. 

We do have an employee handbook and there is nothing in it about a ""negative"" work environment or anything. I got along great with my coworkers and even better with my kids. 

I am not the only one who has spoken up at that school, but curiously enough, anyone else who has spoken up (including more than 5 high-ranking employees) has been fired or forced out. The reason I would like to look into the legality of this event is maybe be able to stop their pattern of silencing every voice that identifies issues, some of which aren't legal within the boundaries of ISBE.

So, my question for you lawyers out there...Is it legal for them to fire me without any sort of three strikes, without any documentation of my ""negative attitude"", or without any reason pertaining to how I did my job? Is it legal for them to let me go without documentation? thank you so much!

This happened this week and i agreed to work. I have worked my 40 hours this week, Sunday will give me 8 hours overtime. I got a call from my boss yesterday, saying that he would like us to flip our schedule next week so that I would work 48 hours this week, then 32 next week. The other employee would then work 32 hours this week, 48 hours next week.

His reasoning for this is so that the other employee would not have to use his PTO. He also wants us to fill out our time cards (we manually fill out time sheets) normally, as if we both worked 40 hours a week.

The time card part is what I don't agree with. I feel that its not the saving PTO he is worried about, but its paying me the overtime. When I said I wasn't comfortable changing my schedule and basically lying on the time card he said that some companies just change the employees schedules and that's how it is. He then said that work is very slow and he wouldn't want to see me have to get laid off.

I don't mind if he changes my schedule, I just feel that if I work 48 hours in a week, then I'm due 8 hours overtime. My understanding is that my two week paycheck should show 72 regular hours, and 8 hours overtime. I'm not sure if the being laid off part was a threat or not, but by the tone of voice I feel it was.

I approached him, asked for his name (which he refused) and so I held up my phone (recording video) in order to get an image of him so we could file a complaint. 

He then proceeded to push me back, hitting my hand, phone and face. He did this two times. I have this all on video.

Later I talked to him and his coworker (who may have been his supervisor)  which I recorded audio of the conversation. During this conversation he said ""I did not touch you, I pushed you out of my way.""

I had a few questions:
1)How would I go about pressing charges? The train was passing through multiple states. I'm not certain of where exactly we were when he touched me, but I have timestamps.

2)Is my video evidence admissible? Audio evidence? I said, I'm recording you on video after he pushed me, is the stuff before that able to be used?

3)At one point he said ""You don't take pictures of [company name] employees on the train, you don't do that."" Is this protected under my legal rights, or is this private property?

Houston, to be specific. My wife and I have 3 children, and we recently developed an ant problem. Our apartment is always well kept.

We notified maintenance multiple times of our issue, and last Saturday morning, my call was finally answered by the maint. manager. We requested that they come and resolve our issue. We requested that no major chemicals be used as we have small children, but if they do use major chemicals, to warn us ahead of time. We left for about an hour and a half, which is when the real fun started.

We came home, and my 11 month old son was sleeping, so we took him upstairs and laid him down. My 2 year old and 9 year old went upstairs as well, and I came down and saw a bug fogger in our kitchen. My wife immediately went to the apartment office, at which time we were told by the lady who works there that we had to get everyone out because the chemicals were toxic, and we had to wait at least 2 more hours to come back. I ran back to the apartment, got my kids into the car, and went back to the office. I informed the lady working there that I expected a call from the owner ASAP to remedy the problem.

That was last Saturday. I called her again Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, as I had not heard back. Wednesday, she informed me that there is nothing more that she can do to have the apartment owner call me, and that I needed to send him my complaint via certified mail. I asked her why he wasn't willing to contact me, and she WENT OFF. She said that she did all she can do, and that it seems to her that I think we're the only ones with problems, and why am I bitching at her, she told me what to do, and that's all she can say.

Long story short, I need to know what to put in this letter to the owner, and what I am legally entitled to. I understand there there is supposed to be at least 24 hours notice before pest control happens in an apt in the state of TX. The night it happened, my oldest daughter and I got very sick, and my wife dealt with a 3 day migraine afterwards. We did not seek out medical treatment as I don't currently have insurance.

Anyway, citing not feeling like she really fit in, she started saving up to move back to her home state (Florida). She left on the bus in maybe April, claiming to come back with a moving van for her stuff by mid May. She even suggested that the BF prepare a contract so that she'd be legally obligated to pay him the money back, and that she'd be willing to sign it. She never showed up to sign the contract or to get her things. She has completely dropped off the face of the earth. No responses to phone calls/e-mail/facebook, no forwarding address. Nothing. She's technically still on the lease at his place since she signed it before making the ultimate decision to move and skipping town. (She obviously hasn't paid any rent this summer though.) In all honesty, this girl could be dead right now and we wouldn't know.

The roommate was a hoarder and left 2 bedrooms and a basement full of crap in the house that he rents. Much of it was junk and trash, but we've also managed to recover tons of video games, consoles and other electronics, cds, dvds, comic books, and signed memorabilia. He'd like to recover some of his cash. 

Question: Does the BF have any obligation to take care of her stuff, or can he rightfully sell it to make back some of the money she owes him? We really don't expect her to come back, but on the off chance she does he'd like to make sure his bases are covered.

his mother put a lien on the family's van to secure the loan. the van is in my boyfriend's name, with his consent, because the family needed a car and no one had the credit to get one except for him. he recognizes now that this was a huge mistake, but what's done is done. the van has been paid for in full for months. 

he got a phone call yesterday from the loan agency. they told him that the van in his name is going to be repossessed this week because the loan has gone unpaid. they have refused to tell him what the amount of the loan is or why they allowed his mother to take out this loan when he is an adult, wasn't there, didn't sign any paperwork, and consented to nothing. 

today he went to the police and they told him that they don't believe it's a criminal matter because the title to the van is in his name- how does that render the fact that his mother stole his information and took out a loan without a consent invalid? how is it not identity theft that she TOOK his SSN and information and got a loan without any permission from him? 

we aren't sure how to really progress from here. he filed a police report but the cops were not remotely helpful and told him that all they could do was suggest he get a copy of his credit report from the bank. he's extremely concerned with not being able to have the loan or the repossession taken off of his credit without this being classified as fraud. does anyone have any idea of how to progress or what should/will/can happen here?

As my title says, I am suing my landlord for my security deposit.  

Here is the background information.

My girlfriend and I moved out of our apartment in the end of April 23rd or 24th.( I'm not positive, I don't have the documents in front of me at the moment stating the exact day.)  Our landlord said we were great tenants in an email and  and in person ,said we would be getting our deposit back.  We live in Wisconsin where the landlord has 21 days after the move out date to get the deposit back to the tenants. 

We have been waiting ever since to get the deposit back ( Its July 4th now) .  We have contacted him sometimes more than once a week by phone and email.  He rarely reply's and when he does, he says he will be getting to us.  

We sent a certified letter stating we would file a claim against him if we didn't get our money.  He replied to us shortly after saying he would get it to us.  That was almost two weeks ago.

I filed a suit against him, it cost $94.50 USD for the court date and $40.00 for the Sheriff's Department to serve him.  In Wisconsin you can sue for double, and get any courts cost back .   He hasn't been served yet, but he sent an email today stating he wants to give us the money next Tuesday.  

I plan on meeting him, if he shows up.   

My questions are:

Do I ask him for the court costs when I see him?   

What do I do in general?

Any advice?

Remember when I told you guys about the photographer that ended up having to bail on me due to her due date falling basically on my wedding? Well, I am having some serious issues getting my deposit back from them.
Let's see... I originally had spoken with her on May 13th, and she assured me that I would be getting my money back. So I waited.
And waited.
Two and a half weeks went by. I contacted her again. A few days later (now over three weeks out) I got a response back from her. ""Give it a few days to see if it'll turn up; if it doesn't, we'll cancel it and send another one out.""
Three days later, it showed up in my mailbox. The check was dated for June 5th, but the postmark was the 13th. I'm not stupid, but I opted to let it slide. Deposited it on the 24th (first chance I was able to get out to the bank.) And whaddya know, it bounced. So on top of having $550 less in my account than I had anticipated having this month, I have also been hit with fees. Needless to say, I'm livid.
Normally, I'd be all for paying for all of this stuff on card. But my mother is paying for the wedding, and she didn't even make a debit card an option; she wants literally everything in check form. So I don't know what my options are now. I let her know about the check bouncing, but I have yet to get a response from her. I feel like she's now purposely avoiding me. I'm willing to give her a couple of days (in the likely event that she is doing weddings this weekend) before I start calling down the fire and brimstone.
I guess what I really want to know is if this is in fact lawyer-worthy, or if I need to try a few other options first. I am just so freaking upset that this is happening... objectively, I can say maybe they had the money in the account when they first sent the check, and it was my fault for not depositing it immediately upon receipt, but honestly I'm not feeling like that's the case. Given how hard I had to fight to get it sent out at all, I feel like they were just trying to stall until they couldn't anymore.
Idk. What do you think?

**EDIT: I did manage to hear back from her finally (we've been in correspondence over FB for this thus far) and her husband/second shooter is going to be meeting with us to give us the amount in cash, in person. Not sure if that's particularly shady or not, but... I do still have all the conversations saved. Would it be prudent to have them check the bills at the bank before I put them in for deposit? Or would that make me seem really extra shady? Anyway, thanks all! Much appreciated, and I'll keep ya posted.**

I wanted both to let people know how the case was progressing, and also ask for more advice.

I submitted a tip through the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and was contacted by an investigator in Delaware the next day.

He seems to be confident that he could get a search warrant for my father's house based on the evidence already available, but wanted to speak with my sisters about what happened to them.  I explained that my younger sister is in the early stages of coming to terms with what my father did to her, and has so far not been open to participating in legal action against him.

He seemed very understanding about that, but would like to get an affidavit from her to strengthen the case for the search warrant, and to have something else to go on if the search doesn't turn up anything that meets the legal definition of child porn.

His description of the affidavit:

&gt;In terms of the affidavit – this is the court  document that I swear to which supports the issuance of the search warrant. When I complete the affidavit, I  take it to the deputy Attorney general assigned to this unit. She will review the document and make suggestions or edits and hand it back to me. This is a face-to-face encounter as she works in this office. After her review, I take it to a court to get it approved. In this case, since there is a state employee involved I typically take it to another county. I normally use New Castle County, since it lessens the chance that the person is known. After the judge reviews the affidavit, he/she signs it and gives me a the signed original. A copy is placed in a sealed file until such time that the warrant is executed. When the warrant is executed, I leave a copy of the warrant and the application at the residence or with the responsible party. I do not leave my affidavit. After the warrant is served, I do a “return” to the court. This is a comprehensive list of all evidence that is seized in the warrant. The return is a document that is then mated up with the warrant and placed back in a file. If an arrest is made, the defense attorney gets a copy of the search warrant in the discovery process. This is the part of the process wherein the defense is able to see the evidence that is to be used against them in court. Typically, these records are not publicized, but the affidavit will be shared with the defendant, most assuredly.

I guess my main question at this point, as I prepare to talk to my younger sister more about all this, is whether her submitting an affidavit that would be made available to my fathers' defense attorney in the event of his arrest would put her in a position of eventually being summoned for testimony/cross examination, and various other things that would be extremely traumatic and drawn out.  These are the things that she specifically has wanted to avoid.

It may be that it isn't possible to avoid these things in the long run, but I'd at least like to know exactly what I'm asking her to sign up for.

My roommate is allowing a crazy couchsurfer to live here with no respect for my safety or comfort and I am financially unable to relocate.  What are my options?**


Detailed:


In January of this year, I found a room for rent at an affordable $600 a month, just off Venice Blvd.  Utilities were included and the location was convenient -- easy access to my dispensary and my awesome job that gave me a chance to be productive in spite of my unpalatably ugly disabilities.  I met the people in charge -- the daughter whose name is on the lease (for credit purposes) and my roommate, her daddy whose kids are all grown, some with kids of their own.  Great!  Responsible adults!  They were chill with me, I was chill with them, and to show good faith, reliability, and responsibility, I happily paid two months' rent up front.  I gladly shared my toilet paper, paper towels, PUR-water filter, microwave, bananas, grapes, entire tupperware containers of crockpot recipes made with fresh produce and meat, and the occasional blunt.  How else was I supposed to show my appreciation for included utilities?


But one fateful day, my roommate decided that he wasn't making enough money for rent and took in some crazy dude who just got out of jail for *making criminal threats towards an MTA bus driver* (arrested on May 10th, moved in on June 10th) to sleep in the living room, complete with paranoid stories about how ""all the bus drivers are out to get me"".


After he barged into my room while I was asleep to help himself to some of my weed (while my roommate was gone), I had to replace my doorknob with one that locked from the inside and required a key to get in.  I gathered up my toilet paper, paper towels, extra water filters, microwave, and non-perishables and moved everything into my room, so as to sacrifice as little of my comfort to an unwanted visitor as possible.


One night (while my roommate was gone) I had my friend-with-benefits over for a late night visit and the dude pounded on my door begging for ""just a little pinch of weed for my pipey.""  (He actually said that, like a fucking little KID.)  After I've calmly told him that I'm on a fixed income, could not spare any of mine for the rest of the month, and closed the door in his face, he stomped angrily away and swore like a fuckity-fuck-fuck-fucking goddamned pirate back to his floor mattress.


A couple of days later (while my roommate was gone -- are you seeing a pattern yet?), I was wearing my headphones and felt a series of urgent, violent thumps cascading beneath my feet.  I took them off to hear muffled yelling and banging from right outside of my room.  I was scared to even move from my chair.  Eventually the noise subsided.  Surely the neighbors would have called the police by now, I called my friend-with-benefits to tell her to come pick me up, and I was still on the phone when I heard a timid knock at my door.  I answered it to find a very strong-looking policewoman asking me to step out of my room and put my hands behind my back.  ""Am I under arrest?"" I asked, and they replied that no, it was for everyone's safety -- the fucking dude had the audacity to say ""throwawaymyroomie was making the noise!  I had to leave because he was acting all crazy, maaaan!""  See, he was trying to get me taken away on a mandatory 72-hour psychiatric hold so he could go into my room and wreak whatever havoc he desired.  So with two peoples' words against each other whose names aren't even on the lease (fuck me, right?), the cops had no choice but to shake their fingers at us and say ""down boys down"".


Easier said than done.  I went out and bought a webcam and started recording 24/7.  Earlier today I woke up to him [throwing this tantrum](http://vocaroo.com/i/s10Rh7uZaDZn) (while my roommate was gone) -- link to sound file because I don't know how to blur faces in PowerDirector.  You could hear me peek outside my bedroom door to see what all the commotion was and closing it quietly when I saw him storm down the hallway.  After he left, I checked out the damage -- [here](http://i.imgur.com/6wRYLxgl.jpg), and [here](http://i.imgur.com/1y5CTem.jpg).  When the roommate came back, I told him what had happened, played him the video, and reiterated that I had nothing to do with the issue that set him off.  His response?  ""You pay rent, and so does he, and he's not going anywhere, so if you don't like it, YOU can move.""


The troubles are:  1.  As I've mentioned before, I have some unpalatably ugly disabilities that seems to encourage others to view me as a money tree, so none of my concerns are valid in the eyes of my roommate or his daughter.  2.  While I am lucky enough to have a job to supplement my guaranteed steady stream of income, the revenue isn't enough to feasibly save up for a deposit on a new place plus the cost of movers in a safe amount of time.  So it would appear that I'm stuck here, living off of food that doesn't require using a fridge, limiting myself to one bottled water a day, taking sponge baths and brushing my teeth at work before clocking in, and catching shut-eye in the rare quiet moments that prevails.  I don't feel safe leaving my room unless it's straight to the front door to go to work.  The police obviously aren't going to do anything since we're not on the lease and they've left the mediation into the hands of my roomie who doesn't care as long as his rent gets paid, and get this -- even with the addition of a third party, not only am I still paying the same amount of rent, but because of this drama (and because I'm a handicapped retard and people takes advantage of me), **my** rent has been raised by $50.

My house was entered by police without permission, I was arrested and charged. details inside.",freakazoid318,20,7,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1frdc5/i_live_in_kansas_my_house_was_entered_by_police/,"Ok, so i actually just got out of jail, so ill start from the beginning. please forgive any grammatical errors i haven't been able to sleep in days.

  So I was at work, i had only been there for about 30 minutes before receiving a phone call from my 8 month pregnant wife, saying that the cops were at my apartment, they made her exit the apartment and would not allow her to re enter. She was half-naked, and my daughter without shoes. they were not allowed to even re-enter my home to get dressed. at this point my wife is absolutely hysterical, crying and begging for me to get there, saying that the cops needed me to come there and grant them permission to search the house (even though they had already entered the first time without permission to remove my girlfriend and my child from the residence)


 At this point, im pretty pissed about a few things. one, the cops making my 8 month pregnant wife sit outside without any of her necessities (shoes, car keys, proper clothing, etc )but i know that i cannot go there freaking out or i will be arrested and then they'll be able to search my house regardless.


 My wife tells me they knocked and she looked out the peephole, and didnt see anyone. she heard another knock and thought it was strange so she opened the door. The two officers were hiding so she couldnt see her. They tell her they had a complaint about weed smoke (which they didnt, all of my neighbors are my friends and most smoke as well, the only neighbor that i dont get along with wasnt even at home so she couldnt have called them) and asked her for permission the enter the house, she said no because she isnt techinally a resident as her name is on the lease and they would have to ask me, at this point they immediately step inside the house and remove my wife and daughter, and search for ""anyone else in the house for their own protection"". Yeah. Right. Like my 3 year old and my pregant wife could be harboring some dangerous fugitives in there.

 So i leave work to come home, by the time i get there, there were 3 cop cars all parked in front of my house. I think ok, whatever i live here im going to go inside my house and tell my wife and child they can to. Not the case. two police officers stood in front of my wide open door, shoulder to shoulder with their arms crossed, saying they will not allow me to enter my house. So i naturally feel like im being taking advantage of, and all around straight bullied by the police officers. My wife and daughter are outside half naked and without shoes, and i have police officers telling me i cant go in my own house, nor can they to get properly dressed.

 By now i've had more than enough of the police harassing my family, so i call my lawyer. he advised me what they are doing is illegal and that if i go inside my house and they arrest me, ""good"". The only problem is there are two cops in front of my door, blocking the entrance. I obviously cant enter through the front door, i would have to move the cops, which is what im sure they wanted me to do. add on a nice assault on an officer charge to. I brainstorm a little bit and realize my back window is unlocked. im not being detained, im allowed to leave, i have my keys.. so i do... only to park my car a distance aways so i can climb into my house via the back window. everyone wins, i get in my house, i didnt have to move any police officers, and now they cant enter without their warrent.


 Well the cops start to wonder 'where im at"" so the officer comes into my house, again without permission. This time he arrests me.
In my house. Which again, he was not given permission to enter. Looking back, i should have shut and locked the door instead of just trying to get a few things, but the way these cops were acting i expected a door to be kicked down and me to be beaten, so i hesitated to shut it.


 At this point ive been there for about an hour already, when they placed me under arrest. I sat in the back of a cop car with NO A/C on and the windows up on a HOT summer day in kansas. It was probably 97-100 degrees. I sat in there for 2 hours before i was allowed air and for my wife to give me water. I forgot to mention earlier, but while i was talking to my lawyer on the phone the first police officer had said ""OK ill take that as a no, im going to go get a felony search warrant and tear your house down until i find it."" this was before i was arrested, and my lawyer told me to enter the house.


 Back to the story, so the officer finally returns, about 4-5 hours after he had left to get the warrant, it was approved and they break out the dog. They run the dog through my house, they find nothing. The first cop is fucking PISSED now, because he thinks i flushed my weed down the toilet. Which i didnt, i didnt have enough time to before the other cop entered to arrest me. So he threatens to charge me with felony destruction of evidence or something of the sort. Im actually quite hysterical at this point, as to how their ""drug dog"" couldnt find my half ounce of high grade weed that was literally 5 feet away from the front door. I could have sniffed it out myself if i didnt even know where it was.

 Anyways, i just told him i didnt destroy any evidence, that i just wanted to grab a few personal items out of my house. They put the dog up and two of the three cops go inside to absolutely destroy my house trying to find the weed. While they were ripping thru my stuff, i even told them i would show them where its at if they would stop destroying my house. i was told to be quiet theyll find it on their own. 

 So it takes them about an hour to find my jar of weed, which was located next to my bong and my digital scales (I dont sell weed, i just dont like to get ripped off if im paying for the high dollar). So as you can imagine, i get charged with three things

*Possession of a controlled substance

*Possession of a controlled substance with the intent to distribute

and the final one, a real kicker

*Felony interference with Police duties


Before everyone tells me to get a lawyer, i already have one, and he personally thinks he can beat this case with ""the tip of his dick"". He's a great lawyer, but pricey. Im confident we will get this taken care of, I just want to know what everyone thinks, and is what the police officers did legal?


Also, on my paperwork, im not on probation, but it says im not allowed to possess, or be under the influence of alcohol or drugs and that I can be subject to ""random drug screenings"".. well i dont have a PO and I dont have to see the judge again until 9/11/13, so im a little confused as to what this means also? is it basically a ""dont fuck up again with drugs or alcohol or we will can your ass so hard"" or are they actually gonna send random cops to find me and make me pee for them? I think ill probably just get a UA in september when i go in to court, but id really like to know what you guys think it is.


I meet with my attorney again tomorrow morning to go over anything.


Oh, i also forgot to say that mine and my wifes phones were both confiscated and they are refusing the return them. My cell phone has my life on it. without it i cant access many things i need to (email account, passwords, calendar dates for appointments, etc.) it is also important to note the phone is not actually mine, it is my fathers. I work for his business and am on the business line for, well, business calls. my job, i NEED my phone back, can they really detain it?

Please help me out reddit, if you can answer the questions, or even just give me advice on the situation. I just want to know if the cops did everything legal and such. You guys are awesome, pre-thanks for the help!

She self represented herself.
The mother refused to allow an adjournment so I could retain council and prepare responding material. 
In October 2012 the courts dismissed this contempt motion, and I was considered the successful party.
The courts acknowledged the following in the Cost Endorsement.
1. There was no merit to the Respondent's Contempt Motion.
2. The respondent did not present her concerns prior to commencing litigation.
3. The Respondent did not provide notice of her intentions or an opportunity to negotiate a resolution of her concerns.
4. The respondent did not present an Offer to Settle in an effort to attempt to procure settlement.

I was seeking costs of $5000.

I was awarded $3000 plus disbursements and HST payable forthwith.

I was expecting a cheque for 3000 + 390 HST and 230.73(cost of disbursements).  In early December I received a cheque for only 3230.73.  Short the $390 HST.

On December 19, 2012 I started receiving threatening letters from my ex-spouses newly retained lawyer that I was still in contempt of the Order siting the same sections and similar allegations that were in my ex's original contempt motion.  This lawyer was threatening me that I could be thrown in jail for this contempt.   

On January 30, 2013, March 21, 2013 and April 30, 2013 I sent this lawyers letters indicating the $390 was still outstanding.  Despite still sending me numerous threatening letters about contempt, he never addressed this issue.  On April 10, 2013 I received a letter they were going to proceed to court in 20 days and they were preparing a contempt motion now.  (20 days has since passed)
On May 24, 2013 I received a letter with an attached cheque for $390 indicating they disagree with the amount I said was outstanding, on the basis that the Bill of Cost sets out that disbursements and GST/HST totaled $230.73.  The Order does not say fees plus HST?  They also threatened me with submitting a contempt motion on June 27, 2013.

Should I even cash this cheque?

Despite being the successful litigant, I was still facing a final bill of $8000 from my lawyer to deal with this absolute nonsense.  I have raised my three children since 2004 as CAS deemed the children unsafe with their mother, and she has only been granted limited access with them since such time.  The mother has never provided any support as she hasn't been able to maintain steady employment since 2009 and has somehow been eligible for government funding and services for years despite living common law living in a home since early 2010.  My ex is on her third or fourth lawyer since early 2009.  I am sick of this latest lawyers threats and would appreciate how to handle this situation.

I live in Clarington, Ontario and would appreciate any family lawyer out there who is willing to help me out.

A day after move in we see a Roach, then another, etc. we've also seen all sizes from the very biggest to the smallest almost grain sized. Droppings are in the cabinets and some of our cups in the cabinets. Gross and unsanitary!

After the first few we notify the landlord and he comes to dump spray down the drains. That was two weeks ago and there was no improvement. We see 1-3 jump out of plates, drains, and the worst is toilet paper rolls while using the bathroom. I've taken pictures of many of them.

We officially notify our new landlord that California deems the unit uninhabitable due to an infestation of vermin and those carrying disease such as roaches also violate health codes. Reading tenant rights it seems like the lease is void since you can't rent a place that's uninhabitable.

Naturally, we just want to leave and start over at a new place. We asked the landlord to refund our security deposit and they can keep this months rent as a compromise. They want us to also pay for June rent so they have a month to find a replacement tenant. But we can't live there so we'd just have to give them $2400 for a place we can't use. They're threatening to go to court over it and possibly try to get us for the full year of rent of $28,800.

So we need to get out ASAP, it's taking a toll of them popping out at us and my poor SO already has an anxiety condition so she has a breakdown when they pop out and surprise her :(  so we're jumpy and she can't sleep.

We're unable to sign a lease for a new place because what if we're on the hook for the current one? We can't afford paying for two places!

I'm hoping maybe someone is familiar with the process and this issue to help us out of this nightmare!

Two nights ago, my husband and I were out walking the dog, when a man walked by us on the main road. The dog was on the inside of the sidewalk, my husband was holding the leash and in the middle, and I was on the street side. Immediately after passing us, he turned sharply behind me (close enough that I could feel his body heat), and stomped at the dog, who ignored him as he urinated. I was startled, and my initial reaction was to dodge him.

Last night, I stayed home and made dinner. When I called my husband to let him know the food was ready and ask when to expect him, he told me ""I'm being followed by a guy with a golf club."" He then explained it was the same man as the night before, and that he had just lost him. 

I got in the car (I picked the one that is a style common in our neighborhood) and drove to him, so he wouldn't be left undefended if the guy found him again. I then went looking for Golf Club Guy to get an accurate description for the police, and found him patrolling the main road between two cross streets that we frequently use, golf club slung over his shoulder. Both these streets are on a hill, and you can see 5-6 blocks up on both sides. (To clarify what I mean by patrolling: he was south of where my husband had left him, and heading back north, which meant he had doubled back towards the initial encounter, then turned around again).  The area he chose made it clear that he is somewhat familiar with our patterns. We think he might live in our neighborhood, but not close to us.

I called him into the police for walking around with a weapon and his behavior. 

After I called this incident in, my husband explained that he had been followed for about 8 blocks, and Golf Club Guy had stopped to smoke and watch when the dog relieved himself, which made it clear he was following my husband. He also said that, when he first ran into him, he had asked about me in a mildly sexist/disparaging way (ETA: it was an inappropriately personal question).

So, this situation seems like something that could get very bad very quickly. We're not sure what this guy's focus is: it could easily be me, the dog, or my husband. (The dog is large, and we both have been fixated on/stalked by random crazies in the past.) We're planning to drive to a dog park for the evening walks for a while for safety, but this is not feasible in the morning, and he may start looking for us then if he realizes we are avoiding him.

The police never followed up on the call I put in, which may mean that (1) they didn't find him, or (2) they did find him, and they had cause for an arrest without following up with me. How do I find this out? (ETA: he was not on the blotter).

We also plan on documenting every encounter with this man. What is the best way to do this? When is it appropriate to pursue a restraining order? Also, what level of self-defense is permissible if someone comes at you with a golf club? What can I tell our immediate neighbors (they have kids who play outside) about what is essentially a he-said/she-said situation without being vulnerable to accusations of slander? 

I'm going to talk to a state trooper I know when I get the chance, and possibly a lawyer, but I think I can use as much uninvolved/not emotionally involved perspective as possible here.

Thanks for any help you can give. :)

It has been going on since December but just picked up the pace now with good weather and a deadline to have the bridge finished by Memorial Day.

We live in Massachusetts and this is a Department of Transportation funded project with a private contractor who have a permit from the town to work until 11pm at night.  

We have complained in writing and email and calls to the town selectman, the Police Chief, the DOT, to the state EPA, and all to no avail.  The town selectman's initial response was that it's outrageous that we should put up with this, but then no changes and no response after they looked deeper into it.  I'm trying not to infer anything from the sudden silence.   Our town has a noise ordinance that the Police Chief refuses to enforce in this case, despite frequent calls and complaints.  Not sure what his legal argument is for ignoring it.  Everyone seems to point the finger at someone else.

I spoke to a friends lawyer up in Boston who said it would cost $10,000-$20,000 to file an injunction (money we don't have), it'll take a month (project might be done by then), and the chance of getting them to stop construction is very low considering we would have to prove irreparable harm.  So seems like getting them to stop is not going to happen.  

I'm generally an upstanding New Englander who just grins and bears adversity, but after a few months of this I'm pissed beyond belief and want to sue anyone and everyone if possible, but only if there is a chance of winning anything.

Here are some videos for your enjoyment.

We sued the driver who hit us (technically we sued their insurance company, Suncorp). It took 9 years to reach a settlement (no court) of 300,000 - but after all the medical and legal fee's we actually only got about a third of that, and it didn't go far.

Without any sound evidence there was not much that I, as a shift manager, could do about it. Well, the other day my suspicions were confirmed.

When I was leaving the store the other night, I checked labor percentage. As it was spring break in a college town, it was extremely high at 47%.  After that, me and another employee (we'll cal her Lisa) clocked out, at 8pm, and locked the doors. When I came in the next day, I noticed that labor was at 33% for the night before. Seeing as there were no more sales, labor could not possibly go down. After som investigation, I saw that Lisa's time clock had been altered on the computer and that her clock out time was now 5:30pm. I had witnessed her clock out at 8pm. The only people who have access to the system on the computer are the general manager, another shift manager, and myself. I immediately talked to the other shift leader and asked for his advice.

The next day, I came into work to see the other shift leader (who was not working that day) holding a packet of papers. He had ran a report on the system to show all of the time clock edits over the previous few months and printed it off. The report was multiple pages, with approximately 20 edits per page. He then called the store owner (not the GM) and informed him of the situation. This was on monday and is where the situation stands now. I do not want this situation to be swept under the rug, as some employees were cheated out of as many as 20 hours in one pay period. However, I need to carefully plan my course of action before I do anything. A responsible store owner would have called the Department of Labor, just to cover his own ass, but I do not think that he has. I also do not see him firing the GM. If something does not happen soon (at the very least, employees receiving checks for lost hours) I would like to take matters into my own hands in a responsible manner.

Additional note: every employee gets a time clock print out when clocking out. It includes hours worked that day, hours worked that week, and total break time for the day. I have advised every employee to keep all of their slips. As I mentioned above, I have access to the system, so I am able to print off any type of report and keep it in my records.

I'm in a weird situation at the moment, and could really use some advice on what to expect. 

My little sister is a mess as a result of stuff my father did to her when she was little. He told her always that we were terrible, that my grandfather and me and my uncle were pedofiles, that my mom was going to leave her and never come back...He's always been perfect to her though. They had a special place, he bought her bikini underwear because he liked how it looked, he used to go around outside the house with a mask on and rattle on the windows to scare her and then come in her room and ""save the day"". He's really fucked up and I stopped seeing him as soon as I could (before most of this was happening). 

Anyway, she's a teenager now. They had started fighting and when they started fighting she accused me of raping her regularly to my mom (note, I'm an adult and haven't actually lived at home with either of them in six or seven years). Then he moved away. 

She went off the deepend and told school that I've been raping her and had in the past. School didn't really do anything about it other than talk to my mom. 

A few days ago she started going to counseling again and told the councilor that she's been hurting herself, taking pills, and that she wants to kill herself. 

My mom and the councilor agreed with my sister that she go to the psych ward to stay inpatient. 


She's there now, and she's told them that I've raped her, and have continued to until as recently as a year or two ago. She still insists that her father can do no wrong, and that my mother is to blame for enabling all of it. 

I really want to know what to expect in the next few weeks. I'd like to know if there's anything I should do, if I need to find a lawyer, if I need to talk to my work. 

If I should expect a call from CPS asking me questions, or if I should be expecting a detective to come ask me questions, or if I should be expecting to be arrested and brought in for questioning.

Overview:
I was out on my usual timed 4 mile run when I saw bright cop lights from the end of the street I was on, .7 mi away. As I got closer I saw that there were 3 cops, all with their lights strobing. (The cops lights in my city are exceptionally well lit and hurt my eyes every time i see them) I turn at the street corner continuing down my normal route as I call across the road to them (This is at 11:30 at night) ""Those lights are disturbing people you know"" and a couple of seconds later ""So turn 'em off maybe?"" One officer yelled to me ""Quit yelling"" and I just continued on my way. A couple of blocks down the road an officer rolls up and shines his spot light on me. He opens his door and I said to him ""I haven't done anything wrong, I haven't broken any laws, I don't have to stop"" and continued my jog. (I had been running for over 2 miles non-stop, not going to quit now) For some reason the officer got out to pursue me on foot calling for me to stop about 3 or 4 times, to which i continued calling ""I haven't done anything wrong"" and ""I haven't broken any laws"", after about 20 yds or so I stopped. He caught up, grabbed me and put me in handcuffs, saying ""You're going to jail."" I was charged with Evading Arrest and spent the night in jail (wtf). Did I actually ""evade arrest"" or am I not at fault here?
The bond costed $1000, of which I had to pay $165 to go home the next day. Is there a way I can make all of this go away (I really don't want evading arrest on my record) and get a refund for the cost of the bond?
Update: It has been 16 days since my arrest and still no court date. The lawyers seem to be too expensive for me and not as confident as I would hope. I think I'm going to apply for indigent counsel. Thoughts? Update 2: I was arrested December 21. It is now February 7. I still have no court date.

The subject said ""no."" and kept running. Officer Garrett-391 chased after the suspect on foot for approximately 30 yards before catching him. While running, the officer gave commands for the suspect to ""stop"" approximately four more times. Each time a command was given, the w/m acknowledged with some statement about how he did not have to because he had not broken a law.

The catch is that the picture was taken when she was seventeen. Does this make it child pornography?

The other catch is that he is currently in jail for some sort of small crime, I'm not sure what. Therefore, they probably have his phone. Can she get them to delete the picture? Is there any way that this could blow up in her face if she tries to get it destroyed?

A detective came in and searched the house. My mom put him on the phone. He claimed that in early 2009 (or possibly 2011, they told me '09 and my mom '11). I supposedly sold LSD to someone working for them. He did not specify if it was an undercover or just an informant. He told me there is a warrant for my arrest in that county. I'm away at college right now, I'm planning on turning myself in next week (during the study period before exams). He said that I should have a bondsman lined up, turn myself in, get out and call him. It seems super sketchy. He implied that he wanted me to work for them. 

The thing is, I have not sold LSD to anyone, ever.
This is all I know of the situation. What should/can I do? I'm low income and cannot afford a good lawyer.

Edit 2: If its 09, I haven't a goddamn clue. I just remembered, if its in 2011, I was with a buddy who may have or not sold something to a person. That's all I can come up with. I haven't heard from or have been able to talk to said buddy. Maybe what happened to me happened to him and he turned himself in? But that's as close to selling LSD as I've ever come.

Sorry for typos, I'm on my phone and train of thought whatnots.

1348136013.0,11,self.legaladvice,106p1h,I was overpaid by my employer for 6 months. They realized their error and are now determined to ruin me financially. I live and work in Alabama.,SKINTtoe,16,5,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/106p1h/i_was_overpaid_by_my_employer_for_6_months_they/,"I have worked for this company for the last 4 1/2 years. It is a very large company with product brands known world wide. I have been in the union since I started working here.  
Last March I transferred to a different department of this company. Same company, same union, and the same location in Alabama.  
 When I submitted my transfer request last March I went 100% by all of the rules and guidelines that are required for any job transfer within the company.  
I will leave out a lot of details to keep this question as short as possible. I will be happy to provide any information, details, or answer any questions anyone may have.  
Last Wednesday  I received an email from our HR department stating that they have been overpaying me $6.00/hr since last March. The grand total was around $11,000.00 that they claimed I now owe them. 
 Next I received another email stating that effective immediately I would start earning $6.00/hr less than I have been currently earning and my next paycheck would start the repayment process and the repayment process is set at $1,000.00 per paycheck! 
So all within a few hours I found out that my pay has been cut by $6.00 and they are deducting $1,000.00 from my check. I immediately went straight to the HR leader and explained to him how this entire over payment was not my fault and the repayments should not even happen. We agreed to meet again the next day with a union official present to discuss my situation in more detail.  
The next day in our meeting my union representative was completely useless. My rep. asked the HR leader if we could lower the amount per paycheck because I needed money to live on and support my family. The HR leader simply said ""no"" and my union rep. basically just looked at me and said he was sorry but there is nothing he can do about it.  
  
Right now here is the situation.  
I will have $1,000.00 taken from my paycheck for the next 5 pay periods. I get paid every 2 weeks. Instead of making me pay back $11,000.00 the HR leader lowered it to $5,000.00. He said he is only going back to June for repayment instead of March. That may seem nice of him until one little thing is considered. That one little thing is that he has admitted to me that this whole ordeal is entirely his fault.  
The transfer guidelines I referred to earlier was written by him personally. The guidelines state that I was entitled to the $6.00/hr that he now claims I was overpaid. He says now that the guidelines have been changed last Monday because they were wrong.
So right now I am so screwed beyond anything I have ever expected. I have to pay back $5,000.00 that I shouldn't have to. And I have to pay that money back with my next 5 paychecks. The union was ZERO help.  
I'm willing to take any advice anyone has to put a stop to these payments. I don't have a union to go to and my first paycheck with the first payment is only 1 more day away.  
If I have to pay the $1,000.00 out of my next check then I won't be able to buy my car tag, light bill, groceries etc.. 
This is crazy. Any help or advice is very much appreciated.  
Thanks  
  
  
Edit  
Thanks everyone for some really good suggestions!  
In my first post I said I would answer any questions and/or provide any details that was needed to help. If I miss your question here then I'm sure I will get it for sure in the comments section.  
For the past 6 months I was earning $24.00/hr. As of last week (Wednesday) my pay dropped to $18.00/hr. The way my schedule works I get paid for 84 hours every 2 weeks. I'll just say my pay should be $1,550.00 before taxes and other deductions like insurance and union dues. So after all of my usual deductions I should bring home $1,000.00. (Ballpark figures)  
So when they deduct the $1,000.00 I'm going to be... well you know.  
 I have been working some overtime for the past week so hopefully we will be able to survive. By the way, I don't think I mentioned I am married with a teenage daughter.  
I do have documentation stating that I should be receiving $24.00/hr when I started my new role back in March. The documentation is titled ""Revised Transfer Process"". It is an email that was sent out by the head man over our entire Human Resources department. (I'll call him Mr. L) This email was sent out last year to every person that works for our company. Depending where you transfer from and where you transfer to is what decides your pay rate. According to his email someone that transfers from my previous role to my current role will transfer in at ""level 1"" pay rate. The ""level 1"" pay rate is $24.00/hr.  
When I transferred last March to my new role I started earning $24.00/hr just like the email stated. I never thought my pay should be lower or higher. My pay was correct according to Mr. L's email. I was not hiding, stealing, cheating, sneaking or lying. Now Mr. L is telling me that the email was wrong. He claims that someone transferring from my previous role to my current role should start off at ""base pay"". Not ""level 1"" pay. Since I showed him the ""Revised Transfer Process"" email he sent out he immediately went and changed it to read what he now claims. So now according to the ""Revised Transfer Process"" my job title/role is to be paid $18.00/hr. 
I have several copies of this email saved in several different places. I have met with Mr. L. on three occasions in the past few days to discuss this situation. I told him several times that I will basically have no paycheck after the repayment. I asked (almost begged... okay I begged) him to reduce the $1,000 payments. He would not budge an inch. He wants all of the $5,000 to be paid back as quickly as possible. 
Tomorrow (Friday) I am taking the advice I've seen on here. I have no other choice other than to call an attorney. I just know that Mr. L. is usually very sharp and knowledgeable about the laws. It's hard for me to believe he would set himself up for me to take him on with the email I have from him and by taking so much money from me. Shit, I'm just nervous because I'd hate screw up my job because it's decent pay (usually). Thanks reddit, I'm calling an attorney tomorrow.

How bad can this get for my father if she makes the accusation?

1330362226.0,12,self.legaladvice,q8a8t,What to do if you're pulled over for speeding or some other traffic violation (or how to get a warning),an_actual_lawyer,14,2,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/q8a8t/what_to_do_if_youre_pulled_over_for_speeding_or/,"The [Kansas Highway Patrol](http://www.kansashighwaypatrol.org/) offers the following tips for drivers when they encounter an emergency vehicle or are stopped for a traffic infraction. My comments are also included below as well below each of the KHP's tips.  Every State/city/jurisdiction will be different, so this post should just be used as a general guide - it is ***not*** specific legal advice to anyone.

If anyone has any thoughts or advice, feel free to reply.  Law enforcement officers are especially encouraged to respond.

Lets say that you're driving along and a traffic patrol officer uses radar or laser (""LIDAR"") to determine that you're speeding. What do you do next?

**• Do not panic. Use your turn signal, and pull over to the right as far as possible, allowing other traffic to pass and an officer to safely walk to your vehicle.**
Attorney comment: Our Kansas City metro area traffic law firm's lawyers recommend pulling over normally and smoothly, regardless of whether you were speeding, failed to yield, or whatever the violation is. The key to pulling over properly is to not do anything that might result in an additional ticket or suspicion.  If you pull over too quickly, then you might receive a ticket for that (often failure to signal or failure to yield).  If you pull over too slowly, you may aggravate the police officer who is attempting to stop you. In either case, it could be used as ""an indicator of intoxication"" that the police officer uses to justify a DUI investigation or arrest, a common occurrence in many cities and states, especially at night.  The officer might also think that you're pulling over slowly in order to hide drugs, weapons, etc.  Either way, a slow pull over simply adds suspicion, which you clearly do not want.  

If you can, pull far enough over to allow the police officer plenty of room to approach whatever side of the car he/she chooses, without exposing them to traffic. You don't want a police officer who feels threatened deciding if you get a ticket. Traffic patrol officers in most Kansas City area police forces such as Overland Park, Shawnee, Merriam, etc. are trained to position their cars in a diagonal position to deflect another vehicle, but in the back of their mind, they still wonder about the traffic. Pulling over far enough will help ease the traffic officer's mind, which is what you want when you're trying to get a warning instead of a moving violation.

**• If you are being pulled over, stop and turn off the ignition. If it is dark, turn on the interior light.**
Attorney comment: This is also good advice. Our law firm's [Mission traffic lawyers](http://www.missiontrafficlawyers) also recommend that you take the keys out of the ignition and place them on the dash. This lets the police officer know that you aren't about to drive off and begins to build a little bit of trust which may be useful if you are later asking to avoid a ticket.

**• Keep your hands in plain view, and do not make any sudden movements. The officer does not know you or your intentions. Reaching for your insurance information in the glove box may look like you are reaching for something else.**
Attorney comment: The driver should keep their hands on the wheel, except to roll down the driver and passenger side front windows. Passengers should sit still with their hands on their legs. These actions let the officer know that no one is attempting to hide contraband such as marijuana or alcohol, and that no one is holding a gun. 

**• Ask any passengers in your vehicle to remain calm and comply with the officer's instructions. Instruct them to keep their hands in plain view and not make any sudden movements.
• Wait for the officer to park the patrol car and approach. He or she may ask for your driver's license, vehicle registration, and proof of insurance. If you do not understand why you have been stopped, politely ask the officer.**
Attorney comment: If the officer asks if you know why he pulled you over, most traffic lawyers will recommend that you tell the officer that you don't know. What this question really means is ""admit to violating the law I think you violated"" and ""please tell me about other law violations that I did not witness."" Unless you're a mind reader, you cannot possibly know why the officer pulled you over, so do not take the bait. Just respond politely and calmly, do not do anything that might escalate the situation. Traffic patrol officers in Johnson County, Kansas, such as Overland Park, Merriam, and elsewhere are trained to use this tactic to look for evidence of other traffic infractions or driving under the influence.

**• If it is dark, the police officer is likely to use a bright spotlight or flashlight to illuminate you and your vehicle, do not worry about this.
**Attorney comment: If you are being investigated for drunk driving, and you agree to take the field side sobriety tests (which our firm's DUI defense lawyers seldom recommend you attempt) ask the officer to turn off these lights before you take the tests. The SFST training manual requires them to be off, but our DUI/DWI defense lawyers find that in a high percentage of cases the overhead emergency lights or ""wig-wag"" lights are left on during the field sobriety tests which is highly distracting for whoever is attempting to take them.

**• Stay in your vehicle unless the officer asks you to get out. Most of the time, the entire exchange will occur without you having to leave your vehicle. However, court rulings permit the officer to decide whether you should step out of the vehicle. If you are asked to exit the vehicle, keep your hands in plain view and watch for traffic.**
Attorney comment: If a police officer in Johnson County asks you to exit your car, you really do not have a choice, but it might be important to let the officer know that you are getting out only because he has requested you do so. Once again, be polite and calm, there is no need to escalate the situation.

**• If you receive a traffic citation, a polite and cooperative attitude will make the event easier for everyone. Feel free to ask any questions, but a courtroom is the place to debate the issue, not the side of the road.**
Attorney comment: ***This is very good advice.*** Just respond to questions or a citation politely and calmly, do not do anything that might escalate the situation. This is not the time to argue with the officer.  If you feel the officer is wrong, your traffic lawyer can bring up the issue in front of a judge. 
For example, you can call our [Olathe law firm's traffic attorneys](http://www.jocotraffic.com/olathe_trafficspeeding_ticket_attorney) to amend or arrange a diversion for most Johnson County speeding/traffic tickets, but arguing with the police officer may make a ticket amendment impossible or every difficult. 

For instance, if you're stopped for running a [red light or speeding, Overland Park's ""e-tickets""](http://www.overlandparktrafficlawyers.com) allow the police officer to write comments into the system. If the police officer indicates you were rude or argumentative, then the Overland Park prosecutor may not allow our firm's attorneys to amend the speeding, red light, following too closely or other traffic ticket to a non-moving violation. This is also true for [Prairie Village speeding/traffic ticket amendments,](http://www.prairievillageticketlawyer.com) and other cities in Johnson County, KS.

Spoke to me in person, said that the divorce was costing her more money and sleep than she thought, and she was willing to get a loan if I'd move out and to come up with a number and email it to her.  Email exchange where she rejects my proposal, submits a counter, i reject counter, then she states she's scared to be in the same room as I, and she'll be moving out of the house into her boyfriends house with our son (previously, we split the day as we both work mids. she'd watch him mornings, and leave at 2 when she put him down for a nap, and a babysitter overnight).

No previous history of violence, threats, no criminal history, police have never come to our house for any reason.

As a precaution, I gave my firearm to a friend, and left a note in the safe saying the date all weapons were turned over with both our signatures.

I printed out the email exchange in full, typed up a synopsis, and faxed it to my lawyer so there would be a time/date stamp.  I will not communicate with my wife before I speak with my lawyer.

Is there anything else I can/should do in the meantime?  Illinois has emergency order of protections, and if she decides to go that route to get me out of the house I'll listed as armed/dangerous and could get fired at work as well (local government/law enforcement related).

(Minnesota)",yesimbitter,22,9,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1jy87w/can_you_sue_or_press_charges_if_someone_knows/,"Is there any criminal or civil recourse if someone is lying about their STD/herpes status to partners, taking no precautions to prevent infection, and then passing that on?

My ex, whom I met this January, has genital herpes, type HSV-1. When we met, she lied and told me she was clean -- she didn't want to use condoms. After months together, I eventually caught her in the lie, confronted her, she lied some more (she says she told me, but never did), and she eventually admitted that there is ""strong evidence to suggest that she did not tell [me].""

I stayed with her anyway because, well, I have mental health issues, she's emotionally abusive, and she knows how to manipulate me. She tried to convince me I already had herpes; she tried to convince me there was no way I could contract it from her. She still took no precautions: no condoms, no suppressive medication therapy.

Fast forward a couple of months from that time to this July. I contracted HSV-1. She lied, said it couldn't be herpes. It couldn't be from her. She says I already had it, and my outbreak activated hers (except she broke out 2 days before I did). This is all bullshit. The nurse practitioner I saw had no doubt this was my primary outbreak.

Plot twist: she was fucking another guy behind my back who is now her roommate. I just found out that not only were they sleeping together, but he also got herpes from her at the exact same time, AND gave it to his girlfriend (who knows he was fucking other women, but he hasn't told her he's sleeping with my ex/his roommate, or that she is the one he got it from.).

Here's what her roommate told me:
&gt;She did give me herpes....and she did tell me the same lies about how she had never had a herpes outbreak before and that she thought it could not be transmitted to anyone, since it had never happened in the past. She also tried to blame [his girlfriend] for it.

I've seen the texts between them: everything she said to him -- the denials, the blaming, even the blanket ""I feel so bad"" apologies -- are almost exactly the same as what she told me, except that she told him she never had herpes, and he never caught her in that lie.

I've even seen texts from my ex to her best friend that says she's glad her roommate's girlfriend got herpes from her -- she's extremely jealous of her.

Is there any legal recourse to this? I have to imagine she's going around telling everyone she sleeps with -- it's a laundry list; she's a man-a-week type of woman -- she's clean and barebacking them all. She's got to stop doing this. Is this some sort of reckless endangerment, or some other criminal complaint we can make? Could I -- or her roommate -- even sue her?

**Edit for clarity:** I found out she had herpes about 2 months before I had an outbreak, so there's enough time between then and when I got it to say that I didn't have it when I caught her in that lie. She convinced me with a bunch of lies to stay with her -- she said there's no way I couldn't already have it anyway, that transmission was practically impossible, that she'd been with her husband for 7 years and never given it to him, etc. She even said she'd never had another outbreak, although AFTER I got it she told me this was her third outbreak. I don't honestly know what's the real truth on that end. Her roommate, on the other hand, claims she said she was clean. I've seen texts between them where she says things like
&gt;""could just be your skin reacting to new flora. Fortunately for you, it won't cause a yeast infection lol. . . The bumps don't concern me. That has happened to sever of my partners in the past and it's always been benign. The painful urination is not though, if it persists I would get it checked it could be chlamydia. We should both get new std tests""  

later on:
&gt; Man I feel like shit. I really had no idea. I cannot even tell you how sorry I am.

^These messages are from 2 days after she sent me a message complaining that her herpes had flared up.

**One more edit**: later in the same above conversation, she messaged
&gt;""And I don't know where my hsv is from. I know I have it because I got a blood test - but I have never had an outbreak. I could have genital hsv-1. I just assumed it was oral because that's the most likely scenario. My sister had cold sores when she was a kid -- I figured it was the same for me (I just don't have a s good a memory as she does for things that happened before I was 10)""

Again, I have messages from her to me, complaining just days before that of the pain and discomfort of a genital outbreak that she knew to be herpes -- also, she told me she got herpes from her first boyfriend.

I worked at DQ in Missouri for about 3 months this year starting in February. I then moved back home for the summer (this is in a college town) so I quit the job. 3 weeks ago I moved back and also got the same job back. Tonight I found out that our owner has been incorrectly adding up extra minutes on the time cards resulting in short paychecks. What she does is enter extra minutes in a shift over a whole hour into the calculator as decimals instead of counting them separately and dividing by 60. So what happens is extra minutes over whole hours on a shift are treated as if an hour was 100 minutes.

For example a 6 hour 15 minute shift would be counted as 6.15 on the calculator instead of the 6.25 it should be.

This obviously results in very random but sometimes major shortages in checks. This week I will lose about 3 hours on my check. Apparently when previous employees have called her out on it they were yelled at, told her accountant informed her this was legal, and were threatened with loosing their jobs if they complained more about it.

I was living with my two roommates in West Virginia. I would always pay months in advance for rent and bills because I work as an engineer contracted by the government so, jobs would come sporadically. I was renting two rooms from them, one to store things in and one actual bedroom.

My roommates started outwardly dating about 7 months ago, sometime after I moved in and I was happy for them. About a month after, the guy roommate randomly decided to confess his love to me one day and make things completely uncomfortable, while still dating my other roommate. That same day I actually started looking around for a new place in the area. I worked from home with most of my contracts so I let the girl roommate use my car most of the time.

The relationship with the guy I had met in California got a little more serious and we wanted to make plans to meet. I decided to go see him and stay for a few weeks to see how things went.  Just a few days before I was suppose to leave, my roommate was having surgery on her mouth and her boyfriend was suppose to get dropped off and drive her home with my car. Well, he didn't show up and she didn't call me to drive her home after she saw he wasn't coming. She ended up getting T-boned in my car after running a red light. She was perfectly fine but, the car was completely wrecked. After a little time passed, none of them offered to do anything about it so I prepared court papers just in case.

I still decided to go on my trip and see my boyfriend. While I was cross country my roommates texted and said they wanted to give me a 30 days notice when I got back which was a reasonable amount of time. I did a few interviews out in California and lined up a nice job for when I moved. They also said they wanted to give me a down payment for a car when I came back home to West Virginia.

While I was out visiting, my birthday passed and I had an awesome time out with my boyfriend. My roommate texted me and said she had a present for me, which I didn't expect since she never buys presents for anyone. She joked around about how she had gotten me something even though I didn't get her anything. I figured it was probably the down payment they had offered to help me with prior or, something of that nature. I ended up staying cross country for almost a month and enjoyed every minute. I kept in touch with my roommates back home here and there to see how things were going. I also let them know when I would be home since they would have to use a work car to come and get me. 

Finally got back home around midnight EST after traveling for 15 hours. My roommate gave me this little box wrapped in a cute bow and told me to open it. I did and it was empty. I gave her a confused look she says ""You actually thought I would give you something?"" Then, like some sort of twilight episode, they told me they wanted me out of the house that night and didn't plan on helping me with a car down payment for the one they wrecked.  I walked into my bedroom to find that they had already started packing up my things in trash bags. 

So it's 2 am, my roommates want me out now. Rather than telling me before, so that I could plan prior, and just started my new job,  I ended up being lied to and baited to come home just so they could feel some sort of revenge and malice. I ask them about my rent and security deposit since I paid thousands in advance and they mentioned they would try to pull some money out the next morning.  I told them that's fine and I'll have to stay here tonight and get in touch with someone to find a place to stay til I can get things in order to move. 

The next morning I woke up and packed up most of my things. I went to stay with a family member so that my roommates had time to get me back the money they had owed me for rent so, I could put a deposit down on a new car or, even a used car. Without a car I won't have any way to work at the job I already have in California.  I also made plans with them to come back the next day and get the rest of my things. 

I am currently on my family member's couch trying to keep my receipts and documents up to date for my court papers. I have a family friend who is an attorney for the area and he agreed to take the case for me so I could continue with my plans of moving, seeing I have no other place to stay now otherwise. The only problem is that he informed me the courts in the area are so backed up, it could take up to a year for things to be resolved.

The next day my roommates ended up getting in touch with me and told me that they felt they owed me nothing and I was only allowed to stop by to get my things with their permission. A few days passed and they kept rescheduling. I ended up having to call the police to escort possibly get an escort to remove my items.

So with all their scheming , they have left me homeless with no car or money and no options left. I have a boyfriend, job, and apartment waiting for me across country but was lied to and maliciously baited into an agreement to come home and be kicked out for their own personal reasons. I just wanted to share my story because of how absurd it seems and how it damages my faith in humanity.

A bit of text, apologies. 
My wife and I got let go from our jobs on the same day about 4 months ago while living in MN(same company). Her mother, who lives with her husband(wife's step-father), has been asking for us to come live in CA for years. Once we lost our jobs she again invited us to come stay in a spare room while we look for work in our fields. Fast forward 4 months...Her mother needs mental help, which is besides the point I suppose but last night my wife and her mother had a pretty large argument(because the bathroom that is attached to our bedroom is ""absolutely fithly and disgusting""). Here are 2 images of said bathroom as she saw it yesterday, taken this morning. http://imgur.com/s7XIUWd,N3CWwJL#0

 This argument ended with her mother hitting her daughter in the chest (a punch above the breast) and telling us that we had to move out. Her (at the time drunk) step-dad comes in and gets in my face, pointing his finger as if I were a 14 year old kid(which is still ridiculous at that age) making fun of me because I am not 'sociable' enough, and that I 'don't know anything' because I helped him paint a garage 2 days ago and I guess I left a paint bush with some paint on it(which wasn't brought up until last night). Still unsure what I had to do with my wife's argument with her mother about a supposed dirty bathroom that couldn't be taken any longer. 

 To my main point and question/s we have. He believes that he can bring all of our belongings onto the street because it is 'his house' and that he does not need to give us any notice. I am not 100% sure but I know when we have lived in apartments and town homes there is a notice that needs to be given, more than 12 hours, a landlord cannot kick you out because they just don't like you. They invited us here, we have no lease agreement, we do not pay rent as they offered for us to stay here for free while we look for work and can move out(and we are currently living on our unemployment benefits). My wife just turned 40 and I am 32. So if they can do this it means we are homeless and will have to sell most of what we have to get back to MN. From my meager knowings of some laws, don't they still have to get a notarized document telling us to vacate the premise within 30 days? I am not their child that just turned 18 and they want out of the house, I am an adult that picked up and left everything I know for something I thought was right at the time. What rights to we have in this situation? We will be moving back to MN as there is no way I will tolerate such behavior from 'adults', it's that we cannot move all of our belongings in a day. We would prefer to move today all of my family is in MN and her extended family live 5+hours away and is not really an option that we wish to pursue. Sorry to turn this into a partial spewing of context. 

TLDR: 'Adult children' being told to leave immediately from a house we were invited to. Is that legal or does a notice need to be given.


UPDATE:

We are going to legal aid tomorrow morning to see what our options are. This morning they came into our room, my wife was sleeping and in her underwear. I had just gotten up and was making coffee in the bathroom. when they came in and said ""We need to talk to you"". I responded with ""I'm sorry but we do not have anything to say to you"". He then proceeded to get into my face and screaming about we need to be out of here before they get back from their vacation. I responded with 'I am sorry but you cannot legally do that'. Still in my face, said 'you don't know a damn thing, I guess you should have been a lawyer(huh?), if you guys are here when we get back I am calling the sheriff"". I responded with 'you can do what you feel is right, but you legally cannot make us vacate because you 'say so', we have done nothing wrong. We will be leaving as soon as we can, however you cannot force us to leave as we have not broken any law.""
This only angered him more, he then proceeded to grab my arm, and shoving me further into the bathroom.He grabbed my neck and 3 times he pushed me, falling backwards into the tub. I got up each time, he kept pushing me back into the bathroom. When my wife ran in he then grabbed her arm and yelled in her face. 
We immediately left when we could(he kept walking in front of the door, hindering our leaving of the bathroom).

Pictures of the marks he left on me from pushing and grabbing me(ankle from when it hit the tub).

After 2 hours at a park we came back and made sure they were gone before coming in. 
How absolutely insane is it that someone will not call out a child molester, but kick someone out of a home from a supposed 'dirty bathroom'(the pictures taken show it isn't the most spotless chem lab but a normal lived in bathroom).

I work at a gas station full time and have been here for around 5 months. Everything was going great until we became short handed and I had to work a week by myself (except for 2 hours with someone during shift change) covering shifts. At the end of each night during this week when I would cash out the drawer would say it was off (we're running of an old system that likes to mess up) but the money would always be found the next day in the paperwork normally so I thought nothing of it. After that week I came in on Monday and after 2 hours my manager approached me and sale what happened last week and why my drawer was 225 short. I didn't take the money or anything so I told her I had no idea and was suspended until they found the money. 2days later I get a call that it's been found and I can return to work.now here's the questionable part.the reason my drawer was short is because the woman who was here already would run on my drawer while I was doing side work and was forgetting to cash out her lotto tickets making my drawer short and her own short. Since the money/problem  was found no shortage was filed by my manager. Well now my paycheck has been coming back with money taken out by corporate to pay for the drawer shortage 20-50$ at a time. My manager has called and requested they return my money and stop removing from my check but it is still persisting,and they have already said they won't return it. So my question is: is this legal? Is there anything I can do since they know for 100% sure through video and the money being found that I didn't do it and that someone else was running my register without my permission?

The experience was good overall, no bad stories from living there and we always paid rent on time, never once a complaint against us.

It has been over two months and I still haven't heard from them on the deposit - no bill of damages, nothing at all. My phone number hasn't changed and I gave a forwarding address. A week or so after we moved out a new management company has purchased the apartments, still the same name and all, just new owner. They have ignored my phone calls so I sent them a letter of demand which simply stated all of the dates and times I have called and left a message. I sent this certified mail and once they got it, they called. The manager told me I had to contact the old management company, which I don't think is the case. I say this because as all of my business classes have told me, you usually obtain the assets *and* liabilities when purchasing another business. I sent another one telling them that if I did not receive the deposit within a two weeks, I would take civil action. Surprisingly I did not hear back. 

Now I am basing my argument off of the North Carolina Tenant Security Act. It clearly states in there that the landlord is supposed to give me my deposit within 30 days or give me a reason why not (such as damage to the apartments, etc). Since they are clearly not interested in giving my deposit, do I have a case?

He's in his early-60s.

He's currently in the hospital due to complications from his chemotherapy; Pneumonia, congestive heart failure, kidney failure.  He's been pulled from chemo, and they've reversed the CHF and KF, and are actively working on the pneumonia.  He's currently on a mask to help him breathe, not a breathing machine.

Him and his wife married a few years ago.  She's stubborn, and thinks she knows everything about everything, and is publicly verbally rude to him.  She tried to tear him and I apart after questioning some of her motives with him, once she told me about how her previous husband died of cancer, and how she collected a large life insurance payout.  Everything in her story was suspicious at the time; even more so now.

He requested to remain on the mask.  What bothers me is she apparently flew off the handle with the nurse, asked to speak to him alone, and when she came back after a small chat, told the nurse that he doesn't want to be on the mask anymore.  His daughter talked to him after and asked why he no longer wanted to be on the mask when just 15 minutes prior, he did.  He said that wasn't the case.  The step-daughter who's a nurse in Phoenix, has been trying to run the show at the hospital.  She's already been kicked out once or twice, but not flat-out banned.

The nurse and doctor both jumped into action to get the wife and step-daughter immediately banned, as they have noticed 90% of his anxiety/panic attacks happened while the wife and/or step-daughter was in the room.  The nurse was especially upset when they told his daughter (apparently in front of said nurse), not to get her hopes up that he's going to survive, and then started talking about his life insurance policy.

I'm obviously very concerned, and wondering if there's any actions that his biological children can take to get power-of-attorney transferred away from his wife, and if there's any way, since he's currently 100% of sound mind according to the doctor, he can file divorce or something to block her from killing him.

No one has ever liked his wife, and in confidence with me, he's flat out told me he's worried about ever getting sick, because he doesn't really trust her.  I'm trying to get to Arizona as soon as possible, and I'm wanting to talk to him privately, and get something in writing, or on recorded audio/video, expressing his concern, and his wishes.

I'm not going to go all dramatic nuts and cause a scene considering I have no legal rights to be involved, but I don't want my father being killed by a heartless bitch that appears to have all the power at the moment.

TL;DR:  Please read.  Please advise.  Thank you.

\* Words, and stuff... sorry, a little shaken up.



**Update: 2155 PST**

I'm going to hit the road shortly.  Thank you everyone for the advice.  I'll check back in when I get to Arizona, and update as things progress, since I may need more advice.  Again, thank you.


**Update: 2013-07-22 1935 PST**

I decided to get as much sleep as possible before hitting the road to ensure my eight-hour drive was a safe one, so I arrived in Arizona around 2pm.  I got to see him for a few minutes; I joked about the hot nurses, talked about our future plans we are still working towards, and read him the card I had sent in the mail a couple days prior.  The card read: ""Barbados, and rum drinks on the beach!  See you soon!""  (I have an accompanying gift: a sealed container with beach sand, and three rum shot bottles partially buried.)

From the time I hit the road throughout the weekend, his wife was nothing but absolutely negative.  Right as I hit the road, I received a call from my brother-in-law, telling me that his wife told him to come to the hospital and say his goodbyes.  I obviously became upset, and called his son, who then called the doctor, and was told that he was relatively stable, and that he was not on his way out.  That particular incident was enough that the nurses and doctors were instructed to no longer listen to her whatsoever, and they because discussing with him about lifting the DNR and DNI.

I stayed at the hospital over night, and on my way out of the parking lot, I ran into his wife.  I hadn't experienced her negativity first hand, so I turned on my camera in my vehicle, to record the entire exchange.  With what I heard come out of her mouth, it took every last ounce of strength to not knock her out, and run her over.  She just kept talking about how he keeps taking three steps back, and isn't going to get better, and there's no reason for him to fight to live.  Instead, I told her he's going to walk out of here, and his entire family is here to support him through it all.  I promised him that when I spoke with him the night before.

I had to leave at that point, because it was tearing me up.

Last night around 12:20am, while I was at my mother's place watching TV trying to numb my mind, I felt a sudden sense of calm come over me.  I turned off the TV, and immediately fell asleep.  3:30am I received a call from his son.  He became unresponsive at 12:20am, and they were doing everything in their legal power to keep him alive until my brother-in-law and I got there.

It took me 20 minutes.  (Thank you Sheriffs Department for not pulling me over when I blasted by three of you with my flashers on, and thank you 911 for listening to me freak out on the phone for a moment, giving you a heads up I was not going to be obeying posted speed limits, and you relaying it to all officers.)  When I arrived, his family and I walked in.  We all said our goodbyes.  Everyone left when they went to take his CPAP off, except his wife, myself, and my brother-in-law.  The doctor and nurses warned us that it would probably take 2-3 hours for him to finally pass, and that it wouldn't be pretty.

He passed within two minutes; no struggle, no pain.  Rest in peace; See you soon.  I love you.

(There's more that happened regarding his wife, even after his passing, but the family is just happy that he's now in a better place.  Sadly, I wasn't able to give him his beach and rum gift; it is now a memento of our bond, and our future.)",,False,self,t5_2rawz,1374548291.0,,,True,t3_1io65k,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1io65k/az_fathers_wife_and_stepdaughter_trying_to_kill/,

I am in dire need of advice. My boyfriend and I were served late last night with a petition to appear in court next Wednesday over eviction from our apartment. Our rent was owed on July 1 but we stopped paying because we need to save to get out of here and find a new place. Our landlord strongly believes we have no ground to stand on in court but we think otherwise.

This is VERY long. Just a warning.

-We signed a lease in mid-April and moved in about a week later. The ad for the apartment stated $1350/month, utilities included. When we signed the lease, though, our landlord changed it to $1500 saying we would have to pay $150 for our share of the oil. (We live in the basement and tenants on the first floor pay the other half). We were supposed to pay only 40% and upstairs 60% but we found out later on that upstairs actually pays $150 too even though they have more square footage and 4 more people living up there.

-The week we moved in, I was very cold and kept turning up the temperature on the thermostat but the apartment wasn't getting any warmer. We confronted our landlord about it and he told us he didn't know what was wrong and that if we want to keep warm we should ""boil a pot of water and let it sit boiling on the stove so it heats up the apartment."" He made no effort to look further into the issue.

-He finally showed us his ""permit"" for the basement apartment but it didn't specify that it was for the basement. It only said the house's address. This had us worried coupled with the things our guests were telling us about the place being illegal. There are only windows in the living room/kitchen but none in the 2 bedrooms. And the windows we do have aren't big enough/up to code. They also said there's no way it can be legal with a door to the sump pump being in our living room, no fireproof sheetrock or fireproof door in the boiler room, no fresh air vent in the boiler room, and nothing covering the bottom of the door to the boiler room. When we confronted our landlord about these issues, he said he has a ""permit for a habitable space"" but no permit for the kitchen. And he said all he would have to do was make one window bigger for the apartment to be legal. However, he said the work he needs to do costs too much money at the moment. Despite him admitting to us that he can't legally rent the apartment, he says the judge won't care about that, only our rent due. 

-One night about a month ago, we returned home at about 10 p.m. to find the oil guy there asking to get into our apartment to see the boiler. The upstairs tenants had called him in an emergency because they were seeing black smoke coming out of the furnace. He looked at the boiler and discovered that it was dangerously close to busting which would have been life-threatening to us, apparently (sorry, I really don't know anything about boilers). He also found out that there was no wiring going to the basement for heat, only to upstairs. And that basically our thermostat was fake, like a decoy. Also, the door to the boiler room is my boyfriend's 2-year-old son's room and the guy said the boiler had been spewing soot at the door and the wall to his room as long as we'd been living there. He showed us the black all over the wall and door as proof. As a pregnant woman (5 months along), these issues frightened me to my core. He finally finished the job at 1 a.m., at the upstairs tenants' expense. Our landlord said the boiler problems must have been a result of a previous tenant messing with it. He also came to the apartment to prove our heat worked. However, only one base board became warm to the touch and you can only change the temperature from the upstairs apartment thermostat.

-Another major issue is the washer and drier in the laundry room directly outside our door to the apartment. First of all, the hose for the washing machine has to be put outside a window while its on, which lets in a LOT of bugs, turning our apartment into an issue of National Geographic. Second the hose is made up various types of hoses, including a radiator hose from a car, and shoddily put together, causing frequent flooding. The water floods the laundry room and then gets under the door to our apartment and into my boyfriend's son's room. This has happened so many times already that it completely ruined his carpet and we had to throw it out. While our landlord offered to replace the carpet, he didn't offer to fix the issue.

-A minor issue in the scope of things but a big issue for me: one day our landlord thought no one was home (but I was and i was in the shower) and he tried opening the door to our apartment without knocking but the latch was on, thank God. This was when we were paying rent and doing everything right, and he had given us no notice that he would be coming to the apartment.

With all of this, and a baby on the way, we decided this is not a place for us to be raising a family and stopped paying rent. We were served last night for our rent due plus late fees.

Hi, my mom was charged with hitting a child a few months ago, which she completely denies did not happen. She was serving food, student grabs food and student says hit him.

She just recently received a document that gives cause for dismissal. She was accused of numerous things.

..falsifying info
..incompetency
inefficiency
neglect of duty
dishonesty
immoral conduct
etc.

If she knows this crap is false, should she fight it with the board of trustees and appeal. They tell her if she appeals and fails she can't apply for unemployment and it will tarnish her ability to apply for other jobs. They are basically pushing her to resign quietly from all of this.

By the way, there are other incidents as well of other employees being accused of hitting children. Apparently children there have realized this as a tool to get back at adults.

Anyway. It's her word against a childs. Does the school really have enough information to do this.

What to do. THANK YOU!",,False,self,t5_2rawz,False,,,True,t3_1if099,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1if099/mom_was_accused_of_hitting_child_at_elementary/,

I am currently employed by a man who is the Chief Marketing Officer for a company (Company A), but maintains his past relationships with other companies he's done marketing work for.  In fact, he used to have his own company, for which he produced all the ads himself (Company B).  

He is currently trying to resurrect Company B.  So when he feels there's an opportunity to put off some work from Company A, he instructs myself and a coworker to do extra work for Company B on Company A's dime.  We are talking hundreds of hours worth of work.  Then when we get back to the first company's assignments, they're days from being due and we have to work harder and longer to make the deadline.
My coworker and I are contractors, 1099s filed with Company A.  But we don't have a non-compete clause.  Which is why I'm not 100% sure if I understand what's wrong with the situation.  But I feel as though myself, my coworker, and Company A are getting screwed (for lack of a better legal term).

According to Louisiana law if a parent either goes with paying child support or doesn't see their child for a 6 month period, then they forfeit parental rights. Well, my ex and her husband decided to take me to court just before I got out of the military and a lengthy court battle has ensued.

Nearly a year later, it has come out that this man that was trying to forcefully adopt my daughter has a criminal background, my ex has filed a restraining order against him, it's documented that he has hit and held his hand over her mouth and nose in an attempt to keep my ex from leaving him, they've been separated multiple times, he's threatened me and my family, and they are just bad people in general. Despite all of this evidence against them the judge has just decided that it's in my daughters best interest to be adopted by this man, even after they have both been caught in lies by the court on the stand.

So here's my dilemma; I am completely tapped out after the last round of court/attorney fees. Now my lawyer is telling me that I have 30 days to pay approx. $13500 to go to appeals (2500 for transcript, 1000 for court fees, 10k for attorney fees). Are there any other options available to me? I just want what's best for my daughter, but staying with these horrible people is not it. Is there anyway to delay appeals until I can get the money.

I have a unique roommate situation and I was wondering if I can get any guidance on what to do.  I sublet a place from a guy who basically had this place as a bachelor pad when he was separating from his wife.  He decided he was too rich to divorce his wife so he subleted the place to me for half the rent.  He is allowed to come at any time and his ""bedroom"" is the couch.  Thus far he only has slept over once.

He is trying to kick me out for the apartment being messy and non payment.  I would love to pay him the rent but he refuses to pick it up and because his wife doesn't know about the place there is not an address I can send it too.  He claims I have till Sunday to move out or else he will throw my stuff on the curb.  I already contacted the landlord who is on the side of my roommate.

The facts of the

* I have a roommate agreement but am not on the lease.  I have lived there 4 months and have utility bills to prove my residency
* He refuses to take rent from me
* the lease is over on July 27th anyway

**What are my legal rights and what should I do?**  He is clearly trying to intimidate me.  The guys is scum bag and advertised the apartment as for ""girls only"" (he's  guy).  I'm in constant fear he is going to attack me although there is no legal claim to my worries just general interactions with this guy.  

I was thinking of e-mailing him with the statute and the fact that I called the police and they know of the situation but I don't know if that's the best legal thing to do.

The driver was unconscious the entire time of the accident and was taken to the hospital. The police get his driver's license and insurance/registration for the police report and I ask for a copy of it to go ahead and make my claim. 

Because I didn't have a whole lot of information on the guy or his business driving the car, my insurance tells me that I need to wait for his insurance to get the police report before figuring out what to do with my car. I call his insurance rep 5 days later because I never hear anything from either party, and his insurance rep says he ""doesn't know why I was told that, because my car is just racking up fees at the tow yard that they aren't responsible to pay for after three days"". So, it being my first time ever getting in a car accident, I ask him what I need to do then if I shouldn't leave my un-driveable car at the tow yard. He says I need to take it to a body shop and ""figure it out myself"". So I get my car towed to the body shop and that is where it is now. 

However, today I found out that his insurance is denying the claim because apparently the insurance on the car isn't his and is instead his ex-wife's, who did not give him authorization to drive her car. Weird that he didn't have authorization but a police report wasn't ever filed even after she knew he crashed her car. 

Anyway, so MY insurance (I have liability by the way, and she has full coverage) is going to sue the driver himself. The problem is, is that he doesn't have a job or money, so him actually paying me for damages is HIGHLY unlikely. Especially considering he's a junkie who thinks it's a good idea to risk lives so he can get high and drive. I am a full-time nursing student who cannot have a full-time job so I really cannot just afford these repairs or get a new car any time soon.

Can I dispute her insurance's ruling? I realize that if her car was ""stolen"" her insurance technically can't help that. But I also can't help that her ex-husband managed to get her keys and steal the car and yet she never did anything or reported anything about it. She may not have given authorization, but I feel like if she didn't actually PROVE that she didn't give him authorization, then it shouldn't matter and her insurance needs to pay for the damages and then THEY could sue HIM for the damages he caused. 

I really don't understand how any of this insurance stuff works, this is my first accident and they know that, so I feel like the driver's insurance is playing that to their best interest and thinking that they can walk all over me and get out of paying for anything.

We lived in that house for seven years. I made rent on time every month. I think there were two times when I had to split the payment (half on the first, other half in the middle of the month). When I left the house, landlord and I were on friendly terms. I paid fist and last month's rent as well as a $1,200 deposit (the rent was $1,050 a month--no sure if that's relevant). I have seen none of that money back. In fact, I paid rent the last month I was there, so I should be due a solid $1,000 back from him at least.

When we moved in, the carpet was old and the walls had been painted with the flattest white I’d ever seen. Landlord failed to do an occupancy permit before renting to us and the city caught up with him about three months after we moved in. The inspector said the landlord should have replaced the carpet but since we had already moved in he was just going to make the landlord clean it. We ended up cleaning it ourselves. Landlord was not present for the occupancy inspection.

I moved out May 3rd. Today is June 24th. I have not received my security deposit back. I have not received a list of damages. I was not present at the final walk through, because he did not inform me of when he did one. He has sent me several angry texts. He's called me a ""fucking nightmare"" and said things like ""you fuck"" and ""I'm going to sue your ass off you fucking asshole"".  I have saved these texts to my phone. He's very angry.

I--nor anyone in my family--did $12,000 in damages to that house. I did NOT cut any rafters. I did leave some things behind--a broken microwave (which I bought because the microwave that is installed over the stove broke about 4 years ago and he never fixed it), and some bags of cardboard, old drywall, stuff like that, as well as a couple other things. He said it cost $300 to haul it all away--I believe that, and I also believe my security deposit covers it.

Sorry, I'm rambling. My main question is: since it has been over 30 days since I moved out, and from everything I have been able to find after 30 days if I don't get my deposit or a list of damages from him, I can counter-sue him for twice the amount of the deposit, do I need to worry about this? I don't want to sue the guy, I just want him to leave me alone. What are my options?

My girlfriend and I bought a house in November of last year.  The house was a remodel and everything from the first floor up is brand new.  The home was originally only one story with a basement but is now two stories.  Our home inspection went great and everything about the house was fantastic so we put in an offer and eventually moved in.  Fast forward until April/May.  
Our basement is completely finished with dry wall and carpeting.  Our basement is also protected with a sump pump.  Throughout the months of April and May I noticed dampness in the carpet after a big rain.  Initially I thought it may be condensation related but the problem continued to occur with more intensity.  Eventually I decided to rip the carpet up and found water all over the floor.  The source of this water was finally tracked to an area behind the wall.
Water was pooling behind the drywall on our knee wall that sticks out from the foundation.  I called in some waterproofers to come take a look and they told me I would need an interior system as well as a system on the knee wall to push water to the sump pump.

I called the builder about this problem and he claimed he never saw any water in the basement and never noticed any water damage.  He says he has no idea why we are having water problems and will not be assisting us in paying for this job.

So the waterproofers come over and begin work on the basement.  They find that the water has been leaking in through a few foundation cracks and when it builds up too high on the knee wall it rolls onto the floor.  Now for where it gets interesting.

The guys working in the basement discover pads that mechanics use to catch oil and grease stuffed behind the wall in the problem areas.  They also find a heavy build up of tar in this area which suggests that the builder absolutely knew of this problem but stuck the pads back there to absorb as much water as possible so he could sell the house while claiming there was never any water problems.  My neighbors have also told me that he used to come to the house during storms and surround the basement door and well with blue tarps.

My question is can I sue the guy I bought the house from because he willfully and purposely deceived me about water damage that he knew was going on in the basement?  If so what do I need to strengthen my case?  I feel the absorbent pads in the wall is the biggest sign considering there should be no reason for them to be there.

my roommates and I signed up for their service when we moved into our new house. We negotiated a monthly price with comcast which came out to 135ish a month for TV and Internet plus a 50 dollar install fee. First problem, they came out to install everything and get us up and running but only brought one of the dvr Unit when we had signed up to have 4. They apologized and said they would be out in the next day or two to bring us the other units. Over the 4 month period we had the service only two of us got the dvr because every time someone came to bring us more they only brought one or none at all. This was definitely frustrating and should have been a sign of the unwholesome shit storm that they were going to unleash on us but we kept trying. First months bill comes... $600 dollars. Honestly I was speechless. There we so many completely ridiculous charges on there that I have never even imagined would be possible. For starters they charged us 200 for our monthly services, when we had agreed on 135. They rest of the bill was the installation fee which was supposed to be 50 dollars. They put the initial 50 on it but then they tacked on fees for bullshit things like running wires from our wall to our unit and, no joke, plugging the receivers in. Needless to say we called them and were extremely upset. They assured us that this was a mistake and that they needed to speak with their supervisor but would call us right back with a solution. So we waited.... and waited.... and forgot. A month rolls by and we get our second bill. We now supposedly owe them just over 1000 bucks. So we called again and asked to speak to a supervisor. After being on the phone for 3 hours we were told that we be given call back and that everything would be fixed. Once again we never got a call. Now our service gets shut off because we haven't paid any of the bill due to them ""Fixing"" the amounts. So we call again going through the same bullshit for the third time. They say that they are sorry for the inconvenience and that they will turn our service back on while they are trying to fix our bill. This was good enough for us so we enjoyed our service while waiting for them to get back to us. 1 week later we are shut off again. So we call. They say that they have fixed the bill and just hadn't gotten back to us yet. The amount that they gave us at this point for our three months of service was about 600 and being as the lack of internet was really starting to mess with our work/school/social lives we decided to pay it. So we get our service turned back on and we go on with our lives assuming that all is well. But like clockwork one week later the service is back off. We call. They tell us we owe them somewhere in the ballpark of 600 more dollars. So we tell them to royally go fuck themselves. About a week later I call them and tell them I want to cancel my service and I want to know how much they think I owe them. They ended up telling me that the slate was clean and I didn't owe them anything so long as I send them the equipment back which I promptly did. And now about a week ago I have received a notice from a collection agency claiming that they have reported me for just under 3000 bucks. 2300 for equipment that I never returned and another 600 for unpaid bills.
So now I'm completely in over my head and to be honest I have no idea how to proceed. It blows my mind that a company could be this fucking evil. I had their service for a whopping 4 months, gave them $600, and now they want another $3000? Not only have I had to deal with their bullshit for 4 months but now they could seriously be messing up my credit, and they are wasting my time which is already spread thin as it is.

1370377337.0,12,self.legaladvice,1foac1,my adult heavily disabled sister lives with my cruel (&amp; dying mother) - is there a way for me to get guardianship when she dies?,Eunanibus,15,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1foac1/my_adult_heavily_disabled_sister_lives_with_my/,"This is an incredibly complex and problematic issue for me that spans around 10 years plus so I'll try to cut it down as best I can.

I'll start with myself. I was a middle boy with two sisters, a young sister, and an older heavily disabled sister (her disabilities stem from an early birth, four types of meningitis, hydrocephalus and more. She will be forever confined to a wheelchair or limited walking, and at her current age of around 26-27, talking to her is similar to talking to a child.) My mother was cruel, far beyond the point of abuse but not enough that it was ever proven. Omitting a hell of a lot of abuse and suffering from this story to cut it shorter, when I was young, a parent of a fellow schoolmate saw what was happening, and sleepovers eventually became a permanent unofficial foster family for me. I never went back.

10 years later, I am 23, and despite a huge amount of issues, I am a well adjusted, happy and hard-working funny and intelligent guy. I decided to stay away from my sisters in an effort to avoid my mother who I felt was toxic to my life, and I struggled to get myself through my education.

Having grown up a significant amount and overcoming some real development issues due to the abuse, I was persuaded to get in touch with my sisters. I found out my younger sister left and avoided contact with our mother because of the similar personality traits that accompany being as cruel as she was. However, my disabled sister has, and likely always shall, live with the mother. 

However, my biological mother is sick, has always been, and it appears that we are on the verge of finally being rid of her. My younger sister rented a house and had it modified to accommodate my disabled sister (handrails, bedroom, disabled specific equipment for her) and upon her death, my younger sister would like my disabled sister to live with her, and for her to be responsible for her. I think she would suit this perfectly, and I will be there to provide support if necessary.

However, due to the relationships as they are, the mother has elected to leave guardianship in a will of my disabled sister, to her newly married husband (I guess our step-father? Though I haven't met him. I have to assume he has some dysfunctions of his own if he is partnered with her. She has not changed (and I know this because I am recently forced to see her in order to collect and drop off my disabled sister).

tl;dr: my question is this. She has put in her will that she wants guardianship of my disabled sister to go to him, and not my younger sister. All attempts at talking civilly, politely and to discuss a serious issue, have been put to death by her horrendous personality defects. Is there anything we can do legally in the UK after her death, to combat this decision?

These emails were sent through MailChimp, and were signed with my name in an attempt to impersonate me, well enough for numerous people to email me asking me to stop. At least one faculty member complained to me, claiming that she had encountered sexual content.  Thankfully MailChimp has shut down the account involved.

(TN),kaygeeeff,16,4,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1f0j83/neighbor_has_an_inoperable_vehicle_parked_in_her/,"I own a small house that sits very close to my neighbor's. She rents the home and was there when I moved in 4+ years ago. About 18 months ago, her large SUV was hit by a fallen tree. The damage was mostly cosmetic (broken windshield, scratches and dents) but she ended up buying another car and tarping the old SUV. The car is parked in her front yard, about 20' from my house, and about 20' from the street. It's covered in a tarp and the tires have long gone flat. The vehicle hasn't moved since it was damaged. 

About a year ago, I called building and codes and reported the inoperable vehicle as well as a huge pile of trash in her yard (about a dozen full garbage bags, we have no city trash pickup and she didn't appear to have a private pickup service). Before I made the call I had a very calm, very friendly discussion with her about both issues. She assured me they would be addressed within days- that she was starting a trash service, and that she had a buyer for the car. Nothing happened after a month, so I decided to go ahead and make the call.  Within a week of the call the garbage was gone but the car didn't move. I followed up with building and codes after another couple months, they said they would send another inspector out immediately. The car is still there, but she went and had the tags renewed since they were long expired. 

Now that warm weather is here again the car is starting to cause problems beyond unsightliness. Wasps have built nests under the hood and in the passenger compartment. Bits of tarp and masking tape have been blowing into my yard for ages. I made my third call to building and codes about six weeks ago and spoke to someone who said he was a supervisor. He assured me that the situation would be dealt with. The car has now been joined by a washer/dryer combo that appears to have been chucked off the second-floor back deck of the house. Both are still there. 

I spoke to my neighbor several times about the car. We're friendly, and she seems to understand my concerns and apologizes profusely about leaving the car there for so long, but it doesn't seem like she's willing to do anything about it. I've googled like crazy and I can't figure out any way to move this up any higher than building and codes, who seem unwilling to deal with this issue. I like to think I'm a pretty good neighbor and I don't want to start a big feud over a stupid SUV, but my house will be put on the market in the next few months and I'd love to have this thing gone sooner rather than later. 

Should I attempt to go through codes again? What's the next step in a situation like this? Any advice or direction would be greatly appreciated. 

tl;dr: Live in TN, neighbor has inoperable car parked very close to her house and the street. The car hasn't moved in about 18 months. The neighbor acknowledges that the car shouldn't be there and keeps promising to move it, but doesn't. Building and codes has been called three times. Do I keep hammering away at building and codes every few months, or is there something else I can do?

EDIT: Thanks to everyone for the suggestions. I'm going to talk to my neighbor about the car (and now, the busted washer/dryer) again. She really is a nice person and aside from this she's a great neighbor. Maybe revealing that I'm trying to sell soon will make her realize it's more time sensitive than she thought. It'll be a few months before I'm ready to put the house on the market, so hopefully the situation will be resolved by then. If not, I will go to building and codes again and make sure they know this is now my fourth call. If that doesn't work, I'll just put it on the market and hope that someone will buy my house anyway.

This means that vehicles have to be off the pavement for 8 hours.  They broke it up into 5 days and did a portion of the complex each day so they wouldn't inconvenience everyone at once.  They placed flyers on all of the posts holding up the carports and at the front of every parking spot that said which day they would be doing which spots and that if you left your car in that spot for the day you would be towed.  I moved my vehicle the night before into a different spot that was not within the specified construction area for Monday.  It said that on Monday they would be working on ""all uncovered spaces for buildings E and F and all carport #'s 139-219 &amp; 233-264 (see map).""  I parked at an uncovered space two spaces past carport #264.  This space as not near building E or F - it was in front of buildings C and D.  

I came home from work on Monday and my vehicle was towed.  It cost me $270 to release it (200 for the tow and 70/day storage fee).  When I went to the apartment office and told them that I was not parked in a ""building E or F uncovered space"" or between carports 139-218 or 233-264 they handed me a color coded map.  It was a Google satellite view of the complex with colored boxes around the sections of spaces that would be worked on each day.  The space I was parked in was noted on the map but not on the flyer so there's an obvious discrepancy here.  The manager said that copies of these maps and flyers were taped to each tenant's door prior to the construction (about 10 days).  I never received anything taped to my door.  Obviously if I would have seen the map then I would have moved my vehicle further down the parking lot but according to the flyer I was parked in a good spot.  She also said that they taped maps to the construction cones placed around the parking lot.  I saw the construction cones placed in the parking lot about 2 days before construction started but I did not see any maps taped to them prior to the start of construction.  When I was walking back to my apartment unit I did see the maps taped to a few of the cones.  Management stated that they would not refund my towing charges because they stated that they provided maps and flyers to all the residents by taping them to their apartment doors and that there were maps taped to the construction cones (not all of them but a few of them).  As I previously stated I never received anything taped to my door.  There was a flyer taped to my carport but there were no maps to accompany the flyers (the office admitted that they only posted flyers to the carports - no maps).  I would assume that they did tape the information to my door and it may have blown off in the wind or something - it happens sometimes (I've come home sometimes to find a piece of tape and a small strip of paper stuck to it on my door from the wind blowing stuff off).  

So do I have a leg to stand on or am I screwed out of $270.  My argument is that according to the flyer I was parked in a legitimate spot.  The flyer however does say ""see map"" but I never received a map (although one may have been taped to my door I never received it - probably got blown off by the wind or ripped off by kids).  It never indicates where to ""see"" the map but I didn't have any reason to believe that I was in a questionable spot as the flyer clearly stated where not to park and I wasn't in any of those spots.  My other argument is whether or not taping stuff to the door of an apartment unit constitutes proper notice.  Most of the stuff taped to my door is about picking up your dog shit and stupid stuff like that (I have no pets but they tape that stuff to everyone's door to be fair).  My lease renewal was taped to the door and mailed to me.  I know that evictions are also taped and mailed.  There's an obvious discrepancy between the flyer and the map and they should have posted both on the parking spots rather than just the flyer.  If you look at the map you can see that there are 3 or 4 spaces past space 264 that are highlighted.",,False,self,t5_2rawz,False,,,True,t3_1f01w5,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1f01w5/my_apartment_complex_authorized_the_tow_of_my/,

After my grandmother died, we got her condo in Florida. We live in New York. We went there on vacation for a while, but it was costing too much. To help pay for expenses we ended up renting it out. One lady screwed us but paid what she owed. Then my mom found ""Louis"", the Brazilian that barely knows English. How she found him, I have no idea, but thats beside the point.

Here is a list of what he has done:

1. Rented the apartment to some men (we learned this from other people in the condo) when he said he couldn't find anyone. He said it was him and his cousin cleaning the place up.

2. He took the security deposit when we got a ""real"" renter. He said it was commission.

3. After talking with the renter, we learned that he was entering it when she wasn't home and harassing her for money.

4. We paid for him to hire a professional service to clean the carpet. He rented a vacuum from Home Depot and made the renter do it.

5. We rarely got a full month's rent into our bank account.

6. Renter left after 2 months of not paying, because the place she worked burned down.

7. We paid him $1000 to get someone to paint the walls. He painted one room himself, poorly, and got paint everywhere. We got $500 back.

8. After he agreed on a time to visit him in Florida, he said he was gone on an emergency for the week. We threatened police action in a letter mailed to his business, and he called within the day, begging us to not call the police.

9. He says he can't afford to pay us what he owes.

10. We finally got a check for $400 from him after bothering him for months. He's saying that's all he can afford to pay us.

In total, he owes us around $600 for rent we never received. Not counting the cost to clean the dried paint out of the carpet, or replace the furniture and my grandmother's oil paintings that he took and sold.

I believe that this caused damage to my suspension, and the company refuses to pay for the damages despite their $1 million insurance guarantee. Do I have any options here?",davedawg2000,14,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1e95bc/california_i_rented_my_car_through_a_carshare/,"Hi Reddit,

Back in April of 2012, I found myself in-between jobs and was looking for ways to bring in some income while looking for other work. I ended up turning to [RelayRides](https://relayrides.com/), a ZipCar-style auto rental company where the vehicles are privately owned by individuals as opposed to being part of the company's fleet. Vehicle owners are able to set their own rental rates, with RelayRides taking 40% of the rental fee amount to cover their insurance and operating expenses, etc.

Anyways, I rented my car to a man who ended up driving my car through what he described as a ""fairly big"" pothole. It was severe enough to rupture the front-right tire on my vehicle. He was super apologetic about it and ended up replacing the tire on his own dime, even though I think this is something that would be covered by [RelayRides' insurance policy](http://relayrides.zendesk.com/entries/21153718-i-d-like-a-wordier-more-specific-more-complicated-explanation-that-uses-insurance-terminology). 

Long story short, I went in to get some unrelated brake work done a few months later (Sept '12), and after the courtesy safety inspection, the mechanic at the shop informed me that I had some severely damaged struts that should be replaced sooner rather than later. This initially struck me as odd, seeing as my car is a 2006 model with less than 35,000 miles on it at the time. I then remembered the pothole incident from a few months prior, and I asked the mechanic if he thought that could be the cause, to which he responded ""absolutely"".

I ended up contacting RelayRides support, only to receive the following message:

&gt; *Thank you for writing in. I am sorry to hear about the recently discovered damages to your suspension. Unfortunately, with the length of time that has transpired following the reservation in question in April, we cannot file this insurance claim. Since there have been other reservations, both renter and yours', that have transpired since the tire was replaced, we cannot properly assign fault.

&gt; Not to discount the shop that you took it to, but I'd also get a second opinion on the damages and their severity.

&gt; If you have any questions, please do let me know. Again, I am sorry to hear about this.*

I haven't since taken any actions on the repairs, as I still feel that I shouldn't necessarily be on the hook for them. Now that it's been over a year since the original rental, I feel like I'm most likely shit-outta-luck due to the amount of time passed / statute of limitations, and all that jazz.

Is there any possible course of action I have to possibly get reimbursed for these damages? Can I possibly go back and sue the original renter directly? I believe the quote I had at the time was over $1,300 in repairs, which far exceeded the amount I made from renting out my car for those couple of months.

I have commented on their social media posts explaining my dissatisfaction with the service, only to have them all deleted. This is ironic to me, as a corporate communications director at RelayRides had actually reached out to me last June, inviting me to be featured as a satisfied owner for a piece that ABC's Nightline was going to run.

I apologize for the disjointed rant, but I just wanted to put this out there in case someone thinks that there may be a possible solution. I am happy to provide additional information if it helps :)

Me and my wife were at a liquor store that we frequent. I had been drinking already. I wanted to get more liquor as we were on our way to the our home to meet her sister and boyfriend for a small get to together. My wife refused and told me that I didn’t need any more liquor and to stick with beer. So we go to the counter to pay for beer and cigs. There are some small bottles of liquor there as most stores have. I nudge my wife trying to get her to buy me a couple of them. She tells me NO. The cashier can clearly see what it happening. I nudge her again and tell her I want it quietly, she of course tells me to stop being dumb. So I jokingly stick a couple of them in my back pocket. The cashier sees this and accuses me of theft. I tell her I wasn’t going to steal anything. They call the police and she informs one of the workers to stand in front of the door. I ask her if shes knows that she cannot detain either of us as that is illegal and similar to kidnapping. She says that she does know this and for the worker to move away and let us leave but to get our license plate. We then get home and my company is already there. Shortly after the police roll up. An officer comes to the window and ask for me to step outside and speak with him. I lock my storm door and tell him we can speak through it because I can hear him just fine. He yells to me that I am going to jail and that they are coming through the glass and walks back to his car. A few minutes later more cops come up. Another one comes to the door and ask to speak with my wife. I tell him that she is unavailable. He begins yelling and cursing me that he will go get a warrant for her arrest. I tell him to go ahead and do that. At this point I am pissed off and raising my voice as well. My wife hears this and her and my sister inlaw and her BF come out of the back bed room. My wife comes to the door and tells me to go set down and let her do the talking as she was sober. I walk away back to the couch and as I’m sitting I say “fuck these assholes” or something similar. I never made any threats of harm to them. As soon as I say that the cop yells out “menacing an officer” and breaks through my front door. Pushes my wife to the ground and tackles me. My sister in law gets up to help her sister from being trampled. I get put in cuffs and thrown around pretty good. At this point I am yelling for everyone to calm down as I don’t want anything escalating further. Things calm down for a few moments and all of a sudden another cop yells at my sister in law that she is going to jail for assaulting him. SHE DID NOT.
I was charged with menacing and resisting arrest.
My sister in law was charged with assault in the 3rd. A felony.

It was very difficult to get around for the next few days, but within a week I was walking without any support with no pain whatsoever.  My first week after the break my work put my on light duty doing desk work to pass the time.  On my 5th day of light duty they told me I could no longer do light duty because apparently since I was on my break when the accident happened they will not supply me with that convenience.  By that time my foot was feeling much better and I was certain that I could carry out all of the duties that my job requires.  

The following Monday I went to see my doctor and had some xrays, I told him how I felt about the foot and what duties my job required and  that I thought I could go back to work.  He said he agreed and wrote me a work release form with no restrictions.  The next day I came into work as I had been instructed to by my supervisor, and was brought into my HR office.  The HR guy told me he would not accept the work release from my doctor and began making ridiculous requests.  At first he wanted to talk to my doctor, then when my doctor declined he decided he wanted me to sign a waiver allowing him to talk to my doctor, when that didn't pan out he said he wanted me to get my medical records and bring them to him so he could get a 2nd opinion from a doctor of his choice.  I declined to do that because at that point he had already forced me to use almost all of the vacation time I had earned and been saving, and saw no point in trying to resist any more.  Now I am in the process of getting myself covered by FMLA or short term disability (not sure what the difference is). 

 My question for you folks is, is this legal?  I don't understand how he can pick and choose which medical opinions to listen to, and how he can ultimately decide when I'm fit to return to work..  I feel as though I am being bullied around because I do not know my rights in this particular situation.  I fear that everything he's doing is completely covered by the company one way or another, and that I'm being forced to burn all of my vacation time that I've earned and saved for a vacation I've already paid for later this year, not to mention being forced to sit around my house when I know I am more than capable of doing my job.

  I genuinely just want to return to work and don't want to lose the things that I've put so much effort into earning.

I have been leasing a warehouse/business-suite  in a commercial park for about 7+years. Over the years my company has installed many industrial machines in there worth about 100K.

I am now ready to sell my shop and move overseas. 

I have accepted 4  offers to purchase my shop, all of whom are from East-Indian people, all of whom were denied by the landlady for very shady reasons: (She says they are ""scammers"", or that they ""do not know how to run a business"" ect.)

The Land-lady has made it essentially impossible for any new (East-Indian) tenants to come to a lease-agreement with her. She has denied all four stating that they do not seem like they would be able to sustain the business. One potential buyer even agreed to pay a year's rent in advance which she also refused. 

The first time I told her I was selling the shop, she was smiling and asked if the people buying were friends. When I told her the East-Indian sounding name of the buyer, her facial expression immediately changed and she hinted that it would be very hard to approve a new renter.

She openly says things like ""oh I cannot trust those people"" when on phone conversations with me.

I fear that if I say anything she will dramatically increase my rent forcing me to move out and lose all the installed equipment.

Is there any law or anyway I could prove that she is discriminating against certain people?

She has stopped returning phone calls and will take over a week to respond to e-mails from potential buyers, each time requesting overly specific (almost uneccssary) information.

Many of these potential buyers have had, great credit scores, good references, owned other businesses in the same industry.

Please help, any advice would be appreciated.

I got a bank account, a passport, a driving liscence, national insurance and all my educational certificates under the name White.

I found a copy from 3 years after I was born that still had the surname Black, and began to realise my name was not White at all.     
When the people checking my documents saw this they asked if I had any proof of a name change. Obviously I don't. They said they would just overlook it, and I completed the form.      
Problem is this is just for part of my uni course, next time this happens it won't be in this environment but will be in preparation for genuine employment!     
I need to know what my name is and if I can even change it by deed poll now when I have no ID to prove that birth certificate is mine.

I'm very unfamiliar with law because I have never dealt with anything like this before so sorry if I seem a bit dull or whatever but I'll try my best to follow. I just want to make sure everything's right.

**Background:** My dad recently told me that he had properties in China that I apparently own 25% of. He said that the market isn't that great right now, but because money's tight he's looking to sell them and needs me to give him Power of Attorney authorisation for the transaction which makes sense.

I am a United States citizen (Chinese background) but I currently live in Australia, so it would be easiest for me to get everything notarised in Australia. However, if for legal reasons I need to get it done in America because I am not an Australia citizen or permanent resident (just on a VISA), this is possible. Additionally, my dad has quite a bit of history of being terrible with money. He's not a bad guy, but admittedly has had gambling addictions in the past so I want to be as specific as possible with my Power of Attorney to make sure I don't end up in this shit somehow.

**Questions:**

* Because I am not a permanent resident or a citizen of Australia, would I have to get all the legal bits done in America? Such as, getting it approved by the Chinese consulate and getting it notarised?

* I looked up a few Power of Attorney templates online, but they're all very general obviously. How would you suggest that I phrase it to be as specific as possible?

* If I give him Power of Attorney over the financial transactions of the properties to sell them, is there any way for me to ensure that I receive my money? Or is it entirely up to my faith in him?

Those are all the basic questions I have, but if there's additional important information, advice, or maybe even similar experiences that can be shared, I'd highly appreciate it!

My household consists of myself and my father, who is the legal owner of our trailer. The trailer is paid for in full, but it's in a trailer park, so we pay lot rent. I come home from school about once every five weeks or so. My father spends essentially zero time in the house, preferring to stay with family while I'm away (ever since Mom died a couple of years ago he's been lonely and won't stay in the house alone).

I returned home for spring break last Thursday night to find that a substantial amount of my expensive liquor had been consumed (Dad does not drink at all), my bedroom had been completely trashed, crayon has been drawn all over my desk and won't come off (I do not even own crayons), the inside of the dryer has been festooned with stickers, my bathroom was excessively filthy, and the distinct smell of marijuana was in the air. I called my father, who was not home when I arrived, and he informed me that he allowed my cousin, my cousin's wife, and their two children to stay in the house while their home was being repaired. He never told me this despite the fact that we talk on the phone at least twice per week and had plenty of opportunity to do so.

While I am glad that my father has that helping spirit, I am creeped out by the fact that someone stayed in my home and slept in my bed (and presumably had sex in it, judging by skimpy underwear left behind) without my consent or knowledge. I am offended and disgusted at the state they left the house in. My father does not seem to care very much about it, but I do because I am expected to do all of the cleaning and caretaking of the house. Not only did I have to invest time in order to get the trailer clean again, but I had to invest money in the form of cleaning supplies.

I told my father all of the things that they did and told him that under no circumstance would I be okay with them staying there ever again, especially not without my knowledge, but he doesn't seem to care much. (I'm not even sure he believes me that they did all of these things.) Dad is sort of a pushover and would likely let them stay there again if they were to ask, and being that they live in a sub-par apartment complex, it's likely they'll have repair on their home again sometime in the not-too-distant future. Even though I'm not the legal owner of the home, is there anything I can legally do to make sure they can't stay in my home again? I'm graduating in May and will be home for at least six months after that while I get on my feet, but I spend a lot of weekends away and the last thing I need is to come home to this ever again.

At the beginning the company was thriving and doing great and the work environment was fantastic, it was the best job I ever had. Unfortunately, we have had turnover in management and the new group has a different idea of how to run the company, which I'm sure finances are dictating to an extent.

Anyways, for the past year we have had 3 rounds of layoffs without hiring anyone back on to replace these people as more work comes in. I have been working 60-90 hours weeks and it's just getting to the point that I am mentally and physically drained. I worked until 2am (got in at 8am) the other night to be back at the office at 8am the same day. I literally got through the day like I was a zombie. Even after this, I was asked to take on more workload. I want to just tell my boss no and that I physically can't keep doing this, but I need some kind of income to pay my basic bills.

To add more to this, I was promoted a year ago and starting a new role, but never signed anything (I completely switched departments) agreeing to my new title and job responsibilities. I asked my manager about 2 months into this new role for a list of my responsibilities and if I could sign something so we both can acknowledge my job duties, but was told it's not necessary for internal moves. I would love to quit, but I can't financially do this.

At what point can I walk out of the office without worrying about being fired without the ability to collect unemployment (if they were to fire me for this). The other night for example, at about 10pm I was really tired and had a hard time keeping my eyes open and was worried about driving home to the point I thought about sleeping in my car (I didn't actually end up leaving the office until 2am), but realized I would need to shower and change in the morning so I just managed to get myself home.

My father, my biological sister and I raise her as a group and have shared custody of her since my mother's death from cancer over a year ago. About two weeks ago our sister (whom we shall call Snow White) sent a friend a picture via cell phone of the answers to a project in her government class upon request.  The teacher asked her repeatedly if she cheated on the assignment, and Snow said no until the teacher asked if she sent someone a picture and she immediately understood and admitted guilt. Her grade was dropped from an a to a C minus for the quarter and an email was sent home reagrding the academic code violation. This was Snow's second disciplinary action since our mother's death--she ditched a few periods last year and severed Saturday school. Before my mother's death she was a dedicated student who has struggled with learning disabilities due to being drug exposed at birth and suffering form Attachment Reactive Disorder. 
About a week after getting into trouble with the teacher, Snow decided to post a fake twitter account to ridicule the teacher, who had been making life difficult for her by consistently referring to her in class as a cheat and a liar (the teacher is one of my former colleagues and is a powerful and amazing teacher who has high discipline expectations and is sometimes very emotional.)

Snow made the teacher's name signifgantly differnt from the real name--she used an exaggerated phonemic spelling and latinized it as well. She showed a couple of friends what she did. According to her, she made posts that exaggerated the teacher's extreme expectations about studying and homework. The page quickly spread through the school and a student informed the teacher of it. 
Snow believed that another student was going to be kicked off the baseball team for something he posts on the parody so she decided (without letting any of us know what was going on) to email the teacher and confess. This morning she went to the classroom to talk to the teacher and apologize. The teacher refused to speak to her. 
She was called into the office this afternoon and suspended for 2 days. Charges have been filed at the local PD (we live in Los Angeles, California) and the detective in charge of High Tech crimes has been assigned to the case. He is not available yet.

My questions are thus:
One, can she be charged with a crime? 
Two, we are people of limited means. SHould we get a lawyer and if so, what kind?
Three, can she be expelled? (She did not access twitter from the school or use a school network--it was our home connection). 
Can she be expelled? There is nothing in the parent/teacher handbook about identity theft (that is what they are calling it) but they do have a bullying code. 
Will being charged with a crime prevent her from receiving financial aide in college? 
The teacher has claimed she is suffering emotionally from this issue--it is making her IBS act up and she has suffered humiliation in front of students and coworkers. Can she civilly sue a student? If she does can she sue us or our father or put a lien on our home since she lives in the home and we receive Adoption Assistance from the state for her due to her special needs and health concerns (no, she isn't Special Ed but she does have have auditory delay.)

We are in a panic. SH e is a really good kid and has been through hell and back taking care of her siblings from her addicted mother and caring from her adopted mother for 2 years while she died an excruciating death, suffocating from lung cancer. We have 17 kids between the 3 families to support and cannot afford to lose our homes or pay for costly court fees.

I paid with two cashier's checks.  We signed the title and received the bill of sale and drove home.

Would appreciate some legal (any) advice.",thrwawayadvice,15,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/11kd7h/i_was_assaulted_then_charged_with_assault_i_have/,"I grew up in a home where I was abused by my step father, I left home got a job that paid minimum for 15 hours a week, which was the best work I could find since I did not have a high school diploma, I ended up coming back to the abusive home. I got back to work and obtained my high school diploma, my step father who saw me as a leach was constantly attacking me. 

This incident in particular was one morning he found that he was unable to use my computer. As I had the only computer in the house. He came into my room and demanded that I let him use it. When I refused and tried to leave the room that he was blocking, he placed me in a head lock and wasn't able to breathe. I used all the energy I had to run both of us into walls. He dropped to the floor, and I managed to squeeze out. He then left to his room, at which point I called the police. 

The police came, and my step father claimed that I had punched him in the nose, which was bleeding (because I had rammed us both into the wall). They asked me if I had touched him first, and I said that at the beginning I had tried to walk past him. (I was trying to be honest) They said that since I started it, that I was going to be the person charged and forced me to leave the house. 

A couple weeks later, I went to court and when they asked whether I was guilty or innocent. I said not guilty. I was given a lawyer, who every step of the way said that I should say I was guilty. But I didn't, and I kept going to court claiming my innocence, that was until the day before my court case when I went to to the judge he told me that I was going to have to get my own lawyer, since my step father made too much money for a court appointed lawyer. 

At that point I was offered a plea in advance, I was told that it would not effect me getting a job and that after the period of time it would automatically come off my record by the same lawyer who had been telling me to say I was guilty the whole time. 

I agreed, I thought it was done, and applied for college and applied for a job, which I had successfully gone through the application for. Then it hit me, they did a background check and found the plea in advance. I was denied the job. I still went to school, but I required school loans now for living expenses, and I still didn't have enough to eat. Despite all this I managed to get a 3.7 gpa for my first year. 

After the year, I had expected this to come off my record, but to my astonishment, it went from being a plea in advance to a criminal charge. I had found out that they had sent mail to my parents home and that it had been thrown away. At the same time, my glasses broke and a tooth cavity was getting so bad that I went to the dentist to get a filling, both without insurance or a job. I used all my money that should have gone towards food to cover the costs.  That's when I dropped out of school. 

My sister said that she could get me work at a call center that she worked and I moved in with her and was able to get the job. But all my money went towards rent. I had no money to pay school loans, and ended up failing all the classes that I had been taking. The call center was something of a slave labor camp, asking for mandatory overtime. Finally I couldn't take it and left. And when I go to job interviews they love me, up until I say that I do have an assault charge, then they turn me away. I'm about to be homeless soon, this event has ruined my life and I don't know what to do.  If you have any advice, especially legal advice, I would love to hear it.  I have $200 to my name (I am not looking for hand outs, I just need you to know where I stand).

Edit:  I contacted the court and they let me know that the case had been dismissed.  This means that it should not be showing up as a misdemeanor on my background checks.  I'll be going to get paper work showing that I was not found guilty today at the court, I've started the process to try and continue the interview with the employer that I was speaking with.  And I will expunge it off my record so that this isn't something that bothers me again.  Thank you reddit, I don't know what I would have done without you.

Some guy has had a lawyer draw up a legal document that she has gone ahead and signed saying she will receive $63,000 dollars for 58 acres of land (which is everything except an acre for her house to be on). Not only do I know that is a fucking joke, but everyone I've talked to about it says she has been preyed on. I've tried many times to talk her out of it, I told her he is going to end up cutting the timber and making a profit, or selling it for what it's worth (probably a quarter of a million). She claims he's putting cattle on it, but I grew up there, and there is room for cattle, but half of it is virgin pine and other good timber woods. The land is soft, fertile, and has a creek or two, not to mention lots of great game (deer, wild turkeys, and such). She told me ""I made this decision by myself, as an adult, and of SOUND MIND"" which sounds like something a lawyer said. They've convinced her no one is going to buy it (a big fat lie) and that it's not worth much (a big fucking joke). Also, there are mineral right in mine and my moms name (some of it a salt water well that my nana has never seen a penny for because, once again, she is timid and lets men tell her she has to lay down and get fucked) and I'm pretty sure there is land that is mine and my moms, but my nana is now saying there isn't. This just sounds like a legal shit storm.

She's 81 years old, not very bright (sorry, nana), has alzheimers, and is a widower living all alone on this land for the past 5 years while I've been off to college. It's painfully obvious that she's been preyed upon. I guess my main question is, will it be worth it to try to make this right? Do I have a chance now that legal documents have been drawn and signed, and also now that she had already received $10,000?

I've thought about two options: either calling the man, telling him I know he's full of shit and that he needs to make it right or I'll sue him and have is lawyer disbarred for preying on an old sick lady (I have no clue what I'm doing) or find her lawyer and talk about it with him (I have no clue how much money that might cost).

We worked for about four years, creating projects and building a commercial space. Over that time, my partners families continued to invest sums of money, far more than my family was able to contribute. I made up for it by running our company’s many websites, managing renovations, doing outreach and processing incoming clients for two years.  Last year, shortly after hiring a manager, my partners sat me down and told me that the company I believe I owned 33% of, I actually owned closer to 5%, but I was still free to create content for them... yeah right. I moved out of town and got an agency job in another city.

During my time at the studio, I co-wrote and directed a project with a friend from middle school who went on to be quiet successful (wrote some big budget movies, has a recurring role on a major network drama). My project won a few awards, and I even had a chance to pitch to a major studio in L.A., but never heard back and my partner dropped the ball on scheduling follow up meetings.

Today one of my (former) partners said he had hired a laywer to write up a release from the celebrity who co-wrote my big project. He wants me to get in touch with the celeb, see if he wants to get on the project or release it, and then have the laywer send him the contract. I worry if I do this, I may out-myself entirely from this project (similarly to what happened with the business). My partner said he's willing to drop a substantial sum of money to promote and sell the project, which is how I lost my share of the business.

There's nothing on paper regarding the ownership of the project. As far as I understand I should own it all, or split 50/50 with the celebrity who co-wrote it.

I know this is a lawyer-up situation, and while I finally have a little cash from my agency gig, I still don't know where to start. I'm currently based out of PA, but the project was completed in NY. The celebrity lives in CA.

Two girls lived here already, and the third had moved out the month prior.  The landlord removed the third girl (J) from the lease and added me on instead.  That lease ended in April 2013.  One of the remaining girls (M) and myself then signed a new lease through August 2014.  When I was shown the house initially, I was told that J had moved out of state and didn't want her bedroom furniture anymore, so it remained with the house, and the room I was renting would be furnished with it.  

Flash forward to this Sunday.  I received a Facebook message from J (who I have never met before) saying that her sister was moving to my city Aug 22, and that she needed the bedroom furniture, or I could purchase it for $500.  

I replied to her saying that I was informed that the furniture was staying with the house, and that was the pretense under which I signed the lease.  

She said that since no money was exchanged, the furniture still belonged to her, and she simply intended to store it there until the original lease she signed was up.  (It ended April 2013)

It seems to me that she abandoned her property whenever she moved out, and that it rightfully would belong to the landlord?  Does she have any claim to it?  Also, if she was storing items here without paying rent, could I counter her and tell her she needs to pay a storage fee for keeping her furniture here for over 15 months without paying rent?

The partner has, recently, been unfaithful and abusive, so my friend is getting out of the relationship. The partner does not want to sell the house, so my friend is looking to find the best way to dissolve this partnership and any further responsibility for the house.

The house:

I) On the deed, both my friend and his partner have Joint Tenancy. My friend would be the last ""unmarried man"" in this document. (Not sure if that makes any difference, just to show that his partner is the initial ""unmarried man"". Here is a redacted copy of the deed: http://imgur.com/UVTRoX3

II) Since purchased, they have been splitting the cost of the mortgage, any upgrades to the house, etc., but his name is not on the mortgage because he was the victim of identity theft when they bought the house. Also, they share a joint bank account, so it might be difficult to prove who's money went where. 

Questions:

1) One would assume he can't force his partner to sell the house. So, what are the legal ramifications of him leaving the partner, but still staying on the deed? 

2) Is it an option to get his name removed from the deed? If not, would he be entitled to a portion of remaining monies (after the mortgage is paid off, etc) if the house were to be sold? His partner has said that he refuses to give him any monies from the house should he decide to sell. 

3) Since his name is not on the mortgage, can he be held responsible if the partner just stops paying (since my friend's name is on the deed)? 

4) Any other options I'm not considering?

""His"" Car:

I) Due to the identity theft, the partner is the only name on the title of my friend's car. So, legally, it belongs to the partner. My friend has been paying the full amount of the car payments and insurance since it was purchased. 

Since the remaining balance on the car is only a few thousand dollars, and since the partner refuses to sell the house at this time, the partner has agreed that it's fair that my friend get to keep his car (since he is the one that will have to move out), and the partner has offered to take over the remaining payments for the car and the insurance.

They wrote up a simple ""agreement"" basically just stating that the partner will assume the payments for the car and the insurance and then sell the car to my friend for $1 when the car is paid off. They took it to a notary and signed the document. 

Questions: 

1) Would this be a legally binding document? In my search, I have read different views on whether it would be. Personally, I'd rather he have something more concrete. Since my friend will be moving to another state, we are worried that the partner may have a change of heart and then call the car in as stolen, etc. He's not the nicest guy. (The partner)

2) Are there any sites that might have a form they could use in this case? Something that would be legally binding? Would they then take this to a notary, or would they need to go to a lawyer to sign, etc? 

Sorry if I missed anything...I really have no idea how any of this works. I'm just trying to help him out because I think the partner may be trying to take advantage of the situation. He's not asking for anything other than his dogs, his clothes and his car. It would be nice if he could get something out of what he's put into the house, but he's not as concerned about that right now. He just wants to get out of a bad relationship.

1375973449.0,10,self.legaladvice,1jyi3e,"Houston TX - Following an accident, the responding police officer denied me key rights and refused to follow proper procedure, possibly costing me dearly.",metallicamaster3,16,6,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1jyi3e/houston_tx_following_an_accident_the_responding/,"Hi /r/legaladvice. Hoping you can shed some light on some of my questions, as I'm very angry with the Houston Police Department and want to know if I'm either boned, or have a chance if I hire a lawyer, as money's already tight and I can probably only afford to hire one if I decide to go after the department, if that's even possible.

I am a commercial driver here in Houston, I drive a non-CDL'd 18ft box truck from Houston to Dallas nightly. Having a clean driving record is key to keeping my career path clutter-free, as I hope to have my CDL in a few months. So, keeping my record clean and my insurance rates low is very important.

Anyway, backstory. On July 15th I got into a car accident, I was making a left hand turn going northbound-to-westbound when a southbound SUV plowed into me. She claimed she had a green light, but I also had a green light. The insurance company(-ies) are investigating to see who's at fault, which looks like I probably will be. Coming from metro New York, I've only ever seen protected-left hand turns, and it's up in the air if the light at the time of the accident was in protected-turn mode or yield-to-turn mode. I was cited for failure to yield, which sucks, but everyone makes mistakes I suppose. I am due in court on the 16th to address the citation, which will most likely be dismissed with deferred deposition since my record is currently crystal clear.

The problem I'm currently stuck right now is that the officer that processed the accident did some very jaw-dropping things that could've played very key roles in the investigation of the accident.

Directly following the accident, two witnesses ran over to see if we were alright. They were two females, ages 15-17 (approx). They asked if I was okay (dazed and winded from the impact, I limped to the side of the road and laid down), before rushing over to the other car. The lady driving the other vehicle came out of the car, arms flailing, and screaming at the top of her lungs, much more dramatic than the usual just-got-into-an-accident stuff. I called 911, and got the police dispatched to the scene. The original witness came up to me again and asked again if I was alright, when she told me that she seemed drunk and there were empty containers in the back seat of the vehicle and on the passenger floorboard. I asked her to make sure she told the police officer, and she said she would. 

There was also a passenger with her, but we'll get to that in a second.

The woman sat down on the ground crying hysterically, and kicking her feet on the cement the way a 3 year old throws a tantrum. She was in her early 30s. 

Two police officers arrived, as well as the fire department. They disconnected the batteries of our vehicles (her horn was blaring due to the harsh impact). The officer went over to the woman first to ask if she was hurt, and she said no, still wailing away. He then took her driver's license and insurance card, and come over to me. He asked me for my license, took one look at it, saw the ""Under 21"" tag in big red letters, and smirked at me. He then told me to stand near the corner of the building while he ""ran my license"". I knew right then and there that it was going to be a long night.

The original witness and two other witnesses - another driver who was behind the other vehicle right before the accident, and another pedestrian who was on the southern end of the intersection right near where I was struck - were walking towards me when the officer pulled them away and asked them to go over to him. They did. He appeared to take their statements, and told them to leave the scene. They left. This got me worried as I had not gotten the contact information from any witness, but I figured that their information would be in the police report. 

I then decided to take pictures of the scene, just like anyone would (and should) directly following an accident. I wanted to get pictures of both the damage and the alcohol containers in the other vehicle if I could. The moment I stepped off the sidewalk and pulled out my phone, the officer yelled to me ""HEY. GET AWAY FROM THERE, AND PUT YOUR PHONE AWAY."" Shocked and somewhat frightened, I followed his commands. The tow trucks came and began to hook the cars up to tow them out of the street. I jogged over to the car (still in pain) so that I could get my glasses from the floorboard as I'm nearly blind without them. Again, he scolded me to get back where he told me to stand, in a pretty angry tone of voice.

I did. Confused as to what was going on, I pulled out my phone to call my father in law so that he could come to the scene (as he was the registered owner of the car for one, and for two because I obviously needed some help between towing and getting home). As soon as I put my phone up to me ear he again looked over towards me (he was in his cruiser talking to his partner and the passenger of the other vehicle), and yelled ""I TOLD YOU TO GET OFF THE PHONE. PUT IT AWAY. NOW."" I hung up just as the name of the intersection came out of my mouth, now pretty scared. 

The other driver was still sitting on the side of the road, barely making comprehensible words as her hysteria increased. She rocked back and forth on the sidewalk holding her knees. Absolutely mind-boggled at this point, I take a deep breath and just waited until the officer came back over. After about 20 minutes of standing at the corner of the building completely isolated from everyone else who was at the scene, he finally came over to me and asked ""what happened."" in a very blasé manner. I told him what I recalled (I didn't see the car coming, it was blocked by another car waiting to make a left hand turn southbound-to-eastbound, so I didn't know anything until the moment of impact), and he sighed, wrote me a citation for failure to yield, told me my court date, and handed me back my license. 

My father-in-law then showed up, and went to go speak with the officer. I made the bold move to go over towards them, but he didn't say anything. I then overheard the other officer speaking with the passenger of the other vehicle, very obviously intoxicated as he was having a hard time standing up and his speech was slurred. My FIL went over to the tow truck driver to arrange the car's transport back home, when I turned to the officer. I asked ""the passenger and driver of the other car look intoxicated, and there's open containers in their vehicle. Could you breathalyze us?"" He scoffed, didn't even look up and said ""look, I'm a patrol unit. I don't /carry/ breathalyzers."" I then asked if he could get a DWI unit dispatched, and he replied ""no need. she doesn't appear drunk to me. you're free to go.""

I was appalled. If this wasn't a textbook case of when-to-breathalyze-someone, I don't know what is. Or even just a field sobriety test would've sufficed, but he never administered one of those either. 

So, I now went over to my FIL who was ready to go, with the tow truck hauling the car behind us. I left with no photos of the vehicles, no contact information from any witnesses, nothing. Nothing more than a paper citation.

I couldn't sleep at all the next three nights. Eventually, the insurance company contacted me to get my statement, which I gave them. I then asked them if they could send over a copy of the police report, which they said sure to. 

I opened up the PDF of the report and was shocked at what I found. No mention of alcohol anywhere in the report, and the witnesses who were ""on my side"" were completely absent from the report altogether. The officer only wrote my statement, the other driver's statement, the passenger-of-the-other-vehicle's statement, and the statement of the driver of the vehicle behind the woman, which only read one sentence (he was Asian and did not speak English fluently): ""I was behind the SUV when the red car turned in front of her."" That's it. That's the whole statement from him.

So now, as far as anyone's concerned, there was no alcohol involved, there's no witnesses to say that I had a green light, there's no witnesses to say that they saw the other driver appeared intoxicated, no witnesses to say there were open containers in the other vehicle, nothing. I'm now stuck up piss creek with no paddles and a leaking boat. I asked the insurance company what I could do about it and they said I could get a lawyer, but also said that it's probably not worth it as there's nothing in the police report to help me or support my claims. 

What should I do, guys? This officer clearly, for some reason, had it out for me from the very beginning for no apparent reason, and went out of his way to make sure that I got the ass-end-of-the-stick for the entire situation. I'm 4 months shy of turning 21, and insurance premiums are already ridiculous. I'm hoping that the failure-to-yield citation can be plead-down or even dismissed, which will save my driving record, but having an accident on my insurance record will make my premiums skyrocket to unsustainable amounts. The fate of which really rests on the outcome of your advice.

Does she have any options?",AtomicPanda82,15,4,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1jtz5a/pa_usa_friend_got_her_bus_run_taken_away_and/,"I have a question on behalf of a friend, so I hope that's okay. If any more information is needed, I can ask her as I'm in contact with her most of the day. She's really upset and doesn't use Reddit anyway, so I figured I'd have a clearer mind to explain the situation and ask for advice.


Before I explain, she is located in Larimer, PA, USA and works for the Penn Trafford school district as a bus monitor.


My friend started working as a bus monitor for Penn Trafford school district in April of this year. She passed all her tests with flying colors and was put on a run immediately after that. She was on her father's run, which was 5 hours a day. She worked for that run until school ended, and then picked up a summer run, because they said she was doing such good work (the kids on her bus are a bit troubled and don't really listen, but she's gotten them under control for the most part).


She had a meeting for work today, in which they told her that her regular run was being taken away and given to someone else who asked for it, but **she was not being fired.** When she asked why, they said that another monitor wanted it (for more hours) and that monitor had called in a union rep, who told them that, because my friend had worked less than 30 days total, the other employee got priority and the bus lot HAD to give her the run. Note that my friend did not give up her run or ask for a different one; she was completely banking on doing that run when school started up again.


The bus lot didn't want to take the run away from my friend, but they said their ""hands were tied"" and they couldn't do anything, other than offer her first grabs at any open runs if someone had to call out or whatever. My friend and her parents (who both work at the lot) put up a fight, but in the end, the lot said they had no choice other than to give it up to the other monitor who wanted it because of the union rep forcing their hands. As a side note, this monitor who took her run had previously turned it down the school year prior. Again, my friend **was not fired** and is still considered an employee, but as of right now, she has zero hours and no run.


So, my questions:


1. Is the 30 days thing a bunch of bull? If it matters, it's the Teamsters Union that said that, but she isn't sure of the local chapter/chapter number (she can ask when her parents get home).


2. Is this legal? Are they allowed to just take her job (which she didn't give up and was doing well on) and give it to someone else, without even firing her? I know PA is an at-will state, but like I said, she WASN'T fired. She also isn't considered ""laid off"". Does she have any recourse for this, or is she more or less screwed?


My friend is really upset, because she has a child and bills and all that, and she now has no income whatsoever.

Last week the old pick up truck that was used for road maintenance was removed and we spotted a number of local relaters going in and out. 

Just today a notice appeared on a sign at the entrance to the park that the township will be voting to rezone our trailer park from Residential use to a Recreational Vehicle Park. 

From what I can tell from browsing the internet is that we will loose our right to any compensation if we are forced to relocate, and that we can be evicted with much shorter notice.

Both my mother's and my own trailer along with many others in the park are unable to be moved and they were purchased from the park owner in that condition.

When i visited it was after he had had a stroke but after my visit he had another issue and my family was informed that he had a brain tumor and was terminal. He's pretty confused at this point but not completely unable to communicate yet. Not sure of what the real time frame is, but he probably has less than a year to live and he is in hospice and a nursing home now. 

He and that side of the family live about 400 miles away. I don't really like my father and grandfather as people, my grandfather especially so. He's the type of crazy that thinks Obama is going to try and take away his guns and we need a well armed militia to fight that or some such.

He said there would be something I needed to sign since I'm next of kin, but I'm not sure what he meant... Then today my grandfather asked me to sign over power of attorney to him. 

I guess I got this by default as my dad's only child? In any case there are some things I want to be careful about.

They seem to care about him, but I really don't know them well or how they are now. 

So is there any solution I can look into where my grandpa (or someone up there) can take care of most things, but I have some say in any major things? For example ... I don't know if my dad has a will, but if he does, I want to make sure it stays how it was when he was less confused and things he owns (if anything) go to who he wanted them to go to then. I don't want my grandpa to be able to change his will without his consent. 

I don't *think* my grandpa has any malicious intents, but to me he seems kinda unpredictable, and I can't really be sure what he wants or why. I plan on talking to my dad's hospice care people about all of this as well, but I also wanted to hear a legal perspective. I don't want to sign anything and regret it. 

I have also thought that I would rather sign over the power of attorney to my uncle or aunt even, if I could because they seem more stable to me, but I don't want to cause drama when my grandpa wants the POA... and I don't know that they would want the responsibility either... Yeah i really just don't know what to do or what I want... Any advice?

EDIT UPDATE: I talked to my dad's social worker and she did some research. It looks like I don't have to give up POA or anything. My grandpa can make medical decisions and set up his final arrangements when he needs to without any POA signing by me since he can be considered next of kin as well. 

TLDR; Grandpa wants power of attorney cause my father is dying I'm not close to either of them and don't know if that's a good idea or what all he can do with a POA. Is there a solution where I still have some say in major things that happen to my dad?

Details inside,NoelHimself,11,0,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1jiz93/illinois_is_half_sisters_father_violating_his/,"Edit: this all takes place in Chicago if it makes a difference. 

Edit: all I know about the scooter is that it's an elite Honda Sr, or something like that. Probably nothing past a 50cc engine. 

Edit: a photo example of the exact scooter he has: http://imgur.com/eaaWvKv
It's the red one! 
Does that look like it was meant to carry more than 2 passengers to you?! 

So my half sisters' father was kicked out of the house a few years ago due to coming home drunk, trying to rape my mother, and getting in a fight with me. 
After all that, he was granted visitation rights to come visit my half sisters during the day (one is 9 years old, the other is 5). 
He recently got a scooter, so what he's been doing recently is taking both my sisters on it to the park. 
My mother is not fond of this idea and neither am I. 
I feel like he is putting them in danger by taking both of them on this scooter, which seems like it only holds 2 people. 
He seats them in front of him, though. 
I've told my sisters that it's dangerous for them to be on the thing together and told the oldest of them to tell their father that he should not be doing that. It worked for maybe 2 days, but he took them both again today. 
I confronted him about it this time, telling him it's not safe for him to be taking both of them on the scooter, but he insisted it was fine in an impolite manner. I kept telling him no, that he either walks them to the park which is a few blocks away or no go. Things started to escalate from then on ending with violent implications on both our ends. 
He called my mother to tell her he's taking them to the park, and according to him, she said it was fine. I then called her to clarify this but when I mentioned the scooter part she said that he didn't say anything about a scooter. 
He was getting desperate at this point so he called her again demanding he'll be taking them. 
My mother was at work at the time so she didn't have time for his tantrums. She then called me telling me to let him take them but that it would be the last time. 
I was pretty pissed at my mom for this but I obliged. 
I let them go with him but I made it clear that it'd be the last time he does this. He didn't seem to care stating that I have no business in this. 
I despise this asshole, and I never mind him visiting my sisters, but the second he puts them in any danger, you better believe it's my business. 

So my question now is if he's violating his visitation rights and/or any Illinois scooter laws. 
If he's gonna be putting my sisters in any danger, I most definitely will file a report and have his visitation rights stripped.",,False,self,t5_2rawz,1375399668.0,,,True,t3_1jiz93,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1jiz93/illinois_is_half_sisters_father_violating_his/,

I can't go home, I live to far away to have to drive back and forth for a week to go to class. 
Also, keep in mind that this is not my first problem with this complex (which is why I'm not resigning) My apartment was advertised with windows, and it has none.

The title basically says it all, but here is some additional info.

About the guy - I guess he's had trouble paying rent multiple times before, and the landlord gave him 1 month notice that his lease was coming to an end soon and he would either need to make arrangements to move out or renew his lease. He did neither, apparently.

I just want to move in to that apartment. The guy refuses to leave. The landlord even provided the guy with ANOTHER APARTMENT IN THE SAME BUILDING to move in to for a few days so I could move in, and he's still refusing. What do I do? What *can* I do? Also, would it be a good idea or a bad idea to go knock on his (read: MY) door and talk with him? This guy seems very quick to anger - if I get him to hit me without myself breaking any laws, could this be good for me on a legal standpoint?


TL;DR - See title. What can I do?

I'm a minister in an Indiana church, and we're discussing offering a ""Geeky Christian"" small group. Essentially, what we have in mind is a series of multi-week units consisting of faith-related discussions based around nerdy media - books, movies, comics, games, etc.

I've waded into the quagmire of copyright law before, and I know basically that the odds are against us. **Mostly, I'm hoping that y'all can confirm or deny that I'm on the right page, and offer some suggestions**.

Unless I'm mistaken:

* We can't reproduce any text for the study. 
* We can't display films without express permission from copyright holders. We could theoretically use a service such as [CVLI] (http://www.cvli.com), which takes care of licensing for a flat fee, provided that their license covers the production companies whose films we want to use.
* However, there's the whole ""Fair Use"" thing, which I've seen batted back and forth on a hundred forums.

---&gt; Some places seem to indicate that we could reproduce up to 10% of a written work, but those may only apply to specifically educational non-profits.

---&gt; It seems that we could use brief film clips for explication purposes (especially since our work would be ""transformative"", in that we'd be using the clips to promote and discuss Christian teaching *in light of* the clip). However, this might also required some licensing, or it might be patently untrue.

So.

If all my suppositions above are correct, do y'all have any thoughts on how we might realistically carry out a study like this? I know this is r/legaladvice, not r/do-my-creative/ideological-job-for-me, but still, advice appreciated.

* Should we forgo all display of film clips, and just *talk about* bits of movies? This will remove all legal complication but make the group only accessible to people who have viewed the media previously. Is there a ""fair use"" middle ground, in which I could simply pepper a discussion with short bits of film? It does seem that obtaining a CVLI license would remove this difficulty (for the most part) assuming that we own a copy of the film in question.
* Same question for written work. If it's legally impossible to distribute copies of a written work, even in small samples that wouldn't impact commercial sales, do I have any other options besides forcing all participants to buy the book?

I'd love any input that y'all could give on where we stand.

1. Wife incurred 5k cc debt on a vacation before our marriage.
2. We were married, had beautiful children.
3. Received notice that our state tax return would be used towards debt (my first knowledge of the debt). We have applied our return *every* year since totaling around $5k over 9 years. Even though I'm a non-obligated spouse I agree to use full return towards the debt.
4. Every year our return is taken to address the issue, I grow alarmed the debt is **still** increasing, even though we are paying our state return year after year.
5. Both cars repossessed, paid to bail them out and money was put towards debt minus the tow and storage fees.
6. Spouse is garnished at $180 a month, total debt is still at about $12k because the interest was never frozen on this account through our entire nine year marriage. In fact, even as she is making that payment, they are still charging interest.

Basically we have paid back the principle multiple times, and are *still* over two times the original credit limit in debt. I am baffled as to how we can freeze the interest.  This debt is being pursued by a law office and not the original creditor, and as far as I can tell they ""bought""  the debt.

I am just exhausted from trying to determine the best step from here. I feel helpless as I didn't take part in running up the debt, but I am married to it. Any pointer would be greatly appreciated.

I am not wealthy and wish to take them for everything I can get out of them,   expenses and possibly damages (I missed a days work and may lose my job) but I am not a US resident and I need advice on complaining, how much to ask for and the US legal system should they prove difficult.  

Here is my story (unimportant details changed for anonymity):

I recently rented a car from Dulles Int. Airport to travel to my girlfriends place and spend a vacation (2 weeks) with her and her family.  At the end of my vacation I am driving back to the airport and am about 40 mins away and in plenty of time for my flight when I get a flat.  It is 8pm and I am in an isolated rural area with no sign of life nearby.  Despite this I pull over to replace the wheel with the spare.  Its missing but there foam repair kit.  However there is no Jack that you need to make this work (foam doesn't set right unless wheel is off the ground).  I try the foam repair anyway and manage to drive another 600 metres before deciding its too dangerous.

I call for assistance but can't get it to work on my UK phone and I quickly run out of credit trying to call various numbers.  So I call 911 and the kindly dispatcher puts me through to the rental companies roadside assistance.

They tell me that someone was on their way and would I like to be kept up to date via text message.  I say that I'd rather stay on the line for as I'm unsure about the reliability of their texts to my UK phone.  After about 2 hours with no assistance the line goes dead.  I try calling again via 911 but this time the dispatcher isn't so helpful (fair play).  So I decide to wait...

Eventually, after another 6 hours (8 since the initial call, 9 since I stopped)  I decide to go look for help.  After walking for 20 mins though the woods I find a police officer who calls the rental company and gives them both barrels.  He stayed with me for an hour when the assistance eventually showed up.  He is appalled by the situation and has given me his details should I require further assistance in claiming form the rental company who eventually comply to send assistance.  The mechanic who showed is also appalled at the situation and tells me that this often happens with this rental company.  He said the rental company say the spare is often stolen so they don't put it in the car (by policy!!), just leave the can of repair foam which is often useless, certainly without a jack.

Eventually I make it to the airport, clearly having missed the flight by over 7 hours.  My airlines desk is closed so I got the laptop out and booked myself onto the next flight to London that evening.  As a result I missed a days work and my employer is not happy with me.  The issue is still pending.... I'm worried I might lose my job.

My expenses as a result of this are as follows:

Extra Flight: $1400
Phone Calls: $20
Food at airport: $30
Missed Days work: $120
Total: 1570


The total cost of the car rental:  $660 (including optional breakdown cover)

I also feel I should be compensated for my time and the distress caused as missing a days work has been very stressful. I was thinking $2000 (as  a starting point) should be adequate given the negligence of the company. But I need someone who knows more about this to advise me.

How should I approach the complaint?
Where do I stand from a legal point of view?  Will they pay my expenses? ($1570)
Am I able to claim for distress without going through legal proceedings?
How much do you think I can get?

Thanks in advance


EDIT:  Thanks everyone for your help. Some great points that I think will be really helpful. Just wanted to clarify a few points.
911 - I know its for emergencies only. I'm not going to debate the legality of it, its not illegal to call 999 the UK, but illegal to waste their time I think. Apologies if you don't think the situation was serious enough but it was dark, I was in a foreign country in an isolated area and it was the only number I could call on my UK cell as I was out of credit. The police officer I eventually found didn't have a problem with it.
Spare tire - I didn't check. I will next time. Who here has ever checked for a spare when renting a vehicle?
Foam - I'll read up on it. I might have got this wrong. I did actually spray it in and try to drive for a bit but it just wasn't safe.
Insurance - I have travel insurance. I will be informing them them and seeing what I can claim, but want to take the rental company to task first.
Rental Company - Does have a significant UK presence and it was booked through an agent. I will be taking it up with both of them. Should I not be satisfied with their response they shall be named and shamed.
Contract - I have it and will be reading it carefully

There were two kids (18) at his house that nobody knew, and eventually they disappeared. I would later learn who they were while investigating.

For the next couple of weeks, I asked around a few circles of friends if anyone heard anything about the backpack. Eventually someone who I did NOT mention the theft to came to me and told me that this kid (18) was bragging to him about stealing the backpack from the cookout and even named some of the items that were in the backpack. Again, I did not mention the theft to him, and for him to come out with a name and the stolen items is compelling enough for me to believe it.

Apparently the kid that stole it is a local drug user and is well known to be a criminal. I confronted one of his friends and he confirmed that he stole a backpack from the party and confirmed the stolen items without me mentioning them. I told him that I was going to seek legal action unless the backpack was returned, and asked him to please convey that information to the thief. 

A week later the thief's friend whom I confronted came to me and said that the item was turned into the police.

I called the police department today, and the dispatch officer told me to check with the records department on monday.

In Massachusetts, I believe it is illegal to have ammunition in an unlocked container. 

Should I go to the police department and they ask about the unsecured ammunition, should I just say that it isn't mine? The ammunition might not have even been turned in, let alone the backpack. Everything I am going on is hearsay.

What is the statute of limitations on filling out a police report for theft? The theft occurred over a month ago, but less than two months ago. 

I have the full name of the person who allegedly stole it. 

How should I approach this situation? I'm really just hoping to have my pack and custom holster returned. All in all, the items that were stolen were about $300.

The company my wife works for is looking to expand, so employed someone to set up new offices. Before that person actually started their job (but after signing all the paperwork) they left the company [I don't know the reasons why].

My wife has been pushing for additional work/responsibilities/promotion for a while now and when this person left, they immediately offered the job to her - which she accepted. 

Her immediate boss (office manager) was informed of the plan to move my wife to these new premises but caused a stink saying that it was unfair and that other people might like the opportunity, she lobbied HR who have since relented and rescinded the application/offer to my wife and are now planning to open the post internally. 

My question is, does a company have to offer a new post to all potential applicants (at least internally) or can a company offer any job to whoever they like? 

Additional info: The decision to offer my wife the post was approved by HR and she has already received the job offer/change to employment contract documents and signed them, but they haven't been sent to HR.

We were married this month and to be honest our relationship has been disintegrating for a long time. He never wants to be intimate with me, I feel as though he is having affair though I have no proof (so I know this has no legal bearing on any of it). 

To cut to the chase, we were in a long distance relationship for 3 years. I left school (mid degree) to move to the UK on a fiance visa. I had $5,000 in savings. He told me that I could go to school here and finish, get a loan, etc. I should have known that was all lies. The agreement was that I would pay for the visa ($900) and he would pay for my plane ticket out here and my LTR after 6 months. Well, he said that he couldn't do the plane ticket so I paid for that as well.. As soon as I got here, things changed. He stopped being affectionate, distant, withdrawn, moody, threatening. He told me I had to pay for the LTR as well (950 pound). I did.. because god, I loved him and even though he was a different person, I had no affection, I wanted to marry him. I trusted him.


The agreement was that I would keep the house absolutely spotless and clean every day (since I couldn't work for 6 months until my leave to remain) and he would take care of everything else. I was keeping the 850 pound for cigarettes and extra expenses (shampoo, conditioner, medicine) until I found out I had to pay the LTR as well.. He agreed to pay for the cigarettes as long as I cut back to just 2 packs a week, which I have adhered to most of the time.

Our relationship has taken a turn for the worse. I tell him I'm unhappy, lonely, and miserable because he never even acknowledges me.. even after we got married. I feel like he pretended to be happy and loving on the day we got married just to make me feel like it was the right choice. He has become threatening and malicious. He tells me to go, that I will be homeless. He says that he had a prenup drawn up before I came out that declared all his assets his and his alone (prior to relationship). That he had his flat and his car transferred to his father's name for a pound before we got married. That if I left him, he would declare me a visa scammer and then he would take me to the cleaners, sue me for everything I had. That he would take my FAFSA money and anything that my grandfather (who raised me) left me in his will.. my car (broken) basically anything I have left.

I don't want any of his assets. I don't want his flat. Or his car. I don't want anything from. I just want a plane ticket home (even though I will most likely be homeless) and 950 pound for the LTR money. He agreed (prior to this maliciousness) that if we ever broke up he would at least do that for me. Now I don't know what to do.. I just want a plane ticket and the visa refund so I can at least get my car fixed and have a chance to go back to school and make something of my life..

He is threatening to take me for everything, though I literally have nothing, and get me deported with immigration if I say I want to leave. He knows I will be homeless, not be able to go back to school, or anything. He knows I have nothing. I don't have family to help me (my grandfather died and he was all I had.. in arguments my husband has threatened to burn and destroy all pictures and letters of my grandfather I had).

Now, on the lease it says I need to pay a security deposit of 1125 (it's not 1500 because from what ive been told landlords cant charge more than 1200 or something. im not sure about that). okay. thats fine. they want me to make a check for that out to the landlord. great. no problem

but then theres another fee, 750, made out to the company that my realtor works for. now, i found this realtor through a pretty popular realty website. i didnt know and wasnt told id be paying any fees. if i have to pay a fee, thats fine i am willing to discuss it with him. however it says that this is the first month's rent. why am i paying the first month's rent to the realtor?

furthermore, it says earlier in the lease that the landlord is obligated to pay the realtor a commission fee of exactly 750 dollars. am i being paranoid? i feel like theyre trying to get me to pay this commission for them. 

in ADDITION to this, they want me to pay another 411 dollars on august 1st. the logic behind this, when i was told a few days ago (before i saw the lease), is because i am moving in monday and that 411 dollars is paying for the time i spend here in july. a partial month's rent, so to speak

but isnt that the first months rent? if that's the first month's rent, then whats with that errant 750 dollars thats ALSO labelled first month's rent? what am i missing?

Sometimes the building managers will ask me to do mildly dangerous work, such as flipping breakers, using a ladder to reach various things, or throwing salt on the ice in winter.

A coworker brought to my attention that he refuses to do this sort of thing, reasoning that if he is injured the security company will refuse liability, claiming the work was not in the security guard's job description, and that he would not receive workers compensation either as, again, the work he was doing when injured was not part of his job description.

Another coworker of mine mentioned that while the above was all true, if you were actually injured doing such work you'd have a pretty secure lawsuit against building management in front of you, as it was your superior who asked you to do the work, and it wasn't taken up out of your own accord.

In January, and literally every month since, I have complained that our bathroom toilet has been flooding. In February, a pipe under the sink burst and flooded the kitchen. In March, all of the water in our place inexplicably stopped flowing, and in April, our toilet and shower were running super slow. Each time I sent our landlord a text message and called him to check it out. Each time, he would send a day-laborer from Home Depot's parking lot to ""check it out"". I asked one of these ""plumber"" people once for his license number, and he literally RAN out the door.

This weekend, I left town for my brother's funeral. I returned Monday morning to see that our entire bathroom had flooded. It was 2AM, so I called my landlord, texted him, got no response (expected, it was 2AM), and went to bed.

At 11AM that day, our landlord come running up the stairs, banging down my door, asking us to stop using any plumbing because the pipe had burst in the wall and flooded his entire office in shit and water.

Today, I noticed that our common-area front door's lock was missing. I called him to tell him as tenants we need a new lock ASAP. Instead of taking this note, he yelled at me, ""You fucking flooded my office! You used baby wipes in the toilet! You're going to pay for this!"" He's threatening to sue.

It's now July. I have a long history of informing our landlord -- IN WRITING -- and by withholding rent, splitting rent, taking out repairs from our rent etc... that he has had a plumbing problem. As far as I know, he has NEVER sent anyone competent to fix the plumbing. I have a very long history of our correspondance with him, with photos and videos to prove the problems.

What can we do? We paid $7000 as security deposit, which he now wants to withold. We're in California. HELP! Reddit! You're my only hope!

Some things you may need to know: -My sister and I were born in Texas -I currently live in NY and the rest of my immediately family in FL - We are 24 and 27 and he is 57

My landlord is concerned about the lawn, saying ""the yard has basically been totally destroyed, apparently from lack of water"" and has said (in email) ""I don’t want you to let things go until next spring, and then have to put in sod, which is very expensive.""

My lease states that we're responsible for lawn maintenance and we've done our best to keep up with that. We've even put at least $150 into the lawn this year with new top soil, seed and fertilizer.

On top of that, our city is under tight water restrictions and we're only allowed to water twice a week. On top of this, we're not allowed to water between 10am and 6pm. Because of this, not only did our current lawn suffer, but our new seed was never able to germinate/grow.

She filed a complaint with her company and her HR dept. told her it was not their problem because it happened after-hours, so she took it to the police.  The man was charged with 4th degree sexual assault and plead guilty to a reduced aggravated assault charge where he got a few days of jail time and a hefty fee.  He has a no-contact order with my friend, but he works 5 feet away from her in a cubicle that faces her own, and he makes a point to lurk near her desk talking to other people about non-work tasks whenever possible and generally does his best to be everywhere he can to make her life uncomfortable without actually talking to her (ie: talking loudly to other people about how some ""bitch"" has it out for him and standing up to go to the bathroom whenever he sees her doing so as well, because he knows she won't walk next to him).  She has requested to be moved to a desk further away from him, but the request was denied because they said he hadn't technically done anything to prompt it.  

So my question is, is there anything that can be legally done to force the workplace to take her request to be moved more seriously?  Or is she just in a position where this asshole can make her life hell, but as long as he doesn't directly talk to her he can do what he wants?

When the FD arrived, they told me the fire was within legal limits for size and that it wasn't a problem. They told me the call they got was anonymous, and since I had no violation, they couldn't even give me a written warning.      
Fast forward to this weekend (the next fire I've had since) and about 10:30-11pm, 2 police officers show up, saying a neighbor called in a noise complaint (they didn't say which neighbor) I had myself and 4 people in my back yard, no music playing, and we were at a reasonable volume. The officer said ""I didn't even hear anything when I pulled up"" they took my name and address down, but no written warning or anything was issued. They asked me ""do you have a  cranky neighbor?"" I replied ""oh yeah.."" and motioned to the neighbor next door. They sort of laughed and told me to have a good night. The 3 other neighbors I have are pleasant, and I've spoken with them a few times, they've always told me i'm very quiet, even when having people over. So i'm fairly sure its my next door neighbor calling the police and fire on me. 
What can I do if my neighbor keeps doing this? I'm not breaking the law, but its a bit unsettling to have to deal with police or fire anytime I want to have people over in my backyard.    
If I go to the police, can I find out which neighbor called the police on me? is it possible to file something against them to stop doing this?    
     
A small back story, just after I moved in last year, the neighbor asked if he could drive a truck on part of my lawn to pour some concrete in his basement, just moving in and wanting to be good neighbor, I obliged. I came home from work one day to find 2 giant tracks of dirt on my front lawn, and also see a new 4ftx8ft fence that is now on part of my property, blocking access to the side of my house with my water faucet and propane tank that needs to get filled regularly. When I went over to ask about them putting some grass seed on the part of my lawn that is now bare dirt, and also asked about the fence, the neighbor got upset with me, charged out of his door at me, and came at me. He pushed me full force trying to knock me over. (I'm 5'9 225lbs, and he nearly knocked me over) he came at me again and pushed me 2 more times, I walked away and went to the police and filed assault charges. (figuring the only other alternative would have been to fight back, which would have landed me in legal trouble..not to mention this guy is probably 60 years old.)      
    
So because of this, i'm sure they have it out for me (even though the fight wasn't my fault at all...I bought my own grass seed to fix my lawn, and it still looks awful...)     

I live alone, and am a pretty quiet neighbor, I don't really want to start a war if I can avoid it (me calling the cops anytime they blast their TV at night for example) I just want to stop being bothered when i'm not breaking the law.

My partner fell pregnant recently despite using the birth control implant (implanon). This unplanned pregnancy is not something we can deal with and should not have happened whilst on this form of contraception.

We both understand that no contraception is 100% secure however, upon the discovery of being pregnant the implant needed to be removed. At this point in time, no person who is familiar with removing the implant (family planning professionals or doctors) have been able to find it and it appears that the implant was never put in. We are waiting to get an radiographer expert opinion to absolutely confirm this. 

We know the implant can move but if it is never found and it is the case that it was never actually placed then is there a case of malpractice here if the doctor who is responsible for putting the contraception in place failed to implant the device?

According to their website (http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Tolling/), ""Simply drive across a toll facility; we will mail you a toll bill within 14 days of crossing"". I never got a bill. At the time, I had Texas plates on my car, but I figured it was their responsibility to figure out how to bill me.

Yesterday, I got a bill from them to the tune of $300. It was each of the toll amounts, plus a $40 civil penalty for each of the time I used the bridge.

I called the number on the bill but they kept repeating that they couldn't do anything but tell me about my 3 options they provided me:
1. Pay the bill. Hell no.
2. Schedule a hearing where I can talk to a judge. The paperwork clearly states that the judge cannot reduce the amount at all; he or she can only determine whether a violation had occurred.
3. Submit a written dispute, which a judge will look at and their determination is final (same rule as #2 though), and it waives by right to an in-person hearing.

So basically there's no one I'm allowed to talk to unless I pick one of the 3 options above, and none of the options allow me to contest the ""civil penalty"". I'm completely fine with paying the actual tolls, but the civil penalties came out of nowhere and I had never gotten a bill or warning before this.

He went on Craigslist, and found a woman renting out a room in her apartment. When he moved in, she asked him to fill out forms to give to the landlord (which included him giving his social security number) with a proof of income. Towards the end of October, we found an eviction notice on the front door, and the woman had not paid rent yet, even though my boyfriend had given her money for the month. We found out later that she used that money to pay for the past month's rent, and had done so the month before as well. This cost him a whole month of rent ($700), which for a 20 year old who just moved across the country by himself is something he would like to get back. He ended up moving out and finding a new place, and he has tried to get into contact with her since. He talked to her on the phone once, but all that came out of it was her crying and yelling at him. Now she doesn't answer calls, respond to texts, and my boyfriend even paid $1 to send her a Facebook message (that she also didn't respond to).

I was traveling through an intersection with a green light, when a car turned left and hit the driver side back of my car (they had a green light but not arrow, and failed to yield). I exchanged full information with the lady, and she tried to say it was my fault.

I promptly made a claim with her insurer and filed a police report. I notified my insurer of the accident, but because I wasnt at fault and I don't have collision insurance anyway, they simply noted it and havent investigated. She never made a claim with my insurer, because she must know it was her fault.

I have talked several times with an adjuster at her insurance company. He took my statement (I have heard some people say don't give one to the other person's insurer, but I did already), and they have assessed the damage to my car and determined it to be a total loss. But the girl who hit me has not responded to any of his calls, and has not given him a statement.

Is there anything else I need to do to protect myself? I am in Texas, and I just read from a lawyer on avvo.com (in response to a similar question) that believe it or not, Texas law allows the ""at-fault"" driver's insurance company to delay, misrepresent, or outright lie to you (the injured party), because they only owe a duty to their insured, not to you.

My car was only worth about $6k, so according to this lawyer, I can file in small claims court (Justice of the Peace) if my claim is less than $10,000, before the second anniversary of the accident. The company does owe a duty to defend the lawsuit and pay any judgment against their insured, but that's all. 

So my question is, how soon should I take this step? Since the at fault party's insurance company is not getting in touch with her on the phone, they could try and get an examination under oath from her, but how do I know they'll actually pursue this? And is her silence not a tacit admission of guilt? She could try and say she was never even involved in an accident, but I did take photos of her car, write down her VIN, and take a photo of her driver's license. So if she gets any repairs done to the car, I should know unless its done under the table. And there was a tow truck driver who saw the aftermath (but not the accident) who towed both of us. I have his name, and the location of the place her car was towed to.

Also, one fishy thing is that the adjuster after saying my car would be a total loss asked me to fax him my title. But then the next day I got a letter saying they were still investigating the claim and to move my car to a storage free facility. Normal enough so far, but the little box on top said the status of my claim was conditional denial.

1369792532.0,11,self.legaladvice,1f8p41,X posting this from /r/needadvice. My sister verbally abuses my mom and doesn't listen to my dad. My dad wanted me to talk to her and now I'm going to court.,Neckrow,12,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1f8p41/x_posting_this_from_rneedadvice_my_sister/,"To start off, I live with my mom, dad, and my little sister currently but I also have an older brother and younger sister. My sister is 16 and her name is Michelle and I'm 20. Yesterday my sister ended up throwing bread and fruit in my moms face while holding a knife around the house and my dad told me to talk to her because she doesn't listen to my dad.

My mom makes all the money in the house and pays all the bills. My dad helps with some purchases of food, school supplies, and random purchases for the family through his income but my mom practically makes three times more than my dad. (it's over a 100k difference) My mom and dad argue a lot and their marriage was somewhat rocky a few months ago and I'm not sure how well it is doing now. I still think they like each other at least enough to keep the family together.

If my dad tries to lecture Michelle but she would just say he has no right to tell her anything to do because he doesn't pay any bills in the house and she won't listen to him. She calls out my dad on not having a good education and a bad job and says hes basically useless in the house.
My mom works graveyard shift and usually comes home to yelling from my father. When my sister yells at my mom she lets it happen. She sometimes cries and she feels like everyone is being mean to her. She doesn't punish, scout, yell my sister or I. She will just get really sad. In fact, if Michelle yelled at my mom and then asked my mom for money then she would probably give my sister money. Btw, I go out of my way to be very respectful to my mom now but I feel she doesn't appreciate it and I'm fine with that as long as I'm not adding negativity to her life. So I'm not implying I'm being mean to her as well.

This is a conflict between my mom and my sister and I'm not sure if my dad was present at the moment. My sister is always making my mom feel bad for things around the house.

For example; My mom put granola cereal in a jar that my sister puts oatmeal in. My sister yelled at my mom for this and I woke up to it in the morning and then called my mom a piece of shit.

I've tried to talk to her in the past but she will say it's none of my business or that I have no right to say anything because I started community college over after being 2 years in because I wanted to do Engineering and not Nutrition Science. And she keeps a 4.0 gpa and wants to go to a good school.

I remember once I was in the kitchen and my mom was trying to cook a ham. She asked my sister ""do I have to add water to this ham?"" and my sister was saying ""No, you don't. I've told you this already. You should have listened the first time mom."" so I said ""we all make mistakes and forget sometimes Michelle"" and she switches the subject to ""So how are you doing in college LJ"". (my nickname)

So, I tried to talk to my sister today when she got home. I was home alone and she entered the house. I told her she has to be nicer to my mom. She told me it was none of my business. I ended up telling her to stop yelling at our dad as well for over feeding our dog because she is always saying the same thing over and over and expecting different results.

She said it was none of my business and I have no right to say anything. I started yelling and saying she causes mom too much stress. She is VERY passive aggressive and she starts smiling and chuckling. So I pushed her and she fell on her backpack. She ended up going into her room which we were in front of and I stood in front of the door. She said get out of the room and how she didn't want to hear it but I said no, so she called the cops. I live in Connecticut which has strict domestic violence laws so I have to go to court now. I don't think I handled it well and I didn't know how do approach this at all.

A few months ago I told my friend about how my sister abuses my mom and acts like she owns the house with trying to control my mom and he told me that I needed to sit down and talk to her but I know she won't listen to me from past experience because she will bring up how I used to be very angry and take out my anger on my other sister Danielle or how I'm going to community college. (which was by choice because I'm very undecided) Even those arguments I feel are very superficial. It was past events that happened over 2 years ago and I didn't physically abuse someone until I pushed my sister Michelle today.

So end of story, cops came and I have to go to court tomorrow because when domestic violence happens in a household then an arrest has to be made.

Also, I live in California, supposedly a very pro-employee state.

She wants full custody and the house that we own outright (no loan).

We both have full time jobs, she takes care of the kids from when they wake up till about 3:30 or 4pm and then I take care of the kids and put them to bed. 

We're still both in the same house. I'm in the bed, she's on the couch; she is not a fan. 

She had her mother buy her a car we couldn't afford after deciding on a divorce because I was unwilling to incur the debt.

She makes slightly more than me on an average basis, but her pay fluctuates due to the nature of the job.

It is out of town so to make things easier we hired a wedding planner.  It was supposed to make our lives easier but it did anything but. 

  The planner said that he could get our guests a great deal at the hotel we are getting married at.  He said to send the money directly to him as that was the only way our guests would get the discount.  One of the guests called the hotel to verify her room and they didn't have any reservations listed.  We investigated, and found out that he hadn't paid for any rooms, despite giving us receipts saying he had.  

  He claimed that it was a misunderstanding and that he would fix it.  We kept calling him and it kept not being fixed.  We traveled there and personally made sure he paid it, but we had to follow him around for a whole day, while he made excuse after excuse.  His assistant had the check, she left it at her house, her car broke down, her keys were locked in her car.  We hounded him all day, and he could never produce the check so we told him to meet us at the bank in the morning to withdraw a check that we would personally take to the hotel.  We were relentless...this money belonged to our friends/family!  He did come through with the money in the morning at the bank, and we took care of the hotel.

  He was supposed to help my fiance's mother rent a house for the wedding weekend.  He said that he knew the owner and if we paid him, he would set everything up.  Her mother did pay him and when we were in town we asked for the address so that we could see it.  When we looked up the address, the house did not exist.  He said that he must have given him the wrong address so we asked for the owner's phone number. We never got through to anyone.

  We then started checking up on the vendors.  We had been given receipts that were allegedly proof of payment from the vendors.  When we started calling them, none of them had yet been paid.  The hair and makeup people that were supposed to come out to make the bride and her bridesmaids beautiful said they had not been paid, they don't do makeup, and they don't do anything offsite.

  When we began our search for a wedding planner, we looked online for one with good review, but there were no reviews for anyone in this town.  After all these problems we Google'd the wedding planner's name again and found a new review where the people said he had promised them a wedding on a yacht.  When they asked for the phone number to the owner of the yacht, it was the same number he gave us for the bride's mother's rental house!  He has a number he uses to lie to people with!  We want to trace this to see if it is registered to him.

  This guy is definitely being dishonest with us.  We have gone to see some of the weddings he has planned to see if he keeps his word on anything.  They do look beautiful, but all these lies are making us very uncomfortable, and our wedding is less than two weeks away.  We have copies of bogus receipts, email records of our conversations, and we have recorded some of our meetings to get all the things he has promised us on the record.

  I know that if he breeches the contract we can take him to civil court, but we want our wedding to be taken care of.  Wouldn't the fake receipts constitute felony fraud?  Would it be legal to mention that we could press charges if he doesn't carry through on his obligations?  We would rather have the wedding go well than to go after him, even if he has lied to us repeatedly.  Obviously we will let him have it with bad reviews after our date.

  Any advice would be appreciated as to how we should proceed to protect ourselves, and to get him motivated to get his act together and plan our wedding!",,False,self,t5_2rawz,1366233659.0,,,True,t3_1ck09m,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1ck09m/getting_scammed_by_our_wedding_planner_who_showed/,

I've put enough money (about 300) back into my account to be in the black again, but that hurt.

It was honestly me going through something and being emotional, but due to the current social and political climate, it got taken seriously. (My dad got away with nothing whatsoever when he did something related but more serious when he was young.) 

In short, I ended up being ""detained"" in a psychiatric ward for a few days while the police got a search warrant for my property. The warrant was very extreme and accused me of some pretty big things, leading to a request to search for ridiculous and far-fetched items. They ended up taking my laptop, SD cards, electronics, books, journals, documents, notes, etc. I've never been questioned, charged, or even contacted by the police department since they took me to the hospital and I've been out for three weeks now.

Today I went and got a copy of the affidavit, seeing as it is public record. It made me sick. I understand that I was having some problems, but so much was out of context and some things were just not true. But it looks extremely bad. I work in a profession where having employers – or even coworkers – do background checks and look for this sort of stuff is not unusual. This affidavit makes me sound so insane and dangerous that it would ruin any chance I have of working in my field should it come out. In fact, no one who reads it could even consider me for a position or anything else. It's dealbreaker-type stuff.

In other words, not only am I having a hard enough time dealing with my personal issues, but I've got this potential criminal case hanging over my head, the situation has lead to significant personal and professional losses already, and it's going to hurt my chances of obtaining my future goals. 

It really doesn't look like they are pursuing this case. If they seriously thought the case was valid, they would have at least interviewed me or something. It would be negligent on their end to just ignore it if it was serious. There just isn't good evidence. In addition, there has been no prosecutor assigned to my case and there isn't even a case number, according to the people at the court I got the records from.

Is there any chance that at some point (hopefully sooner rather than later), I could get the record sealed or expunged or something? This is assuming no further action is taken, of course. At this point, it seems likely that it won't go anywhere.

A few additional things I've noticed that may or may not be relevant in some way:

– The list of items seized included more items than were listed on the copy given to me. (I already suspected this.)

– The affidavit lists something I said to a police officer as probable cause. I did not say anything to the police until they put me in a position of much higher emotional distress (as if it weren't bad enough already). They embellished that comment to sound more incriminating.

– There is medical data that would normally be protected under HIPAA in the affidavit, but it's not redacted in the copy available to the public.

– I can actually make a pretty compelling argument for why this particular police department and some of the officers involved would have something against me personally due to legitimate professional activity a while back that wasn't good for them. I also have information and evidence about multiple federal violations on part of the department and some of what they seized indicates that. 

– I have no criminal record or history of violence or substance abuse or anything. 


I'm honestly scared of posting anything, so if my information is insufficient, please let me know. I'd really appreciate any insight. And getting my stuff back, haha. :)

TL;DR: A communication error lead to me getting accused of some very serious charges that are now public record.

This was five years ago and I'd completely forgotten about this truck even existing. My sister just emailed me a scanned copy of an impound notice that had been mailed to our rental house.

Apparently the truck has been registered in my middle + last name and then abandoned about fifty miles away. I suspect it finally broke down and they were too cheap to deal with it so they transferred it to me. I only use my first name for paperwork so I doubt they had any idea they were using my middle name. I can't remember them at all and I had to have the situation explained to me. We managed to get one of them on the phone and he claimed that two years ago they ""sold it to a mexican"".

I honestly have no idea how the registration process works. I've never even owned a car. Do they need to have it notarized or fill out my personal information? I would think that if they had any sensitive information about me they wouldn't have used that name.. but I have no clue. Could I be in the process of dealing with a full-blown identity theft?

The notice states that if I don't claim the truck within 120 hours of the impound time, it will be declared an abandoned vehicle and auctioned off. I have no interest in claiming a truck that most likely doesn't run; I'm a broke ass college student. Will the proceeds of the auction go to paying the impound bill? I'm being charged a towing fee of $200 and a $50 per day storage fee. 

The impound date was over a week ago, so this is becoming a very big problem, very quickly.. compounded by the rest of my problems. In the past three months I've broken my arm, been to the emergency room twice, emergency dentist once, and need a surgical tooth extraction immediately.

He grabs the cat and she and her guy friend there start to attack him, he says to the guy friend that if he touches him again he will retaliate so the guy backs off. They then go block the door so he can't leave. He decides to go the balcony and jump the 1 story to the ground instead of trying to go thru them.

This morning they are talking about charging him with a felony burglary charge (he has never been in trouble, builds schools in other countries and is an all around outstanding guy).

They basically start and sell franchises of those little tax prep places you see.  

  I got hired on and work from home using a VOIP heasdet and my computer using 8x8 virtual office.

   I was given regular shifts....basically monday, tues, thurs, fri and Sunday.  The weekdays I work 5pm to 9pm and 10pm to midnight.   Sundays I work 10am to 4pm and 10pm to midnight.

  Lately I noticed that I haven't been taking any calls.  Like dead. It seemed to start around the time they changed my extension number.  However I noticed on my call directory (you can see who's online by a green dot next to their name....if they take a call it turns red with a phone icon) whoever was online wasn't taking calls either...so I figured we were just slow.   I don't know this business and how many calls I should be taking.

  I went in yesterday to the office to get my check and my boss asked me how many calls I've been taking....I lied and told him ""a few"" because I didn't want to be laid off....I know, stupid....afterwards I knew it was a loaded question and I shouldn't have lied. 

  Anyway....today I'm working and I get an email from my boss saying that I have been let go, I have essentially stolen from them and I will not receive any money for what I have worked since the 4th.  

   Regardless of if I had taken any calls, I have been sitting here at my desk logged in and ready to take calls.  I couldn't leave and for all I know I was working.  I don't know the circumstances of why I haven't had any calls...I have no idea why.   

  If I take this guy to small claims court will I have a good chance to get my owed wages?


**EDIT: I'm in Indiana**

**Double EDIT:**   Ok, looking at my hours basically I have been paid everything already up to Friday the 15th.  The only thing I'm owed is Superbowl Sunday and what I've worked today, which was about 4 hours.   I have yet to cash my paycheck though since banks are closed and tomorrow is Presidents Day.

  I don't think I've been there long enough for unemployment benefits... I started on Jan 8th.  

  I got some more emails from my boss.   Basically when I explained to him what happened, he said ""Why don't we leave it this way. The job was seasonal and our need for your help has ended. I will take no position either way about whether or not you were working.""    

So basically he accused me of stealing by not working when I was supposed to, and then now he has no position either way about whether I actually worked or not?    If the job was seasonal, then am I laid off or am I fired?

The game is a full contact, full immersion role playing game. We play on private land, it is pretty much a marsh/forest area, and it is pretty isolated. 

The issue we are currently dealing with is this. There is an individual who has special needs who likes to come play. We are not at all sure exactly what his needs are. He needs supervising, and is unsteady on his, he falls down a lot. He is twenty to thirty years old. We don't mind having him at game, we like being able to provide a place where he can play and have fun. He does pay entree fee.

However, there have been some occasions where he has been dropped off at the game by his father, who then left. His younger sister often attends as well, but she is seventeen, and has demonstrated on multiple occasions that she is irresponsible and cannot be trusted to look after her brother. We've had a case where they left to go looking for something at night, and her and her friends left him in the field when he couldn't keep up. Other players and referees stepped up and helped him back to the fort. 

We've told his father that he cannot be left at the game without supervision, but there have been some misunderstandings. Some of the game organizers and I fear that we are being used as a babysitting service. None of the organizers are comfortable being suddenly left in charge of a disabled person, whose needs we have no idea about. None of us are qualified or trained for that sort of situation. We always have at least person trained in first aid, but as said before, we play at a very isolated place, if something very bad happens, I have no idea how long it might take for emergency personnel to reach us.

We don't want to punish him or his sister, we'd love to have him at game. We make sure to give him activities around the fort, and he role plays with us the best he can. He doesn't really cause a problem, if he's being watched, but he gets into trouble if left unsupervised. In those cases, we have to take one of the refs off of the staff, and assign them to watch the brother.

What I'd like to do, is to speak with his father, and clearly communicate with him that leaving the brother unsupervised is unacceptable, and that his sister is unacceptable as a guardian for him. I'd like to lay out what the consequences of what leaving him unattended would be. I hope we will not need to act on them, but if this continues, we need to be able to act on it. 

Which comes to my question. What can we legally do if he is left at a game again without a guardian or chaperone? Iv'e been trying to read the ADA, but I'm not versed in legal speak, and it is overwhelming. I'm afraid of the brother getting hurt, and I'm afraid of the game/business getting sued.

The Commission believes that these deals—which involve a cable company exchanging a valuable service like wiring a building

We have been separated for a number of years, amicably. He was diagnosed with an aggressive form cancer a years ago and has been battling it ever since. He went into remission, and is now in recovery. Although, his capacity to work and parent are limited, he does the best job he can given his circumstances.  

We had an arrangement were we would keep the marital home and live in it together, and continue to function as if we were married so as not to cause any more disruption to our son. Our son is obviously going through a tough time with all of what his dad is experiencing. We just didn't want to add to it. 

The house we live is still in both of our names, and we don't really have much in the way of any sort of custody order. There is a child support order that I haven't enforced since he has been sick, and since we contributed pretty equally to the household . It isn't through the state or government. 

Questions:

They want to send him to a rehab facility in another county for what could be a year of recovery. We both had questions about how custody would work in that aspect since, right now, we have equal custody. I would obviously take him to visit as much as I possible could, and he is obviously unable to make the trek himself back and forth often to see him. We want to protect ourselves against any problems. Would I get into trouble for not taking him to see my ex on a proper schedule? Could he come back later and say that I didn't bring my son to see him enough? 

Do we need to get some sort of proper custody order in place? 

Without him contributing I am having trouble paying for after school daycare for our 6 year old. I want to apply for discounted tuition or state vouchers for daycare through the state. Would they some how require some sort of child support order in his case? It could be a while before he is able to work. 

In the event of his death, should that occur, can he will his portion of the house to me? Would it automatically go to me?

It has been years since we visited the court together. He is at a point right now where he is stable but visiting the court might be possible for him medically.

Did we mess up by continuing to live together and not having a real custody order after the divorce? 

Thanks for any advice. I understand that this isn't legal advice but I would love just a point in the right direction.

We are planning to see a lawyer but I just wanted to know what we needed to address, and whether we could see a lawyer together or if we needed separate ones. I ask because I pay for most of his expenses when I can. I would most likely have to pay for his lawyer. Do we have to lawyer up or could we just see the court together about this situation since we are both working together and want the same thing?  

Note: After he comes back home, we would like to continue living together until our son is in his teens. We are a good team, and our living arrangement works for us, but we just can't be married to each other. Our son does love having both parents under one roof. Especially while his dad is ill. Would continuing to live together be a problem considering we aren't a couple in the traditional sense?

1351108955.0,12,self.legaladvice,120vjv,I don't know what to do. On active duty and my wife asked for a divorce and moved herself and our child out of our apartment. ,airforcedivorce,13,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/120vjv/i_dont_know_what_to_do_on_active_duty_and_my_wife/,"I am in desperate need of some advice. I am in the Air Force, and I am on active duty (albeit in Florida). My wife of around 4 years (and kid), who lives in Louisiana recently asked for a divorce. 

My child is 3 years old. And I won't be able to go back home to Louisiana until a few weeks from now (I have been gone for almost 6 months).

My wife basically told me over the phone that she does not love me anymore, and she can't see our marriage continuing. I love both of them so much and it breaks my heart to know she feels this way. I can't say I'm surprised though because she has somewhat of history of infidelity (I read one of her texts soon after we were married that was basically inviting her ex-boyfriend over to have sex)

She moved out of our apartment into one of her friends houses -- taking our child with her. She recently got a low paying full time job (for the first time since we've been married) at a bank...it makes me feel as if she'd been planning the divorce for a while since she had no interest in having a job before. She also used the job as a reason for not coming to Tampa the entire time I've been here -- so I haven't been able to see my child in almost 6 months.

**I just don't know what to do financial-wise and custody-wise.**

I’ve been sending them most of my money from active duty. She even asked for more money on top of what I have been sending her (which, with her own income, was more than enough to support them). I know for a fact that she has been going out with friends, spending lots of money on alcohol while out, buying tons of new trashy/club clothes, and she even recently got a large tattoo. I want to cut her off completely because I hate to see my hard earned money being used for trashy things that in no way benefit our child (I don't consider those things trashy, but the way she goes about it and the actual tattoo she got are trashy). There was even an ENTIRE MONTH where she pawned our kid off on her grandparents and strictly used the money I sent for herself to finance going to the club and hanging out with her friends. But I feel like if I cut down how much I send, she will hold it over my head in court as being a deadbeat dad. Also I bought her a new car right before I left that is in my name (she has made no payments at all toward it). And now, I recently heard that she is trying to trade it in for a different car while I am still on active duty. Is there any way I can stop her from doing that? And I know that she will try to take as much money from me as possible during the divorce since that is how she has always been; and I’m afraid of going bankrupt between legal fees and child support. 

I am also unsure about what to do for custody. Do I have any chance to get any custody of our kid? I know traditionally, soldiers rarely get custody because they have to do active duty tours and must be away from their kid a lot. But she is such a poor mother, with this new club-life she is involved in and in general -- I can elaborate if needed. I know I can give our child such a better life than she can, and our kid deserves that. 

Also, she has something she has threatened to blackmail me with. About 2 years ago, she had been texting for several days nonstop. Given that she has already tried to text and cheat behind my back I tried to grab the phone from her (I was a little buzzed). I was aggressive, we yelled, and the neighbors called the cops -- but in NO WAY did I lay a hand on her (I’m just not that kind of person). The cop came and my wife lied and I had to spend a night in jail. She didn’t press charges, but she has said she’ll use this to keep the kid if she needs to. 

Sorry for the length and grammar...I’m just so in shock right now and looking for some advice. I want to see a lawyer, but I don’t have the time. I’ll only have some free time when I get back home -- which I’m afraid will be long enough for her to act in court like she has a new, very sustainable life for her and our child. I just feel like I never had a chance to prepare

1348738149.0,11,self.legaladvice,10k15d,Speeding ticket in driveway - California,DrivewaySpeeding,14,3,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/10k15d/speeding_ticket_in_driveway_california/,"This evening I returned home at 10pm from a group meeting. Upon pulling into my driveway, I turned off my car and started walking into my house. It was at this time I heard ""excuse me sir"" and looked behind me to see two gentlemen with flashlights talking by police cars. They appeared to be police officers, each leaning against their individual squad car. Their cars were parked across the street diagonally from my house. They asked me if I would come over and I debated pretending not to hear them and just head inside on this cold night. It is important to note I live on a street that is hard to navigate. Several times a week, pizza delivery guys, UPS, and drivers pull over to ask how to get to the lower part of the street or look for an address. Seeing the officers with flashlights by the curb, I figured they were looking for an address and could use some quick help.


What happened next caught me by total surprise. As I approached the officers, I informed them I could help them, but asked if they could make it quick - I was outside my house and needed to use the restroom. Instead of the help I thought I was providing officers, one of them asked for my license, registration, and proof of insurance. I provided my drivers license and told the officer the rest of my information was in the car. I asked him why I needed to provide the information and he informed me I was being ""pulled over"" for speeding (his words, not mine). I want to be perfectly clear, at this time my car was sitting in a driveway in front of my house, off, and locked.

After the officer took my ID, and told me to get my other information. As I was approaching my car, I was informed I MUST be on the driver side, despite my information being easily accessible and illuminated from the passenger side. At this point I was made aware that I must get in the vehicle, roll down the window, and remain there as I was being ""detained in MY vehicle"".Following this point the officers drove their cars across the street and lit my car and house up, blocking me from leaving my driveway. (Where was I supposed to go? I was home.)

I handed my information - all current and readily accessible - to the officer. He ran my information through the system. At this point I want to defend myself and growth as an individual. When I was younger I lived in Los Angeles, and speeding is courteous, not illegal. When I moved up to college, I received my first ticket and two others, all for speeding in 6 months. At this point I drastically changed my driving habits and am proud to say I have gone without incident for the past three years. The smaller town mindset became part of life and showed me a way of life alternate to that of LA. Additionally, I recently purchased a Suburu Imprezza (I LOVE HER!!!) and one of my favorite features in the car is the ability to drive it with a no clutch manual. The time I passed in front of the officers, I was turning off a side road, driving the hills. This is manual transition heaven. I, as usual, placed my car in manual, took the hills, then coasted the final block home in first gear after turning. First gear does accelerate rather quickly, however the distance I travel to get to my driveway from the road I turned off of is a MAXIMUM of 200 feet.

Turning onto my street is 1 short block (3 house lots), a street, my neighbor then me. My roommate even joked, ""What did you do, throw the e-brake and drift into the driveway?"" Accusing officer had my approximate speed set at 37. (It would be pretty hard to accelerate to 37, then quickly make my driveway.) The officers were on foot, even the ticket said they had no radar.

When handed my ticket and asked to sign, I asked the officer if his badge number (which HAS to be) and that of the fellow stopping officer (only info I wanted) were on the ticket before I sign. At this point he made it clear if I did not sign the ticket, I would be ""arrested"" and taken to the station. How nice. I signed the ticket, and asked if I could go into my home. Officer granted me permission to enter my own home like I am some animal.

As I began to take pictures of the squad cars parked outside my house the officer informed me of a ticket error. He had forgotten to write down my proof of insurance - which I provided. He asked me if he could correct it, and I told him I would prefer he not tamper with my document of the incident. He again tried to intimidate me by telling me if I wanted to ""make a stand"" it would be worse for me - if I didn't hand him the ticket and let him correct it. I politely refused, as on previous tickets, failure to provide proof of insurance is written as a violation, and on this ticket my accusing officer was just too eager to write me a ticket to even complete it. To add to the errors, my name on the ticket is spelled incorrectly as is the title holder of the vehicle (my father).

TL;DR: Tried to help out cops. Got a speeding ticket with my car parked, off, and locked.

Is there anything I can do Reddit? I have read about written declaration, but can someone help me out with this (seemingly) rare incident of being pulled over for speeding while parked?

This is my first time posting in this subreddit and I'm really at a loss of what to do. I will try to make this very clear and concise so I dont burden you with a textwall.

I own a business in Ohio. Friday, a woman drove up and into my store front. She destroyed the front wall and the windows, and in a panic (her words) she kept flooring the gas while inside the building, literally burning through the carpet to foundation. She did not stop until a nearby business had someone run in and remove her foot from the gas/car.

I was not inside the building, my partner and his girlfriend were. The car came within feet of them, and the driver kept on the gas in a panic for some reason. They were ok, but mentally I think they're having issues.

My question is this: I've itemized everything damaged in the accident...some of it small, like $15 signs. Some of it large, like $1,500 equipment. Ive made a huge list with approximate cost and whatnot for everything in order to help things along. Am I going to be scrutinized to death over everything, and do I have any options or defense to explain that rubble and fine mortar dust CAN damage, and HAS damaged computers within the building?

Lastly, I lost and continue to lose business daily over this. The day of the accident is easiest to account for; cant do business with a car in the building. The next day was cleanup, getting rubble, glass, etc out. The next work day was continued cleanup and inventory and diagnostic of what was, and was not destroyed in the accident.

My store front is just a 9 x 10 cardboard slab bolted to the building now. Somehow my actual door survived. I'm losing business daily now because it LOOKS like we're shut down. I have no open sign anymore, no windows, so even if people knew we were open somehow despite all this, why would they still come in with my store front gone? It looks like we're a shanty now.

How would I, could I even, claim continued loss of business? Am I out of line for this? My insurance company who is basically handling this, then going after the driver's insurance told me to bill hourly what we charge for what we do...I have for the first three days I mentioned before. But what about afterwards? Do I have any grounds to claim I will continue to lose business until it's fixed? If so, how do I determine how much?

I'm really just upset over everything, and I'm not going for blood money. Im not claiming pain and suffering, no one here is. I just want my store and inventory fixed or replaced, and I want the money due to me that I WOULD be making if I had a store front anymore.

I was staying at my cousin's house, when suddenly I got a call from my frantic wife at 1:30 in the morning. Here's what happened:


I guess the cops said they saw my car abandoned with the doors open and everything strung out. This was not true, my car was in my cousin's apartment complex's parking lot, not anywhere close to where they allegedly saw my abandoned car. So, three cops ended up going to my house and while my wife was sleeping they came in, searched the entire house (my wife is a very heavy sleeper), went through my yard, etc. With guns drawn they went into my bedroom and freaked my wife out. They told my wife about my car being abandoned (which as I said, it wasn't) and I guess they went to my door and thought it had been pried open (there is a little bit of weather wear, but it certainly does not look pried open), so they then entered the house to search for any potential suspects. My door was unlocked when they came in.
What the fuck? Is there anything I can do about this? My wife is a nervous wreck, I have no idea why they thought my car was abandoned, I don't know why they would think my door was pried open, I'm wondering if they made a huge mistake, went into the wrong house and then had to come up with a story to cover their tracks or something.

About the arrest, when they took me in, given that it was the hash bash, they had a makeshift area in a nearby garage. I think that day they processed around 300+ people. When I was taken in, I had a pipe and joint I believe. I was a long time ago and don't remember exactly all the details. 

I was 21ish at the time this happened, I'm now 38 and married with a kid. I don't want to ruin it anymore then I might have already done over this. I obviously don't want to do jail time.

I couldnt get much done while I was home on leave, but I redeploy in about a month and want to handle this. My father wasnt rich, but about a year or so before he died he had recieved about $500,000 as a retirement payment from his job. The house he lived in was fully paid off, life insurance, etc. He also had a storage room with lots of my stuff from growing up, his jewlery, art, etc. He was pretty clear all this would be mine, but I dont know where the will is.

Am I doomed to have this on my credit until it falls off basically?



* The court order is from 3 years ago. I don't want to send money to an unconfirmed address.

* They left **the court's address** on the credit report..

* One of the relatives (who DID help on the house, like maintenance) is responding. The problem is that his name is not on the lease, his name is not on my credit report and not on the court order.

* I don't feel comfortable talking to this guy about paying this off, especially when he isn't even the one legally signing documents. So technically I have yet to speak with the actual landlord. Left at the court was one relative's email and the legal ones's phone. I've left the landlord voicemails but only his relative responds in the form of emails

The landlord could be relocated, dead, out of the country, or in jail for all I know yet his relative is the only resource I have for discussing payment options. 

Regardless, I have asked him for an address and I'm still waiting but like I said I have no proof his reply will be the LANDLORD's address since they put the court's address on the court order.

First off, I'm glad I got caught. It was a stupid thing to do and a huge mistake on my part. I'm not a bad person, I just made a very poor choice and I'm very afraid of the consequences.

I got caught attempting to leave Walmart with $97 worth of merchandise, was arrested, and issued a criminal trespass warning. Instead of sending me to county jail, the officer let me go with a citation (but made it very clear that it was still an arrest). The violation was Class B Theft. This is my first offense, I am an adult, and I live in Texas. My citation says the judge's name, court, and the date says ""ON OR BEFORE 8/19 2013 AT 12PM"". I called in and they said they hadn't received my case yet, so I'm not sure if I'm actually able to go in before that date although I really need to.

I'm supposed to leave the country at the end of August for a $35,000 foreign exchange scholarship and I'm really worried I might jeopardize it because of the arrest. I really don't want to screw this up because it's one of the only things I've ever accomplished in my life.

I know my situation where I got off with a citation and arrest is rare rather than spending a night in county jail and having to post bail, so it's very hard for me to find answers and advice. Most of my questions are being asked *because* of my more unique situation.

About how much will Walmart Asset Protection charge me for the $97 worth of merchandise?
Will I still be able to leave the country for the scholarship?
Am I just getting a fine or will I be put on probation?
How far will pleading not guilty get me?
Is there any way for me to handle everything after I get back from the scholarship program in June 2014?

The officer said he knew I was leaving the country and said something about me getting snatched up as soon as I come back at the airport. I was too panicked to remember exactly what he was talking about though. I don't have a lot of money for an attorney, although I know I should call around and maybe do a free consultation.

I live in Washington State, renting an apartment in a complex with four attached apartments next to each other. About 2 months ago, our next door neighbor(who has been trouble since the day they moved in) brought an infestation of Bed Bugs into their apartment. They have spread into our apartment, and I am assuming our neighbors as well.

I have spoken to him about it multiple times, but he is impossible to deal with as, I assume, he is stoned 99% of the time. I have also spoken to management about it, and they keep saying they are going to ""do"" something about it, yet nothing ever comes of it.

Our manager is a very nice lady, but she is a complete pushover. We were once 3 weeks late paying rent and she shrugged it off saying it wasn't a problem, and every time I talk to her she mentioned how nice we are, and how we are some of the best renters she has as we don't cause problems.

The person who lived in the apartment next to us before she(finally) kicked him out, had not been paying rent for *months* before she finally kicked his ass out.

We have already spent probably a months worth of rent(or more) trying to get rid out our bedbug infestation, and just when we seem to have it managed, our neighbor mentions he is ""bug bombing"" his place and the following day we have more bites.

I have two small children, ages 3 and 1, and they are just **COVERED** in bites, especially my 3 yr old. She has them on her face, back, arms, legs, everywhere. My 1 yr old has been lucky so far and not had many bites, but still.

I have bites all over as well, and they are *terribly* itchy, it takes all my willpower to keep from scratching, something my 3 yr old doesn't have, and so she has open sores all over her body from scratching.

We have tried bombing, and spraying, and using powders, and cleaned all our carpets and upholstery, we threw out our couch, all of our clothes are in bags, all of the kids toys are in bags, we have washed **EVERYTHING** over and over to try and get rid of them, the only thing we haven't done is called an exterminator, but we did get quotes from them and it will be about $375 for the first treatment on JUST our apartment, and then another $175 per treatment after that, and it would take at *least* two, possibly more to get rid of them. This would just be for our apartment, and even if we paid for this and got rid of them, they would just be back a few weeks later as the *entire* complex would need to be treated at the same time, or else they will just come back.

I have spoken to the manager about this, told her we would pay for our part if she called an exterminator, but she doesn't want to spend the money, and says we shouldn't have to either, but hasn't given us another option, or *any* options.

We have complained *multiple* times, and I have spoken to the neighbor *multiple* times, but none of them are willing or able to do anything.

We are planning to move, and are currently looking at places, but I don't think we should have to pay rent while we live in these conditions, *constantly* having to spend money *just* to mitigate the problem, not solve it.

Is there any legal ground for us to stand on? I am grabbing the rental agreement as I type this, and will be looking over it shortly.

I just looked over the rental agreement and there is *nothing* about hazardous living conditions or whatever, just that tenants are not allowed to ""release hazardous substances"" inside the apartments.

Going to look up state law, and possibly call the health department. Not sure what else to do. What do you think reddit?

**EDIT:** Thanks for all your advice. So far from what I take we *cannot* withhold rent for any reason. And as we are planning to move, there is no point getting legally involved in trying to get them to fix the problem as we won't be here anymore. The only thing I can do at this point is give them written notice of the problem, and written notice that we plan to leave. 

We are on a month-to-month lease there won't be any problems with that, so I am not too worried. Thanks!

**UPDATE:** So after discussing it with the girlfriend, we have decided that we don't really want to move unless *absolutely* necessary, so I am  sending the landlord a written notice about the bedbugs, and I was hoping that maybe someone here could take a look at it, and let me know what they think:

**Date**

**Address**

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am providing you with written notice of an infestation of bed bugs in our apartment.  According to RCW 59.18.060 Under the Landlord-Tenant Act, the landlord must: 

•	Make a good attempt to get rid of any insect, rodent or other pest problems, except when you (the tenant) cause the problem.

As we are not responsible for this problem, it falls to you, the landlord, to remedy it.
According to RCW 59.18.070, you have 10 days to provide remedial action. Should remedial action not be provided within 10 days, then according to RCW 59.18.090 we may:

1)	Terminate the rental agreement and quit the premises upon written notice, without further obligation under the rental agreement, in which case we shall be discharged from payment of rent for any period following the quitting date, and shall be entitled to a pro rata refund of any prepaid rent, and shall receive a full and specific statement of the basis for retaining any of the deposit together any refund due in accordance with RCW 59.18.280.

2)	Bring an action in an appropriate court, or at arbitration is so agreed, for any remedy provided under this chapter or otherwise provided by law; or

3)	Pursue other remedies available under this chapter.

From this date forward we will be documenting all expenses and damages caused by the bedbug infestation, and should legal action be necessary we are prepared to provide them in evidence.

If you have any questions, please contact me at **Phone Number**

Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,

**Name**

**Address**

Also would it be a good idea to provide with the letter some of the pictures of my daughter who is *coated* in bites? She is an older woman, and has said multiple times that we should have to put up with this, especially not out ""sweet little girls"". I hate to use my kids as leverage, but *holy shit they are bad*.

1374679490.0,11,self.legaladvice,1iyl1i,[Northern Virginia] - Question about highly restrictive employment contract,throwaway_legalq,13,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1iyl1i/northern_virginia_question_about_highly/,"The wife works for an after school music studio, below are a few of the more restrictive points to her employment contract.  My question to you legal superheros and geniuses, how enforceable is any of this?

Back story, this contract has been in place since the beginning of the studio's existence, sometime since the mid-90's.  

The wife has worked at the studio now for almost 10 years.  The contract is signed by all employees (~5-8) in a group setting the Friday before the school year begins in September.  Contract is valid from September through June.  So about 72 hours pass between contract signing and the first day of work.  The wife has asked about striking some of the more restrictive/outlandish stuff, and the studio owner has said in no uncertain terms that the contract is not up for debate; basically ""sign here or don't work here.""

Most of the contract is a Non-Compete:

* Cannot work for a competing music studio within 50 mile radius 

* This contract and its restrictions exist for 3 years

* Any business with a current or past clients (within past 3 years) no matter if the work is outside the scope of the services the studio offers, my wife owes the studio a $1500 finders fee plus 30% of the total bill.  So, if my wife suddenly decided to repair computers, and a former student asks for her services, and the studio found out, suddenly she is in debt to the studio.  Same thing goes if she quits or is terminated, and a former student wants a private piano lesson at our home.  

* If she wants to quit, she must give a minimum of 2 months (60 days) notice, or she will be responsible for any and all lost revenue from the studio; my wife has over 40 students, so I can say without a doubt, that dollar amount would be substantial.  There is not an ""extenuating circumstances"" provision.  So, if she is in an accident, or is put on bed rest because of a difficult pregnancy, per the contract, she is not protected.


I know Virginia does not take too kindly to overly restrictive employment contracts.  That being said, we are concerned that she is basically ""stuck working there"" with no prospects after she quits.  Yes, she is considering quitting within the next year or so.

After his wife had moved in with us, her car was keyed, side mirror broken, keyed again after it was fixed, nails were placed under her tires, and a rock was thrown at one of my dad's cars that was gated....we don't have any video of this but we assumed it was him all along and couldn't do anything until we finally got the video. This all happened over 4 months.

We were able to get video from a neighbor the night he keyed 2 of the cars belonging to my family and placed nails under the tires. And another night where he broke the side mirror of another one of our cars and stole her license plate. On the same night he keyed our cars, my aunt who lives about 5 minutes car was also keyed in the same manner...however we don't have video of that. 

So, considering he admitted to doing what was shown on video to the detective, what are we able to recover in monetary damages? Just what he admitted to? 

The police did not arrest him but he told them he did what was on the video and said he would be willing to pay for the damages.

Should we deal with him directly or should we just sue?

All we want is the money to repair our cars so they are in the condition they were in before he damaged them. Can we get the estimates and present it to him and  ask for that total? Can we ask him to pay for the camera system we had to install to deter him? 

I know it's a lot but if anyone can guide us before we proceed it'll be appreciated. The detective we worked with was not at all the greatest and it took constant pestering over a month for him to finally call my uncle him.

Through mediation my mum and dad agreed that if one of them wanted to take us on holiday overseas they must provide 2 weeks notice and a full itinerary. Dad was told we were booking a cruise for April 2013 in September 2012. We asked him if he was okay with it and he didn't say much, he did not protest about us going on holiday. We gave him a full itinerary at the same time. 


We had a living arrangement planned where my sister would spend one week at mums house then one week at dads house and I would spend every second weekend with dad and the rest if the time with mum. In January of this year I stopped living with dad altogether after he kicked me out and said I was not allowed back. This was because he would constantly blame me for 'trying to stick up for mum' and 'loving her more, and hating him'. It was also because I wanted to spend New Year's Eve (which was on his designated weekend) with mum because she would have been alone. He put all of my stuff that I left at his house in bin bags and chucked it in the back garden whilst it rained. 

In February mum and myself asked dad if we could have mine and my sisters passports so we could finalise payments/ get my passport renewed. He refused and sent me a long email explaining how he though my mum was going to kidnap us and take us back to England (where we are from). He said he wasn't going to give the passports back and that we weren't going on the cruise. After 3 weeks he gave my passport back but refused to give my sisters. He still hasn't given my sisters passport back. 

We had to cancel the cruise and mum lost a $600 deposit. I have asked him numerous times to let us go on upcoming cruises but he replies with the same kidnapping story. Both my sister and I really want to go on this holiday as we have had a rough year. We can provide substantial evidence that mum will not kidnap us and that we will stick to the provided itinerary.

Is there anything we can do to go on holiday, or will we have to wait until we are both 18?

Zimmerman case, and one thing that's been confusing me is the option for the jury to convict for manslaughter instead of second-degree murder. My question has to do with the process of presenting a charge against a defendant. 

Wouldn't the question of what to charge a person with be addressed BEFORE the trial? If a new charge is brought at the last moment, wouldn't that force a new trial (since technically one or both sides wouldn't prepared an argument dealing with that subject)? 

I'm curious why there hasn't been a lot of discussion about the fact that there is now the option for the jury to rule on a lesser offense in  addition to the state's second-degree murder charge. Is this something that's common in criminal court? Or is this something that happens with Florida's judicial system specifically? I would have thought that if the jury chooses manslaughter, there would have to be another trial (since it wasn't the original charge), but this doesn't seem to be the case... 

I'm posting this here since this seems to be the best place for random questions about law and the legal system. I'd like to post this to /r/askreddit but I'm pretty sure the discussion would end up devolving into a clusterbomb of people trying to figure out if he's guilty or not.

Upon returning to my car, I was confronted by a national wildlife law officer or whatever they are called, and he cited me for ""Unauthorized take of Plants or Animals"" and wrote in parenthesis (mushrooms) and the offense code is 50 CFR 27.21. I told him that they were from the nearby state park, but he told me picking was forbidden there as well.

So I have several questions here, first, after doing a little research I found that mushroom picking is not allowed in the refuge, but I could not find any clear list of regulations for Virginia state parks. Anyone know where I could find this? I did find one website claiming they had asked a ranger and been informed that it is allowed, but who knows if that's accurate.

Secondly, regardless of the park rules, I should not have been cited under this law because they were not taken from the refuge, correct? Would I have a case solely on this basis? I am nervous to go to court because the officer made some ominous comment about it possibly going on my permanent record if I did that and lost... I can't prove where I picked them, but innocent until proven guilty right?

Finally I am wondering if fungi are considered plants in legalese. Clearly they are not biologically but the law makes no mention of fungi.

If I can clearly show them that I was in the right, I am hoping I could call and get my mushrooms back (they said they would probably keep them until figuring out what to do with them--and they are quite delicious so I would like to have them) and avoid paying the fine. Is this a reasonable hope?

Some back ground: I was married 2 years, we had a one year old baby and my wife was two months pregnant. We had lived together 1 year before that. and dated 2 years before that. I always did anything to try to make things easier for her. Anytime I was home from work, I would take care of my daughter to let my wife have alone time if she wanted. Due to financial hardships, I started getting stressed out. It didn't help that she kept pushing to buy things, to not let me rest, or the fact that when I asked for her help, I was ignored. So one year ago, I got sick at work. I couldn't eat anything and started having terrible stomach pains. I was taken to the urgent care center where they diagnose me with appendicitis. I get sent to the er. They did all kinds of blood work and ct scans and deemed no appendicitis. I was at the hospital several hours and didn't get released until almost midnight.

Needless to say, I was accused of lying my own wife. I was still weak the following day and she kept pushing about it when I repeatedly asked her to leave me alone. As I started feeling better, my patience was wearing thin and we got into a huge argument. She decided to leave that weekend. Took my daughter, came back when I was at work and took anything that belonged to me specifically.

I decided to file for divorce as she would not speak to me or even let me see my daughter. As soon as the divorce papers were served, she decides to file a counter claim that I was abusive to her throughout the entire relationship. for 3 whole months I had no access to my daughter. When I finally did, I had to have supervised visits. The only positive was it was member of my family that did the supervisions. It didn't stop my wife from trying to say I was threatening her.

My son was born shortly after. I wasn't allowed to hold him at the hospital. I only got to see him thru a glass window. I missed his entire 1st month of life until we were able to schedule another court date. Judge ruled I would only see my son at their home for 2 hours once every 2 weeks.

I have been as cooperative as I can with this situation. The latest ruling has given me access to both son and daughter one day every two weeks. But it is still supervised. It has been a full year since the separation. Yet I still can't make progress on removing the supervision, or having my kids for entire weekends.

I was wondering what can I do about the situation. I would like to get custody of my children. Unfortunately I don't know what else I can do. Any advice on the matter would be greatly appreciated.

Considered 30 day notice, now wondering if he can be evicted sooner.",Junental,14,3,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1hg68g/oregon_my_mothers_tenant_unemployed_uncle/,"There's a tl;dr and questions at the bottom.

**A little background**: 
My uncle (we'll call him Paul, not his real name) lost his house in the big housing crash. He held on until 2009 before walking away and moving across America to live with my mom for free. She has a 4 bedroom house and at the time it was her primary residence. At first they got along great but Paul is a smoker, my mom has severe asthma, and he didn't see a problem smoking in her house even when she requested he not.

Paul lives rent free, though he pays the utilities which are in my mom's name. Last year my mother got married and moved into her husband's house, but she has 2 dogs that Paul takes care of in exchange for ""rent"" or something. It's an unspoken agreement. There are no leases or written agreements of any kind.

My mother and her husband want to sell the house, except it's been damaged by smoke, dogs and miscellaneous damage as my uncle has both caused damage (multiple door frames damaged, linoleum floors have holes from mirrors and things that he's dropped, holes in walls, smoke) and seriously neglected the property. In order to sell the house, they need to rip up the floors and repair a lot of the damage. 

He can't be there afterward repairs are made because he'll ruin it all again. Their solution is to wait for him to get a job, then they'll give him a few thousand dollars and ask him to move out. 

**The incident**: 
My mother and I have been over at the house cleaning out some of the old stuff she left behind from when she lived there as her primary residence. She never officially had a date of being ""moved out."" It's a 4 bedroom house with a large plot of land and a 2 car garage FULL of storage boxes. 

It's been very hot in our area so we had the air conditioning on. At 2 in the afternoon he came in *stumbling* drunk. No exaggeration. He had a sober-ish friend with him that witnessed the entire incident. Paul started whining that the AC was on and that it was costing him money. I told him it's reasonable to allow the people working in such heat to have AC if it's available. He bumbled on about how he pays the bills around here (lol) and that he chooses if the AC is on or not, he walked over to me and pat his hand on my shoulder HARD as he was talking. It felt like a ""threat"" hidden under the guise of a friendly gesture, especially considering I'm a small woman and he's a large grungy truck driver (unemployed). I felt this was ridiculous and suggested he should be able to pay a couple bucks extra this month with all the money he's saving from not paying rent. That didn't make drunk uncle happy and he went off on a tangent calling me a useless bitch and a slew of other names, yelling at my mother and telling her that her house wasn't even worth renting (he's not renting lol). I suggested he find a place worthy of renting and that August 1st was a convenient 33 days away and implied that we'll expecting him gone by then. I yelled at him to leave and he went to his room. My mother stood by speechless (she's kind of a ""mouse"" type of person, non-confrontational).

I left the house after that incident and told her husband what happened and about the 30 day notice. The house is in my mom's name and I have no legal standing in sending him a 30 day notice, but my mom didn't object and later agreed that it would be a good idea. He reassured me that it will be a tough road ahead getting rid of him. I don't know if this is legal or not but I ordered a set of 25 large moving boxes and sent them to my mom's house addressed to Paul. They'll be arriving early next week. 

**The Threat/tl;dr**:
I woke up this morning to a voicemail left at midnight from Paul, and it's just 40 seconds of purely calling me a ""bitch"" which I was unimpressed with (seriously, you're 50+, come up with a better insult!) but at the end he threatened to bash my face in if I ever ""talk to him like that again."" 

...That scared me. I realize that yesterday he was drunk, and it's possible he might have been drunk again when he left that voicemail but I honestly believe Paul is capable of violence and could be dangerous if actually given a 30 day notice. 

Basically, at this time my mother wants to give Paul a 30 day notice or sooner.

* What options are there for landlords of non-written agreement holding non-payer tenants to evict with an earlier than 30 day notice?
* Are there notices to get someone out of a property that isn't your primary residence that is threatening physical violence against your children? 
* Is it safer to just contact the Sheriff's Department and give Paul a 30 day notice? I honestly feel I'd need protection if I or someone else were to hand Paul an eviction notice and I don't want to give him any more extra time than he needs.

My initial interaction in the transaction was with a twenty-something guy, but his parents technically owned the car.  His mother signed the title over to me, and I went home glad to finally have transportation again.  A couple days later I went to go to the DMV to get some plates for the car only to notice that under Seller it lists both the mother and the father on the same line.

I read the fine print on the back of the title and it clearly states that ALL sellers listed must sign for the purchase to be valid.  Crap.  I didn't want to have to drive *all* the way back there to have the guy sign it.  They live halfway across the state and I just don't have enough money to spend that on gas again.

So I did a stupid thing: I scribbled the guy's name next to his wife's and hoped for the best.

The lady at the dmv was confused.  I told her that he signed it, but she insisted that there was no reason for him to, so she gave me a letter for him to fill out and sign that has to be notarized.

I feel pretty shitty about it and my intention was not to hurt anyone by doing it.  Honestly everyone in the transaction was happy at the end of the sale, and I even met the guy who's name I forged.  He was okay with the sale too, so its not like I would have caused any harm to them.

Fast forward 4 years to yesterday (June 2013) and I receive a call from a new manager that has taken up residence there at the complex. She is going through old filing cabinets and comes across my file which apparently has a note attached to it from one of the previous managers that is dated August 2009 and it states something along the lines of (Faxed bill update to resident, waiting to send to collections). The current property manager said that the file contains: my lease agreement, my move out paperwork, and a ledger with the lease fee attached. They claim that I owe them ~$1500 for breaking my lease in 2009. When I moved out I paid everything that the manager asked me to pay and went along with my life. When I didnt hear anything from them for the span of 4 years I assumed that I paid everything that they asked of me.

They called me yesterday with this new found information that she came across and she is asking that I pay it immediately or else I would need to be sent to a collections agency. I asked them to give me a few days to look through everything.

I contacted their district office and told them that I paid what was asked of me in 2009 and that I hadn't been contacted in nearly 4 years and their incompetence in misfiling is not something I should be responsible for. She stated that unless I have proof that I paid all of my fees (via a bank statement) then I would need to pay the fee ASAP or be sent to collections.

I spoke with an attorney that works in the office where I am employed and they stated that my lease agreement does not have the words ""seal"" in brackets ( ""[]"") beside my signature. They claim that a non-""seal"" contract is limited to a 3-year window in which they can exercise their rights. He stated that they have gone outside that window and thus, I am not legally obligated to pay them in regards to this contract.

I relayed this message to both the district manager and property manager and they used the same intimidation techniques and told me to either pay (set up a payment plan) or they would send me to collections. Then they added that if it came to it, they would take me to court if I so chose.

I have no idea what to do. My attorney claims that they dont have much of a leg to stand on since they are trying to collect on a contract that is past their legal rights (due to limitations) but the apartment complex isn't listening to any part of that.

Do I really have to take them to court to get this fee removed? Or can I draft a legal letter to their property lawyer stating the same law of limitations on this contract that is 4 years old and hope that he looks at it and says ""yeah, looks like we can't collect on him because we're outside our legal rights."" Or is that just wishful thinking? Somehow I feel like taking them to court to try to get this worked out is going to end up costing as much if not more than the ~$1500 that they claim I owe them from 4 years ago. 

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you all

I am in need some help, and I will do my best to keep in concise.

**BACKGROUND:
**
My BF got an opportunity to work for the Boy Scouts of America as an aquatics director.  Basically he manages all the waterfront activities.  They trained him (non-paid) for seven 12 hour-plus days and he earned his lifeguard trainer cert and a host of other Boy Scout certifications.  This job is for about 8 weeks.  

The issues have since started.  First, they were not entirely honest on the hours needed for the position.  First it was 48 hours a week (8 hours non overtime?), but as he is finding out this week, many of these days are 13-plus hours.  And now instead of 5 days a week, it is 6 days a week.  Oh yeah, you are not supposed to leave at night (we live 50 minutes away and there is no traffic).  The living arrangements are smaller than that allotted to inmates at CSP Sac prison (source: I used to work there).  They are hiring unqualified staff for lifeguard positions that have never been a lifeguard, some of which he is trying to train that may not be able to hack the water proficiency, so potentially not enough staff.  And on a minor point, the camp director has stated that the entire campground is smoke free, and he is a smoker (we are both on the process of quitting).  The camp council guide specifically states that there be a designated smoking area on the property.  Apparently there is none, nor will there be and those found smoking can be terminated immediately.   

Finally, he has been there for 4 days, and has yet to see a contract to be signed, but from what I have read, all employees may be salaried, so exact info on the employment stipulations are not known.

**QUESTIONS:** 

Under California law, is there a limit to the amount of hours that are required of a salaried position, or can they basically work you 13+ hours all days?

If you are working 13+ hours, what is the mandated rest/lunch breaks during a shift?

Is it legal to require an employee to live on site?

Besides “salary”, what are some key words we need to know in order to decode the employment contract (exempt vs non-exempt, etc.)?
**QUESTIONS FOR US:**

Why did he take this job?  He has been lifeguard for a long time, and loves the job, as well as working with kids.  He is very good at it.  He is burnt out from school, he loves to camp, and let’s face it, there is not a lot out there right now for jobs.

Did he not know what he was getting into?  No.  From the demands of training, to the hours involved, to the living arrangements, we feel a lot of things were not truthfully represented.   If they were, he would never have taken the position, or we would have at least had time to work with my schedule, or be better prepared for the challenges.  

So why not just walk away from the job?  Fair question.  His position is extremely tough to fill-perhaps now we know why.  Some camps will have no waterfront activities this year due to staff shortages, while other positions have over 10-20 applicants per slot, and they have to turn people away.  If he walks away from the position, there will be no waterfront activities for the entire summer-no swimming, wading, canoeing, etc.  He does not want that on his conscious.  Also the Boy Scouts have been known to blacklist people (they have their fingers in a lot of organizations apparently), so unless things are really bad, we do not want to deal with that fallout as well.  

If the living space sucks, why does he not simply set up a tent?  We are seriously thinking about it so I can see him for a little bit more (and get some privacy ;-)   )

Are you going to ask for some exemptions towards camp policy?  Yes, and if they at least do not concede some parts, then we are definitely out of there.  But we wanted some advice.

Smoking is bad for you, why should we care about that?  I work as a radiology tech, and my entire campus is smoke-free, but I knew that going in.  I knew that if I was going to be miserable, I at least knew what I was getting into.  He is trialing patches right now, but has failed Wellbutrin.   So yes, this is kind of a big deal.

* Can she charge us *more* than our deposit?
* The lease never mentions fines for violating the lease. What is this?
* The lease never states anything about us paying extra water. She's threatening to get the oil company in on it or something.
* She never gave us a notice of a breach of lease in any event and she is just blowing hot air.

**Edit: I can include the ""itemized"" damages list, but she does not ever have any proof of the numbers and everything is a whole number which makes me a little suspicious.**

Below are full sections from the lease:

**6. CONSEQUENCES OF BREACH BY TENANT:**  If Tenant, by any act or omission, or by the act or omission of any of Tenant’s family or invitees, licensees, and/or guests, violates any of the terms or conditions of this Lease or any other documents made a part hereof by reference or attachment, Tenant shall be considered in breach of this Lease (breach by one tenant shall be considered breach by all tenants where Tenant is more than one person).  

In compliance with New Hampshire Statutes § 540:2 et seq.: 

In case of such breach, Landlord may deliver a written notice to the Tenant in breach specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and that the Lease Agreement will terminate upon a date not less than thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice if the breach is not remedied within a reasonable time not in excess of thirty (30) days; and the Lease Agreement shall terminate and the Tenant shall surrender possession as provided in the notice subject to the following:

(a) If the breach is remediable by repairs, the payment of               damages, or otherwise, and the Tenant adequately               remedies the breach prior to the date specified in the notice, the Lease Agreement shall not terminate; 

(b) In the absence of a showing of due care by the Tenant, if substantially the same act or omission which               constituted a prior noncompliance of which notice was given               recurs within six (6) months, the Landlord party may               terminate the Lease Agreement upon at least fourteen (14) days written notice specifying the breach and the date of termination of the Lease Agreement; 

If the Lease Agreement is terminated, Landlord shall return all prepaid and unearned rent, and any amount of the security deposit recoverable by the Tenant. 

However, if the breach by the Tenant is nonpayment of rent, the Landlord shall not be required to deliver thirty (30) days written notice as provided above. In such event, the Landlord may serve Tenant with a seven (7) day written notice of termination, whereupon the Tenant must pay the unpaid rent in full or surrender possession of the premises by the expiration of the seven (7) day notice period.  However, Tenant may not use this seven day notice period to avoid eviction more than three times in one calendar year.

Furthermore, the Tenant may be terminated with seven (7) days notice if the Tenant has committed a substantial violation of the Lease Agreement or applicable law that materially affects health and safety, and the violation is not cured prior to the expiration of the seven (7) day notice period.  

Tenant expressly agrees and understands that upon Landlord’s termination of this Lease, the entire remaining balance of unpaid rent for the remaining term of this Lease shall ACCELERATE, whereby the entire sum shall become immediately due, payable, and collectable.  Landlord may hold the portion of Tenant’s security deposit remaining after reasonable cleaning and repairs as a partial offset to satisfaction of the accelerated rent.           

**8.  	UTILITIES:**  Tenant will pay all utilities charges, except for the following, which will be paid by the Landlord(s): Heat and Hot Water.
Tenant(s) shall be responsible for having same utilities disconnected on the day Tenant delivers the leased premises back unto Landlord upon termination or expiration of this Lease.

 **2.  	LIMITS ON USE AND OCCUPANCY:**
The premises are to be used only as a private residence for Tenant(s) listed of this Agreement. Overnight guests for more than 2 consecutive nights are prohibited without landlord’s consent. Without landlord’s written consent and will be considered a material breech of this Agreement.

**Edit: Below is the full ""itemized list"" that I was provided for security deposit deductions.**

So they created the problem, failed to fix the problem, and told me that, despite having paid top dollar for their service/protection plan, I was going to have to wait again for it to go to the service center to be deemed eligible for a junk out.


After stressing that I needed my computer in order to leave town for seasonal employment opportunities, part of which will include writing and reflecting on my experiences (preferably done on computer since my hands are going to be sore from picking fruit all day and will likely not have the stamina to write 10 pages with paper and pencil), the manager concluded that there was nothing he could do besides send it to the service center. He assured me that it would be sent out the next day (last Friday), and I reluctantly gave my authorization for my computer to be taken hostage by Best Buy for the third time in three months. 


I called two days after talking with the manager, only to find out that he never alerted the shipping department that they had authorization to ship my computer out, meaning that it was still sitting in the store, where no one apparently has the authority to approve a junk out transaction where I could get a new comparable computer. 



The [Best Buy Code of Business Ethics](https://secure.ethicspoint.com/domain/media/en/gui/26171/code.pdf) says on page 19 that ""Our employees share an obligation to:


»Treat all customers fairly and honestly


»Communicate in a respectful and helpful manner


»**Provide prompt and accurate customer service**



By failing to authorize the shipment of my computer after I gave my consent, the manager failed at providing prompt service, and since he assured me it would be shipped out the next day, it was inaccurate customer service as well. Furthermore, after finding out that he had failed to do the one thing he actually could do for me, I find out that he gave me the number of a Sex Hotline instead of the number of his corporate superior. 


Do I have grounds to sue here? For sexual harassment or for lost income opportunity? Help me out here reddit, Best Buy should not be allowed to commit mistakes and force the consumer to deal with the outcome after shelling out a ridiculous amount of money for a service/protection plan!!!


***TL;DR*** Best Buy caused a major problem in my computer when I brought it in for a minor repair, failed to fix it when I brought it back, failed to send it out when I brought it back in, and gave me the number of a sex hotline instead of a number through which I could complain to the manager's superior.

Let's say a table walks out with the signed copy of the credit card authorization, leaving behind only the unsigned copy. The server takes the unsigned copy, and finalizes the transaction. The server turns these authorizations in to the house. That same customer puts the charge in dispute (usually 1-4 months later.) 

Then the house contacts the server, and lets the server know that the charge was put in dispute, and the house either could not find a copy of the authorization, or found an unsigned copy of an authorization. The servers are told that they will have to pay back the house for the entire amount of the bill. The implication is that the servers have to pay up, or be fired, but the house never directly says what the consequences would be if a server refused to pay.

In the last few months servers have had to pay checks ranging from $30 to $275. Is this legal or just immoral?

Also, the house will approach servers and say that the server turned in counterfeit money last week, and he/she needs to pay back the house. Evidence is sometimes shown to the servers before they are asked to pay. These amounts have ranged from $60 to $100.

...What does this mean? Is it retroactive? By that I mean, if it happens, will all of my unpaid work for the previous pay period be transformed from [pay rate per hour] to [minimum wage per hour]? Or does it mean that my work GOING FORWARD will decrease to [minimum wage per hour]? Or something else I haven't thought about?

My dads license was also suspended and he contacted them and they gave him a ""deal"". The total damage is like $2000 or something. He paid $700 and was told to refer me to them.

I called and they said I'm responsible for the remaining balance. 

Few things:

1. I was 16 when this happened and only spoke to the owner of the vehicle and my father. Nothing else other than that.

2. The vehicle wasn't mine. It was my dads car.

3. This happened in 2002 and the only reason we knew it was still a problem was because my dad tried to renew his license and couldn't due to it being suspended.

4. I have never, not one time, ever been contacted about this. No phone call, no letter, nothing. 

5. I work and shop in Kentucky every day, so if I get stopped I go to jail for driving on a suspended license. Again, no one told me about this ahead of time.

We just moved to a pretty nice neighborhood. It's a big townhome but the only place that our unit is attached to this neighbors is the stairwell; everything else is a good 15ft and two walls apart.

Now, on Thursdays some of my friends (about 5 people, tops) come over and we play board games in the garage. We are not partying and we aren't consistently loud. We play till probably 1:30AM and everyone leaves.

The neighbor has called his landlord twice now, this week complaining that he was woken up in the middle of the night by doors slamming, last week it was ""kids in the garage throwing a big party and beer pong"" (false). He says he'll call the cops next week.

He has made zero effort to talk to us directly, opting to complain to his landlord who calls mine who calls me at work the next day. I plan on talking to him about it and giving him my number, etc, but if he's irrational and doesn't want anything short of us not being able to have company over (we are late shifters and this is when we are awake) then I'll just have to let the cops come and decide.

My question is this: since we are not consistently loud, if a cop came to our house he would have to stand by the garage door and listen for people occasionally talking louder than normal, would we have anything to be worried about in regards to disorderly house, etc, since this guy gets woken up by, apparently, doors closing? Can a cop give you a ticket for somebody who doesn't live at your house slamming their car door on their way out of the residence or does the cop have to show up and hear loud noises, like a party?

If he does hear us talking from inside the closed garage door, is that still warranting a disturbance at 1am? 

I could use an idea of what kind of cards I have in my hand before I talk to him. Hopefully he accepts an apology and can get over it, but not likely. I am also positive that, being someone who has been to many actual house parties, this is far from a large disturbance and I feel like the cops will show up and apologize for wasting time...

Hope this is the right place to put this, apologies if not. 

I live in California and I went skydiving for the first time yesterday. as one would expect, I had to fill out some liability waivers saying I understood the risks and would not sue them, nor would my family, etc.

So I filled them out, asking them to clarify a few of the points (one if which stated that in the event that I sued them (which I had already waved my right to away), any money awarded to me would have to be given directly to a party they specified, which could then be given right back to them). Sneaky on their part, but crafty and smart as well. That's fine, a little douchbaggy but whatever, that's not why I come to you.

After they addressed all my questions I turned the waiver into them and then asked for a copy for my records. The woman said they don't usually do that and asked a co-worker about it. She informed me that it would cost $75. I obviously balked at this, asking if she was serious or just messing with me. When she was serious, I told her that this was a legally binding document that was removing many of my rights as a consumer and I had a legal right to a copy of it. She then went to grab the manager.

Her manager came in and she was immediately defensive and combative, starting off by asking why I would want this, I told her the same reason I told her employee, for my records.

But why would you keep it? So I can review the rights I've waived in the future. 

Why would you want to do that? I don't know, but I want it in the event that I do. I keep literally everything I sign and receive, I have bills from 2008 stored on my external hard drive.

She then told me that the waiver was now their property and that I could have my lawyer subpoena it, pay the $75, and wait 8-10 business days for it.

I just sat there for a few seconds and said, did you really just pull out the lawyer card, over a waiver copy that I'll probably never look at again?

Yup.

Well, I'll pull mine out again this week and see what we can do about this. In the meantime, let's get this dive done!

That surprised her, I don't think she was expecting me to go through with it. I wouldn't have, but I had paid a $100 deposit and they NEVER return it for any reason, even weather (they do reschedule for any if you request it though). So we did my jump, literally everything other than the women in the office was perfect. The tandem people were great, pilot was hilarious, the videographers were nice, and aside from some tight harness (which is nothing to complain about), the jump was everything I expected and hoped for...and more.

So, my question to you all is, is it legal for a business to refuse a copy of a contract or liability waiver to the person who signed it and their rights away? It just seems so sketchy and I don't see any reason why they would put up such a fight.

Do I have any recourse?",barelylegaladvice,11,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1dinrn/old_debtor_won_summary_judgement_in_trial_i_never/,"So about 6 years ago, my wife had a credit card with a limit ~ $1500. We both became unemployed, and we used it to buy groceries. I don't think we maxed it out, but we may have. We paid on it until all of our savings and limited side money ran out. We couldn't pay anymore, so they started calling. We explained, they stopped calling since we didn't have a dime to give them.

Fast forward to last Saturday, I get a notice in the mail that they took my wife to court, got a judgement (about $6300), and would put a lien on our bank account. On Monday, sure enough, we couldn't touch our account and they cleared it out. Bad timing: we hadn't paid rent yet and my wife just got a scholarship. It had about $2400 in there, highest it has been in a long time.

So we were never served, they won what seems to be an egregious amount, and took our rent money. Left us nothing to live on. I've talked to a few bankruptcy lawyers and they said that because we really do owe, there's not a lot we can do. We could attempt to get the judgement vacated, but they would just sue again. I've also heard that this $6000 odd dollars makes it cost-ineffective to sue for; lawyer/court fees would probably end up at least equaling that.

1367334490.0,9,self.legaladvice,1dex4s,Texas: Question about damage from leak in ceiling of apartment,paper4,13,4,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1dex4s/texas_question_about_damage_from_leak_in_ceiling/,"I got home last night to a leak in the ceiling in my kitchen.  I called emergency maintenance, who, after poking around for awhile, preliminarily determined that the leak was caused by a burst pipe between my ceiling and the floor above mine.  The leak was not evident in the apartment above mine, but rather occurred under their floor.  The complex is attempting to fix the problem today, but they have to drill through concrete to get at the pipe.  

The water has caused a bit of damage (all of which I have pictures of): The rug in my kitchen is ruined and I had to throw away around $75 in perishable food items that were covered in gross ceiling water.  The water somehow got into many of my cabinets (that will probably be fixable by washing my dishes).  My apartment is probably running at 100% humidity.  It smells disgusting.

I spoke to the apartment management company this morning, and they acknowledge that it is their responsibility to fix the pipe.  I mentioned the issue of cleaning and running a dehumidifier, and they seemed open to assuming those responsibilities as well.  However, when I mentioned reimbursement for the damaged items that I had to throw away (which is realistically about $125 worth of items, but potentially more because I haven't really looked through the entire kitchen to assess the damage), they said they wouldn't pay for that because the burst pipe wasn't caused by their negligence.  (I would add that the maintenance man mentioned this same situation happened two doors down from mine earlier this year.)  

I have renter's insurance, but frankly, I'm not sure it's worth it to make a claim for such a relatively small amount.  I'm also pretty sure my deductible is around $250-$500.  I'm wondering if there's a way that the complex might be strictly liable or otherwise responsible for reimbursing me for these costs.  

I'm also concerned about the costs increasing over time.  I have health problems that make dust from construction and mold from water damage a real issue.  I mentioned this to the complex and asked that they put up a plastic sheet sectioning off any area of construction while they fix the pipe.  I know this is (very much so) premature, but is there anyway they can be forced to take these types of precautions to prevent possible health consequences?

Sorry for the rant, I'm obviously a little upset about this situation.

I'm poor!!",porkrollsammy,12,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1d9nzm/help_i_feel_that_im_being_retaliated_against_for/,"Hi there, I live in MA, i'm a female, 45 y/o. I have been at this corp for approximately 6 months. Without too much blah blah blah, I was sent to a different location to train for the next step up position. At the other location, I came across a list of nearly 50 infractions, some extreme and quite provable (theft/major policies broken, safety), and some more nit picky corp policy stuff (cursing, food, cell phones). Which aside from the safety aspect (we work with animals) I could care less about the other stuff. But it was obvious after less than a week that I was definitely not going to get the training I needed. I spoke to my managers, left the program and it's been hell since then. I've been formally written up twice for what I feel are bogus reasons. I know, I know. Of course they are bogus right? But I can explain more when you need me to. 

Absolutely nothing has been done about the manager that I ""whistle-blew"" on. I have been told that, we're sorry, but the only other trainer is over an hour away, 2+ hours commute at $8.00 an hour, for 10 weeks, I don't think so. Since my first formal write up, they have promoted a 19 y/o girl to the training program. She is a f/t college student in a completely unrelated field and has repeatedly expressed that she does not want to pursue a career in the field. Also, they're now saying that I am not eligible for the training program because of my 1st write up (which is about NOT taking a break.....seriously). 

Now, they are just ""after me"" I feel. I was sick this week, one day, and they wrote me up again, saying I did not contact the correct people. Which I had been in touch with my two managers, and left a vm for one of them. Then in the next breath, they are saying the opposite, I shouldn't have contacted one of them....bla bla bla.

So now I think I'm one more write-up, and i'm gone. The one thing, over everything else, is that they did not do anything to the manager/trainer at the other location. It proves that they only care about the money (it's a $$ producing location) and not at all about their ""policies"" that everyone is always shoving down my throat, not about safety and integrity, not about the animals. I really want to make it public. People are bringing their beloved pets to this place, with no idea of the treatment or conditions they face.

She moved with her mother to Nevada 3 years ago and I have visitation over the summer.  I'm currently filing a motion for contempt due to the mother's noncompliance concerning this summer's upcoming visitation.  
The past 2 years the child has been returned to GA but has lived with the mother's family and a family friend of the mother's.  I am not a fan of this and I want her to live with me over the summer.  The mother will probably not allow this outright.  

I haven't filed for a modification but the circumstances of my visitation rights were drawn up under the assumption that the mother lives in Georgia and not Nevada.  As the order allows us ( mother and I) to make adjustments as needed per our work schedules, etc. filing for a modification could possibly be avoided.

However, after further contemplation I am considering filing for a modification to reflect better our current living circumstances (being across country from each other) and I now wonder if it is now best to share custody so there is no problems with emergencies, etc.  

I am very much involved in my child's life despite her living across country.  Since january the mother has had a child with another man and subsequently began absconding from my communications.  Therefore I haven't talked to my child since January and missed both hers and my birthdays (mother turned phone off).  

I am a 26 year old full time college student.  I know it doesn't look good being 26 but even the mother's family agrees that I am an important part of the child's life.  I feel like I should point that out.

Court was set 3 weeks ago for May 30th. 

1. Should I file for a mod to reflect the mother living across country?
2. Should I also file for shared custody? (why?/Not?)
3. Is it too late considering the court date is in a month?  Will it be handled on the same date or is it a different process?

First I'll explain what's going on:
About a week ago an old friend came over to my house (without warning) asking for help finding some weed.  I no longer smoke but I still know where to get it so I drove him to a dealer's house in another town.  My car was overheating when we got to there, so I parked in an empty lot (trailer park) and we looked at it; then after failing to diagnose the problem I walked up to the trailer and purchased an eighth ounce of weed with my friend's money.  He stashed it in my (locked) glovebox.  We headed back to my house only to be pulled over by the local police- the reason they gave us was that I failed to use my turn signal 100ft before making a turn at the traffic light..

So the cops take our licenses and run our information, then they come back and question us about where we work, where we live, where we were coming from, etc.  Eventually they explain that we were sighted behaving suspiciously and visiting a well-known house, to which I explain that my car was having issues.  They ask us to step out of the car, search us, and ask for permission to search the car.  I decline and so a K9 unit is called.  After almost an hour the dog arrives and they find the weed.  My friend denies knowing it was there and so I am arrested and spend all day in jail.  I have a simple possession charge and court on April 4th in a small Kansas town.


Now my problem is that I have no money to hire a lawyer and I'm going to tech school to be a Pharmacy Technician, which I can't be certified for if I have a drug charge on my record.  I've talked to the Detective but I no longer know enough names to snitch and get the charges dropped.

My questions are:

* Was this a legal Terry stop and search?  They didn't give me a ticket for the turn signal..  We weren't intoxicated and didn't smell like weed so I'm not sure what the reasonable suspicion for detaining us was.  Do I have a chance of fighting this based on that?

* What are my chances of getting deferred adjudication or the charges dropped?  I have two misdemeanors on my juvenile record (one is a traffic offense) but I'm genuinely trying to get my life back on track, I can pass UAs, and I can't afford to lose my student loans.

* Will this affect my student loans?  I may continue with school and just switch programs in case this goes on my record, but I need to maintain my loans...

The roof on the building is partially collapsed; the whole thing seems like it could go at any time (especially in an earthquake). I'm wondering what our liability for his safety is if the building falls down or if he hurts himself in there some night.

So I've ran in to an issue. A colleague and I just started a business and had someone who we don't know (anonymous) make a quick placeholder picture for us. 

I put this picture on the website while we were in just planning and development stage, aka there were no hits to the website and still isn't according to google analytics. We received an email from a company named Master File giving us 5 days to pay up or they will take us to court for $25,000. They did send mail telling us to remove the image and contact them but we never got to opening the letter because we thought it was just spam mail. Either way we still kept the letter in a basket and I opened it today after reading the email, luckily for us the image on the website was just a temporary placeholder and we had removed it before we even received that letter in the mail, or very close to it. Their letter in the mail also showed screenshots of the website and the picture in use.

Now I don't really know how to approach this. I tried to call their contact and discuss terms of cancelling this but he was away until Monday. 

We certainly don't have any cash flow (or even a bank account) and we didn't even have the business registered yet while using this placeholder image. It was simply for making a concept of the way the website might look. 

Where do I go from here? Should I be scared about their threat for litigation?

I was taking a left turn. The solid green arrow had become a green and I was taking a left turn at about 15 mph. Normally cars turn left here at 30mph or so, but I was going particularly carefully because of the slippery roads and poor visibility that night. 

A pedestrian was crossing on the crosswalk. I ended up hitting him and he was taken to the hospital. Had I been driving at regular speed, he really would have died. But because I was going only at 10-15 mph he was saved. [An eye witness told the police I was going only at 10-15 mph.] The pedestrian did not have a walk sign.

1. I don't understand how I can be at fault. Granted he was on the crosswalk, but this is a really busy road and no one should cross this road without a walk sign.. it's as good as asking for death. How can I still be held accountable for this? Do I stand a chance in court?

2. What should I do now? Fork out money for a lawyer already? I haven't got anything formally from the pedestrian's lawyers.

I went to this company for a lease because my mother already leased a car from them.  As a student, I signed a form to have my credit checked, and the employee requested that I have my mom's co-sign and have her credit checked too.  My mom was not available and she was already a customer of theirs, so the employee just told me to forge her signature for her credit check form as co signer, so I did.  A few days later, they told me they were going to have the car shipped from another state, and I could pick it up on Thursday.  Somehow the insurance paperwork did not go thru to the leasing company, so the owner of the company called me, yelled at me for being late with the insurance papers, and told me the deal was off.  The employee called me back and said he was just upset, and the deal is still on and he will have the car available on Friday.  So my mom went in on that Thursday (the day before the car was to be shipped), and gave a $500 deposit check, and she does not recall if she signed anything or not, but thinks she only gave the deposit and may have signed one form.  

That same evening, my gut told me not to go through with the lease since I was yelled at and I found a better car deal somewhere else.  I never even signed or received a lease agreement.   So I called the employee and told him not to have that car delivered because I did not want it anymore, but he said it was too late.  The car had not even been delivered yet, and they could have easily stopped it from being delivered the next morning, but they chose not to do so.  So, I cancelled the $500 check at the bank.  The next morning, the owner called me and started yelling again when I did not come pick up the car, and I told him I cannot afford the car so I do not want it anymore.  He said I still have to pay for the $500 delivery fee of the car and other fees since he went out of his way to have it delivered and prepared for me.  I ignored his request.

Now, a few months later, I received a letter that my mother is being sued for $500 by the leasing company owner, and she is to appear in court in a few weeks.  In addition, I have learned that the owner fired that employee who did the deal with me.  Does the owner have grounds to sue me?  I live in NY, and there I heard there is a buyers remorse policy for leased cars where they can be returned no questions asked within a week of leasing a car, and I did not even pick up the car and called the day before they delivered it and told them I did not want it anymore.

We weren't too happy with the company that had bought our apts from our previous landlord and wasn't sure what we were going to do. (They were buying up all the apts in town and forcing the rent above fair market.) We never got around to signing a new lease and the apts never said anything about it and they kept charging us the lease price. (They said if we went to a month-to-month deal with no lease, the price would go up, but it never did.) So the rent went up again and we decided we could no longer afford to live there. (We could get a three bedroom house with a garage for the price we were paying for our tiny little two bedroom apt.) We found a very nice house that said we could move in immediately so we did. Every other place we have ever lived in just took the deposit and called it even when you moved without notice. When I went to sign the form they said I had to sign to be able to move, the ladies there tried to intimidate me into paying them money right there. They said I owed two months rent for not giving two months notice, which were the terms in our original lease. This pissed my husband off to no end, so he didn't clean up very well on the last day (I was at work and couldn't help.) So I was shocked when I opened up a bill from them for $1800.  Our rent was only $650. They were charging us extra for various things. Most of it was for the carpet which they claimed a pet destroyed. (We didn't have a pet.) The rest was $150 for cleaning up what was left and $150 for taking the trash out. Our downstairs neighbor had told us that they cleaned his carpets for free a few times. We kept trying to get them to clean our carpets, but they refused. We lived there for five years, when we moved in, the carpet was already pretty nasty, and an added five years of wear and tear was not good for it. It wasn't destroyed, there were just a few stains where I had spilled things. All they had to do was clean it and would have been fine. So my question is, can they hold us to an expired contract? Is there anything we can do? We certainly can't afford an $1800 bill just for moving out.

Update: Ok, we tried to negotiate with them but they refused. They are now saying the extra month's rent is a ""failure to give notice fee."" (Which is not what they originally called it.)

So, I am trying to be clear headed and gather thoughts and ideas prior.


**Backstory**

We were having a small party like usual on NYE with drinking, beer pong, music etc. I had been drinking since about 7:30 pm and consequently, was completely hammered. The party took place at my friend’s house, and most of the people attending were my good friends and their GF’s. As the night went on and everyone got increasingly intoxicated, I ended up making out with a girl that I have met only three or four times. She had been feeding me jello shots and vodka drinks for about two hours prior. This wasn’t new, as she had did the exact same thing the last party we had, except I had passed out early. However, as this night was coming to an end (appx. 5am) we started kissing and ended up on my friends couch together. There were at least 8 witnesses of this, 3 of which slept in the living room next to us. Now, I cannot say for certain that I had sex with her but we did have different types of foreplay. I say that I’m not certain because I honestly don’t remember, we were both really drunk. The next morning I wake up around 8am and leave, noting that I did still have my pants on. Later that day I get news that she is accusing me of raping her. When I heard, my stomach churned and I am still trying to comprehend the situation. She was claiming that she didn’t drink that night, which is bs. She had posted herself doing keg stands on twitter. Also, I have pictures of her drinking vodka drinks along with everyone else. Not to mention that she had made about 200 jello shots earlier in the night. I have talked to my friend’s wife, married to the person who owns the house: she said that at about 6 am she had seen us on the couch together, making out and appeared to be having sex...


**How to proceed?**

Though I am not sure if she will try to press charges, I’m trying to prepare for the worst. So, far I have written down everyone that was there at the end of the night along with their addresses and phone numbers. I have isolated the pictures from my camera that show her drinking. I really want to obtain the picture she posted on twitter of her doing a keg stand but I do not even have a twitter account (not sure I can do that without following her).
I am a 23 year old Mechanical Engineer only 6 months into my career and if I were convicted of this, it would ruin me. I do not know where to being in combating false rape accusations (how would I?). I do know that the guy is usually fucked, in most situations, as people tend to side with the female regardless. If there is anyone familiar with this type of situation, or any lawyers that see this post, please give me some advice! I will sincerely appreciate any help at all. Thank you in advance.

My parents are Chinese and don't speak English that well. They own a tiny restaurant for whom they hire one worker to help cook and clean. My parents simply paid him with cash, and he has been working for around 7 years. This inspector lady came and fined my parents for not paying worker comp. The fine was around 5,000 dollars. My parents honesty didn't know...but I guess I shouldn't claim ignorance as an excuse. Anyways, the woman keeps coming over for the last month, fining everything, out dated poster, not the right paperwork. In the end we had a total of 40,000 fine. My mom felt that was outrageous (all our life savings are literally 40,000) and in the end we had to simply let the worker go and work ourselves at the restaurant. 
My parents tried to be polite to her, sending in the paperwork she demanded, but she would say ""Oh, this is almost the right one, but it's not...I'll make sure to send you the right one after I fine you another 10,000. 
In the end we had own over 50,000 dollars. It depressed the whole family, we tried to get help with a lawyer, but most looked uninterested or bailed out on us. Even when the inspector heard that we were looking for a lawyer, she condescendingly told my mom that she'll lose the case. 
I was feeling really suicidal over the whole thing, guilty that I can't really do anything to help my parents out. I see my dad literally aged 10 years within these last months and my mom crying often when everyone else is asleep. 
It's not even the end of it, last week the inspector came again and calculated now...overtime pay? reaching over another 50,000 dollars. 
So we owe around 100,000 dollars. I'm so confused and terrified now. 
This has literally been the worst year for me...
I live in southern CA...I really tried researching about all this worker comp but I'm feeling overwhelmed and going insane. And Yahoo answer was pretty useless.

Dad is getting up in years and wants to ensure my Brother has somewhere to live in case of Dad's death, so Dad wants to leave his home to my Brother (a good idea from my perspective.)

What's the best way for Dad to do this to minimize overall financial burden on the family?  (By ""Family"" I mean ""Me.""  I'd have to cover any expenses my Brother has, he really spends ALL his time taking care of our parents.)

Two ideas we had:

1. Make my Brother partial owner of the house by putting his name on the deed. In case Dad passes, remaining ownership would go to my Brother.  Wouldn't my Brother still need to pay large inheritance tax?

1. Transfer partial ownership (something like $13.5k/year) to my Brother over the next X years until my Brother owns the house.  This will likely cost about $700/year in legal fees to get executed.

Is there any better way to address this?

Based on family history and his shockingly pragmatic commentary, Dad probably has another 5-8 years.

The story: My boss was running short on liquidity for payroll earlier this year and so he paid me in a half ounce of gold (I work for a precious metals firm).  He quoted me a price of $850, saying that if he was able to buy the gold, that's what he would pay me.  He then gave me the numbers to two places downtown that he regularly did business with and told me to go there.  Me, being lazy, called local gold dealers because I didn't want to spend the money on gas.  The first place I called offered me $830, which was a little low, but I figured someone was trying to make their margins, which is fine.  The next place I called was rude to me, acted like they didn't want to talk to me or do business with me, and kept me on hold for a couple minutes while they checked a price.  When they came back, they quoted me $730 - a hundred dollars less than the lowest other offer I received that day.  So I said ""Thanks, no thanks"" and hung up.  Called the two places my boss recommended and they offered me $860 and $865, respectively; the five dollars was negligible in my mind because it was about ten miles farther out of the way.  So I went, sold the coin, got my money, and deposited it.  Started thinking about how shitty the service I got from the one place was and so I wrote a review on Google where I documented my experience with them and told people to check out the three places I got good quotes from (the two places downtown and my own company).  This was back in late February.

Fast forward several months and I receive a subpoena; the place is suing me for defamation, claiming that I intentionally gave a false review in an attempt to make my employer look good and that none of this happened.  I've already hired an attorney and have provided phone records, check stubs, had my assistant (who was there the whole time) go through the deposition process and tell their lawyers the same thing, etc.  Basically, there's no proof there of ""corporate sabotage"" (which is what they're alleging) and I'm pretty sure the case is going to be dismissed or be ruled in my favor.

My question is this, though: lawyers aren't cheap, and defending against this case is going to cost me literally thousands of dollars - and I may potentially have to declare bankruptcy over it.  Meanwhile, the guy who is suing me has enough money that he can drag the case out as long as he wants.  Do I have any sort of legal recourse, either through the system I'm already in or through small claims, to get him to pay my attorney's fees and for court costs?  I didn't do anything wrong here, but this could seriously fuck me over for like the next ten years.  :(  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT: So, thanks to you guys, I have discovered something: I had never heard of the term barratry before, so I wanted to look it up.  This in turn led me to find Texas' anti-SLAPP laws.  Okay, cool, something to talk to my lawyer about.  So, because it was mentioned that this particular person might be litigious, I looked them up on the Harris county courthouse's website.

I know i didn't explain this before, but my grandpa gave my mom this house, and now my uncle's name is on it.
So, This is VERY long and hard to explain whats going on, so i'll just sum it up. My uncle got his lawyers** using my grandpa's money** to send us a eviction notice, and after 72 hours, the police will get involved.

So, my question is this: How do we get a lawyer, or represent ourselves in court, when the person that we are suing(?) is basically using our own money to sue us.
We already talked to some lawyers, and they estimated it will cost ~$17k and $5k to start. We don't have money to do this, but if we don't, we lose the house.

1339520978.0,10,self.legaladvice,uy7ff,Called police; They made things worse; Helped ex steal car; Now covering it up and refusing to take action.,NoCatsPleaseImSane,11,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/uy7ff/called_police_they_made_things_worse_helped_ex/,"I would like to recover my car from my ex-wife, who had the police help her steal.   (Texas)


I called the police for help, (this is not the first time I’ve been assaulted by her), and they made everything 100 times WORSE.  Before you laugh - I’m close to 6 foot and 215 pounds, yes I can fight off a 5’5” 98 pound girl, but I *REFUSE* to even hold her wrists to protect myself as one tiny bruise and she’ll surely claim I beat her. Instead I just take the beatings, they’ll heal – a legal mess trying to prove I was defending myself isn’t worth it.


Incident brief:  *I* called the police (not my ex) to get myself and my things from my ex-wife’s house when she got home and became physical.  She told the police my car was hers and had the officers take my car keys and gave them to her.  I was prepared for this possibility so I had the actual title in my hand showing it was my car. I had the divorce papers showing I bought the car after the divorce.  I tried desperately to explain it (calmly) was my car and they refused to listen, got in my face yelling with his hand on his gun in holster and stole my car keys from my possession and gave them to her.  She is now hiding it out and the police are refusing to do anything, even file a plain vanilla theft or unauthorized use of vehicle report because it will reflect poorly on their crime numbers (small town good ol’ boys).  


I was perfectly respectful to the police at the scene never raising my voice – it is all on video.  I have recorded all my conversations since with the police, sergeant (their supervisor) and commander (his supervisor/internal affair) - all my claims are verified through context of those conversations, specifically that I was perfectly reasonable and totally calm at the scene, the threatening officer being out of control, the commander saying they shouldn’t have taken my keys, the fact they don’t want their numbers skewed.  All recorded.


The officer that was yelling at me and taking my things had turned off his video equipment.  He also failed to upload his video at the end of his shift.  He was written up for those two violations and his rough treatment for a total of three permanent personnel marks (not that this helps me in anyway). Luckily two other officers at the scene didn’t try to cover up their actions so their equipment recorded it, otherwise he would have gotten away with it entirely with “his word against mine”.
Initially the police said it was a civil issue.  If this was the case, they would have no right to take my things from me physically.  If it was a civil issue, they should have told *her* it was civil and I should have kept my property.  If it isn’t civil, and is criminal, why can I not file a report or charges?


As of yesterday, they are refusing to do anything else.  I had wanted to just make a plain vehicle theft report and if the police won’t recover it, just call my insurance company.  They won’t because it will mess with their numbers.


The commander suggested I repo the car (like many of you might suggest).  However, the car is a 2006 Jaguar XJ6 – one of the hardest cars to move unauthorized, hiring a repo company, if I could even find the car in the first place, would likely damage the car greatly and cost thousands (just re-keying that car will be over $1,000).  


Background:  My wife and I divorced (she cheated with my best friend and subsequently two other guys).  My ex fell on some hard times so I agreed to move in and help her with some finances for a few weeks.    The car was purchased *after*divorce.  I paid cash for the car after divorce so I have the title, and it is titled to me – it has *never* been titled to my ex.  It’s licensed and registered to me and me alone in their system.  She tried to sue me last year for the car and the case was dismissed (seriously guys, it’s my car).
I had two cars at the house, my Jag and my nephew’s car (watching it for him while he is deployed overseas).  This was a deciding factor including the assault for calling the police; she was going to trash whichever car I didn’t take first.  At least calling the police in advance before I left (I thought) I would have witnesses to the other car not being damaged when I came back to get the other.


I don’t want to wait and spend thousands of dollars to get a car I already own.  I want justice done, I want these idiot officers that made matters WORSE to be held accountable.  


I’m at a loss.  What do I do?  Sue the city?  Call the local news?

1337503255.0,9,self.legaladvice,tvszi,Kind of urgent. I don't know who to ask or what to even search for to narrow it down.,YouEssay,10,1,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/tvszi/kind_of_urgent_i_dont_know_who_to_ask_or_what_to/,"So here is the scoop. My girlfriend had a person message her on Facebook about a year ago with photos of her that were obviously Photoshopped to make it seem as if she had cum all over her face. I informed the person that what they were doing could be considered slander and legal action could be taken against him if he was discovered. After that he stopped.

But now, just today, she received another message from a different person saying her pictures were on a website, fuckbook.com. He gave her a link on it revealed a full profile with her name, last name spelled slightly wrong, the city she lives in, and a couple pictures. The pictures include the photoshopped photo sent before and a couple other ""subjective"" ones that could be considered sexual. One is of us in our friends hotel room in Vegas, her face is in front of my crotch suggesting she's giving me head while she is not, others include her with her friend on a bed in the same room, fully clothed but they were doing sexual gestures to each other. One had a boob bite and another the girl had her tongue out by her legs. The other ones are just her in a bikini with her friends.

So we realized the profile has been up for a year, she now has about 500 friends and her photos have almost up to a thousand views a piece. The website costs money to upgrade your profile to comment and message. They are portraying her as a slut on the website stating, ""I am a huge slut, I love big dicks but am also bi"" etc etc. She also has captions on her photos such as ""his cock was big and yummy"" and there is even a photo of a dog sitting on her from a family get together that says "" i love dogs tongues, they're so long.""

So i am familiar with slander, i learned about it in photojournalism, does this fall under that category at all? This website is profiting from pictures that are slanderous and hurtful towards mine, my girlfriends, and her friends' images. Is there anything that can be done, is this even illegal? No permission was given for these photos to be portrayed that way and I have no idea what to do.

Sorry for any typos, I am on my phone. Thanks for any help you guys can give me. 

I live in the U.S., by the way.

[EDIT 2] My girlfriend is currently 21 years old but one picture on the website is from when she was 15 years old.

**UPDATE:** 

So, after using the ""Who Stole My Picture"" app via Firefox, I was able to find another picture, similar, but the cum is slightly different on another website, imagefap.com This time though, the user who posted it is our culprit and he has multiple pictures of other girls from her High School with fake cum on them as well. With captions like, ""this girl is such a slut, have a good fap."" 

I promise you this is not some huge epidemic where these girls are whores, the pictures are from Facebook, some of them are at school, others at home, and they are manipulated to make it seem as if they are in fact sluts. Some use their real names, no full last names, just first name and last initial.

She is notifying all of the girls but I made sure to tell them to keep it under wraps until we speak to a lawyer which is what we'll be doing.

Thanks for the help guys, I think the right to publicity is the grounds we might take this guy down with if we can in fact locate him. Does that sound right to anyone else?

**UPDATE 2:**

 So my girlfriend decided to do a little investigative research while I reviewed the legal aspect of our case. As I mentioned, we found even more pictures on imagefap.com. One particular album has a picture where it says, ""This is my sister."" That person's sister is, we'll say John. So my girlfriend began reveiwing John's friend list on Facebook and she found exact matches to an entire album of girls which have the caption, ""Sluts I met in College.""

So she cross-referenced every girl in that album, searched them in his friend database via Facebook and found out that every girl on there, he has added, and they all do in fact go to his college, **AN ART COLLEGE**

I had not realized first thing that he went to an art college until someone pointed it out. This would explain the photoshopped images.

So we BELIEVE we have narrowed it down to whom it may be, but we don't want to point fingers just yet. Then we find out, someone's mother is on there. The mother's son, we'll call him Joe, is best friends with this John character. He uses the mother's name. In my opinion, you have to be pretty close to someone to know their mother's name. 

Then she did more research. 

Turns out, the first website we were notified of having the pictures on, fuckbook.com, our friend John has his own profile complete with cock photos and a list of his turn ons. 

So either this is the kid doing it, or someone is setting him up in this grand scheme just to have a cover up for their work, which I am highly doubting.

The signed request or electronic mail shall contain the name and address of the tenant, and the date and time the tenant requested the tow. A towing company shall obtain within 48 hours of receiving the written authorization to tow a copy of a tenant request required pursuant to this subparagraph. For the purpose of this subparagraph, a person providing the written authorization who is required to be present on the private property at the time of the tow does not have to be physically present at the specified location of where the vehicle to be removed is located on the private property.

(B) The written authorization under subparagraph (A) shall include all of the following:

(i) The make, model, vehicle identification number, and license plate number of the removed vehicle.

(ii) The name, signature, job title, residential or business address and working telephone number of the person, described in subparagraph (A), authorizing the removal of the vehicle.

(iii) The grounds for the removal of the vehicle.

(iv) The time when the vehicle was first observed parked at the private property.

(v) The time that authorization to tow the vehicle was given.

(C) (i) When the vehicle owner or his or her agent claims the vehicle, the towing company prior to payment of a towing or storage charge shall provide a photocopy of the written authorization to the vehicle owner or the agent.

(ii) If the vehicle was towed from a residential property, the towing company shall redact the information specified in clause (ii) of subparagraph (B) in the photocopy of the written authorization provided to the vehicle owner or the agent pursuant to clause (i).

While returning back the agent issuing the boarding pass asked me for the credit card I had purchased the ticket with. Unfortunately the bank had closed my credit card and issued me a new credit card on the same account (but different card number) a month prior to my travel and was asked to destroy my old credit card.

So I was forced to purchase a new ticket at the airport for my wife almost twice the cost of the original ticket. I have been trying to deal with the customer service people at qatar airways but it is all in vain, when I call they say all refund request must be done using online form and when I do it online they ask me to contact Qatar airways office in India and when I contact the office in India they ask me to contact their ecommerce support who do not respond to the emails.

My Mom died in Denton County, Texas, which is where I also live.

My Mom died in August of 2009 with no will. At the time of her death she was married to her third husband, my step-dad. Her only children are my brother and myself. My step-dad had an affair while they were married and had a kid with that woman and that is his only child.

Shortly after her death, my step-dad emailed me and asked me to sign some paperwork to ""let him refinance the house"". This sounded really sketchy to me, as my Mom and I had talked about them refinancing the house the spring before she died and I knew they only owed 20k after that.

I got the paperwork in the mail. It was obviously done by my step-dad on a do-it-yourself legal site. He listed my brother as a female and left off one of my Mom's ex-husband's. Anyway, I took it to an estate lawyer who told me it was basically a document used to sign away an inheritance. It was so poorly drawn up she doubted it would be taken by the title company. My brother did sign his copy. This info cost me $300 dollars.

I was surprised I had an inheritance at all. I assumed everything would go to her husband but was told because he was not our father he gets half of her assets and my brother and I split the other half. She told me he could live in the house but not sell it without my brother and I consenting to the sale. I didn't sign the paperwork and he had a baby fit and thus cut off all contact, no loss to me.

My step-dad proved himself to be quite the scumbag by lying and trying to trick me and my brother into signing away whatever inheritance we had. How do I know there isn't anything else? I'm not really interested in getting anything but sentimental things, like my grandmother's china, the china my Mom got when she married my Dad and photos but he won't talk to me or my brother.

My questions are:

How do I settle the estate without paying a lawyer tons of money I don't have? I'm a stay-at-home Mom going to school full time and living with my Dad to save enough money to pay for my classes.

What can I file on my own without a lawyer?

How do I prove that my step-dad is a sneaky mofo who shouldn't be the person in charge of listing her assets?

Thanks for any help you can give me. I really just want her estate settled so when my step-dad dies I will have minimal contact with his crazy baby mama and however many ex-wives he'll have racked up by then.

TL;DR: I want to settle my Mom's estate, she died with no will, complicated by the fact her husband at the time of her death was not my father but my step-dad, who tried to trick me into signing away my inheritance

She lived with her biological mother when she was younger (who gave up rights), and suffered neglect, educational neglect, possible physical/sexual abuse, and was around drugs/alcohol. We've had her in counseling for several years. Our daughter has always been adamant about not having contact with that family anymore. She has suffered from nightmares, is a highly anxious child, etc. 


The issue lies with my daughter's biological maternal grandmother. She has lived on the West Coast for several years now and moved back to Missouri at the beginning of the summer. Our daughter wants nothing to do with her, told her as such 2 years ago when she visited, and has not wanted to respond to any phone calls or letters. The grandmother has continually harassed my husband by phone and text for several years now. She showed up at our daughter's school in May and tried to get her out of class. The police told us to either start filing harassment reports with future incidents or file for an order of protection. We sent a cease and desist letter by certified mail a week after the incident. She stopped by our apartment yesterday and found our daughter playing outside with her friends. Tried to get our daughter to go into her car with her, tried to coerce her to sign her up at school so she can come visit, and gave our daughter her phone number. 


Police have changed their story about filing harassment reports - they advised to just file a protection order. Our daughter is terrified that the grandmother will kidnap her, and asked me last night if we could move so that she doesn't find us again. She kept repeating last night that the incident made her ""very nervous.""


We're filing a child protection order tomorrow. How likely is it that this will go through for a permanent order?

It is still covered under a basic 36k/3 yr warranty and the 60k/5 yr drivetrain warranty.

About 2 weeks ago I began having issues with the car starting.  Took it to the dealership who identified a defective part that needs replacement.  The part is on ""national backorder"" and apparently no one knows when it will be back in stock.  The part is such that it needs to be programmed by the manufacturer with my VIN so secondhand parts are not an option (even if they were available, which I have been unable to find any).  I frequent a forum related to the vehicle make/model and have found someone else with the same issue, according to his dealership he is #150 on the waitlist for the part after bringing his in on the same day, so this is obviously a problem that more people than just I am facing.

The issue seems to be worsening.  It has not reached the point where I would call the vehicle undriveable however it is quickly approaching that point.  I have contacted the car manufacturer however getting any sort of response is like pulling teeth.

At some point I have to assume that the manufacturer will be in violation of the warranty, but how long do I have to wait for that to be true... days, weeks, months?  I depend on this vehicle to function in normal life.  I have already had to rent a car for a weekend out of my own pocket due to the issue (dealership does not offer courtesy cars, manufacturer has not offered any sort of rental/reimbursement).

He keeps them in crates for most of the day every day, and all night long. After they started dating, a friend gave them another small dog, let's say a long hair Chihuahua, because they didn't realize how hard it is to take care of them. Also crated. I moved in with them from my dad's place. This year, the min pin and long hair had puppies. They kept one despite my protests.  They keep the puppy in the same crate, and the crate is only meant for one. It was fine when the puppy was little and and had separation anxiety, but now he's as large, if not larger, than his dad. The min pin is spayed now. The boxer is bonded to John strongly enough that she won't mate with any dogs. The chihuahua is a pure breed so John won't neuter him because he says he wants to 'stud him out' bit I doubt it will happen. 

I have a cat who doesn't like the dogs, so she stays in the back of the house. She goes outside whenever she wants and always has food and water, and is free to roam.

The dogs have fleas and we can't get rid of them no matter what we do. Before the puppy was potty trained, he would mess the cage often and it wouldn't be cleaned for days because ""we can't afford to wash the bedding every single day,"" according to John. 

John smokes (nor sure how much, he gets mad if I talk about it; maybe a pack or two a day) and my mom went electric a few months ago. The smoke affects everyone in the tin can we call a house.

If you're unfamiliar, G1 is the license you get at 16 but you can't drive around with a G1 unless you're accompanied with someone with a G. (Fully licensed driver)
I got charged with it. I am from Ontario, Canada.

I have 15 days to go pay or go to court. My friend says to go to court and fight it because more often than not the police officer decides not to show up.

I am not worried about the price of the ticket as much as I am worried about the demerit points. They will affect me when I get a G2 
because my insurance will spike.

What can I do? Should I go fight it in court? I just need answers. If I fight it will they get rid of the demerit points fully? What would happen if the police officer decides to not show up. What would happen if she does decide to show? 

I drove because I wanted to get experience before I go for my G2. I can't exactly afford a driving instructor. I can tell that to the judge and if the police officer doesn't show up the judge might rack down the punishment a bit. Hopefully the police officer doesn't show up. 
I'm just worried. It was a dumb mistake and I need advice on what to do. Anything helps!

Anyways, this is what happened:

I was driving around this one neighborhood and apparently there was a robbery that had happened in that neighborhood at that moment. The cop pulled me over because she was just doing a checkup on passing cars. She saw that I had nothing to do with the robbery and let me go. At this point I was alone in the car.

Later, I was with my friend (whose car I was driving earlier) He was driving with me in the passenger seat. He has a G2. At this point the lady told me that I was wrong for driving with a G1 but let me go and now she is gonna charge me.

I dont know the laws and dont pretend to know but I think it was wrong of her to charge me when I wasnt exactly driving at that moment anyway. Oh, and I was driving completely fine. No way she would have pulled me over had it not been for the robbery which I was NOT involved in.

Honestly, I dont want to fight the police in the court about this issue because that may give off the idea that I still disregard the law and dont fully feel like I have made a mistake. I dont want the judge to get the wrong idea when I go to court. 

So my idea is... I was thinking I go to court, tell the judge I am sorry and hope for him to reasonably lower the ticket charge and demerit points. If the police shows up, should I politely mention that really she had no right to pull me over after ward anyway? When I was with my friend the police just pulled us over and brought up the G1 driving thing AFTER she had previously let me go.

Called the leasing bank (Chase) and they sent me the power of attorney, title and some other paperwork I needed to register the car in NJ (NJ requires a title to register the car).

I got the paperwork and checked the title and at first the color threw me off (black, my car is red). Then I verified the VIN and it's completely different. Called the bank and at first they thought the VIN had a typo and told me it will take a week to get this resolved. In the meantime my NY registration has expired but I still drive with NY plates (pretty much illegally). Also called the dealer where I got the car originally and they confirm that they submitted the paperwork with the right VIN. My copy of lease agreement also shows the correct VIN.

Week goes by with nothing from the bank so I call again. I talk to a little more enthusiastic rep this time she kinda understands the situation and tells me that she'll overnight the paperwork. 

Today comes and the paperwork is just the POA letter and some other legal paperwork with my correct VIN but no title. I call them again and they say to take this paperwork and the old wrong title to DMV to register the car. Right. I ask for a senior rep and actually got one that at least the gist of my situation. She said that according to their records I lease that other car that I have the title for. They'll need to work with NY DMV to get me the right title and it will take 6-8 weeks. That's 6-8 weeks of me unable to legally drive the car that I pay for monthly. In NJ I can't even go buy milk and eggs without a car. Plus my wife is pregnant and is on last trimester.

Bank's senior rep is supposed to call me back in about an hour, if they still say they need 6-8 weeks I will try to push to terminate the lease. Is it good enough ground to terminate it? I can't drive it with NY plates, registration is expired and I'm no longer resident of NYS. And I can't register the car in NJ I pay for due to a bank error?

Manager A then had me go write down my hours (10.0) in their office.  Asked other bussers who had been working there awhile what they got paid and they said about ~150 a night with tipout.

I work for a huge and powerful retail corporation (One the top 15 biggest in the USA) that has it's own charge card. Our managers have quotas they need to meet so they stress that we should 'do anything' to make that charge card sale. The incentive for the customer to sign up is a percentage off of their purchase. 

It is against company policy to offer the discount if they are not approved for the card. 

One of my co-workers (who was one of top in sales) has just gotten fired for offering that discount even if they were not approved, and now owes the company a good chunk of money to compensate what they had lost with the discounts. She signed a paper agreeing to pay them back.

Well, where I'm getting at is a good majority of the sales associates who work there have done that plenty of times to make a sale in the past. I'm one of them, and I'm fearful for my job and me owing them a considerable amount of money. 

If I were to quit now, would they be likely to hunt me down and make me pay them back? Before we go into ethics and such, I was encouraged by upper management to do exactly what we're not supposed to do. I knew that it was wrong, but I considered them friends and wanted to please them with lots of sales and since they said we should do it, I figured they would override when we got in trouble for it. Now they're saving their asses and I don't have proof that they told me that, but they have proof of me discounting.

I'm planning on getting out of that company, because I'm seeing the dark side of it more and more every day. My questions are:

1. Should I leave now? Or when I find another job. (I'm trying to avoid owing them that large chunk of money)

2. Do I /have/ to sign the agreement saying I'll compensate them for their losses? 

3. Will this show up in a record as me stealing from a retail company? Will I be able to work in retail again?

4. Is there anything I can do to fight back? 

I wouldn't be worried if I was lower in the sales ranking, but I'm one of the best and I'm fearing being targeted next to leave. Our loss prevention is under the impression we're doing it to make more money for the commission we get (which isn't even worth mentioning as its under 2 dollars each) which is not the case. We did it for the company and to please the upper management.

I live in London, England.

I'm looking for some swift advice regarding an unfair dismissal case my mother has opened against her employer. She's had one of her appeals dismissed tonight and is feeling a little stressed - so while we wait for our actual lawyers to provide feedback to her case I thought I'd see if any of you might have any words of wisdom that might help her relax. She is facing this dismissal as a result of redundancies being made in her department.

Her case against the employer is built upon two main points:

 - Firstly, while ""matching"" the old jobs with the new posts they wished to create, the employer failed to properly take into account the job description my mother filled. They used an old - outdated - description which had not been updated during her time there, which failed to reflect both the role she actually fulfilled and failed to reflect the guidelines she was placed in her role to achieve by those in charge of the description.

    This has lead to the situation whereupon she is facing redundancy for a role that she did not really fulfil anyway.

 - Secondly, following on from the first point, one of her bosses spoke with her privately before any final decisions had been made, stating that if she chose to take voluntary redundancy they were ""prepared to be very generous"". This talk was cited as being ""off the record"", and took place shortly after the interview for her old position had finished.

      This is indicative of the sort of atmosphere that she feels the employer created to show that they had no intention of ever offering the position in the first place.

The employer's response has been to make the offer of applying for a junior role for which she'd be contending with an associate who used to work for her.

My questions to /r/legaladvice are as follows - firstly, does the junior role offered negate any of the claims regarding unfair dismissal? And secondly - do those two points (summarily) seem like they might hold water in a case like this?

Really quick version of something that has been dragging on for 3 years. I an provide a longer version if people want. 

Background:

3 Years ago, me and  2 other guys/company where going to import a product here to sell (separately, they where my 'competitors'), and a big company was granted a temporary injunction against the product. I had already sold almost all the stock - so it was in my best interest to fight the injunction (I emailed the company asking for a refund, they said no, they are in China, no real recourse to get the money back). 

1 of the guys recommended a small firm that we had used before. 

We rang them, they suggested QC (Queens council) rep, and said that they needed a buffer of $50,000!! We said no way, and where ready to ring around. 
The owner of the firm said something a long the lines of 'The case shouldnt go anywhere near that, we just need the buffer available as the QC needs to be paid immediately when they ask to be paid. When the case is finished we can refund any difference'. 
The court date was in a week, so we stupidly went for it. They sent us all the contracts that night, I quickly signed to they can get started. 
I deposited HALF as I felt bad  and had a bigger share of products coming in. The other 2 did around 25% each. 

The case:

It was a bit of a joke, the company we where up against is a multinational, multi billion dollar company. However the things they claimed in the injunction where guesses, and we had a good chance of getting it removed. We knew that if we did though, they company would then probably take us to court and drag it out. 

The firm we hired made a decent amount of mistakes with the papers they submitted to court, and different people rang me multiple times to confirm details that I had already explained....and they billed be for that. 

10 minutes before the case,  the QC for us, asked if we would to offer The multinational company to buy all of our stock at cost price and agree not to sell the device ever again. This was not discussed beforehand at all. The deal would mean that we get out of the situation with just our legal fees to pay - and would note lose the insane amount of money we had all invested in the stock.
I asked the QC and our legal team what would happen if they decided they didn't want the stock --- they said that if they agreed to it, it would be in 'good faith' and they would draw up a contract in the coming days
We agreed, as there didn't seem to be any risk that anything would go wrong. 
3 or so days later we got a response from the Multinatinal company that they would NOT be paying for the stock...some of the reasons where that 1 of reasons given was that the contract that out firm wrote up did not stipulate the amount of devices they would be paying for (an error on there part)
This means that we could not import the stock, could not sell it, could not get a refund, etc...


After the case:

I emailed the firm and asked them to stop representing us. 
They sent a final bill for around $60,000!
I asked them why it was over $50,000, and they said that they incurred more travel costs, and the more time then was thought was billed...
I had a look back at the contract I signed to see that the amount listed on the contract was 10,000 to $60,000 + travel costs!
The firm had not indicated to me via phone/email that the balance had gone over $50,000 at any time. 
I then found out that 1 of the other companies had NOT signed the agreement, and was refusing to pay anymore as the loss had left his company in financial ruin. That company is not closed, and I believe he is filing for bankruptcy. I believe they did try and chase him for the funds but without a contract they had no legal stand point. 
The other company was the one that recommended these guys, and was a client already. They did not push him to pay the balance, i believe because they see future value in him staying a client. 
So they have been chasing me for around $13,000 (becuase someone didn't pay the full 25% 3 years ago, around 20%) -
Sending me debt collector notices...emailing me to settle for $8000 etc. 
I had already paid more than 1/3 of the total bill (25,000 of $60,000) so I didn't see why they had the legal right to do so



Now:

Mid this month I received a summons to appear in court  in order for them to collect the $13,000 in funds. 3 years on. They attached the contract to the court documents, and I read it again the other day to see that not only did I miss the totals being 10 to 60,000......They also listed me as a guarantor PERSONALLY for the money. Which I signed. 
I never read the document, it was rushed to me signed, and returned straight away so they can get started.


So what do I do?

My first idea (after watching Suits) was to call them and ask them if they are proud of the way they represented me, I doubt they would be. I have a guy I went to Uni with that is an expert as SEO, and could EASILY get a website about the case to rank very highly on google. It would cause a lot of prospective customers to be turned off them, and they would probably lose more than $13k in future customers. 
I have already told this friend about the case a while ago - and he already has half of the website ready

Is it worth calling them and proposing that to them? Send me an invoice for $0 or I give my friend the rest of the details?

 I don't think it would be illegal as it is not defamation if the information is true...I don't know if it falls under any other laws that I could get into trouble for.

The court date is in 1.5 weeks!

After a trial period (2 months where I was paid $650 a week and sometimes worked up to 50 a week) I agreed to a set schedule keeping my hours around 36 a week and pay of $850 on the books as well as an additional $185 off the books. 
 This past week my boss told me we were having financial problems and that they could no longer afford my salary that was agreed to when my trial period ended and I would need to take a pay cut of $100 a week on the books, he would also no longer pay me what we agree to off the books. I was also told that because I am on salary that my hours would be increased from 36 hours/5 days a week to 45 hours/6 days a week. I am the only employee in our company that has been asked to agree to this. No other salaried employees have been asked to increase hours or take a reduction in pay. I have been told by senior staff members that I am an essential employee for our business, so this cut isn't a penalization. This amounts to a loss to me of $1000 a month take home and with added hours weekly, it becomes a significant pay reduction I cannot afford to accept.
 I asked my boss what would happen if I didn't agree to the reduction/hours increase and he told me quite clearly they refused to lay me off or fire me, I would have to quit and they would fight my unemployment. 
Being that we had this conversation alone and I felt that it was vague and semi-threatening, I sent him and additional senior employees (our accountant and comptroller) an email stating clearly that I did not accept the reduction in pay and hoped for an alternative. My boss emailed me back saying vaguely that he had received my email and then asked me if I was coming to work the following day. I said yes, went to work and worked the full week of my normal schedule assuming that we would be renegotiating or that he had dropped the idea of my paycut (he's sort of a bully like that and generally if people politely stand up to him he backs down). He saw me multiple times during the week and did not discuss it with me, every time I tried to bring the subject up he was vague and changed the topic. But he did not pay me my weekly $185 cash.
He emailed me today as payroll was being cut and said I did not work the hours he told me to (he never actually specified to me a ""new"" schedule of extended hours in writing or verbally, only told me I had to work more hours). I told him that I worked my regular schedule assuming we would be renegotiating. I then asked him what he cut my check for for the week. He responded that he would cut it for the full amount (although I still have not received last weeks $185 and doubt i'll see it or this weeks either). My paycheck is direct deposit and I will not know if he was truthful until thursday. i cannot accept the reduction what do I do? If I go back to work as I understand it, I would be accepting the paycut by working, but if I don't go, I assume he will consider it ""quitting"" even though he is forcing it on me.

 What rights do I have in this situation in NYC? Any advice? Anyone I can call?

Note: He also pays 2 line cooks cash under the table (them their entire salaries) by writing fake ""catering invoices"" from his other business and having our business cash them out to him...

PLEASE HELP!,beadloom,11,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1jgcw4/new_york_my_land_lord_is_taking_her_time/,"My two roommates and I moved out of a rental on May 26th. My landlord said she needed to wait for the new renters to arrive before she could properly assess the damage and give us back our security deposit. She said she would have the deposit and an itemized list of deductions by the second week of July. Well, the date came and went. We reached out asking for the deposit back but she stated she needs more time to catalog the damage properly. Fine.

After 62 days we emailed again and she informed us that she is taking so long because she is waiting for the window repair man to come and evaluate the break. She said she found it two weeks after we moved out, so about 40 days ago. 

On day 66 she stated, "" I ask just a bit more of your patience.  This timetable is not unique to you ladies.  It usually take a while for everything to settle.""

My roommates and I are furious, we think 66 days is enough to return a deposit. Additionally, during that time she has had many people in as summer vacation renters. I contacted the last two renters of the property, old class mates, and they stated they didn't receive deposits until about 90 days after they moved out! Meaning she did not return the money until after all her summer renters left. This makes me feel uncomfortable as it muddles up what is our damage and what is damage caused over the summer. 

If it was just me I wouldn't care but one of my roommates is moving to Canada for graduate school and needs to financially plan accordingly. 

Edit: Didn't ask a clear question: Is the landlord wrong in keeping our deposit so long? 

Edit: My roommates and I are three quiet and responsible women. We kept the house in good working order and scrubbed the house top to bottom when we left.

I hired an electrical contractor to do some work at my house. He was recommended by someone (job unfinished, but very friendly and seemed knowledgeable). 

He gave me a quote and called me a few days later to confirm an appointment. Asked me for a 50% deposit when he came to take measurements. I've found that it's perfectly normal to do this so I obliged. 

Since then he's missed two dates to do the work, once because another job ran over and second because he was in hospital.

I'm trying to determine if my chances of winning joint custody of my daughter are better if I wait until I have an optimal living situation, or if it's better to try for joint custody as soon as possible regardless of living situation. 

**Background:**

My daughter is 4. From birth to a few months shy of 3, my daughter's mother and I were together which means I spent every night with my daughter. 

When we split up, we verbally agreed to have her 50/50. This went on for a couple months and then her mother decided to take sole custody and give me visitation rights. From ages 3 to 4, I only had my daughter overnight on every other weekend and certain holidays. We followed the Indiana parenting time guidelines. 

**Regarding the living situation:**

When we split up, her mother moved into a new apartment at a new complex. Once our lease was up on the old apartment, I moved into the same complex as the mother in order to make things easier with daughter. 

Now my lease is up at my place. The mother is renewing and staying in the same complex. For financial reasons and to be able to purchase an actual house in a year, I have moved in with my fiance. This is about 35 minutes away from the mother's apartment complex and my daughter's preschool. 

In one year I will buy a house in the area my daughter will be attending preschool and I will be married to my fiance. 

**Question again (reworded):**

What does the court take more stock in? The time frame for how long we have been doing our current arrangement (parenting time guidelines with her having sole custody), or the living situation and the fact that I will have a house for my daughter in one year?

Not.,dznj,13,6,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1izr07/lowes_1000_gift_card_not/,"Was given a $1000 Lowe's gift card in 2009 from a vendor-sponsored contest.  There is no Lowe's near where I life, so I stuck it in a drawer.  Fast forward to June of this year.  I am going to be near a Lowe's store in CT (I live in MA) so I grab the card.  Go into the store and pick out a really nice weed trimmer.  Go to pay with my card. Cashier scratches the pin # area on the card.  Register says ""use another card.""  Try again. No luck.  I call the number on the back of the card and they tell me the card has a $0 balance.  Speak to a supervisor who says that the card was used in Chicago, IL in January of this year.  I told them that I didn't use the card.  They said they would send me some paperwork to fill out.  Gave them my e-mail and my postal address.  After 10 days, I got nothing, so I called their customer service line.  Spoke to a guy named Jeff who may be the rudest, most condescending guy in the South.  Basically told me to file a police report, and that the police would arrest the person who used my card and give me back the $1000!  I went back through their social media person, who passed me on to someone else who was sympathetic, but basically gave me the same advice.  The more I think about it, I think this is a Lowe's problem.  The card says lost or stolen CARDS will not be replaced.  My card was not lost or stolen.  I have it.  It was brand new when I gave it to the cashier in CT.  She scratched the PIN mask off.  Therefore, no one outside of Lowe's should know the PIN, and thus the card number should be useless.  The PIN is not calculated from the card number, to my understanding.  It is stored in a database.  The card number PLUS the PIN are required to use the gift card.  So, my theory is that someone at Lowe's simply runs a report that says ""show me all the cards that are greater than $500 that haven't been used in 3 years.""  They then give the list with the associated PIN's to a cohort who makes the cards and uses them.  Either way, I didn't do anything wrong.  I protected the card.  If I had put 10 $100 bills in my drawer, there still would have been $1000 there when I took it out 3 years later.  The card looked the same as when I put it away.

I've tried to do my own research a bit and sometimes I feel there are grey areas or words that have wide definitions.

1: I was told in the interview and also after I had been hired and signed some papers that I would get a $0.25 raise for every position I learned completely through training. Of the 4 positions I can fully work 3, yet still work the 4th but can't do maybe 5% of that job because they won't send me for the classes. My question is, is that a legally binding oral contract that they owe me the raises and perhaps even back pay?

2: I know in the state of Wisconsin it now states in law that no employee above the age of 18 is required to be given a break, yet they do state ""although it is recommended"" which to me is a slap to the face. Anyway I'm wondering if there is any federal law that can trump that? Even if I work a 14 hour shift, which means I'm working a double I'm told ""Eat on your own time"" by the very same manager that takes frequent smoke breaks.

3: There is no posting of any employee rights posters in a general employee back/break room. I believe it's called OSHA. I was told that is illegal by a friend and also a neighbor.

4: I went to a supervisor and brought up some issues I feel need to be resolved and that I couldn't take it to the general manager because he was part of the problem. He promised me he'd give me the owners phone number so that I could bring it up to him. Instead he back stabbed me (My fault for trusting him I guess) If I get terminated/fired for voicing my opinion on issues is that legal grounds for termination or does that fall under wrongful termination due to ""retaliation"" style firing? I know WI like many other states is work at will or what ever it's called so I feel little to no protection as a worker.

5: I was told maybe a month ago that since we're a work at will state that I can be fired for no reason and can't fight it because I CHOOSE to work. They also mentioned that we all signed agreement contracts to that. Now I know for a fact the only thing I signed was a small package of maybe 5 papers and it's still in my gmail inbox and NONE of them are contracts about working. Anything I can do if I do get fired?

6: If I do get fired is it within my legal rights to ask for a written reason for my termination that both of us must sign? Meaning I'd have it written up like reason for termination: ""Wasn't working out"", and if I don't agree with it and sign it until I get the real reason on paper... I just really want to protect myself from this clear bullying...


Okay that was as clear as I could make it. If you have any other questions please feel free to ask I will try to answer them. Also thanks ahead of time for any insight into my issues. If you care about some more back story I'll just state I make BARELY above my states minimum wage and like I said I'm never given any breaks and I feel there is a lot of bullying and scare tactics used by the owner and the general manager. They're the type that think I should lick their boots clean to thank them for ALLOWING me to work. I know work place politics happen everywhere and I'm not the type to complain. I'm the type that doesn't back down to bullying of workers. I think it's sickening that workers don't have any rights anymore and that we're going backwards. If you follow anything about the state of Wisconsin our lovely governor Scott Walker is a union buster. In my opinion EVERY worker in the world should be able to FIGHT for their right to bargain about the job and they should be protected from bullying and wrongful termination by employers.

Since filing the report, I have been contacted constantly by my parents, and now, have decided to approach this issue in a new method. My brother and I are both adults, and after hearing my parents' and brother's pleas, I realize that I do not have the emotional strength to potentially send my brother to jail.

I would like information on what would happen if I requested the detective to no longer pursue action, as well as steps towards the removal of this report/charge. I understand the state of Georgia observe unique rights for victims of assault, but I would like any information that might aide in dropping the charges. Furthermore, I would like to know the repercussions should I remove charges, as well as any legal advice for my brother (and my former family, as they are supporting him).

---

I'm in Detroit (area), Michigan, USA. 

Questions, before I get into the story:

(posted at top for visibility but you may wanna read these afterward)

* Can they legally call those numbers after I told them not to?

* Can the person they were trying to speak to tell them not to call and will calling be illegal for them if they call after being told not to? (If my simply telling them not to isn't enough - as a resident of the same house)

* Does it sound like they're going to call? (note in particular the italicized text at the bottom of the post)

I am living in a house with 3 other people. Two are old, two are young. The old pair date, and the younger pair USED to date. I'm the female in the younger group of people. The younger male is the older females son (as named below: Brain is Edna's son)

* Story name for older man: Ted
* Story name for older woman: Edna

* My name: Pinky
* Ex name: Brain

Someone called for Ted. I tried to answer on the phone with caller ID, but it wasn't charged so I used the old phone without ID.

 I am not related to Ted nor anyone living here. They said they were calling about medical issues, I believe. They usually say that. They have called before. It is an 866 number. This company who named their name ONCE and wouldn't repeat upon request asked for Ted, I said he wasn't here (very true too) and the asked for a cell phone number. I immediately and foolishly shared because I don't know if Ted is waiting for some blood test result or something. I gave his girlfriends number too (I want to shoot myself). 

I hung up and about 5 minutes later it hit me that it may not have been the hospital. I went upstairs and checked the spare phone hidden in the back room which was charged and it was that dang 866 ""medical company"" or whatever. I called back and got the same woman who had just called (pretty sure, but I won't say 100% sure). Her name is Emily. I asked her not to call the numbers I had just given her and she dodged the issue by asking my name and saying I couldn't ask for personal medical information about Ted. WTF

I called back a 2nd time and spoke to another woman whom gave me the same ""we can't help you without knowing your name and relation"". I told her I was just the person Emily talked to and wanted them to remove the cellphone numbers from their system that I just shared with Emily. This woman said it wasn't in their system so I shouldn't worry and she hung up after I squeeked out a pathetic ""okay"". 

So, naturally I call back because Emily must have written the numbers down on a piece of paper and I wanted to ask to have her throw it away and tell them not to call. 

Blah blah, a 3rd woman and then the supervisor both told me they couldn't help me without knowing my name (but somehow can get personal medical information about Ted FROM a woman without knowing her name).

&gt; Me: Can I have your company name or what sort of company you are? I don't want you calling them on vacation. (note: I never asked for any on previous calls. Her reply was to THIS statement)

&gt; Supervisor: WHY are you asking for personal health information about Ted?

&gt; Me: I'm not, please just have Emily nor anyone there call Ted nor his girlfriend. Don't call them.

&gt; Supervisor: What's your name ma'am?

&gt; Me: It's irrelevant. I just want you to not call the numbers I gave thinking you were the hospital. 

&gt; Supervisor: I can't help you if you won't tell me your name. Why is it some military-guarded secret?

&gt; Me: I don't want you calling telling them I told you it was okay to call them.

&gt; Supervisor: (she pauses)

&gt; Me: Can I at least know what kind of company you are?

&gt; Supervisor: You can't ask for personal medical information regarding Ted. 

&gt; Me: this has nothing to do with Ted. I don't want you to share any medical information whatsoever. I don't even need to know what your business is. I just want you to not call.

&gt; And she interrupted me as I was saying ""I just want you to not call"" because she knew it was coming.

&gt; Supervisor: I don't think you should call again. I'm ending this call. 

&gt; Me: Just never call (phone hangs up)


--- I reworded this post because it was confusing and I'm not sure if I could have made it shorter AND informative.

*They never said they won't call but the 3rd woman (before I spoke to the supervisor) said to have Ted call when he gets back, so they may not call).*

This is stressing me out and I'm shaking and light-headed. I don't want to ruin their vacation.

I work for a restaurant at a golf and country club. My managers make the servers tip 1% of total sales to bussers and 2% of total sales to the managers. The interesting part is that our managers sometimes double as servers. So, if they are supervising, they take 2% of tips. If they split the floor with us, they will not ask us to tip them out. 

It really frustrates me because there is food service available before we open. Customers can pick from limited menu and order food to go. When I clock in, I have to then ring those items on my account and it adds to the total sales even though I don't receive tip because there was no service given. Also, they grab chips, drinks, and ice cream to go which they also do not tip from. This contributes to my total sales but not my actual amount of tips (because who tips on Doritos?).

This guy has planned all long to own her, and it's happened. He knows where she lives so she's afraid that she can't even hide from him, he has money due to his rich parents who spoil him which also adds to her fears because he could easily pay someone to stalk her if she tried anything.

He has shady friends, has been spotted by her mum doing drug deals, drives like a buffoon (over the speed limit, intoxicated, doesn't indicate, cuts people off etc.) and he is, as I said before, abusive.

He has previously been jailed for two months after his ex got the police involved after he pushed her down the stairs. Could this previous offence history be helpful?

She's shown me the text messages he sends her, he's sent death threats to me after I tried to tell her to ignore him and get a restraining order, he has forced her to cut all contact with me, and many other of her friends, she has made a fake Facebook account just so she can talk to me, it's like being in a damn Bond movie in reality. She posts things on the wall of that account. She was raped by him, though it was not violent but she said no multiple times.

Three years ago, two Craigslisters and I rented a 5+ bedroom apartment.  Our lease began October 2010 and terminated September 2011.  I moved out shortly before the lease ended, subletting to another person for two months, and this person continued to live there after our agreement was up.  Since the sublessee paid me the equivalent of my security deposit upfront, I considered my responsibilities terminated at the time the lease was terminated.

In the past two years, no new lease was ever signed with the occupants of the apartment.  In March of this year, apparently following a rat infestation in the basement, the occupants at the time ceased paying rent.

We (the co-signers of the original lease) recently received a letter that we're being held responsible for the rent that was unpaid between March and July, which amounts to almost $15,000.

Any help with these questions would be insanely helpful.

1. What information decides whether my previous landlord has a case against us, the original lessees of the apartment?

A few months ago, he admitted to having an affair, moved out, and is now renting a home with the other woman. She cannot afford a lawyer or a mediator right now but has found an attorney who might be willing to take her case pro bono. I have a few questions about the divorce and child custody regarding their situation. She has 4 kids with him. 

Any advice or information I can relay to her would be helpful. She would talk to the potential attorney, but she doesn't want to burden him with questions since him helping her isn't a 100% thing yet and he is nice enough to potentially help her for free.

Right now, there is no formal custody agreement in place or any kind of legal agreement in place at all. Since he's been out of the home, they've been sharing the kids 50/50 where she gets them one week and then he gets them the next.

1. The husband is refusing to pay any of the costs associated with the marital home after this month ends because he has to pay the fees on the new home. Can he do that? Their home is marital property and he is on the mortgage. 

2. When he left the home, he told the kids about the affair, moved out, moved into the new place, and introduced the kids to the other women in the same week. Will this affect the custody situation in any way? Kids need stability, and he has shown little regard for their mental health with making all these big life-changing decisions so suddenly. 

3. Can the judge have him undergo drug testing and a mental health evaluation before deciding on the custody arrangement at her request? He has a family history of bipolar disorder, and his behavior has been so erratic with these big changes that we both suspect there may be drugs or mental health issues involved. If he is in some sort of manic state, he may make risky decisions that could negatively impact the kids. She is willing to undergo the same drug and mental health testing that he would go through.  

4. While the husband is at work, he leaves the kids alone with the other woman. They do not like her much and do not want to be over there if he is not home and able to spend time with them. They would prefer for her not to be around at all when they're visiting, but that's probably not realistic. How likely is it that a judge would approve of adding a ""morality clause"" to the custody agreement, where he and she both would not be able to have overnight guests of the opposite sex? How would this work if the husband and other woman are sharing the new place?

5. Related to the above, is he allowed to leave the kids alone with the other woman? Can the mother refuse to allow the kids to go to his house if he isn't going to be there? She knows virtually nothing about the other woman and does not feel comfortable leaving the kids alone with her. However, he has threatened to file for full custody. She knows he has no grounds to actually get it but is afraid it will look bad for her to refuse to allow them to go over to his house. 

6. Using some sort of online calculator, the husband has determined that he will give her $800 in child support a month. This number is most likely an underestimate of what she should actually get, but the money issue is currently preventing her from getting a formal agreement in place. How will this affect the custody arrangement? Will it look good for him that he is trying to give support? Or will it look bad because he is probably underestimating the amount and trying to persuade her not to save up and file for a formal order?

I am willing to repay my employer for overpaid wages. Here's the story though. I work for a very large private ambulance company and I transferred from division to division in 2010. With this transfer my wages are different and so is my overtime. My original division paid me $10.50 an hour and anything after 8 hours is time and a half and anything after 12 hours is double time. The new division pays me $12.30 an hour and anything after 40 hours a week is time and a half and double time after 12 hours in a shift. The new division forgot to switch my overtime from the 8 hours daily to the 40 hours a week. I was getting paid my new wage at $12.30 an hour and time and a half after 8 hours (keep in mind, we work 12 hours a day minimum). This resulted in my employer overpaying me by $2,352. This is where it gets tricky. They never noticed this until I asked for 8 missed days paid. I never noticed these days missed nor did I notice my checks seemed larger from the overpayment. I finally decided to check my time clock punches online and noticed I had the missed days. I turned in a form to request payment of these missed days which allows them to audit my whole pay history. They found the overpayment through the audit and sat me down to schedule a repayment method. I told them I needed to read over everything and get back to them. This meeting was in the beginning of 2011. I have yet to hear back from them about this. Is there any form of statute of limitation with this?

I live in a trailer park. I have lived here since I was a child, and will continue to live here until the foreseeable future, when I can afford to move out of my dad's place.

A few years back, one of the longtime trailer park residents took on the role of Park Security. He does not get paid to do this, and volunteered to fulfill the role in his spare time. The role of Park Security did not exist before this, and is an unofficial title. Park Security is mentioned nowhere in the rules/guidelines to this park, and he was also not trained in any way.

Things started off pretty innocuous, but have evolved to a level that I find sort of strange. He has put a decal on his vehicle that is uncannily close to the VT State Police seal, he has crafted himself a uniform, he has a light on top of his car, and he owns a radar gun which he uses on park residents when they drive through the park, typically while sitting in his own vehicle in a hidden area with the lights off. If he determines they have been speeding, he will follow them to their destination, wait until they park, then park behind them and confront them. The radar gun he uses is very old, and several residents report being confronted about speeding when they were not doing so. (It is basically impossible to go over the set speed limit in this park, given the quality of the road.) When he confronts people about their driving, he does so in such a way that a person unfamiliar with the park may believe him to be a police officer.

This trailer park is private property, if that makes a difference in any way.

My question: Do his activities constitute impersonating an officer, or is he just overstepping his authority without that impersonation? Or is he fulfilling his role in an appropriate manner?

I don't really want to sue the guy or bring litigation against him or anything, I'm just a little weirded out by how much authority he appears to wield when he isn't paid, isn't trained, and isn't fulfilling an official role per the park guidelines.

I've searched my place top to bottom, but it' s nowhere to be found -- and there's not many places it could hide in a 1-bedroom apartment. The only reasonable conclusion is that the movers stole it. (I hadn't packed it into a larger box -- it was just in its original packaging.)

Unfortunately, I'd initialed the waiver saying that all my stuff was present without actually doing a thorough check, which was stupid, but you know how it is when you move -- you just want it over with as soon as possible. That's a mistake I'll never make again.

So what are my options? My plan right now is to contact the company, explain the situation, and ask for reasonable compensation (I'm thinking $150, which is the going used price for the Xbox model I had.) If they refuse, which I'm almost positive they will, I'll tell them that I'll do a chargeback on the credit card I used for the move for the full cost (about $550) and will be posting negative reviews of their company on Yelp and related websites. I figure even if they win the chargeback dispute, they'll still have to have spent time handling, which will give me at least some satisfaction. 

Does this sound like a reasonable solution? The amounts of money involved are below my renter's insurance deductible, so that's no help, and I have a feeling the police aren't going to be working in shifts to solve my case if I report it, considering that I have no actual proof and it's just a few hundred dollars at stake.

I've never been here before so I'm not sure that this is the appropriate question for such a topic, but I think it might be! This question regards gift card expiration in New York State.

My girlfriend bought her aunt a $200 gift card to a nail salon one year ago. When her aunt went to go use it today however, the clerk told her that she was 7 days over the 1 year expiration date and that there was nothing he could do. My girlfriend was really bummed about the whole situation, so I google searched how gift card expiration works and stumbled upon this site.

http://www.ncsl.org/issues-research/banking/gift-cards-and-certificates-statutes-and-legis.aspx#

It lists the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act of 2009 and claims ""The law provides that gift cards cannot expire within five years from the date they were activated.""

I was slightly confused because I had never heard of such a law, and was wondering whether or not this would apply to New York? I did some research and all I was able to really find was the Office of Unclaimed Funds website for New York.

http://www.osc.state.ny.us/ouf/giftcards.htm#faq3

It states that ""When the federal Credit CARD Act of 2009 goes into effect in August 2010, cards covered by it will not be allowed to expire before 5 years.""

I am 18 and male, my girlfriend will be 17 in July.

I am a citizen with a clean record.

We are both going to college next year.

Northern Illinois.  I can provide the county if it is needed.

We have been together for almost a year and a half.

She was pregnant at one point, but her mother has no evidence that the child was mine, she ended up miscarrying :(

So, my girlfriend has a psychotic mother who does not like me one bit. She is filing for a restraining order to keep me away from her daughter. As far as I know, she has nothing against me to use in court other than the age difference.  She may try to bring sex into this, but has no evidence that my girlfriend and I ever did in fact, have sex.  I have never been in a court battle before, nor do I know how obtaining a restraining order works very well. I just wish to keep my girlfriend out of depression.  Where is the best place to look for a lawyer suitable for restraining orders and are they decided in court?

A few weeks ago code enforcement came by and tagged my '73 Gran Torino as a derelict vehicle. Bewildered I called the police department (who handles the information on code infractions) and they said that the Torino was in pieces and the tag was out of date. 

I admitted that I had let the tag lapse on it, but told them that it was in fact completely intact and running. Code inspector said as long as I moved the car to show that it was running, and properly tagged the vehicle that I would be fine. The vehicle was tagged and pulled further up in the driveway.

As of this morning I got a certified letter saying I had 72 hours to remove my Torino as it was a derelict vehicle. Called the police department again and said the Torino was tagged and it was still running and driving.

He said because I had chocked the tires and it had a blanket thrown over it it was still derelict and it didn't matter that it was legally tagged and running.

I told him (which he should have known) that the blanket was on the car due to the recent hail storms we've been having here in OK, and that the chocks were just a safety precaution since the car isn't driven daily and I thought wheel chocks were well within my right.

He told me none of that mattered, I was cited once about it, and I had failed to handle the citation.

Am I in the wrong here? I do plan on speaking to an attorney, I just want to know if they are actually in the right and can impound a running, legal, vehicle because of what I consider to be an issue of appearance more than anything? I did what they asked last time and they didn't cite my wheel chocks last time.

I get the feeling that going against my city would be a losing battle, but I don't feel like I'm in the wrong here.

**Edit**: I just got a hold of the mayor (only person above the police chief I was told) and they said that the police chief just did a drive by and is accepting of the situation as it sits, so they've decided to drop the case.

In 2009 a friend of mine and I started chatting online about websites and SEO - he was (is) a spammer and primarily makes a living through less than legal means and talked like he wanted to make a change. I was living in Florida at the time and i was always a dream of mine to move to California (where he lived) and invest myself in the booming medical marijuana industry and scene in a meaningful and productive way - vaporizers - a clean and responsible way to change real peoples lives. There are many ways to make a living on the internet and most of them are dishonest but this was/is something I really connected with and hold an extreme passion. I cant explain the feeling you get when people thank you for giving them the time - for helping them take the steps necessary to improve their own quality of living. Its amazing. 

My partner mentioned he would be moving soon and we should both move to a new area and start this business together so I packed up and moved to California in July of 2009 using all of the funds from the sale of my money making website ( ~20K ) and we moved to the same apartment complex. The prices were a shock ( $1400/month for a 1bd room) for me and soon I realized that we would need to get this site off the ground. My partner put forth the funds to purchase the initial domains ( ~9K ) and the equipment ( ~1K on vaporizers and a ~1k camera for himself ) and I was responsible for the sites themselves. I have a background in graphic design, content management and creation and general web development and he is a programmer.

 As the months went by traffic to our sites began to grow and we actually started getting orders to the point of a sustainable business, it was nearly a year in that I confronted my partner about the fact that I still hadn't received any of the money from sales and couldnt even afford to pay my rent any longer - I felt as though he had been repaid his initial investment and I needed an equal partner in the project as planned. We decided to start a LLC in California as equal partners and we put forth what each of us provided to the partnership. We got business bank accounts setup and merchant accounts as well and I went about my work spreading the sites through the internet and even built a whole new brand to be our flagship store. 

Traffic continued to grow through the months and the site was now making thousands of dollars, I was able to salary myself for $2000 per month before taxes and finally I was on the right track but I could tell my partner had less and less interest in the sites. Legitimate money was no match for the huge amounts of cash he could make in short time by coding spamming software. In 2011 he had saved up enough cash spamming to purchase himself a home for $500k cash and needing a place to live I ended up in one of his spare bedrooms for a few months, his relationship with his fiance ( now wife ) was becoming strained with her current job and since business was doing well and I decided to hire her - maybe my weak attempt to pay them back for allowing me to crash or maybe just trying to help my friends spend more time together -regardless it didn't work out.

I wont go too far into this part but in the end she was paid the same amount as me per month for six months or so until it got to the point that she really wasn't fulfilling her roll at all and had pretty much taken a back seat just getting a check every month. I could feel the tension growing in the house so I took what money I had and moved out, crashing on couches of my friends of girl friend scrambling to find next step. In november of 2011 I headed back up to their place to pick up my car which was stored in their garage with a blown headgasket ( long story of bad events ) and during the trip home my partner transferred several domains from one of our business domain accounts to his own personal account. 

Naively I believed that my partner was just protecting his own interest's in case I ever tried to screw him out of the company as he was really not even involved at this point and accepted this action. We had the contracts signed the LLC was registered in my name - I couldn't have my own company taken from me could I ? The next few months my communication with my partner fell to an all time low, the Google Panda update had hurt our rankings considerably and I started feeling uncertain about our future. I continued to work on our sites every day completely redesigning one and testing new methods on others trying to restore our ranks and slowly traffic started to flatline then come back. On the evening of my birthday knowing I wouldnt be around a computer my partner logged into the Godaddy account holding both my personal and our business domains ( we had over 100+ domains related to the industry at this point - a collection I had hand built over the last two years preparing for the vapor boom. ) and cherry picked all of his favorites including personal domains I had registered years before even meeting him. At this point I was once again in financial ruins - I didn't feel like I had the support of those closest to me and slid into a depression. 

I have spent the last year of my life struggling along trying to deal with the loss of my dream and feeling sorry for myself. A month ago I was looking for an email in my spam folder and came across a domain that looked familure - after some quick research I quickly realized my partner was now using our domains to spam vaporizer emails out. I started checking the sites and to my surprise everything was still there exactly as I had left it, rankings had returned and it appears the site is now making more money than ever. I worked up the nerve and headed to my local bank still having my company debit card and tried to find out what had happened with the company since I had been excluded a year prior. It turned out after a lot of back and forth that my partner held a fake meeting of the minutes for the LLC and apparently forged my signature to pass my ownership to another party. He allowed our LLC to expire in August of 2012 so we wouldnt have to report or pay taxes on the profits ( something he had mentioned doing before with internet startups ) and closed the business checking account instead pointing the merchant account profits into his own bank account. Public record shows he has put atleast another 100K cash into his home in improvements over the last year and he purchased new cars for himself and his wife as well.

I am now sitting here, two days left in this apartment with a girlfriend that now despises me and my depressive rut - wondering what I should do, should I leave this place and these negative feelings - move on from it all and accept my mistakes as a loss - Should I fight for my dream - I'm losing the life Ive always wanted over this and it just seems impossible to move on from - I just cant see a life over the hill but I don't know my rights.

But, students who take the test have the option to pay extra for a copy of their test and answer key. Mom has copies of these tests (that she uses to supplement her classes and private tutoring) dating back to 2002, maybe earlier. She has literally boxes of them around the house/her daytime classroom. I know that national tests like this one are pretty hardcore about distributing test questions and general copyright stuff (think back to all statements I've had to sign before different tests, including the statement you sign when you buy a copy of this test). 

I just want to know if I'm right to be worried about this realization, and, if I should be worried, how worried I need to be. Considering I'm right about the laws; I have a few ideas to help the problem, but none that will be as easy/accesible/helpful as Mom's current practices. For example, she might have to exclusively use the text books in her class. If a student takes the test, buys a copy, and returns to mom (or me!) for private tutoring, then it's legal for us to use that students copy that they own for tutoring. 

My mom is an incredible teacher. Her students from her full-time job never forget her, and she has helped so many high school students reach their best score on this test. She's only trying to do good for students and supplement my parent's teacher incomes. I'd hate for her to get in trouble for something like this. I would so appreciate anyone with more knowledge than me in this area (ie the copyright tutorials I had to complete from time to time in undergrad).

Quick backstory:
I had a bad abscess in my mouth. I went to the local hospital, they refered me to another hospital to have oral surgery.

I only have medicare Part A, which covered the hospital visits. However the surgery was not covered. Prior to the procedure, the Doctor/Surgeon was made aware that I had absolutely no insurance outside of medicare (and even if I did I learned later he does not accept medicaid or any other goverment insurance)

Despite this, he did not mention anything about pricing or alternate treatment. Instead he proceeded with the surgery while everyone was leading me to believe that Medicare would cover it all (since the surgery happened in the hospital).

This was not the case, and now they (the Dr's firm, not the hospital) expect me to pay a $8,790 (over 88% of my annual SocSec Disability income) bill for the procedure. What ticks me off the most is that nothing was discussed with me up front. The procedure was not life-threatening, and could have been postponed (albeit painfully) so that I could have gotten proper insurance, or removed only the bottom row since they were the only teeth causing abscesses (which would have at least halfed the bill).

I am wondering if (and how) I can be legally responsible for this when I was not made aware up front that this would be an out-of-pocket expense.

Sorry if this reads kinda long.

Neighbors have a pitbull that has been terrorizing us for over a year now, but it's only part of the problem. We basically have our houses split in half, so our doors are almost right next to each other, and share a giant yard that encompasses the property, and also a big parking area. This dog has attacked our dog multiple times as well as the other neighbors dogs 15-20 feet across the way in front of us (they live in identical housing as us, so we're two houses in parallel.) And it even tried attacking me and the person I live with. We've called the landlord, says she will tell them to leave, but follows it up with ""being afraid of them trashing the place after they move out."" So nothing has been done ever since. 

After we tried to talk to the landlord, the morning after the wife next door basically went berserk on the other person here. Yelling in her face constantly, calling her a liar, bellowing that she has taken care of the situation by ""disciplining the dog by kicking it,"" and that we didn't need to bring the landlord into this. It was all ridiculous. She then broke down and started crying, calling the landlord on her phone, and accused us of being racists, said we called her a ""nigger lover,"" and conspiring against her (which made me beyond angry.) She can't control this dog and in my eyes she isn't fit to own it. They let their small kids walk this dog and they can't control it when it gets wild and tries to attack one of us (which has happened.) It runs outside loose almost everyday and bangs against our door barking, growling and snapping, which makes it almost impossible to leave the house during the day.

Now it's getting petty, the wife yells outside our window as she passes by and shouts things about us as she goes inside every other day, trying to instigate things. Dumps her garbage behind our house in the grass. Purposely put a half a pan of cake next to our door (if you own a dog, you know what chocolate does to it.) And just yesterday/today in the middle of the night, moved our garbage cans before the garbage truck came to pick them up, then moved them back out front in the morning while we slept. 

This is all childish, and it's harassment in my eyes, and the only thing I can think of that will solve this is moving out at this point. But it's also my home, and I don't want to be driven out after only being here for 3 years, and especially when I've done nothing wrong. 

Is there something I can do that could put a stop to this? The police won't do anything about it.

1369155393.0,9,self.legaladvice,1eruiy,"Landlord agreed to let me break my lease, but is now demanding I pay for the rest of the rent.",Gizlo,9,0,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1eruiy/landlord_agreed_to_let_me_break_my_lease_but_is/,"So my girlfriend, my friend and myself all started renting a house together back in June and we all signed an 18 month lease. In November the friend did something stupid and went to jail. The friend, now drowning in court costs/legal fees, refused to help us with his portion of the rent because he says he has no money left and he will be in jail until August of this year. My girlfriend and I had a discussion with the landlord about this and we came to the conclusion that without the friend paying his 1/3 of the rent it was simply much too costly to keep renting this house. Even though our lease (at the time) still had 11 months left on it, the landlord reluctantly agreed to let us leave and get out of the lease. (We stayed there for 2 more months after he agreed to let us leave to honor his 60 day notice policy)

So fast forward to April. We begin moving out and realtors begin giving tours of the house. He finds a new tenant within a week. So we paid for April rent, the new tenant began paying rent in May and the landlord never misses a beat in getting his rent money. 

2 days ago I get an email from the landlord telling me he feels that that we are responsible for the remaining months on the lease, so he is now requiring us to pay 7 months rent, even though we don't live there anymore and he found new tenants the same month we moved out. On top of this he has stated that he will be keeping our $2500 security deposit EVEN THOUGH the house is in better shape than it was when we got there (we buffed scratches out of the hardwood floors, cleaned up his shed so that it was functional and not filthy, did TONS of landscaping, and put up new working light fixtures/ceiling fans in the bedrooms).

So Reddit, what can I do here? If he would've stated in our 60 notice period that even if we moved out we still had to pay for the rent, I wouldn't have moved out in the first place. He brought this up after we had already been out of the house for a month. Him keeping the security deposit, plus demanding almost $10,000 in rent when I'm not living there (and he has new tenants already) seems crazy to me. Does anyone have any experience with this sort of thing? By the way he's only pursuing my girlfriend and I, not the friend who is in jail because I'm sure he knows he can't squeeze any money out of him. HELP!

**TL:DR My landlord agreed to let me out of my lease due to another roommate not being able to pay his portion of rent...Now after I moved out he decides he wants me to pay for the rest of the months on the lease**

I can't believe that this jerk is denying this whole thing, but below is the condensed story:

- Had a New Year's Eve party to bring in 2013, complete with food, booze, and good times for my guests.

- I invited a friend from work (we'll call him E), who brought two other guys he was partying with (his roommate who we'll call C, and his roommate's friend who we'll call G).

- All guests had left by 3AM except for a girlfriend of mine, who was hooking up with E in the bathroom, my boyfriend who was spending time with me in my room, and three other friends who were all asleep in different rooms.

- Around 3-3:30 AM, both my boyfriend and I heard C and G belligerently screaming for E, that it was time to leave, to get out of the bathroom, and leave the apartment with them. They were clearly hammered. I remember they had a whole water bottle of liquor (classy...) that they had been sipping on all night.

- E was still preoccupied with my girlfriend in the bathroom and C + G were only screaming louder. I heard them storm out of my apartment into the outer hallway, where there's a solid metal door that leads outside.

- The screaming in the hallway continued, then there was a HUGE crashing sound. My boyfriend and I were too nervous to go out there until we heard them leave. When they had gone, we walked into the hallway and saw that solid iron door had been ripped off its hinges and was on the floor. There was also a hole punched in the wall, the floor was ripped up, and a few tenants' bikes had been thrown around.

- The next day, E told me G would have to pay for the damage somehow because he did it, and maybe C would have to help him because G can't afford it. I still have these text messages. I told my landlord, who approached me about it, that I knew who did it and he would be held responsible. I confessed to knowing because I was afraid that if I didn't, I would not be invited to re-sign my lease. It didn't even occur to me to file a police report at the time. I've never been in a position like this before, because none of my friends are belligerent fucks.

- The bill just came in for repairs to all the damage - $1,950. I got in touch with G and C and they denied the whole thing, saying the damage was done before they left my apartment. They are ignoring me and refuse to set up a phone call. They're also telling me they'll call the cops on me if I continue to ""harass"" them. I'm going to the police on Wednesday, so there's some sort of report of this, and am sure I'll have to take this to small claims court in Boston, where I live. They will deny this in court, for sure, and I'm afraid I'll end up with the bill. I'm a grad student and work 2 full time jobs. It kills me to know I'll be set back financially if I have to pay this bill. It also kills me that I have to clean up these scumbags' mess.

Potential evidence that I have: photos of the damage after it was done, my account, my boyfriend's account, text messages from E saying C and G are going to have to find a way to pay, and could possibly get security camera footage of them leaving my place (but not actually doing the damage, because the camera is outside).

I don't think E would come to court. Is he obligated to? I've never been in this position and am not entirely sure what to do...

Backstory:  Last November my then-girlfriend's boss starts getting these emails implying that inappropriate things took place between her and I in front of the kids (which is completely unfounded, slanderous, and untrue, btw). The only person that could have sent those emails was my dad's wife, due to language used and certain details that only she would have been privy to. My ex-gf could have lost her job, her career, her children, and did in fact break up with me over my crazy step-mother (which I don't blame her one bit!). could have potentially lost custody of my daughter and been investigated- now they're demanding I let them back in?

Today is my daughter's birthday and my dad is trying to force my hand in letting them see her. What should I do?! (also x-posting to /r/law) Am I being unreasonable here by not letting my daughter see them? Why would I let people so destructive into my daughter's life?

EDIT: Just got a text from my dad: ""I understand your feelings. But if you insist on not allowing us to see ****, when it doesn't involve you... two can play that game. I've nothing to lose at this point!""
was that a threat?

As I began composing an email to respond, I began feeling like this was *precisely* the actions that I was being manipulated into... I mean, sending an email would be like acknowledging bad behavior and giving attention to a narcissist.  In case this goes further, the only thing I've found on the subject is this snippet:

“The custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder. A law that allows anyone to petition a court for child visitation rights over parental objections unconstitutionally infringes on parents’ fundamental right to rear their children.” ~ Supreme Court Case, Troxel vs. Granville, Year 2000

Anyways I bought the car trying to do dealer finance which was dumb I know. Believe me Ive really learned a lot this in the last month.

So here is whats going on first I got pulled over for expired tags on May 10th for which I never received my tags (expired 5/3) was given a $103 citation. I then went to the DMV which they told me my tags were purchased on April 29th and to go to the dealer or pay $45. I went to the dealer and talked to a finance guy who assured me everything was ok and that my citation would be taken care of. I was given a piece of paper without a new temp tag and was told to wait by the mail and it should be there and if I get pulled over show them that piece of paper. I get a call today 5/15 from my actual finance manager leaving me a message telling me the bank fell through and that I need to come back in and resign with another bank that gave me a better rate. All this when I was suppose to pay my first car payment on 5/18. Following that I get a call from my sales guy who also left me a message. I then later on gave my finance manager a call telling him I was out of town and that I would like the paper work sent over so I can take a look; which he wouldn't do. He then preceded to flip out on me telling me he should have ""trucked the car"" and that I should be grateful. I told him I was upset about the other finance manager not giving me another temp tag because I got pulled over again on mothers day with my mother in the car and I had to sit there for over an hour before they let me go. He then said he didn't know and that I wouldn't receive my tags in till I sign this new deal. I have been upfront and honest with them and I feel Im getting screwed somewhere. I also fell like they are trying to bully me. I work a lot and also go to school I have really no free time to deal with this which also pisses me off.

Now for questions: How much weight do I have here? What are my best options?
Im already pretty pissed could I demand my older car(or down payment) and return keys? Even if they do give me a better finance deal?

There is a signed contract outlining the work and deliverables.

Since completion, the site has experienced some problems with its online store. Partly the eCommerce plugin being used is a bit buggy and also some users using certain browsers aren't able to checkout their purchases. Since completion, I have on several occasions agreed to fix some of the problems that have arisen, but now almost 3 years after the fact, the problems continue.

I suggested switching to a new plugin and offered to complete the switch for a reduced rate. The client has said no, that they paid for a working product and that they should not have to pay to switch it to a better service.

It's clear to me that I want to end my dealings with them because while there have been some bugs, I have loyally fixed them all up to this point, and currently the bug in question is only affecting about 10% of customers. More importantly, my work finished when they signed off on the project almost 3 years ago.

Seems simple enough, and I plan to tell the client that I've been happy to fix problems up to this point, but that given my current workload I am no longer able to keep working on the site. I'm going to suggest hiring someone to maintain the site.

I guess what I'm worried about now is legal action. The client has proven himself to be a little hotheaded and I worry that he will threaten legal action. He has a fair amount of money and I am worried that I will have to deal with the possibility of legal action.

I guess I'm just looking for some realistic advice about how likely that is and if it does happen, what the best way is to procede. I think I am in the right, and without posting the contract, I can say for the most part it is fairly standard for this type of work and should justify my position that the work ended when I delivered the site. Can someone give me some insight on this issue? Thank you so much.

The girl who I was dating for a couple of years got pregnant. Thinking that the baby was mine, we chose to give her my last name. When the child was born, I quickly realized that she had nothing physically in common with me, so I questioned my girlfriend about that, and she told me that she had slept with multiple people near the time of conception. We got a paternity test and my suspicions were confirmed. A short while later, we split up.

Fast-forward about a year (to today), and I have just found out that the child still has my last name, and the mother has no intention of changing it. Is there anything that I can do to 'get my name back'?

Also, I never signed the birth certificate, since I had my suspicions and didn't want to be held legally responsible if they turned out to be true. Moreover, my ex-girlfriend was married and in the process of divorcing at the time (not sure if this makes any difference, but I figured I'd include it just in case).
