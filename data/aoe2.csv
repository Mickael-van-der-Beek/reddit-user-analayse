http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1c2xat/age_of_empires_ii_hd_updategeneral_information/

*Please up vote this so everyone sees it as my previous thread from yesterday is heading off the front of r/aoe2, it is a self post and I get no karma.*

**Next patch** is currently unknown as to when it will be released. Everything is **current as of 2:55PM EST 4/10/13**. Currently no word from the Devs today

If you are having problems even starting the game, ensure your OS is up to date and that you have the latest drivers for your GPU as well as a **Direct X 9.0c Capable GPU** . **Update the game** and if the problem persists then you will just have to wait until the Devs get back to work which I'm sure they will be doing considering it is launch day. 

* White screen will usually indicate that your GPU is only DX 9.0b compliant (If you have this error try, ""-nostartup"" without quotes, no guarantees this will work.

* ""Could not initialize graphics system. Make sure that your video card and driver are compatible with DirectDraw."" This error seems to occur if you on Windows XP SP2, make sure you update your system to Service Pack 3. (This could be wrong so take it with a grain of salt) A possible fix for DirectDraw error would be to run Windows Server 2008R2. *I can not confirm this but from what I hear it is possible so try at your own leisure*

Latest DirectX Update Here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35

Currently from what I have gathered from Steam Chat that the AOE II HD Dev team is currently working on is as follows:

* Priority is on issues affecting game performance
* ~~Windows XP,~~ For the most part this has been fixed (if you still have issues check to make sure your cpu/gpu supports Direct X 9.0c
* Speed,
* **FPS**, This seems to be #1 priority now for people with high end systems getting terrible frame rate
* Crash in quick search,  This is #2 priority atm it seems
* Lag Issues 

Other related issues they are looking into are as follows:

* Achievements not unlocking
* Improvements to the Lobby/Matchmaking
* Out of Sync errors
* ~~Age of Empires 2 HD ""Unable to initialize graphics system. Device may not meet minimum specs. Subcode=3""~~ This error seems to be caused by your hardware not supporting the shader model needed. Check above.

**They do not have an eta on when these fixes may be coming. Currently, their priority is to fix the FPS related issues first which is being tested atm.**

Fix for Crash before loading screen: (This may or may not work, please report back if it does) Follow steps below

* Start singleplayer game
* Disable the statistics with the Button above the minimap (Shortcut: F4)
* Quit the game completly!
* Start the game again
* Join a multiplayergame
* Don't turn statistics on during the game

Launcher doesn't look right, there are white boxes all over the place: Check Below

* This is because you have your DPI set incorrectly: 
* Right click on the Desktop
* Click Screen resolution
* Click the link ""Make text larger or smaller""
* Select either 100% (recommended!) or 150%
* Click Apply

Mouse does not stay confined to your screen (This is caused by having multiple monitors). Fix below

* Simply disable one of the monitors
* Right click on desktop and select screen resolution
* Next to multiple displays, select show only desktop 1

Hotkey Fix: (Unconfirmed) Fix below

* When starting a multiplayer game, AoE2HD forgets the custom hotkey settings and reverts to default until opening the hotkey menu which can be very annoying considering how important the first few seconds of the game can be. Luckily there is a simple fix: copy player1.hki from \Age2HD\savegame to \Age2HD. (by default, Age2HD should be in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common)

**This may fix some of the above issues.**

* Update your game by verifying the integrity of game cache by right clicking on the AOE II HD and selecting properties, then under local files you will find it. Make sure you are not in the beta anymore as it will not update to the correct patch.

**Multiplayer**

* Until everyone updates their game files during multiplayer, games will go out of sync (or their patch just doesn't work). **Make sure you are updated! Everyone needs to update, not just XP users** The latest patch that came out was around 10:30PM EST 4/8/13. This latest patch will not have a 2.XX because it was not a patch but a general fix.

*I'm Updating this post as I get more information. If you have any new information especially from the forums as I can not find everything, please comment below and I will add it here.*",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1365621205.0,,,True,t3_1bzxv5,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1bzxv5/age_of_empires_ii_hd_updategeneral_information/,

I've done my fair share of research, so I thought I'd help set people on the right path. If you have any advice you think I should add, let me know!

The most useful guide for me thus far was this video: [Age of Empires 2 The Conquerors: How To Rush Tutorial/Rush Defense by Ilumiknight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjj8qHKcBcQ).
It teaches a number of useful things:

* How to get your economy going quickly. **Your town center should never be idle.**
* Building your base in a defensive way
* How to properly handle a rush
* A number of different feudal age strategies
* And more!

Learning how to handle the early game well is a huge part of playing competitively. Having some sort of build order (a set plan on how you'll build up your economy and where you'll put your first villagers in the dark age) can help a lot. Knowing how to win in the late game is only useful if you can actually get there.

Some general advice, from one newbie to another, is below. Not all of it may scale up properly to expert-level play, but it can help get you off on the right foot:

**General:**

* Learn your hotkeys! One of the first things you should do in a game is hit HCCCC (selects your town center and queues 4 villagers). If you're having trouble with them, try learning just one new hotkey every game; you'll get the hang of it eventually.
* Use control groups. Hit ctrl+(number) to set a group, then press that number again to reselect that group. In the beginning of a match, you'll generally want to set your scout to 1 and your town center to 2. You could also select your TC with H, but that also focuses the camera on it. You can also quickly tap the number twice to center the camera on the control group.
* You can queue actions by shift-clicking. To build multiple buildings, hold shift while placing them. To set waypoints for moving, shift-right click each location you want to move to, then do a *final* right click without shift (this is different from other RTSes).
* When playing random map games, you can check the map type on the objectives screen (the button to open it is in the top-right corner). This is useful for e.g. checking if you're on a water map or not.

**Economy:**

* **Make sure your town center is never idle!** Always be building villagers or researching something. This is a good approach to make sure your economy builds fast enough. Generally, in a 200pop game, you'll probably end up wanting ~110-120 villagers, with military units for the rest. Adjust this to different situations, but particularly at lower levels of skill, having a better economy makes a *massive* difference.

* At the start of a game, move your scout in a spiral around your base. (Alternately, concentric circles if that's a better visual for you). Scout out your 8 sheep, where your large forests are, where your berries are, etc.
* Start the game by getting food from sheep and pumping out villagers. When you're about to run out of sheep (you have 8), send a villager out and bring a boar back. Watch the video I linked above - it shows hunting a boar. CAVEAT: You can hunt boar without Loom, but it's harder. Plus, Loom helps with scout harassment. If your game is lagging hard when you hunt boar, [follow this advice](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGZ1NY74g4I) to keep your villager alive.
* You want to assign your first 6 villagers to sheep (5 for Britons due to their 20% sheep gathering bonus), which is enough to keep a constant flow of villager production during the early stages of the game.
* Don't be afraid to move around your villagers. If you have a ton of wood but not enough food, take guys off trees and put them on farms (and vice-versa)
* Because it's not intuitive: If you have a bunch of villagers selected and right-click on one farm, they're smart enough to spread out evenly to nearby farms. (IIRC this was added in the game's expansion) Don't worry about micromanaging who goes where after a garrison.
* Build at LEAST 1 extra town center - preferably 2-3 more - as soon as you reach Castle Age. It takes a long time to make all the villagers (as well as research the gathering bonus techs!) you're going to need so these extra TCs are essential to getting a great economy up and running quickly.
* Practice getting to Feudal Age quickly. Need a go-to ""default"" Dark Age build? [Check out this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtukDHXy9GU). Knowing the early game well makes a huge difference in lower-level games, and makes all the difference in the world when you're getting rushed.
* When one or a group of vils build a farm, mining camp, lumbercamp, mill they automatically deposit whatever resource they're carrying. This only applies to *builders*, not to workers sent to other resource nodes. When a villager goes to a different resource, anything they have not deposited gets lost (this includes different sources of food!).

**Military/Defense**

* Learn what units counter what. Also pay attention to how much units cost: Knights are awesome and super strong in Castle Age, but they're also super expensive. Conversely, Pikemen (which counter them incredibly well) are dirt cheap and don't cost gold. Even if it takes you 60 skirmishers to kill 40 archers, they didn't cost any gold whereas your opponent's archers did.
* Build your base defensively. Use your buildings as walls and make paths that the enemies have to come through to get in. This will help a lot in holding off early attacks as players attacking early aren't trying to kill you, just harass you.
* Houses can make effective walls early game without costing stone. Plus, you'll be building them anyway, so why not use them defensively?
* Siege is actually super important in this game. In games like Warcraft III, siege units are really only needed if your opponent is turtling. In AOE2 however, non-siege units take forever to take out buildings.
* Related to the above: learn to love trebuchets. They deal massive damage and will outrange towers and castles. They're also expensive and weak, though, so protect them well with your army!
* Don't forget to learn blacksmith upgrades. They're huge. As a general rule, if you're focusing on archers, get the offensive techs first - they also add range. For melee/cavalry, I tend to get defense first
* Don't neglect your economy! Multitasking between economy management and military gets easier with time.
* Town Centers are actually a great defense. They're really, really hard to take down early in the game, and their arrows when units are garrisoned really pack a punch.
* When garrisoning villagers (eg in the town center while getting rushed), only garrison the ones that are threatened. Avoid hitting the town bell unless you have no other option, as it makes your economy grind to a halt
* Military units can be garrisoned in the building they're made in. When building them, set their rally flag to the building (ie select the building, and right-click it to tell units to go there when made). Once removed, though, they can't come out. If you're getting attacked and have no army, this is super useful as it lets you build up a small force and then release them rather then sending units one at a time to die to an army.
* Build multiple copies of the same military building, particularly later in the game. Three barracks can pump out Halberdiers last-minute to counter their cavalry much faster than one. It also lets you research upgrades without halting unit production.

**How to Keep Improving**

* Play! You can learn a lot by studying, but you also need to practice execution
* At first, focus on learning the early game well. Try to get your advancement times for each age down as you learn to handle your economy better. Playing the computer is good for this as you could play the first 20mins over and over if you're really having trouble getting build orders down.
* Record your games! Watch them later and scrutinize where you made mistakes
* Watch recorded games of other players, particularly really good ones. You'll learn a lot by watching them. That said, also keep in mind that some strategies an expert can pull off might be really really hard for a beginner to do (e.g. a monk rush), so don't copy them exactly. Watch what they're doing and try to reason why they make the decisions they do.

**Useful Links**

* [BBQTurkman's Youtube Tutorials](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL891DE10D2EFEA2E6) can help get you off to the right start
* [ZeroEmpire's Youtube Channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/ZeroEmpires) has a lot of awesome videos of AoE2 matches filled with commentary. [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OC5jndPODU) was one of my favorites (for entertainment, that is, not necessarily learning value)
* [AoCZone](http://aoczone.net/) is a pretty solid forum community. The site also has a *ton* of replays available for download.

Hopefully that helps!

Also, [feel free to add me on Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/madlordofmilk)! I'd be more than happy to play, and also go over games afterward and discuss what happened. I'm still a newbie, but I'm working on getting better!

**tl;dr** If you walk away with nothing else, though, remember this one: **Make sure your town center is never idle!** **Make sure your town center is never idle!** **Make sure your town center is never idle!**
It makes all the difference in the world when you're starting out.

I'm not going over any build orders or strategies. You can find plenty of recordings or videos online.

**General Problems**

* Always be making villagers (generally at least 100 villagers but it depends on pop cap, strategy, map, etc.).
* Villagers should never idle.
* Do everything with a sense of urgency, speed wins games.
* Don't needlessly waste units, if you can't win a battle then don't engage.
* Always be scouting.

**Really Noob Mistakes**

* DO NOT RING YOUR BELL. This halts your entire economy, if villagers are in danger then only send those villagers to garrison somewhere.
* Use your boars - every map has at least 2 boars near your TC. Reasearch loom and send a villager out to shoot the boar TWICE (if you shoot it once it will not chase) and then run back to your TC where you should have villagers ready to kill the boar.
* Most maps have at least 8 sheep/turkey near your TC. Find them and put (at least) your first 6 villagers on them.
* Research loom at some point.

**Noob Mistakes**

* Don't put all of your first farms around the mill. Your first few farms should be around your TC. This allows you to quickly garrison inside your TC for protection much quicker than if they were at the mill. You can eventually put farms around the mill once it is safe.
* You don't always need to make militia in the Dark/Feudal Age, especially if you aren't being attacked or planning on attacking.
* When you hit Castle Age, you should be looking to build more TCs to make more villagers.
* If you are on a water map then you generally want to build a dock at some point in the Dark ages.
* If you are booming^1 then wall appropriately.
* Use your blacksmith!
* Upgrade your lumberjacks speed as soon as you reach the next age. You should get the farm and mining upgrades at some point as well but not necessarily right away.

**Above Noob Mistakes**

* Economies win games, do not neglect them and make sure your villagers are always working.
* Don't let villagers needlessly die if you are being raided. Put defenses (i.e. castles, towers, pikes) and send the villagers in danger to somewhere safe.
* Don't let resources stockpile, if you have too much wood or food then move some of those villagers to something else.
* Don't let your army get out of position, you need to protect your economy. If I see your defenses out of position I will simply walk into your base and destroy your town.
* If you're in a team game and you beat an opponent then quickly move on to the next or help your teammates. You do not need to destroy every building and unit of someone who has quit.
* Lose to someone better than you? Watch the recording and see why they are better.

I wrote this pretty quickly and may add to it later. If you have any rebuttals for any of these points then I'd be glad to hear them.

Notes

^1 An economic boom (referred to as ""booming"") is when you are completely dedicating your effort to your economy. Your goal is to constantly pump out villagers as quickly as possible and then advance to Imperial Age. This is usually done by getting to Castle quickly and building lots of TCs.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1365795543.0,,,True,t3_1c7zwe,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1c7zwe/how_to_not_suck_at_aoe2/,

1366340530.0,122,self.aoe2,1cnl64,"Just finished the most epic AOE game I've ever played, had to tell ya'll [pic included]",mjb5406,129,7,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1cnl64/just_finished_the_most_epic_aoe_game_ive_ever/,"**TL;DR** - Wonder survived a valiant last effort bombard cannon attack with 31 hp and a cannonball in the air as time expired.

So the game's a 1v1v1 on some desert map (maybe Arabia? It was random), blue (me) as Franks, green (Jmielke) who's Byzantines and red (socks_mcgee) as Vikings. Game starts off, we're all doin well off the start, chatting and bemoaning our common lack of sheep. Castle age comes, they've both walled themselves in (green almost 2/3 of the map I'd find out at the end). Little fights here and there, nothing major. Heading to the Imperial age, I get ganged up on once, green gets ganged up on a few times, all the attacks are fended off pretty well.

So it becomes rather clear we've got ourselves a stalemate. I decide to pool my remaining resources and invest half my villagers and the requisite 1k wood gold and stone for a wonder (victory was standard). The wonder finishes without much hitch - I assumed they were massing their armies no doubt. About 20 'years' after I finish it, red sends about 100 Vikings towards my base in an attempt to get it, but I fended him off. That left green, who had been surprisingly quiet. He hadn't attacked me yet this game, but had fended off both my previous pretty substantial attacks rather well. 

So it gets to about 50 years left, and I see green coming in from the top. I'd been prepared for this, but his hand cannons were doing a number on me. On top of that, he'd built a forward castle complete with protecting bombard towers, so my troops couldn't wade too far out. I'm still fighting him off though, all the way down to 10 years. At this point I've just spamming troops towards the wonder, but his men have begun to outnumber mine. As the time ticks under 10 years, he says fuck it and goes for the wonder with everything he's got - camels, swordsmen, and most importantly, bombard cannons. We all begin our gg's with about 5 years left when we notice his cannons are actually doing a number on the wonder. The smile on my face fades away slowly as I realize he's got a legitimate shot at actually finishing my wonder and subsequently decking me.

2 years hits and the wonders below half hp and dropping fast. My guys can't get to the cannons fast enough and I'm swearing at my computer screen so loud and fast I swear I made up a few new words. As the timer hits 0, I look down and see 31 hp - and the time is up! With 31 hp left on my wonder I'd survived! [As time expired you can see a cannonball IN THE AIR on the way to finish off the wonder!](http://imgur.com/OfqRJea) I couldn't believe my luck. We all agreed it was the best finish we'd ever been a part of.

Title really says it all. If you want games with low pings, read the game list **from the bottom up** until you find a game you like. AoE2 HD sorts all the multiplayer games by the host's proximity to you, but does so the wrong way around: the closer the host is to you, the further DOWN the list he will be.

Yes, this is counter-intuitive. I bet the devs intended this to be the other way around (having games whose hosts are close to you at the top of the list) but messed up the sorting (ping descending instead of ascending).

Anyways, spread the word please, so we can all have lag-free games. I have a short text explaining this issue saved in a text file. I then copy/paste whenever someone with ping &gt;150 joins my game and have gotten tons of good, thankful feedback. Keep it nice though. The more people know about this the better.

Here's my text for you to use:

I'm Peter Freese, one of the programmers involved in developing the HD update to Age of Kings. Because my background is primarily in 3D graphics, I was given the responsibility of updating the game's rendering engine. We had decided that one of the major goals of the update was to improve the look of the renderer by taking advantage of modern hardware. The renderer, which looked great when the game was originally released, was showing its age. This presented some interesting and unique challenges.

AoK was released at a time when many users did not have 32-bit color graphics hardware. Except for a few earlier adopters with 3D graphics cards, most consumers' display cards were limited to 16-bit ""high color"" mode or 8-bit palette mode. Age of Kings used 8-bit palette mode - each pixel was one of only 256 colors -- which meant that it ran on a broad range of consumer machines. In order to do things which are rather simple with modern hardware, such as changing the shade of an object on screen to make it look shadowed or fogged, developers at the time had to resort to special tricks involving look up tables, special palettes, and hand optimized assembly routines. Furthermore, because hardware could only use one palette at a time, special colors had to be reserved for drawing Windows' GUI elements.

http://i.imgur.com/5nDo1W0.jpg

*Early terrain rendering prototype showing 3D mesh wireframe.*

Switching to 32-bit graphics was complicated by the fact that the original art assets to the game had been lost to time. We decided that the best way to update the render was to replace parts of it, but leave other parts using the original shipping art assets (which still looked great). The end result was a hybrid system with new terrain, water, and lighting, while still using the original system for rendering units, buildings, and trees.
Another goal with the update was to improve the compatibility with modern operating systems and hardware. AoK utilized technology called DirectDraw to perform 2D graphics on Windows. DirectDraw has been deprecated since 2000, and as a result there is little to no support on recent OS versions. The game has been updated to use DirectX 9 (which is broadly supported), and runs seamlessly in windowed and fullscreen mode on virtually any display resolution.

*These screenshots illustrate the soft filtering and noise for terrain lighting.*

Working on AoK was great fun, and it's tremendous to see so much support for the game from the community and Microsoft. I'm proud of the work we did, and hope you enjoy the update!

**Next patch** is currently unknown as to when it will be released but they are 100% going to come out with a patch. Everything is **current as of 12:40PM EST 4/12/13**.

* **Dev Update 4/11/13 @8:45PM EST** (Pretty much nothing new other than them confirming that a patch will eventually come and that they are focusing on performance issues like frame rate. They have also recognised some of the features that we as a community have expressed interest in.) http://steamcommunity.com/app/221380/discussions/0/828935672791332702/

* Latest DirectX Update Here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35

Currently from what I have gathered from Steam Chat that the AOE II HD Dev team is currently working on is as follows:

* Priority is on issues affecting game performance
* ~~Windows XP,~~ For the most part this has been fixed (if you still have issues check to make sure your cpu/gpu supports Direct X 9.0c
* Speed,
* **FPS**, This seems to be #1 priority now for people with high end systems getting terrible frame rate
* Crash in quick search,  This is #2 priority atm it seems
* Lag Issues 

Other related issues they are looking into are as follows:

* Workshop Content disapeering after playing one time
* Achievements not unlocking
* Improvements to the Lobby/Matchmaking
* Out of Sync errors
* ~~Age of Empires 2 HD ""Unable to initialize graphics system. Device may not meet minimum specs. Subcode=3""~~ This error seems to be caused by your hardware not supporting the shader model needed. Check Below.

They do not have an eta on when these fixes may be coming. Currently, their priority is to fix the FPS related issues first which is being tested atm.

**Below this point there are some fixes for the more common problems:**

If you are having problems even starting the game, ensure your OS is up to date and that you have the latest drivers for your GPU as well as a **Direct X 9.0c Capable GPU** . **Update the game** and if the problem persists then you will just have to wait until the Devs get back to work which I'm sure they will be doing considering it is launch day. 

* White screen will usually indicate that your GPU is only DX 9.0b compliant (If you have this error try, ""-nostartup"" without quotes, no guarantees this will work.

* ""Could not initialize graphics system. Make sure that your video card and driver are compatible with DirectDraw."" This error seems to occur if you on Windows XP SP2, make sure you update your system to Service Pack 3. (This could be wrong so take it with a grain of salt) A possible fix for DirectDraw error would be to run Windows Server 2008R2. *I can not confirm this but from what I hear it is possible so try at your own leisure*

(Unconfirmed) Possible fix for when you launch the game and then it quickly exits (Launcher doesn't appear):

* Go into AoE2HD's folder, and there should be AoK HD.exe and Launcher.exe
* Delete launcher.exe (back it up somewhere just in case) and rename AoK HD.exe ""launcher.exe"" instead.
* That makes it so the game loads without the launcher,

In Game Menu is blank: Try disabling scaling on high DPI settings (please confirm below if it worked)

* Start Menu &gt; Computer &gt; Steam &gt; Steamapps &gt; Common &gt; Age2HD &gt; Right Click AoK HD &gt; Properties &gt; Compatibility &gt; Check ""Disable display scaling on high DPI settings &gt; Apply

Fix for Crash before loading screen: (This may or may not work, please report back if it does) Follow steps below

* Start singleplayer game
* Disable the statistics with the Button above the minimap (Shortcut: F4)
* Quit the game completly!
* Start the game again
* Join a multiplayergame
* Don't turn statistics on during the game

Launcher doesn't look right, there are white boxes all over the place: Check Below

* This is because you have your DPI set incorrectly: 
* Right click on the Desktop
* Click Screen resolution
* Click the link ""Make text larger or smaller""
* Select either 100% (recommended!) or 150%
* Click Apply

Mouse does not stay confined to your screen (This is caused by having multiple monitors). Fix below

* Simply disable one of the monitors
* Right click on desktop and select screen resolution
* Next to multiple displays, select show only desktop 1

Hotkey Fix: (**Confrimed**) Fix below (If you edit your hotkeys you'll need to move the .hki file again)

* When starting a multiplayer game, AoE2HD forgets the custom hotkey settings and reverts to default until opening the hotkey menu which can be very annoying considering how important the first few seconds of the game can be. Luckily there is a simple fix: copy player1.hki from \Age2HD\savegame to \Age2HD. (by default, Age2HD should be in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common)

**This may fix some of the above issues.**

* Update your game by verifying the integrity of game cache by right clicking on the AOE II HD and selecting properties, then under local files you will find it. Make sure you are not in the beta anymore as it will not update to the correct patch.

**Multiplayer**

* Until everyone updates their game files during multiplayer, games will go out of sync (or their patch just doesn't work). **Make sure you are updated! Everyone needs to update, not just XP users** The latest patch that came out was around 10:30PM EST 4/8/13. This latest patch will not have a 2.XX because it was not a patch but a general fix.

Comment from JesseBright, an engineer working on AOE II HD in my previous post:

* I also apologize for being unable to provide official details on the future of AOE II:HD. I am an engineer and I will never be cleared to speculate about upcoming patches or release dates or anything like that. If this were one of our self published titles, like Defense Grid, it would be different, but because this is a Microsoft title it would be extremely inappropriate for me to leak information about what may be coming in the future. All I can say is that the work this community has been doing is easily worth $100k in private testing and that I read this subreddit multiple times a day.

**Next patch** is currently unknown as to when it will be released. Everything is **current as of 11:06AM EST 4/11/13**. Apparently they had a meeting today that went good, I can only assume that this means there are no huge underlying problems that will prevent fixes going out for many of the common issues/bugs.

**Next patch** is currently unknown as to when it will be released but they are 100% going to come out with a patch. Everything is **current as of 9:00PM EST 4/12/13**.

* [Latest DirectX Update Here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35):

Currently from what I have gathered from Steam Chat that the AOE II HD Dev team is currently working on is as follows:

* Priority is on issues affecting game performance
* ~~Windows XP,~~ For the most part this has been fixed (if you still have issues check to make sure your cpu/gpu supports Direct X 9.0c
* Speed,
* **FPS**, This seems to be #1 priority now for people with high end systems getting terrible frame rate
* Crash in quick search,  This is #2 priority atm it seems
* Lag Issues 

Other related issues they are looking into are as follows:

* Workshop Content disapeering after playing one time
* Achievements not unlocking
* Improvements to the Lobby/Matchmaking
* Out of Sync errors
* ~~Age of Empires 2 HD ""Unable to initialize graphics system. Device may not meet minimum specs. Subcode=3""~~ This error seems to be caused by your hardware not supporting the shader model needed. Check Below.

They do not have an eta on when these fixes may be coming. Currently, their priority is to fix the FPS related issues first which is being tested atm.

**Below this point there are some fixes for the more common problems:**

If you are having problems even starting the game, ensure your OS is up to date and that you have the latest drivers for your GPU as well as a **Direct X 9.0c Capable GPU** . **Update the game** and if the problem persists then you will just have to wait until the Devs get back to work which I'm sure they will be doing considering it is launch day. 

* White screen will usually indicate that your GPU is only DX 9.0b compliant (If you have this error try, ""-nostartup"" without quotes, no guarantees this will work.

* ""Could not initialize graphics system. Make sure that your video card and driver are compatible with DirectDraw."" This error seems to occur if you on Windows XP SP2, make sure you update your system to Service Pack 3. (This could be wrong so take it with a grain of salt) A possible fix for DirectDraw error would be to run Windows Server 2008R2. *I can not confirm this but from what I hear it is possible so try at your own leisure*

(Unconfirmed) Possible fix for when you launch the game and then it quickly exits (Launcher doesn't appear):

* Go into AoE2HD's folder, and there should be AoK HD.exe and Launcher.exe
* Delete launcher.exe (back it up somewhere just in case) and rename AoK HD.exe ""launcher.exe"" instead.
* That makes it so the game loads without the launcher,

In Game Menu is blank: Try disabling scaling on high DPI settings (please confirm below if it worked)

* Start Menu &gt; Computer &gt; Steam &gt; Steamapps &gt; Common &gt; Age2HD &gt; Right Click AoK HD &gt; Properties &gt; Compatibility &gt; Check ""Disable display scaling on high DPI settings &gt; Apply

Fix for Crash before loading screen: (This may or may not work, please report back if it does) Follow steps below

* Start singleplayer game
* Disable the statistics with the Button above the minimap (Shortcut: F4)
* Quit the game completly!
* Start the game again
* Join a multiplayergame
* Don't turn statistics on during the game

Launcher doesn't look right, there are white boxes all over the place: Check Below

* This is because you have your DPI set incorrectly: 
* Right click on the Desktop
* Click Screen resolution
* Click the link ""Make text larger or smaller""
* Select either 100% (recommended!) or 150%
* Click Apply

Mouse does not stay confined to your screen (This is caused by having multiple monitors). Fix below

* Simply disable one of the monitors
* Right click on desktop and select screen resolution
* Next to multiple displays, select show only desktop 1

Hotkey Fix: (**Confrimed**) Fix below (If you edit your hotkeys you'll need to move the .hki file again)

* When starting a multiplayer game, AoE2HD forgets the custom hotkey settings and reverts to default until opening the hotkey menu which can be very annoying considering how important the first few seconds of the game can be. Luckily there is a simple fix: copy player1.hki from \Age2HD\savegame to \Age2HD. (by default, Age2HD should be in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common)

**This may fix some of the above issues.**

* Update your game by verifying the integrity of game cache by right clicking on the AOE II HD and selecting properties, then under local files you will find it. Make sure you are not in the beta anymore as it will not update to the correct patch.

**Multiplayer**

* Until everyone updates their game files during multiplayer, games will go out of sync (or their patch just doesn't work). **Make sure you are updated! Everyone needs to update, not just XP users** The latest patch that came out was around 10:30PM EST 4/8/13. This latest patch will not have a 2.XX because it was not a patch but a general fix.

How to play on a different region:

* In steam, select View &gt; Settings &gt; Downloads + Cloud &gt; Download Region &gt; Select Region

Comment from JesseBright, an engineer working on AOE II HD in my previous post:

* I also apologize for being unable to provide official details on the future of AOE II:HD. I am an engineer and I will never be cleared to speculate about upcoming patches or release dates or anything like that. If this were one of our self published titles, like Defense Grid, it would be different, but because this is a Microsoft title it would be extremely inappropriate for me to leak information about what may be coming in the future. All I can say is that the work this community has been doing is easily worth $100k in private testing and that I read this subreddit multiple times a day.

My name is Jesse Bright and I was the programmer selected to perform the multiplayer update of Age of Empires II HD. We began work on this portion of the code with two main classes of goals:

Primary Goals

- Remove the older and deprecated DirectPlay layer and replace it with a current network communication framework (p2p session management and message authentication, robust NAT traversal, etc.)

- Implement basic matchmaking functionality for quick matches, lobby browsing, and friend invitations

Stretch Goals

- Implement advanced matchmaking features such as skill based ranking

- Allow mod community support and make it easy for users to share mods

- Implement stats, leaderboards and achievements for the first time

- Introduce a current generation anti-cheat system, as suitable for a popular multiplayer game.



Releasing the game on Steam with Steamworks libraries helped make these features fit within our timeframe. Not only did Steamworks provide a base of functionality which matched our goals, but additionally the team here at Hidden Path has a lot of experience working with Valve and the Steam platform itself. This experience would prove to be very important, as the challenges we were to face during modernization would prove much more difficult than simply plugging in a new back end service.

When Age of Empires II was written 14 years ago, there were few alternatives that could match the functionality of DirectPlay and MSN Gaming Zone. With such an established architecture the developers at Ensemble had little cause to write Age of Empires II with the thought that all of its functionality would one day need to be replaced. As a result, when we received the source code to Age we discovered that the Direct Play and Zone architectures were intertwined with the game logic itself. This presented us with our first difficult problem – should we invest the time in extricating the logic which was dependent on those architectures or should we leave things in place and simply emulate the old behavior?

In the end, we decided to perform a clean break from the old code and I am very pleased that we did. The original core networking class in Age of Empires II was a massive 13,000 line piece of engineering. The fundamental architecture originally designed by Mark Terrano was brilliant, but over the course of development, many other programmers had hacked in their own bits and pieces of code. I was overwhelmed, so I did the only sensible thing that I could think of – I tracked down every piece of networking logic and injected logging, on screen messages, and forced stops. What began to emerge through this process was a real understanding of what exactly was going on at the lower levels of the multiplayer code.

Those first few weeks were harrowing and often confusing, but far more quickly than I had first thought, I was ready to draw a line in the sand. I had a map of where I was going to abstract out the functionality and interface it with the new back end services. A few short months after that we stepped back and looked at what we had – a fast, stable, fairly well understood replication of the original high level functionality, all running through Steam. On top of that, during the same period, our amazing internal test team (Lead by Mark Shoemaker and Jon Lee) deployed a set of automated testing tools that are the best I have seen. Regardless of whether I was home programming late at night, or in the office chasing down an obscure synchronization error, I had the ability to summon up automated opponents on remote machines. At that point, with our primary goals met and the security of knowing that we would be able to test out anything new with hundreds of hours' worth of automated multiplayer matches, we were able to set out at a sprint adding in new functionality and knocking out our stretch goals.

I think you are going to be extremely pleased with how things have turned out. The new matchmaking system delivers what you would expect from a modern game. You can filter by player skill, game type, map size, etc. There is a global ranking system and 190 new online and offline achievements. We have done our best to ensure that the Steam Workshop integration is smooth and that it will be of great value to the big name modders as well as the amateur map and scenario designers. For obvious reasons I cannot reveal details on the new anti-cheat system, but I will say that I had a fun time exploring existing cheats as well as planning for the future.

ANALYSESESESE IN HISTORYRRYRYRRY

**CHANGES TO THE NEW CIVS**

TODAY I'M DOING SOMETHING REALY FAST BY ANALYSITIZING THE NEW BONUSES AND TECHS AND CHANGES THE OLD CIVS HAVE BEFORE I START GO HAM (HARD AS A MOTHERFUCKER) AT THE NEW CIVS.

[FOR THOSE NOT IN THE KNOW HERE'S THE CHANGELOG STRAIGHT FROM THE FORGOTTEN EMPIRES DEVS THEMSELVES](http://www.forgottenempires.net/features/changelog/)

**[AZTECS: MEXICA UP, TENOCH-TOWN DOWN. WEST SIIIIDE](http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/uj5d1/viva_la_raza_historicity_vs_gameplay_day_17_the/)**

* Free Loom removed

This is more about balance than historical accuracy and there doesn't seem to be a particular idea the Aztecs free Loom in the first place. This is related to the next bonus...

* Start with +50 gold

In The Conquerors, Aztecs had Loom free and started with the set amount of gold. In this game, they have extra gold but still have to make the choice all the other civs have to make about when to research Loom. However this does present a very dualistic, Azteccy choice: will you sacrifice the durability of your Villagers and leave them vulnerable to Wolves and other Drushes in order to go for your own 8-man (you'd mine the extra 10 gold) Drush? Will the Nahua peoples (not quite Aztec/Mexica in the Dark Age) wrest a homeland from the complacent and stagnant Mesoamerican tribes by force?

* UNIQUE UNIT: Jaguars Warriors: +1 pierce armor

The Jags in The Conquerors didn't even have base pierce armor! This meant that they really sucked against archers (while Eagle sucked against melee). This is for game balance but also very historically accurate because the Jags would have had fine arrow-resistance thanks to the cotton armor prevalent in Mesoamerica.

* UNIQUE TECH: Atlatl: Skirmishers +1 Attack, +1 Range

Alright so the Aztecs finally get their signature weapon! The Atlatl is almost a sling type weapon that fires a dart, shorter than a spear longer than an arrow. It's very simple and manages to shoot darts with almost as much foot poundage as a longbow. It's very simple and very powerful, and has a faster firing rate than a bow. The Atlatl Unique Tech is very similar to Garland Wars; it's essentially a Blacksmith tech at the Castle, costing Food and Gold except this one is available in the Castle Age and it makes your Castle Elite Skirmishers as strong as an Elite Skirmisher in the Imperial Age. EDIT: Skirmishers have never benefited from Thumb Ring, so this is a pretty good tech. Aztec Archers lack Ring Archer Armor so their ESkirms vs other ESkirms are not as effective but +1 attack and range is alot for Skirmishers and makes them better in other situations.

**[BRITONS: JUNIAH SPESH JUNIAH JUNIAH JUNIAH JUNIAH SPESH ONE POUND AND FIFTY PENCE FIFTY PENCE FIFTY PENCE](http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/r7fe4/hameplay_vs_gistoricity_day_9_the_britons/)**

[AN' MAYONNAISE IS TWENTY PENCE MORE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s760qkHGfG4)

* UNIQUE TECH: Warwolf: Trebuchets have a broader splash damage.

Warwolf was the name of a huge Trebuchet that Edward Longshanks used in the defense of Stirling Castle against the Scots, led by William “BRAAAAAAVEEEHEEEAAAAAAARTT” Wallace. I'm not sure where else it was used. Anyway, Trebs used to have a very teeny-tiny splash damage but this gives them a pretty wide area of effect. Thanks to this tech, you will probably win Treb wars as the Britons, even against the Huns. And thanks to the British Siege Engineers, I think these are the best Trebs in the game after the Japanese.

Now most of the new Unique Techs are available in the Castle Age but this one would make no sense there. Thus another change has happened

* UNIQUE TECH: Yeoman: Now available in Castle Age

Yowza, now we've got +2 Range for our Archers in the Castle Age over everybody else's Archers. Your regular Crossbowmen, with Fletching and Bodkin Arrow, now have 9 Range in the Castle Age. Longbowmen have 10 Range. This is a pretty nice boost to have, no doubt. As far as it's historicity...there's a mind-blowing amount of historicity here because Yeoman used to be the word to describe those minor lords who could afford horses and full suits of armor while knights used to be the word for his trainees who bathed him and rubbed oil on his...armor. Also the British were arguably at their strongest at the end of the Castle Age when Plantagenet Dynasty created the “Angevin Empire,” holding half of Ireland, Acquitaine, Brittany, Normandy, Flanders, and Toulouse and having Scotland, Wales, and the rest of Ireland as vassals. And they held those lands with Keeps that had +2 Attack power. I guess.

* UNIQUE UNIT: Longbowman -1 creation time

This is probably to encourage the players to actually use Longbowmen. Most players would opt for Arbalests by virtue of their creation from the Archery Range. Longbows are ideal but they come from the Castle and are harder to mass.

* DOCKS: get Cannon Galleon

There was no reason for the British to lack Cannon Galleons starting with Age of Kings but now they get it. Now their Cannon Galleons need to somehow be better than Spanish Cannon Galleons in order to recreate the Battle of Gravelines...

* SIEGE WORKSHOP: get Heavy Scorpions

The British have always been a premiere user of siege tech in Europe and it was a wonder why their Siege wasn't better in previous iterations of Age of Empires 2. Well, now they get a fully upgraded siege weapon in the Scorpion. You can pretend that these guys are just humongous Longbows mounted on a wheeled frame.

**[BYZANTINES: I'M LIKE A MEDIEVAL WOLVERINE MADE OF BYZANTIUM!](http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/q253f/civ_gameplay_vs_history_day_3_the_byzantines/)**

* UNIQUE TECH: Greek Fire: Fire Ships +1 Range

If you're name is not Galleon, you are an underused ship. The idea behind this is to make Fire Ships more useable for the civ that invented them. So Byzantines get the best Fire Ships in the game (which isn't still saying too much), and a range bonus makes more sense than the attack speed bonus. Pretty historically accurate.

**[CELTS: THEY LOVE FUCKING SHEEP](http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/u2eg9/faster_than_a_trade_cog_less_armor_than_a_gothic/)**

* UNIQUE TECH: Strongholds: Castles fire +20% faster

I would have named this Tower House or something, because Tower Houses are pretty Celtic. Strongholds gives the Celts some defensive power but it kind of feels like a bit of a throwaway tech. You're probably not going to stuff any Archers in there considering how terrible Celtic archers are. The Celts are already a pretty powerful civ as it is, though, with one of the best economic techs for the early and midgame and a ridiculous Siege army for the late. The Celts were fierce in their defense of the homeland (it's kind of their defining trait) and Scottish Archers were way better than they are depicted in AoE2 so maybe this is a reference to that.

* UNIQUE TECH: Furor Celtica: Siege Weapons now get +40% HPs, down from +50%

Some felt the Celts were overpowered with Furor Celtica (suck it Kevin Garnett!) so this is a welcome change. The current Slavic civ suspiciously hits a few of the same niches as the Celts do (they're an Infantry and Siege civ) and have cheaper Siege. Normally cheaper is better and they are 15% cheaper. However, Celtic Siege has 40% more HPs and fire 20% faster and that's all you need out of Siege Weapons so they will be better in the Imperial Age. I'm still kind of wary of the Slavic civ in comparison but for now, this is the case.

**[CHINESE: LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS BITCH](http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/qan78/epic_civ_analyses_in_historrreeehhhh_day_5_the/)**

* Town Centers +5 LoS

This is a neat little bonus intended to give you a good start at the beginning of the game. The Chinese Villager bonus was a double-edged sword if you couldn't find your Sheep and Berries early but now you can. You could say that this is jaw-droppingly historical because the Chinese always had a pretty firm idea of what land belonged to them (until very recently, ahem). Compare to Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire: that far away island called Britannia you wanted to take the wife and kids to see has suddenly fallen off the radar and the Berbers want the far shore of your lake back.

* UNIQUE TECH: Great Wall (walls +30% Hps)

This isn't quite the Byzantine +40% in the Imperial Age but it matches them in the Castle Age. I dunno, I would have made it 40% so that it exceeded the Byzantines FREE bonus in the Castle Age but that's just me. This is obviously a reference to the Great Wall of China but Chinese fortifications in general were top notch.

**[FRANKS: HOH HOH WE FREANCH ARE BETTAR THAN DE REST OF ZE YOOROPEANS HOH HOH FREANCH IS ZE LANGUAGE OF SEX HOH HOH HOH HOHO HOHO HOHHH HOHOHO HOHOHOHHOH OHOHOHHHOHOHOHOH HHHOOHOHOH OH MY](http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/pwcd7/civ_gameplay_and_history_analysis_day_1_the_franks/)**

* Foragers work +25% faster

The Franks were quite one-dimensional in AoE2 and didn't really have too much OOMPH. This is a small change that gives adds to their somewhat lackluster economic bonus, the free Farm upgrades. There isn't a whole lot of historical accuracy here as all civs went foraging when food was short. It does parallel the Britons pretty well...

* UNIQUE UNIT: Throwing Axemen (non-Elite): missile delay -2 (frames?), Elite Throwing Axemen research costs -100 gold

Castle Age Throwing Axemen fire faster now. This is pretty nice because that makes sense as an advantage of the throwing axe in real life. It didn't need to be drawn like a Bow. This also makes the Franks a bit stronger overall. The cheaper Elite TAxemen research is quite nice because it's very hard to get out fully upgraded Paladins AND fully upgrades TAxemen, which kind of sucks because the Franks are so one-dimensional.

* UNIQUE TECH: Chivalry: Stables work +40% faster

Grab me by the ballsack and call me a monkey's anus this is pretty badass. AND IT'S A CASTLE AGE TECH. This makes the Frankish Castle Age pretty boss (and the Imperial Age, too). This Tech is vagina destroyingly historical. In real life many historians theorize that there were too many Knights in France and not enough land to go around. That's why most Crusader armies were made up of Frenchmen to the point that the Muslims called all Europeans “Franks.” So this is very historically accurate, especially if you consider the Crusades to be in the timeframe of the Castle Age. Frankish Light Cavalry was never notable in the Middle Ages but shit, think about how anti-Monk the Franks are now. Thanks to certain changes, like the Saracens Madrasah tech, people will probably use more Monks and the Franks can kill all of the heathen Mahomeddans! ...at least until they give up and go home in the Imperial Age. This also makes a nice parallel to the cousin of the Franks, the Goths.

* BARRACKS: get Squires

The reason why this was left out in the first place was probably because Ensemble Studios thought that the Throwing Axemen would be too powerful with their ranged attack. Their range is kind of pitiful so they actually need to be a bit faster to compensate for the terribleness of the French Archers. Also, the Franks' thing was Knights and they didn't have Squires? WTF Ensemble Studios!

**[GOTHS: THEY'LL FUCK YOU LIKE ANIMALS](http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/riyad/gameplay_vs_historicititiciticiticiticity_day_10/)**

* Infantry cost -35% starting in Feudal Age.

Wait a goddamn minute, didn't this use to stagger? And wasn't this only 25% at it's max? ...I'm kind of wondering what's going on here. Were the Goths a bad civ? This is according to the in-game tech tree, anyway. There's no mention of it on the FE website. EDIT: It turns out that Infantry have always cost -35% it's just that the in-game tech tree was completely wrong.

* UNIQUE TECH: Perfusion: Barracks work +100% faster

I haven't had time in the past few days to crunch the numbers, but is this really 100% faster? Uh at any rate, really fast Barracks spamming Infantry is a cool gameplay idea but not one I'd say is quite authentic to the Goths but that's Ensemble Studios' thing and not any fault of the Forgotten Empires team. Goths were marveled at by Romans for their light hair and skin, and tallness and fierceness. “Undisciplined” Gothic Hordes managed to defeat “disciplined” Roman Legions. I put “undisciplined” in quotations because the Goths had been in contact with Roman warfare for a long time and I also put “disciplined” in quotations because the Legions were mostly a shadow of their former selves by late Antiquity. But it's good characterization and AoE2 gets rampaging Gothic Infantry and Forgotten Empires magnifies that. EDIT: The stats for Perfusion has always been 100% faster creation time. Again the in-game tech tree was wrong.

* DEFENSES: Treadmill Crane removed

This is pretty historically accurate and it might be necessary for gameplay purposes, now that Infantry are even cheaper.

**[HUNS: I FUCK BITCHES SMOKE WEED ALL DAY YA'LL CAN CALL ME PIMPTILLA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/qn17k/its_that_time_again_civ_vs_history_analysis_day_7/)**

* Cavalry Archers cost -15/20%, down from 25/30%

Oh thank fucking Cysion.

* UNIQUE UNIT: Tarkans (non-Elite): +10 Hps

Well it makes sense to make the Tarkans stronger earlier in the game, because the Huns weren't around for the Imperial Age (or even the Castle Age for that matter...or technically the Feudal Age).

* UNIQUE TECH: Marauders: Tarkans created at the Stable

This is x-games level of historical accuracy because I don't think the Huns really had Castles and, being nomads, never had much use for them. There's supposedly a Castle in Aquilea built by Attila so that he could watch Aquilea burn but that's it. It's more historical for a 20% faster Stable to just sort of pop up on the outskirts of a town and then all of a sudden dudes with torches and wearing animal hides come and destroy everything.

* DEFENSES: removed Treadmill Crane, removed Stone Walls

These changes are also testicle explodingly historically accurate. The Huns didn't have goddamn Stone Walls they were goddamn nomads and they didn't give too shits about Treadmill Cranes and engineering and medical advances and indoor plumbing. Fuck that we hit things with torches! And if I were Bleda the Hun, I'd fire invisible arrows from my bow at point-blank range, that's what I'd do!

* DOCKS: removed Cannon Galleons

The Huns never possessed a Navy, much less gunpowder weapons. And of course in AoE2, they end up possessing a pretty good Navy thanks to their housing bonus saving tons of Wood and the whole population thing. They end up being pretty good Grushers so this took away some of their Imperial power.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1359456607.0,,Blank,True,t3_15o5ek,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/15o5ek/your_mother_is_gameplay_vs_history_all_of_the_old/,

**WHAT IS THE POINT**

Aiight playa, the point of this topic is for me to historically nerd out about the way this game was designed, and how it pertains to history, and get everybody else's input. The main hook of this game is that the playable factions are based on history, so I'm going to perform a little reverse engineering and figure out how the game designers made their design choices.

Keep in mind, some of the choices were made based on fun; the most obvious example is the War Elephants, who weren't really used by the Persians by the Middle Ages but are so cool that they were included. Another example is balance; imagine how horrifying and unfun it would be to play as the Aztecs or Mayans minus siege weapons.

But alot of choices were made on history, and I'm going to point them out.

**A SMALL TIDBIT OF FRANKISH HISTORY**

The Franks in Age of Empires 2 represent the Kingdom of France, the tribe of Franks, as well as some related nations like the Burgundian and the Normans. Occasionally, the Franks are used to represent Italian factions, as well.

The Franks were a Germanic tribe who eventually formed a kingdom that was technically under Roman Imperial jurisdiction, but really independent. They were eventually Latinized, converting to Christianity and adopting a Latin language that fused elements of their Germanic one with Latin. The Franks in AoE2 are thus related to the Goths, distantly related to the Vikings, and can be considered precursors of the Teutons, and their relation to the Teutons is pretty interesting.

The Frankish Empire formed by Charlemagne was divided for his 3 sons after Charlemagne died into East Francia, Middle Francia, and West Francia. West Francia would evolve into the Kingdom of France (and eventually into modern-day France) while East Francia under Louis the German would become the German speaking Holy Roman Empire, the nation the Teutons are based on. The land known as Middle Francia would be fought over by Germany and France for about a thousand-ish years, up until the World War era.

**THE FRANKISH BONUSES**

* Castles cost -25%

France doesn't quite have the most castellation in one area of Europe, but France's Castles are still famous. This is really more of a Norman bonus and I'll explain why: the Normans were Scandinavians who settled in France and became subject to the crown of France. They eventually set up Kingdoms in Sicily, Greece, the Middle East and most famously in England. The consolidated their holdings by building massive fortresses, and the Castle cost reduction bonus reflects the far flung Castles of common origin. The French, however, ARE responsible for the creation of Castles for the Crusaders in the Middle East.

* Knights +20% HPs

The Franks in AoE2 have strong Infantry, but they also have strong Cavalry. The Franks, like most Germanic tribes, used lots of foot soldiers while the elites would ride to the battle on horses, but not during battle. Eventually they switched to a true heavy cavalry force during the reign of Charlemagne and they used armored cavalry well past the timeframe of AoE2 (AoE3 has Cuirassiers!). Charlemagne had many military successes thanks to the power, speed, and durability of the Knight. The Franks had many conflicts with many horse-cultures from Central Asia including the Huns and the Avars, who brought the stirrup into Europe. The stirrup allows the rider to actually stay on the saddle while smashing into somebody with a lance, which is one key component of the Middle Ages heavy cavalry style. The other component is the personal and horse armor, which the Franks adopted from the Romans, who adopted armored cavalry from the Persians and Iranian tribes such as the Sarmatians, who they employed as mercenaries. Combine the barbarian and Roman influences, and you get the medieval Knight...or the Franks themselves.

* Farm upgrades free (requires Mill)

Modern-day France is a very fertile land full of plains and rivers and stuff. Known as Gaul in Roman times, it was a bread basket for the Roman Empire and obviously valuable enough land for lots of Germanic tribes to want to wrest control of it from the Romans and Celts who inhabited it. Speaking of Celts, I have some interesting info on them but that will be for another time. Today, France is the second largest exporter and the sixth biggest producer of food in the world, and the EU's biggest agricultural center. Thus the Franks get a Farming bonus. It's not as good as the Teutons' bonus, which further shows the sisterhood of the two civilizations, but that might be for the sake of balance. The Franks didn't actually discover the Horse Collar or the Heavy Plow or Crop Rotation, though.

* TEAM BONUS: Knights +2 LoS

There is no historical basis for the Knight LoS bonus. The heavy helmets could be pretty hard to see through, if anything. Maybe the LoS bonus represents a Knight errant, who goes across the land finding damsels to rescue and wrongs to right. With a longer line of sight, he can see injustices from a longer distance.

To summarize, we have strong Knights who rule the Farming peasants from their Castles. Feudalism, mofuggah!

**THE FRANKISH TECH TREE**

* UNIQUE UNIT: Throwing Axeman

The Franks were renowned for their dudes who would chuck Axes at you. AoE2 has dudes throwing big ass axes at their enemies which is pretty freaking cool, but not quite accurate. The throwing axe was more like a hatchet, a small axehead with a long handle. At any rate, the Frankish unique unit represents the strong infantry that the Franks used as a result of their Germanic origin. The Throwing Axeman in game complements the Paladin extremely well, and vice versa. They each perform well against each other's counters, which might be a reference to Charlemagne's successful army. Earlier Frankish infantry armies were meh, and later Frankish heavy cavalry-centered armies were dominated by the British but the combined armies allowed for the height of Frankish power. The Vikings and Goths would also throw axes at guys, too, but the Franks were most famous for them because...

* UNIQUE TECH: Francisca

~~The Franks take their name from the throwing axe they use, the Francisca.~~ Actually, the Franks were so famous that the Francisca is named after them. While this may be pretty inconsequential, if you make a scenario where a Viking, Gothic, or Teuton civ has Throwing Axemen, none of them will have the extra range like the Franks. wink wink.

* BARRACKS: no Eagle Warriors, no Squires

The Franks have access to 3 Infantry units; the regular joe and easy to create Champion, the balling Throwing Axeman, and the anti-cavalry Halberdier. The Franks always had Infantry, of course, but they had problems with archers. So, they get a little bit more variety in their non-archers. Due to the prevalence of Heavy Cavalry in France, the Swiss, the Dutch, the Belgians, the Burgundians, and other small nations around France innovated massed Pike formations to counter Heavy Cavalry, so it definitely makes sense for the Franks to get Halberdiers. The Franks don't get Squires probably because of the ranged Throwing Axemen, but it creates an interesting parallel with the Teutons; both of their UUs end up being sluggish, and the Teutons also lack a speed tech for one half of their army, which is Husbandry.

* ARCHERY RANGE: no Arbalest, no Thumb Ring, no Parthian Tactics, no Bracer, no Ring Archer Armor

I'm not going to do a separate Blacksmith section because the Blacksmith techs are purely for balance. If they weren't, then the Aztecs and Mayans would lack most of them and would have some sort of cotton-armor and obsidian weaponry techs to compensate, and the Saracens wouldn't have Plate, etc. So anyway, the Franks always had poor experience with Archers. Their Archers weren't particularly good and true to history most European archers forces were pretty terrible. The exceptions in AoE are the Byzantines, the Britons, and the Vikings. So the Franks, Teutons, Celts, Goths, and sort of the Spanish get bad archers. The strongest archer civilizations were historically in Asia. The Franks do get Hand Cannoneers, and definitely were among the first to use them extensively in Europe. Curiously, they get some (crappy) Heavy Cavalry Archers, which may or may not be a hint to their roots as part of the barbarian invasion.

* STABLE: no Camels, no Hussar, no Bloodlines

Even though they are technically a Cavalry civ, they have a very limited tech tree for it. Of course they don't get Camels. They don't get Hussars for balance purposes, but I can't really figure out what the balance issue could be. Both the Teutons and Franks have bad light Cavalry, though the Teutons is worse.

* SIEGE WORKSHOP: no Siege Ram, no Siege Onager

The Franks made extensive use of siege weapons. There isn't anything particularly notable I can talk about, but the French definitely used alot of Cannon during the Hundred Year's War, and their Bombard Cannons are pretty decent, when combined with Siege Engineers. The Franks could have adopted much of their siege technology from the Romans, who had very sophisticated weaponry.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1343184634.0,,Blank,True,t3_pwcd7,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/pwcd7/civ_gameplay_and_history_analysis_day_1_the_franks/,

To me, this seems to be one of the main reasons we haven't seen a pro-level tournament on AOC HD.

The developers have been pretty good about addressing community concerns so far. In that light, it's pretty surprising they haven't addressed an issue this big yet.

The Hidden Path team was presented with some interesting problems when updating Age of Empires II. Part of it came down to: What could we do with the assets we had access to? What could we do without affecting the fundamental game play? (Unit recognition, obscuring terrain, etc.) What could we update in the engine during the time we had to work on the project?

We focused first on the UI. This was something we could plan on up front and start work on while the programmers dug into the guts of the engine to determine what was feasible from our list of things we wanted to upgrade. We took elements from the original UI images (single texture per resolution size of the original game) and broke each of the selected images (per civilization) up into individual sections. This allowed us to create sections that could be set or tiled and allow for variable screen sizes on the fly.

One of the engine upgrades included updating the terrain pipeline to a 32bit texture system. This would allow us to update terrain textures without being restricted by the palettes of the original system. The first terrain element we focused on was water. The programmers gave us animating normals, reflections, and even logic switches to modify texture properties based on the depth of the water tile. As you can see (or will see soon enough) that the changes to the water were a big win.

Anything that can be placed on the terrain in the editor is considered to be on the unit layer which remained 8-bit, but could be partially upgraded in the time we had. Another issue on the unit layer is that we no longer had access to many of the original 3d assets used to generate the original 8-bit texture content.

As more terrain features came in ( light maps, building occlusion, water, etc.), we decided to focus on the impact on terrain elements from the unit layer. We were able to come up with a custom palette system so that we were no longer restricted to the original palette set. This gave us the necessary flexibility for a wider range of colors that we could use per feature. Trees, cliffs faces, fire effects, to name a few, were all updated as a result of these upgraded custom palette features that were added to the engine.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,False,,,True,t3_1bmim7,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1bmim7/age_of_empires_ii_hd_developers_diaries_part_3/,

**ITALIAN HISTORY IS LIKE PASTA: IT'S PROCESSED AND MADE OF WHEAT...WUT**

In Forgotten Empires, the Italians represent the entirety of medieval civilization in the present-day state of Italy: the Romans at the end of their empire, the Papal States, the city states of Milan, Padua, Ravenna, Verona, Venice, Genoa, Salerno, Florence, Naples, Pisa, Tuscany, Amalfi, Capua, and Bologna, as well as the not-quite Italian Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica.

After the fall of Rome, Italy was dominated by Germanic influences. Many tribes invaded the peninsula and some of them, namely the Ostrogoths and Lombards, established dominion there. You could almost say that the Germans created the idea of the European city-states. A vast Empire broken apart into many small pieces thanks to the German migrants loyal only to their chieftains. Even Germany would be a very broken up patchwork of territories and free cities right up to the early modern era.

Now when I write my analyses, I try to talk about things NOT covered in the game's history section. So let's talk about Sicily! Smackdab in the middle of the Mediterranean and dangerously close to Africans who want their coast back. Charles Martel stopped the Moorish advance in France, but what they don't tell you was that the Moors had control of Sicily and they even sacked Rome. Holy shit, MUSLIMS SACKING THE POPE'S HOUSE! It would have been a bigger deal if the location of the Christianity's heart wasn't in dispute at the time. The Byzantines held much of south Italy at the time and they exerted influence over the Bishop of Rome, the Pope.

The Emirate of Sicily was eventually conquered by Normans at the behest of the Pope, which led to further Norman conquest in Italy. The Pope and the Norman Kings did not get along very well and they frequently fought each other. Things got heated when the Normans decided to fight the Byzantines, the protectors of Christianity, in southern Italy and then even further to the Balkans! Norman Sicily had elements of Norman, Italian, and Moorish culture because the Norman kings were fairly tolerant of the learned Moors.

Meanwhile Northern Italy was being preyed upon by the Holy Roman Empire, which meant everyone was up in their grill. Due to the very entangled nature of European politics, Italy became an utter hotbed of war during the Italian Wars and they can probably blame the Germans. The English, French, and Spaniards all got involved and the Frenchies even convinced Scotland to invade England at the same time. Hell the Ottomans fought in Italy as allies of the French. This incredible chain of conflicts could be considered the climax of the Middle Ages as many different armies turned Italy into a huge battleground, with sieges and battles and pikemen and knights and artillery. It was basically like playing a post-Imperial Death Match with the Teutons, Spanish, Franks, Britons, Italians, and maybe the Goths if you want to pretend they're the smaller German principalities or the Hapsburgs.

During the Middle Ages the Italians spread again all over the place, with trading posts and colonies all over Europe. The furthest they went away from the Mediterranean was Crimea in the Black Sea. Gazaria, named after the Khazars who had ruled the area once, was the main Genoese colony there and traded with the Mongol Golden Horde and even with the surviving remnants of the Italian's old nemeses, the Goths. The Venetians bribed the army of the Fourth Crusade to attack Constantinople and a French-speaking empire briefly reigned in Greece. It was the Venetian Marco Polo who traveled all across the Mongol Empire all the way to China. The most infamous Genoese of all Christopher Colombus opened the Americas to European invasion. Safavid Persia employed Italians as ambassadors to Europe.

The Italians have crossed paths with early Celts, Goths, raiding Vikings, Byzantines, French, Spanish, British, Teutons, Magyars, Slavs, Turks, Saracens, and Persians. They are the heirs to Rome along with the Byzantines, and are thus related in some way to every single European power.

**MARGE I COULDN'T GET MY CHRISTMAS BONUS THIS YEAR HOMER BART GOT A TATTOO AND I'VE USED ALL OUR SAVINGS TO REMOVE IT NO ITALIAN BONUS FOR YOU**

* Age Advancement costs -10%

The Italians were hit hard by the root causes of the Dark Ages such as the Germanic and Turkic migrations but they bounced back quite quickly. Their Feudal era had been in place as soon as the many German tribes began to invade. The Germanic tribes brought with them a fervent loyalty to their local leaders as opposed to the centralized government of the Romans. A Castle Age of fortresses could be considered to be in Italy first due to the Roman fortification 
traditions combined with the many city-states who needed to create defenses in order to hold their ground. A grand age of Imperial expansion was always on the Italian shopping list alongside wine, pasta, and truffles because come on these guys used to be the frikkin Romans. This bonus is a more broad relative of the Byzantine bonus, which makes alot of sense.

* Docks techs cost -50%

Think about Italy's geography: smack dab in the middle of a sea with the path to the mainland blocked by some big ass mountains. So you're going to take to the water. Now think about Italy's history: the Roman Empire, the only nation to dominate the entire Mediterranean Sea. So of course Italian naval tradition would be strong and thus they have easier access to naval technologies. Italian fleets dominated the Mediterranean both militarily and 
economically. The maritime republics would forge colonies around the Sea, wresting control from the Byzantines and Arab and Slavic states. Other nations hired Italian sailors due to their expertise and advanced tech. I mean, the Spaniards could not have reached the New World without the batshit insane Christopher Columbus, now could they?

* Gunpowder units cost -15%

The Italians made very, very good use of the combined arms model of Pikes + some sort of mechanical ranged weapon. Their UU is a Crossbowman and this bonus gives them Hand Cannoneers who are cheap enough to warrant use over regular Archers in some cases. Cheaper Hand Cannoneers end up being a great Infantry counter. Bombard Cannons end up costing 191 Wood and Gold, making them cheaper than Trebs. I can't find anything in particular about Italian gunpowder but we're supposed to get the idea of an advanced and simple army. Bombard Cannons basically need 200 Wood for the University, then 300 Food and 200 Gold for Chemistry and you're making them, unlike a Siege Ram that needs 1300 Food spread between 2 upgrades total. Instead of cheaper Infantry, the Italians take the bonuses of their former overlords the Goths, Lombards, and Vandals and instead apply it to Gunpowder.

* Fishing Ships +2 LoS

The Italians were most active in the Mediterranean, and by the Middle Ages it was familiar ground, even if half of it was inhabited by unfriendly Berbers, Arabs, and Turks. The Italians knew the waters they were navigating quite well. Fishing Ships with extra LoS is a pretty good bonus for those crucial early stages of the game and helps offset their sometimes dumb AI.

* TEAM BONUS: Condottiero available in the Imperial Age

The Italians have a sort of an “ultimate teammate” feel to them. The Italian city-states were very independent from each other and the other nations of Europe and frequently played large games of chess with various powers. Genoa, for instance, would ally with the Helvetians, the Swiss, the Burgundians, the French, the German Holy Roman Empire, the Austrians, the Byzantines, the Castilians, the Normans, the English, and the Arabs, and then stab them all in the back. Due to the independent nature of the city-states as well as their small size, mercenaries were very important to fill out their armies and there was no way to regulate Italians joining the armies of other nations. So the Condottiero, the epitome of mercenaries, being the the Team Bonus is not only an extremely cool team bonus but also a historical one.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1358317743.0,,Blank,True,t3_16o74z,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/16o74z/if_yall_forgot_about_this_shit_you_done_fucked_up/,

Ya best protect ya neck, it's The Battler and today I'm analyzing the Teutons as they are presented in Age of Empires 2 versus the history that they are based on. They are teut like teuger.

**A SMALL HISTORY LESSON ABOUT THE TEUTONS**

The Teutons represent the various polities, principalities, dukedoms, kingdoms, republics, city-states, duchies, counties, princedoms, etc. that made up the Holy Roman Empire. The developers of Age of Empires 2 use the Teutons to stand in for the Crusading Knight Orders (which is sort of weird and sort of not because most of the Templars and Hospitallers were French) as well as Hungary in the final scenario of the Ghengis Khan campaign (although I think that they would have been Huns if the Huns were included in the original version of AoE2). The Holy Roman states include, but are not limited to, modern-day Germany, Austria, Saxony, Shwaben, Bavaria, the Czech Republic (Bohemia), Luxembourg, Switzerland (Burgundy), Holland, and the Netherlands.

Charlemagne's Frankish Empire was split into West Francia, Middle Francia, and East Francia. East Francia is the beginning of the idea of a German pan-ethnicity. Henry the Fowler is the first man to lay claim to the title of ""King of the Germans,"" and in Latin the title is ""Rex Teutonicorum,"" which is why our German friends are known as Teutons.

Otto I the Great was crowned as King of Italy, and he and his successors were stylized as ""Romisch-Deutscher Kaiser"" or ""Roman-German Emperor."" Kaiser is a German pronunciation of Caesar, and people at the time referred to it as THE Western Roman Empire. The ""Holy"" in ""Holy Roman Empire"" (Romanum Imperium Sacrum) was not added until Frederick Barbarossa sought to attain authority above the Pope.

There's a famous saying that the Holy Roman Empire was neither Holy nor Roman, and it was occasionally not an Empire. It was a huge mosh pit of independent political states  centered around Germany of varying size, from cities to large swaths of land like Saxony. The Emperor was elected by the Dukes and Princes of the states from their own, but the title was nominal and did not come with any real strength. The Emperor was technically in control of the entire nation, but only had the resources of his home state. The Holy Roman Empire would occasionally have control of Italy but never after the Middle Ages. During the early modern era the HRE did not have Church authority so it wasn't Holy and since it lacked Italy it wasn't Roman.

The Teutons are related to the Franks. The Goths are among the first Germanic peoples to appear in recorded history and can be considered the predecessors of the Teutons. The Goths came from Scandinavia, and thus the Teutons and Vikings are distantly related. The Holy Roman Emperor for a time sought the approval of the Byzantine Emperor, and at times the Holy Roman Emperor was considered a viceroy of the Byzantine one. Many peoples from what would be considered the Holy Roman Empire, such as the Saxons, the Jutes, the Danes, and the Angles invaded the British Isles so the Teutons are related to the Britons (Anglo-Saxons), as well.

A Germanic tribe known as the ""Teutons"" was also running amok in the Roman Empire around the same time as the Goths, Huns, Burgundians, Alans, and Vandals, but they caused a much smaller ruckus than those other guys.

**THE TEUTONIC BONUSES**

* Monks heal from 2x as far

The Holy Roman Empire considered itself the Roman Empire except with the blessings of the Pope. So, their Monks get a bonus. The healing bonus makes it so that the Monks can accompany you in battle without being completely vulnerable to getting their asses handed to them, and many Monks would accompany the Crusaders in the Middle East. The Teutonic Knights, Templar Knights, and Hospitallers were all Monk-warrior Orders, so having Monks who can do their thing on the battlefield makes alot of sense in this regard

* Towers garrison 2x units, fire equivalent arrows

The Teutons were historically known for running to the nearest tower and stuffing themselves in twice as efficiently as every other civilization at the time. Okay, no they weren't, but the Germany had just as many [famous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_castles_in_Germany) fortifications as the rest of Europe. Many Teuton towns are extremely well-fortified, and difficult to take not just by Hungarians, Avars, French, Vikings, or Italians, but by other Teutons! The Teutonic Knights were well-known for slowly pushing through Eastern Europe, building fortifications as they went to keep their new territory. In AoE2, towers allow you to mirror the Teutonic Knights' aggressive defensive encroachment tactics. Also, this might not have anything to do with anything, but I learned about a month ago that stuffing 10 Hand Cannoneers into a Teutonic Bombard Tower will cause the Tower to fire 2 cannonballs instead of 1, killing Camels or Paladins who would normally survive one ball. Mind=blown.

* Murder Holes free

The Teutons didn't invent any particular fortification system, but hey this makes their Towers even more badass during the Castle Age. I'd like to point out that these fortification bonuses run parallel to the Franks' cheaper Castles. It's a different kind of defense, but still along the same line, which brings us to...

* Farms cost -33%

Germany had plenty of arable land for farming. Pretty much the entirety of Europe is ripe for farming. Today, the German economy does not rely on agriculture nearly as much as France's. I think the Franks and Teutons should have their bonuses switched, as it makes more sense for France to have the better bonus AND it gives the Franks a nice leg up in the Dark Age, which makes sense since they had were doing well for themselves in the Dark Age while the Teutons didn't technically even exist yet. Oh well.

* Town Center +2 attack/+5 LoS

Ahhh, this bonus used to be +5 Range instead of LoS. Paired with Town Centers originally costing no Stone, Teutons were overpowered because they'd set their ""Death Star"" Town Centers everywhere and completely screw their opponents over. AND TCs used to benefit from Blacksmith upgrades! Anyway, like I detailed earlier, the Holy Roman Empire was a patchwork of states, from the small to the large. The Teutons have a bonus for every defense except for walls, and you can infer that every town in Germany was fortified.

* TEAM BONUS: Units more resistant to conversion

Since the Teutons represent the Crusading Orders, of course they'd have more zeal for the Christian faith. Those HEATHENS won't be converting the Teutons to their FALSE RELIGIONS AND IDOLS NO SIR. YEAH, THOSE DEVIL SARACENS AND THEIR SURGERY AND MEDICINE AND LITERACY!

So for our Teutons, the smaller city-states had +2 Attack and +5 LoS. The bigger princedoms have Towers that you could stuff 10 German dudes in lining their borders. And the Saxons and Swabians and Bavarians had Castles that had +3 Range! Oops, I'm not there yet. Also, the Teutons get a defensive bonus applicable per age: this one for Dark Age, Towers 2x garrison for Feudal, Murder Holes for Castle, and super Bombard Towers and super Castles for Imperial. Every town has a good agricultural base and on top of that, the Empire has the blessings of the Church. Gawddamn, son.

**TEUTONIC TECH TREE**

* UNIQUE UNIT: Teutonic Knight

The Teutonic Knight is named after the real life order of Teutonic Knights. The Teutonic Knights actually fought mostly from horseback, but you could consider the unique unit a dismounted Paladin. He's beefy but without his horse he's SLOW. The Teutonic Knight draws interesting parallels with the Teuton's cousin civs; the Frankish Throwing Axemen is pretty damn slow and beats other infantry pretty handily like the Teutonic Knight. The Gothic Huskarl is the yin to the TK's yang. The TK kills other infantry and cavalry, and is great against fortifications due to it's high attack, HP, and decent pierce armor but it's so slow that it fails against archers. The Huskarl slays Archers but dies to other Infantry and Cavalry, but is still good against fortifications thanks to it's high pierce armor. As for the Berserks...uhh...they both have capes?

* UNIQUE TECH: Crenelations

Yet another defensive tech. The main shred of historicity we can gleam from this tech is that Infantry can fire arrows (they fire the same number as Villagers) when garrisoned in things. This is probably related to the Teutonic Knights who, as I've mentioned, were master fortification builders. Those TKs built the Castle, and then they can huddle inside and fire arrows from it. Coolio.

* BARRACKS: no Eagle Warriors

The Teutons get most Infantry techs just like their cousins, the Britons, Goths, Vikings, and Franks. I mentioned that I like to think of the TK as a dismounted Knight, but what does that make the Champion? The flavor text in AoE2's manual states that your regular joe infantry guy could become rich enough after surviving a few battles to buy himself armor and a sword, so I think the Champion is a man of common birth who is well off enough to buy some equipment. The Teutons also get Halberdiers, and you can bet your ass that the various German states came up with massed Spear formations to counter the Heavy Cavalry. The Swiss, in particular, were among the most adept Pikemen ever and they were often vassals of the HRE and their Swiss Pikemen were famous and dominant. Other famous Pike mercenary companies were the Landsknechts. I like to think the Teutonic Knight's ability to destroy Cavalry is a reference to these mercenaries.

* ARCHERY RANGE: no Arbalest, no Heavy Cavalry Archer, no Thumb Ring, no Parthian Tactics, no Bracer.

Very similar to the Franks and Goths, the Teutons Archery Range is lacking. The Germans never had particularly good archers, although their lack of Heavy Cavalry Archer is kind of weird because they did use mounted Crossbowmen. The lack of Bracer is one of the sole cons of the Teutons, preventing their crazy defenses from being unstoppable. But they don't really need Bracer because 1 - they have Crenelations and 2 - if you look above, you'll notice that they get Hand Cannoneers and you can PUT THEM IN BOMBARD TOWERS OMG TWO CANNONBALLS

- Shadows of enemy buildings frequently appear in the fog of war even though I have never scouted the buildings.
- When you develop applications you assume your users are idiots. Well, when you develop games you need to assume your users are all assholes.

It is simply not practical to have a screen that lets anyone stop the game indefinitely. There must be a timeout on this screen that forces the game to continue. When games allow shit like this to happen then no one will ever play it competitively because it will just be endless drop-trickers that kill the community.

Edit:

- Often, when enemy buildings appear at the edge of line-of-sight they light up as if I should be able to click on them but when I do click on them, I can't select them.

**SO YOU WANNA KNOW ABOUT THEM MONGOLS!?**

The Mongols in Age of Empires 2 represent the Mongol Empire that came out of Mongolia and conquered much of the known world. The Mongols are occasionally used to represent nomadic tribes such as the Scythians.

Mongolia is a part of the steppes that stretch from Europe to Asia, a vast region of the world with few trees and mostly shrubs and grasslands. The civilizations that were brought up in the steppes have a huge emphasis on horses, as the wide open land is well-suited to them. These civilizations include Uralic, Iranian, and Turko-Mongol peoples such as the Avars, Bulgars, Magyars, Khazars, Sarmatians, Scythians, Alans, Uighurs, Seljuqs, Turkmen, Huns, Mongols, Kipchaks, Tatars, Kazakhs, Cossacks, Machu, Jurchen, and Khitai. These people relied on horses for food as livestock and as hunting tools. Most of them would spend a lifetime in the saddle, and riding was just as natural as walking to them. 

Prior to Ghengis Khan, Mongolia was subject to multiple confederations of tribes who were primarily united against China. These confederations were made up of the Turkish/Mongol/Tungusic tribes The Xiongnu was the first of these confederations and they began to quarrel internally and then were beaten by the Chinese (the Xiongnu are candidates for the Hun's ancestors, I'll discuss that some other time). That would become the pattern for about a thousand years to come; some hotshot confederation would come up with a Shan Yu (the dude from Mulan!) or a Khagan or a Khan at the head, and then they would start to argue amongst themselves and the Chinese would snicker and laugh at them.

Finally, a hyper-competent, super-charismatic, super-intelligent, and super-ruthless dude named Ghengis Khan took the reigns of the nomad tribes and forced them to do something about their situation. He did what no other confederation leader did before: he broke up the tribes and enforced strict unity. If you submitted to the will of the Mongols and you were conscripted into their army, Ghengis tried his best to make sure you would be considered a Mongol and not an outsider. As you know from playing the single player campaigns in AoE2, they beat up each other, they beat up a rival confederation (the Khara-Kitai Khanate), they beat up China, they beat up the Khwarezmids, and they beat up much of Eastern Europe, but they also fought the Tibetans, the Vietnamese, some Indians, and the Arabs.

The Mongol Empire would fragment, leaving their descendants all over the place. Mongolian-ruled China, AKA the Yuan Dynasty, was technically the leader of the Mongol successor states, but they were all pretty much independent. The Golden Horde in Russia, the Ilkhanate in Persia and Turkey, and the Chagatai Khante in Central Asia (today's Kazakhstan) would linger for about a century or so until THEY broke into smaller groups and left their descendants behind, such as the Tatars in Russia. One Mongolic group, the Mughals, would become pretty successful and conquer and hold India for a few centuries.

The Mongols are related to the Turks and the Huns, having similar languages and ethnic origin.

**THE MONGOL BONUSES**

* Cavalry Archers fire +20% faster

The Mongols' primary weapon was the Cavalry Archer. The Cavalry Archer was a combination of speed, range, and power. Mongol composite bows were pretty ridiculous and good enough to penetrate most armor at reasonable range, and their horses were bred for speed. Because they did not wear much armor, the Mongol horses had stamina that the heavy chargers of Europe did not. Back in those days, a Cavalry Archer was just plain unfair. He'd nail you pretty hard with an arrow, and then run away before you could do anything, if you weren't already dead. You'd need a pretty damn accurate bow (such as a Chinese crossbow) to retaliate. However, Cavalry Archers were pretty rare because each man needed a lifetime of training. Like I mentioned earlier, though, the steppes of Asia are perfect training grounds and a Mongol man would get his training, by using a bow and a horse to hunt Notice that the Mongols do not get any bonuses for creation speed or cost. That's because the Mongols rarely ever had the numbers advantage. Their written records would often exaggerate the enemy's strength, but we do know simply from analyzing their way of life that the Mongols were outnumbered in most of their battles. So they relied on quality and not quantity. Mongol horse archers were the best in the world, so of course they get a quality, offensive bonus.

* Light Cavalry +30% HPs

Another qualitative bonus. The majority of the Mongol army did not wear much armor. They saw the benefits of heavy cavalry and used them on occasion, but the majority were light cavalry for the sake of speed. In military history, ""light cavalry"" actually refers both to melee fighters and ranged fighters (just like how archers are considered infantry) but in AoE2 they're two separate units. But it's not a surprise the Mongols get bonuses for both of them. The Light Cavalry and Hussar line is the fastest in the game, and after that are the Mangudai and Camels, and then the Cavalry Archers. The Mongol armies were known for their extreme mobility. No other army could match them. Even with the HP bonus, Mongol Light Cavalry and Hussars still don't beat the units that normally beat them (such as Camels and Knights), but they do end up lasting alot longer and make good, cheap meatshields for the Mongol cav archers and siege weapons. Hussars are extremely good at running in to the enemy camp, killing their most valuable units (Monks, Siege weapons, and occasionally Archers), and then running away and thus frustrating the enemy. Mongol cavalrymen could never beat a European or Chinese army in a toe-to-toe fight, so they would use sneaker tactics, and this bonus encourages you to do that. The Mongols lack the final armor tech for Cavalry, so this bonus is not quite as good as one would like it to be; in fact, a Hunnic or Persian or Spanish Hussar with the full armor techs ends up being just as durable versus melee attacks and slightly more durable against missiles! Maybe this is a reference to the fact that the Mongol Empire simply did not last?

* Hunters work 50% faster

You've probably seen youtube vids about Mongol dudes hunting using falcons and horses. They've been doing that for thousands of years! So of course they get a hunting bonus. The Mongol Army was different from other armies of the time because each man was a skilled hunter and could find his own food, as opposed to the capitol shipping food to the army on the march. This bonus also makes it so that the Mongols don't have to immediately get to Farming like the other civs do. Normally you'd start Farming as soon as you eat up your Forage Bushes because putting a Mill near some Deer ends up costing just as much Wood per Food as putting up a Farm near your Town Center, except putting a Farm at your TC is much faster. The Mongols can actually make up for this disadvantage and don't need to farm, so it plays in to their nomadic lifestyle. Plus it allows them to make the vaunted Scout Cavalry rush in the Feudal Age. Mongols like Cavalry!

* TEAM BONUS: Scout Cavalry line +2 Line of Sight

Another piece to the Mongol success puzzle was their superior scouting and intelligence. The Mongols would have the lay of the land sooner than their enemies would have liked them to, and the Mongols even sent scouting missions into far off lands, charting roads, rivers, and guessing about enemy troop plans. Your Scout Cavalry in the beginning of the game is your only eye into seeing what your enemies are planning on doing, and so this bonus starts in the Dark Age and goes all through the game. The Mongols also had very, very good communications, relaying messages through horns, flags, smoke signals, arrows, and through plain old letters carried out by an organized system of riders.


**MONGOL TECH TREE**

* UNIQUE UNIT: Mangudai

The word ""Mangudai"" is from a Mongol tribe known as the Mangits or the Manghuds. After the Mongol Empire fragmented, the Manghuds would rule over an area around the north Caspian Sea, in today's Uzbekistan, Russia, and Kazakhstan. Some western sources believe that the Mongols had a cadre of suicide troops known as the Mangudai, who were the craziest of the crazy Mongols. The Mangudai is a super cavalry archer, and you'll notice in gameplay that he fires instantly as soon as you click on an enemy (if enough time has passed since he fired his last shot). Mangudai are also the second fastest, regular unit in the game tying with the Camel and just under the Light Cavalry (making them faster than the Cavalry Archer line). Mangudai also have more range, attack, and HPs in the Castle Age, making them Heavy Cavalry Archers during the Castle Age. On the downside, the Elite Mangudai upgrade is kind of weak, but it is useful depending on how heavy the enemy uses siege weapons. Obviously, the Mangudai is the best cavalry archer in the game, just like how Mongol Cavalry Archers were the best in their day. Speaking of siege weapons, the obvious thing that makes Mangudai special is their attack bonus versus them. This means that no unit technically counters Mangudai except Camels. They can back up and fire at Knights all day, Hussars aren't nearly strong enough to beat them, and they're fast enough to dodge siege weapon shots and their bonus outweighs the pierce armor on Rams, Onagers, and Scorpions. This, of course, takes strong micro (AKA a strong leader, like Ghengis or Subotai). The Mongol army is extremely good at running in, killing enemy siege and monks, and thus frustrating enemy assaults.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,False,,Blank,True,t3_q5cn3,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/q5cn3/civ_gameplay_vs_history_day_4_the_mongols/,

[Steam Global Achievements for ValveTestApp221380](http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUserStats/GetGlobalAchievementPercentagesForApp/v0002/?gameid=221380) The interesting thing is that I checked the global achievements several days ago and there were only two test achievements; also if you notice the percentages on the achievements which means that people / developers are actively playing the game on Steam!

I RANG

YEA BITCH, I'M GOING TO CHINA MAYYYYYYNNNNNE

FROM NOW ON, I WILL BE REFERRED TO AS THE B OR BATTLED GOD.

**WORD TO YA MOTHER ABOUT THE CHINESE**

The Chinese in AoE2 seem to represent a fairly diverse group of  ethnicities and dynasties. For instance, in the Battle of Noryang Point, we get a glimpse of Ming Dynasty China. In the mission they are most prominently figured in, Ghengis Khan does battle with 5 Chinese factions; the unimportant ""Engineers,"" the Xi Xia, the Tanguts, the Jin, and the Song. The Xi Xia and the Tanguts were the same dynasty, the Tanguts being the lead ethnicity (currently of unknown origin) of the Xi Xia and referred to by their Chinese subjects, other dynasties, and Mongols as ""White Mongols."" The Jin were a Dynasty led by the Jurchen, a group from the Manchuria Steppes. That leaves the super technologically advanced Song Dynasty.

The Song are the main inspiration for the Chinese civilization as presented by AoE2 and they are the ""true,"" Han Chinese dynasty. Today, there are 1.5 billion Han Chinese and they obviously inhabit the People's Republic of China, as well as the Republic of China in Taiwan. The Song were around from 960 - 1279, until being defeated by the Mongols. Their predecessors, the Tang Dynasty, ruled a united China from 618-907. The Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty united China and Mongolia from 1271-1368, and finally the Han Chinese Ming Dynasty held China from 1368-1644 to round out the Middle Ages.

The Chinese civilization has been around prior to that for pretty much ever starting with the Shang Dynasty (they were in AoE1) in 1600 BC. The Shang claim to have wrested control of China from the (currently) mythological Xia Dynasty, and the Xia even claim descent from Chinese during the earlier, mythological Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors period. The Chinese were probably the first archaeologists, and they investigated earlier dynasties as well as keeping records for later ones.

The Chinese have such a comprehensive, continuous, and long history that a sinocentric AoE like game about China and it's neighbors (as opposed to the eurocentric AoE) could be made: you'd have the Han, the Tanguts, the Jurchen, the Tibetans, the Koreans, the Japanese, the Mongols, the Vietnamese, the Burmese, the Khmer, the Indians, Persians, Turks, Uighurs, among others.

In my opinion, the Chinese are exemplary of humanity. At nearly any period of human history, if you're looking for the most advanced civilization of the times, it's probably China (with Achaemenid Persia, the Roman Empire, the Abbasid Caliphate, and good ol' US of A providing the main competition).

The Song Dynasty in particular was pretty freaking nuts. Their main strength was their high population, and their ability to arm a massive army with mass-produced, crazy technology. They of course had the Chu Ko Nu, but they also had standardized measurements for spears, arrows, swords, armor pieces, etc. so that any Blacksmith can create and repair weapons. They were so good at metalworking, they used as much charcoal as Industrial Revolution era England, though it wasn't for machinery but for blacksmithing. The Song had grenades, bombs, rockets, land mines, and flamethrowers, among other things.

The Chinese in AoE2 had contact with the Turks, the Mongols, the Japanese, the Koreans, the Persians, the Saracens, and the Byzantines. They greatly influenced the Koreans, Mongols, and Japanese greatly, and arguably drove the Huns and Turks out of Central Asia.

**THA CHINESE BONUSES MAYYNE**

* Start with +3 Villagers; -200 F, 50 W

The Chinese political states have always had a very high percentage of the world's population within their borders. Today, the People's Republic of China has a population of 1.3+ billion. In 1120, historians estimate that the Song Dynasty had a population of nearly 120 million. Remember that the human population only went over 1 billion around 1850. In 1500, some academics estimate the population was 500 million. And you can bet that it was even smaller in 1120. At one point, the Song had about a quarter of the total human population in the entire world! The food and wood reduction is obviously for balance sake, but there's a couple of deeper issues here. In actual gameplay, the Chinese player has to dick around for about 30 seconds before his Scout Cavalry manages to find some Sheep and send it to the Town Center. In that time, the Chinese player may have gathered enough Wood to offset his wood reduction. It takes another 30 seconds or so for the villagers to gather enough Food to start production of Villies. Every other civ will have created a couple of villagers by then, thus offsetting the Chinese bonus a little bit. If you aren't experienced, this bonus can actually work against you! [(the upcoming Forgotten Empires mod by Aoczone addresses this and moves the Teuton Line of Sight bonus to the Chinese)](http://62.63.45.103/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=68879&amp;sid=23ecb70c683193e2891c1ce1f8cf22a4) If you know what you're doing, this is a definite bonus. This is the case for China in history. Proper management of their huge population led to their success. Mismanagement, such as under the Sui Dynasty, led to some horrifying times. The complete and utter lack of Food for the Chinese *could* also be a reference to the Chinese' concept of the Dynastic Cycle. The Dynastic Cycle is something that the Chinese believe happens to every political state, but especially the Chinese; out of a chaos of multiple smaller states, one will receive the Mandate of Heaven and rise out above the rest. This new state will enter a period of prosperity before the Mandate withdraws. When there is a famine or high flooding, other political factions use this as a way to rally their followers to challenge the current ruler, stating that the Mandate has withdrawn and the ruler is no longer has the satisfaction of the gods. In the Dynastic Cycle, all states eventually come to an end due to breaking up back into multiple small states and the Cycle starts again. The fact that you start with no Food means that you are a political state that is just emerging from internal warfare due to a famine! Or not.

* Town Centers support +10 Population

Again, a reference to their population. Plus, it would kind of suck to be Housed (not having enough Houses) at the beginning of the game with less Wood. The Chinese cities were very sophisticated, and they settled a large territory. A Town Center basically signifies a new town or an expansion to a an existing Town.

* Demolition Ships +50% HPs

Ehh. The Demolition Ship itself is not very accurate to history, but it's one of those things where fun beats accuracy, and nobody can deny the coolness of Michael Bay ships. In actual gameplay, they sort of suck but that's another issue entirely. Real Demolition Ships didn't quite explode, but the flavor text of the manual states that they were set on fire and sailed into the enemy ship formations where the winds would carry the flames onto the targets. It was still a suicide attack on the part of the ship itself, it just didn't happen in a spectacular BOOM. I mentioned when I analyze the Byzantines that the Fire Ship in the game is a purely Byzantine one, but the Chinese had analogous ships except they used gunpowder bombs and flamethrowers. It seemed like the developers wanted to give the Chinese a gunpowder related naval bonus, but they already gave the obvious ones to the Byzantines (Fire ship attack speed) and the Turks (the HP bonus). So they cam up with this one. There's still some history to be gleamed, though. This is a ""useless"" bonus and it fits because while the Song Dynasty Chinese were great ship builders, they didn't have massive naval conflicts on par with the Mediterranean ones. Though, by the end of the Middle Ages the Chinese had the biggest fleet in the world (and that's because Shipwright is cheaper for them). The Demo Ship is also the fastest unit in the game (I think the Trade Cog might be faster, though), and the Chinese invented the very speedy wheel-paddle boats. So it's possible for the Chinese to create the very sturdy, very fast, and explodey Demolition Ships in AoE2, they just never used them in real life because ships armed with Trebuchets and flamethrowers were better.

* Technologies cost -10/15/20% starting in Feudal Age

Now, the Chinese civ could have had myriad bonuses associated with them. They preferred to use cheap, massed formations of soldiers and had technology before everybody else. They had a massive economy, they had a massive everything. This was probably the most broad, general bonus they could give the Chinese while still being balanced. And as a result, the Chinese have a strategy for just about everything! Their units aren't directly cheaper, but upgrades for them are. The Champion upgrade, for instance, costs them 150 F and 70 G less, so they end up being able to field almost 3 extra Champions due to the reduction. Siege Ram upgrade saves them 160 Gold, so that's an extra two Siege Rams. That's sort of like the Chinese having a higher population or having standardized parts for their weapons and tools. Heavy Plow in the Castle Age is 108 Food instead of 125 Food and while that's not extremely high savings, that could be a full minute earlier you get that tech in the Castle Age. On that note, it's also partially a speed bonus, because the time it takes for you to gather enough resources for the techs is significantly (20%) less than other civs. That reflects the fact that the Chinese had everything before everybody else.

* TEAM BONUS: Farms +45 F

China had to have strong agriculture in order to feed it's massive population. They get a free 45 Food, which is incredibly helpful in the Dark Age and Feudal. Probably another reference to the fact that their civilization has always been pretty strong.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,False,,Blank,True,t3_qan78,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/qan78/epic_civ_analyses_in_historrreeehhhh_day_5_the/,

thanks to [Paul the Tall](http://www.paulthetall.com/), and some time spent on multiple forums.

I am giving you guys this in good faith that you *ahem, have purchased the game. That being said it's not required to use your physical copy to play the game, it's not required for any part of this. 

Here's what's included, set up, and good to go:

* AoE2: The Base Game

* AoE2: The Conqueror's Expansion

* The Famed 1.0.e Patch

* The UserPatch (everything but Windowed mode, since that causes it to crash.)

* The Forgotten Empires Expansion

Just unzip the app with [Keka](http://www.kekaosx.com/en/) and drag it to your Applications folder.

What isn't working:

* Multiplayer

* Some minor features from the UserPatch and ForgottenEmpires.

Other than that everything is good to go! I've got it running a full 1680x1050 right now with no lag. (Note that it will be in it's usual rubbish resolution until you change it in the settings, and even then it only affects the in-game resolution.  Lobby will still look like ass.

If there are any major issues, as always feel free to comment/message me. I do prefer comments over PM's though, since questions/issues can help other users.

Have fun guys!

Ps. I'm trying to get multiplayer working, it shouldn't be too hard, but I've only got like a half hour of free time a week to devote to this.  I figured you'd like to at least be able to play single player for the time being. I don't play multiplayer at all so it's not of the highest importance for me.  But I'll get it working eventually and send out an update then.

Pps. It'd be really cool if the mods could put a link to this thread in the sidebar!",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,False,,,True,t3_169f6c,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/169f6c/ive_got_another_little_something_for_any_mac/,

**A SMALL TIDBIT ABOUT THE BYZANTINES UP IN HERRR**

The Byzantines in Age of Empires 2 represent the Byzantine Empire, as well as the entire Roman Empire, some Greek states, and some Crusader states. They are also used to represent the naval-oriented Italian factions, such as Genoa and Venice.

We call them the Byzantines, but that is a name invented by scholars past the existence of the Byzantine Empire to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire after the fall of Rome in the West, which was centered at Constantinople, prior called *Byzantium*. Constantinople was occasionally referred to as Nova Roma. A Byzantine man would call himself a Roman. The Byzantine Empire considered themselves the Roman Empire, and carried on the military, societal, and administrative traditions of Rome. When the Turks conquered Anatolia from the Byzantines, they called the area ""Rum,"" a Turkish pronunciation of Rome, and the Buglarians and Hungarians called the empire ""Romania.""

The Roman Empire was first split into four ruled by a Tetrarchy; Italy, Spain, and western North Africa was one distrct, France (Gaul) and Britain another, the Balkans the third, and Turkey (Anatolia), Egypt, and Israel, Jordan, and Syria (just Syria in Roman times) were the fourth. Eventually the first two were consolidated as the Western Roman Empire and the latter two became the Eastern Roman Empire.

Due to the capital being in Greece, the Byzantines were ethnically Greek ruled by a Latin/Roman aristocracy and spoke Latin, but eventually the Empire became a purely Greek one. So they are the Greek civilization of Age of Empires. The Byzantines grew rich because Constantinople sat right in the middle of Europe and Asia, and because of that they had many enemies. The Germanic movements into Europe mostly spread from the east and into the west, so many barbarian tribes encountered the Byzantines but then went on to Rome; these tribes include the Goths, the Huns, the Slavs, the Magyars, and the Avars. The Vikings even had a few conflicts with Constantinople, and of course they retained their old nemesis, the Persian Empire. When the Arabs came running full sprint out of Arabia, they attacked both Persia and Byzantine ruled Egypt and Anatolia, and later on the Persians and Arabs sent the Turks after them, who became their conquerors. The Byzantine Empire reconquered Italy and North Africa, taking them from the Goths and Vandals for a time.

The Eastern Roman Empire had Rome for only a century until the Lombards invaded Italy, and the Arabs began to take the rest of their territory. The Byzantines adapted many different tactics against their many different enemies and thus have a variety of units in AoE2.

The Byzantine Empire, through the fact that they were the true Romans of the Middle Ages, influenced a great many civilizations; they considered the Frankish Empire and, later, the Teutonic Holy Roman Empire their vassals (as both civilizations posited themselves as the successors of Rome). The Goths would imitate Roman customs and tradition when setting up their kingdoms in Italy and Spain, and in turn the Spanish obviously are descendants of Rome. The Magyars and Bulgars would imitate the Byzantines in setting up their states. The Russians owed a great debt to the Byzantines in terms of culture with architectural and religious influences easily seen and when Constantinople fell in 1453, Ivan III would marry the niece of the last Byzantine Emperor and call Moscow the Third Rome, especially because the Greek Orthodox religion had found it's last bastion of protection there.

Constantinople was actually conquered by Crusaders (the Republic of Venice paying off German and Frankish Crusaders to take Constantinople) during what was supposed to be the Fourth Crusade. After 60 years of western European rule, the Byzantine Emperors reconquered their city and were restored to rule.

The Saracens would study much of Roman and Greek culture, using their scientific knowledge as a starting point for their own advances (along with the Persian ones). The Turks would also do the same, and they would imitate the Byzantines in numerous ways; take a look at the Turkish Wonder and realize that it was modeled after the Hagia Sophia, the Byzantine Wonder. The Ethiopians felt that they were brothers to the Byzantines, especially when the Muslim Arabs began conquering their lands.

**THE BYZANTINE BONUSES**

* Buildings +10/20/30/40% HPs starting in the Dark Age

A reference to the fact that the Romans were the premier builders of Europe. Roman buildings are still standing to this day, and the Byzantines continued that tradition. Constantinople was sieged numerous times for a thousand-ish years. I doubt the developers quite planned it out this far, but this bonus is not as good as it appears to be in the Imperial Age. Other civs with Masonry and Architecture actually have stronger buildings in some instances than Byzantines ones. Let's say a group of 10 FU Pallies are attacking your Bombard Tower. That's a total of 180 attack power every 2 seconds. HOWEVER, that's divided by 10 so then with Masonry and Architecture each Paladin does less damage. The total damage output drastically goes down. When enemies use Siege, however, the extra armor makes little difference and Byzantine buildings come out on top.

* Camels, Skirmishers, and Spearmen cost -25%

I don't think this is an exact reference to any specialty of the Byzantine military, but this does allude to the fact that the Byzantines were on the defensive against various invasions. The Byzantines have a counter to everything when you consider their ""stronger"" Fire Ships and the Cataphracts. The Skirmishers and Spearmen are, in AoE2, considered to be the bottom of the barrel soldiers in an army and you could infer that when the Byzantine Empire couldn't afford to keep a traditional Roman army of heavy infantry and Cataphracts, they turned to the cheaper and crappier soldiers. The Camel thing...doesn't really make *too* much sense, but the Byzantines used Camels in Arabia and even put armor on them!

* Fire Ships +20% attack

The developers intended there to be a rock-paper-scissors in AoE2 on the seas; Galleys defeat Demolition Ships before they get close, Fire Ships eat Galleys, and Demolitiion Ships have enough attack power to destroy Fire Ships. However in real gameplay, it is better to mass Galleys because they are practically Cavalry Archers on water and Fire Ships are essentially Pikemen. The Fire Ships' attack is pretty screwy, and does not work against Galleons that are properly microed by hitting and running. But we're here to talk about historicity. The Byzantines posses the ""best"" Fire Ship, and it makes sense because the Fire Ship is a specifically Byzantine Ship. If the Fire Ship was a Byzantine unique unit, that would be historically accurate as no other civ quite had Greek Fire (the Chinese, Koreans, and Indians would have analogous Ships utilizing gunpowder, but not quite the same). The exact composition of Greek Fire is not known today, but it's thought that Greek Fire is a napalm-type substance.

* Advance to Imperial Age costs -33%

You see, the Byzantines were so far ahead of the rest of Europe that they barely experienced a Dark Age. Sure, their territories shrunk pretty dramatically, but their society just kept on trucking along. They kept most of the Roman military science, medicine, arts, etc. So it makes sense to give the Byzantines a leg up in this respect. They hit the Imperial Age sooner than anybody else. However, it would make more sense for them to have a faster Feudal Age or something because the timeframe of the Imperial Age really sucked for the Byzantines (since they got their asses handed to them the the Crusaders and Turks).

* Town Watch free

Not a super historical bonus, but consider that the Byzantines had the best roads, the best-trained scouts, and the best buildings in Europe. Of course they'd be able to keep a better eye on their holdings than most.

* TEAM BONUS: Monks +50% heal speed

Constantinople was the bastion of Greek Orthodoxy, and they considered themselves the legitimate holders of the Papacy. So the Byzantines get a Monk bonus. The word ""Pope"" comes from the Greek ""Pappas,"" which means ""father"" and it is the same title of the Greek Church leaders. The reason why the Pope is THE Pope (or THE Father) is because he is the Father of Rome. The Greek Orthodoxy thought that Constantinople superceded Rome in authority, and thus the Pappas of Constantinople was considered to be the true Pappas of Christendom. Obviously since the one in Rome held a ton of authority, the Byzantines walked on eggshells in terms of diplomacy with them. Also, the word ""Catholic"" is derived from the Greek ""Katholikos,"" which means universal. You'll also notice that the Byzantines and the Teutons have a Monk heal bonus; the Holy Roman Empire is the closest thing in AoE2 to a Papal political entity.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1365355587.0,,Blank,True,t3_q253f,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/q253f/civ_gameplay_vs_history_day_3_the_byzantines/,

This weekend I had such a battle. I hope you enjoy the story...

The matchup was a 4v4 on Arabia and I chose China. I was playing with some friends; NoTt_MaG on the Huns and AssassinDave (henceforth Dave) as Spain, and a randomer Darth Potter as Aztecs. We were against: Orange (Huns), Grey (Mongols), Pink (noob) and Yellow but I don't remember which civ he was.

I started the game on the border with Potter just behind me (right in the corner) and NoTt_MaG was just behind Dave on the other side. I had a pretty good start, found lots of deers which were worth harvesting and a good secure wood just behind my town centre. I was going for a 28 pop feudal 30 pop castle with intention to get a big castle age military. No time to boom when you're on the borders! 

I get feudal rushed! Yellow comes with scout cavalry but he's slow. I tower my wood. He also has militia and spearmen so I get some archers. He kills off a few of my deer hunters and slows me a bit but my archers and TC eventually kill of his rush. I managed to get my castle age going as well but I'm low on wood and gold so I can't spam the cav archers like I wanted to. Once I get 5 I make my way to yellow who has also castled by this stage. He has some palisade walls up but there's a gap and I get a lot of kills around his wood and gold which were together. He comes with knights but the terrain is to my advantage and he loses a couple and I run away.

*MEANWHILE on the other side of the map... from NoTt_MaG:*
&gt; Orange feudal rushed Dave. Killed 50% of his vills. Dave is on the ropes, but rather than finishing him off he comes for me, but I had a 16min castle and got 2 knights out, drew his 4 spear within range of TC and my knights killed off his skirms.

*More from NoTt_MaG later.*

I'm too focused on my fight to really pay attention there but I know Orange is playing really well and NoTt_MaG is at his best to match him.

I'm trying my best to boom. Got 3 TCs going and still hitting and running with Cav Archers. I get a castle up quickly to protect my gold and have some skirmishers and archers about. I send 4 knights up to destroy some of orange's rams too after a plea for help. I still don't have cartography at this stage and then I see a flood of units in my base. 40 eagle warriors! I panicked, but quickly realised that its Darth Potter, fresh from his boom in the pocket and he's coming for yellow! We hit him hard together and cripple his economy. Grey (their pocket player) comes to help out with mangudai and we're stopped for a little while.
 
I get to imperial age and I start getting all the infantry upgrades and eventually amass 40 champions. I go straight for grey who is pissing everyone off with his mangudai! I get a couple of TC's but his main base is well structured with Castles and TCs and eventually I get annihilated! But that takes of the pressure from Potter who is now trebbing yellow's base. Orange is still attacking hard!

*NoTt_MaG:*

&gt; Dave retreats closer to my base, but still in front of me.  Orange and me both go heavy on Paladins, both have pikes to back up. Both are attacking each other’s hearts, food and TCs. Both take big losses, but I’m a bit more destructive in his base than he is in mine, BUT he has all of Dave’s gold.  

&gt; I can’t let up my attack on his home because he is too strong, so I can’t destroy his stables in Dave’s base. I give up on the pals, go heavy on hussars/halberdiers as I have 13,000 food. Grey comes knocking with 40 Mangudai, but easily pushed back by halbs/huss. I get about 50 hussars in orange's base which by now takes up about 1/3 of the map. Dave starts to get pikes in to stem oranges pals. Its at this point I notice he has been storing units in his siege workshops. UNLEASHES FURY on my main base which is quite compact, 20 siege rams and pals to boot. Hussars are too weak to smash the rams, so I call for help from Sir_Joshula and Dave. He takes out my castle and 5 TCs. Maybe 50 vils dead but together we fight him off. I start immediately to rebuild and build in exactly the same spaces asap. That rush cost his economy dear! He is reeling more than me when I get another 50 hussars in his farm land.

I expand to 5 TCs (one down the south near yellow's old base for the wood - which is now scarce). NoTt_MaG is fighting orange hard and now AssassinDave has recovered and is contributing with Halbs and Skirmishers. I get more barracks and have a constant stream of halberdiers slamming into orange's paladins. Darth Potter has cleared out yellow and is now attacking pink who is a noob but has lots of pesky castles! He also has the trade routes which NoTt_MaG had started attacking with hussars and I continued with Chu Ko Nus and a few scorpions.

*NoTt_MaG:*

&gt; I get about 20 hussars &amp; 10 pals in grey’s base and take out TC, he comes home HARD, all units.

&gt; I move straight to the trade lines and disrupt. I'm low on gold but Sir_Joshula has some to spare. He gives me 3000 gold just as Dave starts getting hand cannons and halbs.

&gt; I drop.    

NoTt_MaG has disconnected. I knew we were going to lose... Me and Dave could hold him back for a time but his onslaught is continuous! 

I have resources though (even though 3000g was just wasted). 

More barracks and castles built down towards pink and I amass another 40 champs with some Chu Ko Nus and some scorpions. I have skirmishers too to try to counter the inevitable mangudai. I go for grey again and also start sending a few units to orange's base (20 champs perhaps that kill villagers and TCs and eventually get killed off). I manage to cripple the trade routes by sitting the Chu Ko's and the scorps in the path. I kill most of grey's army and then eventually he kills my force but I know grey is out for quite a while. Darth Potter has taken out pink now (who quits) but back home he's in trouble because orange is going straight for him with the paladins! I keep the halberdiers flooding in...

I amass another squad. 60 champs, a few chu kos and a few scorps. I don't have much gold left now even though I've been quite good at saving it. I go straight for Orange's heart. 4 TCs taken down in short measure. every villager I see get killed. I then circle round back into Dave's old land and start destroying stables and siege workshops. Meanwhile Darth Potter has turned south and is attacking grey. The tide had finally turned and we came out victorious. A GLORIOUS battle...

4/1/13

**Greetings Kings, Queens and Conquerors from Microsoft Studios!**

We have a short interruption in our scheduled developer diary series today. At least, I have to call it an interruption since I'm not technically a developer. 
I'm Ryan Chaply, (aka Ryz0n), and as the producer on Age of Empires II: HD Edition, I want to spent today chatting about a feature I'm really excited for - user generated content.

We've got an amazing development team at Hidden Path getting the game running on today's machines, and adding a bunch of new features into the mix. But over the past decade, the Age of Empires community and fans have kept the game fresh with innovative maps and creative campaigns. When we set out to create Age of Empires II: HD Edition, we wanted to make sure to incorporate all of the astonishing creativity from our community, both new and old. That meant there were a number of unique challenges we had to address through development.

When it came to the game engine, we'd basically taken a propeller and replaced it with a jet. After some careful exploration, Hidden Path managed to ensure the core data structure from the original games could still be read into the new engine, enabling scenario backwards compatibility. Due to player profile changes, this doesn't apply to saved games and replays, but this does mean the thousands of custom maps, scenarios, and campaigns can be easily replayed right in the new version. Even better, with the new multiplayer experience through Steam, inviting friends to play through your favorite RPG scenario is a snap. Just create a scenario game, shoot your friend an invite and off you go!

**Workshop!**

But this is more than just nostalgia. Over the last few weeks we've seen tons of questions about one of the coolest new features in Age of Empires II: HD Edition, the Steam Workshop. There are many sites out there that have done an amazing job of curating existing AOE II content and mods, but with Steam we saw an opportunity to make it even easier to grab, promote, and share your works of art. 

Let's get the legal warning out of the way first. Please note, any custom content will change the way Age of Empires II: HD Edition runs, so please abide by the warnings before making use of the workshop. (You'll need to agree any time you enter the workshop from the game).

**Adding Workshop Content to your Game**

You've got several different routes to enter the workshop; either from within the game or the steam client itself. No matter how you enter, you'll see the same workshop page for the game, with new items at the top, as well as collections and discussions to peruse. Filter down the list to pick out the mods you want to add, and go ahead and choose one that looks interesting. Our community team will be highlighting the best ones on the launcher from time to time, so keep an eye out!

Once you see something you like, just click on its picture to head to the mod page. There you can vote, discuss the game mod in question, or report it if the content shouldn't be there. To add it to your game, simply hit the 'subscribe' button, exit the game, and Steam will download it directly for you. Next time you launch the game, you'll have the workshop item installed! (Note: You will have to exit the *game client* completely in order for the mod to be recognized).

**Want to remove a mod?**

-Exit the game, enter the workshop and hit unsubscribe on the correct mod.

-Right click AOE II: HD in your library, go to properties, local files, and verify the game cache and Steam will restore the content for you!

-Note: You can subscribe to multiple game mods at once, but if both mods make a change to the same file (ie, two mods which both change the look of farms) the mod downloaded most recently will overwrite the former.

-To help keep your mods straight, the workshop has a feature called collections. Here, you can pick your maps and scenarios, or bundle some new art in place into a single collection to effortlessly share with friends.

**Uploading Content to the Workshop**

Those of you who watched the gameplay reveal the other week (Haven't seen it? Check it out on YouTube!) may remember I showed off ""fish farms"" to show easy it is to change some of the farm textures in game. To all of the corn haters out there, I didn't show how easy it was to upload the content into the workshop, so I'll describe it here.
Uploading content is designed to be easy!

-From within Age of Empires II: HD Edition, click on map editor, and then the ""Steam Workshop"" button. It will bring up a window with a couple of options to easily put a file bundle up on the workshop.

-Hit the appropriately named 'add files' button to open the steam install directory and add any files associated with your game mod. In my fish farm example, I'd clumsily gone into Photoshop and put a bunch of fish in the farm texture .png files.

-Once you pick any files associated with your workshop entrant, all that's left is to name the mod, add a bit of info (for filtering mod types), and choose a stunning photo of the mod for the world to see and entice users to subscribe to your file.

-Hit publish and you too could be sending villagers to farm fish!

Make sure to share your custom content with others, and we'll be keeping an eye on the workshop to highlight some of the best things users make. Remember you can set some mods to be visible only to friends if you want to test out your work, or open it up for everyone to download. Inappropriate workshop items can be reported directly on the game's workshop page so keep it clean folks.

**So..what exactly can I modify here?**

It's actually much easier to talk about what you can't change. You can tweak the vast majority of files in Age of Empires II: HD Edition, with a couple of exceptions. You won't be able to change the main game executable (which is locked through Steam), as well as some dll libraries for the launcher, steam connectivity, video, etc. By default we also protect the main game campaign files, so if you want to create modified campaigns you can, just create your own with different names.

When it comes to the rest of the game content however, the only limitations are creativity and a bit of ingenuity! You can modify the sound files, the ground textures, art, unit files, and more! Some of the data files are packaged like the original and may take a bit of digging, but other areas (some sprites like fire) are actually easier now to modify. Some existing mods will be trivial to bring to the HD Edition, however in other cases a direct port may not be possible.

We realize that one of the largest reasons the community is still so vibrant around Age of Empires II has to do with the flexibility people have had with the game over the last decade. This is a game for the fans, and we're excited to see what this new generation of creativity will usher in!

**What mods can I use with multiplayer games?**

This isn't one that isn't easy to answer, and in fact the real answer is ""it depends."" If you're making changes to the game that don't affect any gameplay, you shouldn't have any issue using them in multiplayer matches. Of course, anything that does change the gameplay, you will likely risk experiencing sync issues when attempting to play with other players. Having said that, if you were to come up with an awesome gameplay mod that a ton of people liked and downloaded, anyone with that mod probably would sync just fine together. Fortunately by working through the Steam environment here, you're able to restore the default game at pretty much any time very quickly should you ever wander off into the mod trail and get lost.

Before signing off here, I want to bring up some netiquette. Please respect the original author / owner of any user generated content. Even content released years ago still deserves credit to the original creator. If you didn't make a mod, get permission before uploading it to the workshop, or better yet, suggest the author uploads it themselves. I've seen hundreds, even thousands of hours of work people have put into their creations, and it's crucial to give them the recognition they deserve.
Hopefully this clears up a bit about the workshop. I can't wait to see what everyone comes up with starting April 5th!

1366406014.0,52,self.aoe2,1cp7y1,What to do when you can't compete militarily in a team game,Mind_Killer,55,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1cp7y1/what_to_do_when_you_cant_compete_militarily_in_a/,"This is going to apply to a very specific group of people. It also won't be perfect. However, after playing a lot of random games with a lot of random people I realize this needs to be said. 

So, lets say you're not that great of a player. It's fine, most of us aren't. But suddenly you find yourself in a team game where everyone seems to be leaving you behind. And then, just because the AoE gods hate you, you're the one getting attacked. You have a decent growing town, but you know you're going to lose. What do you do?

Here are your options in order from least to most helpful, and we're going to start with the two most common, and least helpful, options:

1. You could complain about it over chat. ""Why aren't you guys helping me?"" And ""Do something yellow!"" And ""Sorry I'm not good."" Are all common examples of the least helpful thing you can do. Chances are your teammates know what's happening and are trying to help as best they can, but as the old saying goes... ""Failure to plan on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine."" So please stop doing this. 

2. Quit. This is actually more helpful to your teammates than just staying in the game and whining. If you quit they don't have to try and save you. They also don't have the added pressure of hearing you complain. In the same vein, they're now outnumbered and the pressure to win is that much greater.

Helpful options:

3. Rebuild and try to contribute militarily. If you find yourself being attacked, you need to escape. Rebuild your TC somewhere near your allies and just soldier on. You'll be forever at a disadvantage for the rest of the game, but if you can manage to get out a force of military units you can still be helpful.

4. Rebuild and contribute in indirect ways. Since you'll be far more limited toward advancing your units, you could consider a role as harasser. Use scouts or knights to wreak havoc on your opponents' villagers and economy. That's called revenge, and it feels good. You could also collect relics and prevent your opponents from expanding. These are things your teammates will probably be too busy fighting to do. There are a lot of options here that could actually turn the game back in your team's favor. Keep in mind, however, that all this means you're now going to be draining your teammate's resources. 

The Best (and least used) Option:

5. Rebuild and contribute economically. So you're wiped out and basically just draining the few gold and wood reserves your allies have left, now what? I, personally, feel that the best thing you can and should do is become a resource for your teammates. Since they've got the added pressure of being a man down, they'll also be on the back foot militarily and won't be able to concentrate on their economy macro as much anymore. Given that you probably won't be upgrading your units much anytime soon, and the rest of the game has already proven it can outproduce you, why not feed your allies what they need to succeed? Use the Market the way people rarely do. A regular supply of tribute to keep their military reserves supplied. Create your own super-cart-train and give them the gold. Look at the units your allies are building and try to keep that resource going for them. 

Often it seems like the only time people tribute is when the person doing well is trying to help the defeated get back on their feet. The opposite of that can be way more conducive to a winning formula. In a game where your team is basically fighting 2 versus 3, you're going to get out produced. Wouldn't it be nice to have a surge of extra resources in a situation like that? Instead of having to fight those battles with an even more limited supply?

Turn your weakness into a strength. Instead of being the weak link in the chain, become the anchor. 

I know there's not a lot of direct information here. Just ideas. Maybe ideas you haven't considered. Maybe ideas you don't give a damn about. I don't know. I just know that I like winning, even if I'm outmatched, and I'd like teammates that feel the same way.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,False,,,True,t3_1cp7y1,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1cp7y1/what_to_do_when_you_cant_compete_militarily_in_a/,

1337841454.0,47,self.aoe2,u2eg9,FASTER THAN A TRADE COG LESS ARMOR THAN A GOTHIC HALBERDIER IT'S GAMEPLAY VS HISTORICITY DAY 16: THE CELTS,TheBattler,52,5,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/u2eg9/faster_than_a_trade_cog_less_armor_than_a_gothic/,"**BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAVEHEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!**

WHAT IN THE BLUE FUCK WHERE THEY DOING WITH WILLIAM WALLACE'S TESTICLES AT THE END OF BRAVEHEART!?

Today I'm doing the Celts and what's really weird is that they are the most historically inaccurate civ in the game. Please, if you have more knowledge on the subject than me, correct me if I'm wrong but in particular, the Celts' siege capabilities are greatly exaggerated and to an extent plain made up.

**YO DAWG, THERE BE THREE IMPORTANT CELTICS IN HISTORY. WILLIAM WALLACE, AND BILL RUSSEL AND LARRY BIRD, BITCH.**

In AoE2, the word “Celt” is a broad term used to refer mainly to the people of Scotland but the Celts probably represent the greater Celtic peoples such as the Irish and the Welsh. In Age of Empires 2, the Celts are used to represent the Scots during the William Wallace campaign. They are again used in the Hun campaign to represent the Aquileans for some reason and one more time in the Vinland Saga scenario to represent the native Newfoundlanders. For some reason, the developers decided to not use the Celts in the Joan of Arc campaign, even though the Scots helped the French during the Hundred Year's War and they could have shown up as an allied force during the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Joan of Arc campaigns and it would have made for a cool transition from the William Wallace campaigns like how Saladin shows up in the Barbarossa campaign and vice versa (well, Barbarossa's forces are mentioned but never make it to the Holy Land).

Taken broadly, the Celts were probably the first groups of people in Europe. At some point they migrated from the Indo-European homeland and went West. The word “Celt” comes from Greek, and may refer to a singular Celtic tribe. The word “Gaul” is almost synonymous and comes from Latin, which would also probably refer to another Celtic tribe, and also refers to the region today we call France. The Celts and the Gauls inhabited most of continental Europe as well as the British Isles and had conflicts with both the Greeks and the Romans. The Dark Ages could be seen as a drastic shift in power from the Celts, Latins, and Greeks to the Germanic peoples. By the Middle Ages, the people whom we refer to as “Celts” were reduced to Scotland, Ireland,  Wales, Cornwall, the Isle of Man, and Brittany or what people refer to today as the “Celtic Nations.”

During the Middle Ages the, majority of peoples on the British Isles were Celts with those inhabiting England having been mixed with Romans in an ethnic and cultural sense. Then came the Germanic invasions and groups such as the Jutes, Saxons, Angles, etc. settled the area and mixed with the population who would become the English, and furthermore Vikings and Normans came and mixed with them, as well. There is a documented flight of Celtic groups to the British Isles from mainland Europe during the Germanic migration and I'm sure the AoE2 devs wanted the player to be able to create scenarios about Celtic tribes fighting against Germanic tribes in the early Dark Age.

In the Dark Ages, the Kingdom of Alba formed in Scotland while Ireland was actually pretty renowned for it's learning. The Monks had preserved, copied, and translated many Latin books and many other peoples came to Ireland to learn. During the Viking Age, many Vikings settled in Ireland and Scotland and intermingled with their Celtic subjects, founding towns and integrating.

Scotland is pretty much defined by getting their asses handed to them by the English time and again. While the English can never quite take Scotland by force for very long, the Scots could never really engage in an offensive themselves. Ireland is very similar to a lesser degree; as an actual island apart from the rest it was more difficult to invade and keep.
	
The Scots were pretty cool after the Middle Ages for being the first place The Enlightenment started, but in the Middle Ages it was kind of meh. I dunno, personally I like the civs who have more cultural clashes than the insular civs like the Celts and the Japanese but Scotland and Ireland are in existence today.

The Celts are related and fought many battles with the Britons, they are sort of related to the Byzantines, fought against the “Goths” (Saxons), fought against the Vikings, and allied with the French.

**BONUSES UP IN THIS BITCH**

* Siege Weapons fire +20% faster

Siege is the Celt's main trait and...I don't think this is at all historically accurate. The Celts seem to be very inaccurate. I looked every where, and nobody describes the medieval Celts (Welsh, Scots, Irish) as using much siege engines, let alone rivaling the Mongols. It would be more accurate if the Celts had no siege weapons! However, given the large number of Infantry civs already in the game, it would be pretty boring if the Celts were purely Infantry like they are in real life. So I feel like the Scots were given stronger Siege Weapons not just to make them different but to have different gameplay from the rest of the civs; at the time, they were the only true Siege civ, with the Turks having higher HP Bombard Cannons and the Mongols having an anti-Siege unit that paved the way for their own, well-rounded Siege tech tree. But for certain, this bonus is not historically accurate, at least not according to the multiple history websites on the internet I have access to.

* Infantry move +15% faster

This bonus makes it so that Celtic Infantry is faster than everybody else's Infantry...sort of. Berserks and Huskarls are still really fast and outrun Celtic Champs and are equal in speed to Celtic Halbs. Anyway, the Celts were known for their guerrilla tactics. Versus Archers, this helps quite a bit and even sluggish Champions can hold their own against Archers. Obviously Halberdiers have an easier time catching Cavalry. The Celts in real life were known for their guerilla warfare; running into battle for a raid, and then running away to cover and doing this repeatedly. They would harass their enemies, most specifically the English, and reduce their morale.

*  Lumberjacks chop wood +15% faster

There isn't an exact truth to this tech, but it isn't false, either. Scotland is home to many forests and wood was pretty important for all Europeans. You could have given this bonus to pretty much any European civ and it would have made sense in the context of AoE; this bonus gives broad benefits to farms, buildings, and military units. Europeans cleared large tracts of land for their farms and buildings, so the Teutons, Franks, Vikings, Britons and to an extent the Spanish can exchange their economic bonuses with the Celts and it would make sense. However the Celts have stronger siege weapons so this is a good gameplay bonus and the word “Celt” evokes sort of a forest and nature and shit, and that might have contributed to giving the Celts this bonus.

* Sheep are not converted if within 1 Celt unit's LoS

This is the economic bonus that is pretty specifically Celtic. The British Isles were famous for their large numbers of Sheep and as a workshop for the wool trade, so their Sheepherders were obviously skilled in proportion. Celtic villagers were holdouts and centers of resistance against the English crown, so it makes sense for the Celts to be able to hold onto their resources in the face of enemy soldiers (like Scout Cavalry).

* TEAM BONUS: Siege Workshops work +20% faster

Another bonus to make the Celts THE Siege civ. I sort of like to think of the Celts as an “alternate British civ,” as the British were more famous for their Siege than the Celts were, and their bonuses are fairly similar. Obviously this bonus gives them a parallel to the Britons and the Goths, the Wood bonus is somewhat analogous to the Town Center bonus, the Sheep bonuses are analogous, and the Siege and Archery bonuses are somewhat similar in that the Britons fire more shots at their enemy due to their range while the Celtic siege weapons outright fire more often.

Thats quite a number as opposed to the 4,000 before HD. I know a lot a lot don't play MP, but there are quite a few that do. I know most of them are newer and not as experienced, just like very experienced players were when we started playing way back when. Obviously most of the buyers were going to be new, otherwise they would have been on Voobly. So I'm kind of confused as to why some people expected every HD player to be on par with the veterans on Voobly. 

Anyway, the fact of the matter is there is a huge player base on HD right now, and we aren't taking advantage of it. The best way to right now is STREAM. I know a lot of you can, and some of you do, but most don't. To get a community growing, you have to be apart of it. You don't even have to stream HD, because there isn't a HD version and regular AoC to choose from on Twitch. Just a couple days ago, some guy streamed and didn't even know farms produced food, it was his first time but he had 200 viewers.

I've started streaming a couple days ago, getting viewer games as well as laddering in, and people watched. I've also started a Steam group specifically for tournaments I will host with different rating placements (IE base 1400-1601 rating is it's separate tournament, and so on) (I also know the ratings are kind of useless because some players are arguably better than their rating but it's the fairest way I could come up with). I will be happy to cough up some Amazon gift cards for the prizes and what not (who doesn't like Amazon) Just to get a community thing going. This is the place I thought I'd announce it.

Will AoC become a one community thing (all at Voobly or all at the HD version)? Probably not. But really, it doesn't matter as long as the community is thriving. Viewers on Twitch, streamers interacting with viewers etc etc. As a matter of fact, I think I heard Viper just got partnered on Twitch, so the viewers are there. 

I really want the community to grow, and last. I hope you guys do too, and strive to become a not only bigger but better community within Voobly and Steam.

1374262878.0,43,self.aoe2,1ingzj,Beta patch 2.5 is now live!,Cheesydude,48,5,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1ingzj/beta_patch_25_is_now_live/,"&gt;http://steamcommunity.com/app/221380/discussions/1/864973919378660441/

&gt;Steam should automatically update your game from 2.3 to 2.5. If you have been running the 2.5 beta, the beta will disappear today and you will be moving to official 2.5 directly (Verify the game cache if you don’t see an update downloaded). As always, if you have any issues – first try creating a new player profile from within the game.

&gt;I’ve been jumping between 2.3 and 2.5 quite a bit over the last few days, and I think a lot of players will see some great improvements to the game. Again all of the patch notes below are between 2.3 and 2.5 since the vast majority of players will be making this jump next time they sign in. For the particularly astute, there are a few changes between beta 2.5 and the official release as well, including a performance improvement aimed squarely at the command lag. This feels like one of the most significant non-beta patches we’ve had since launch and we’re excited to have you check it out!

&gt;Read on for all of the details:

**Full list of Patch Notes (from 2.3)**

&gt;**Tech tree:**
&gt;&gt;* Implementation of unique unit with purple legend entry, and purple boxes for all unique units. Make sure any unique unit is not visible by more than one civ.
&gt;&gt;* Tech tree should show up properly at all scales on both the left and right side. There were several clipping bugs when the window was at a 4:3 aspect ratio.
&gt;&gt;* Scrolling to the left or right in windowed mode should feel right. Before it would only scroll in some cases when you were well outside the window boundaries.
&gt;&gt;* Scrolling should be disabled when you are close to the bottom of the window so it doesn’t interfere with resizing.
&gt;&gt;* Scroll and close buttons are always centered now in any resolution/aspect ratio.

&gt;**Gameplay**
&gt;&gt;**Maximum Selection Size**

&gt;&gt;    * Increased from 40 (2.3) to 60 (2.5). Backed down from 200 in 2.4beta due to aforementioned reasons

&gt;&gt;**Hotkeys** 

&gt;&gt;    * Reverted hotkey changes from 2.3 that caused incorrectly functioning shift + alt control group commands
&gt;&gt;    * You can now hotkey groups 0-9. (An added control group over the original 1-9)
&gt;&gt;    * The hotkey reset button will not scroll the menu to the top of the screen anymore
&gt;&gt;    * Clicking reset hotkeys will restore the key to the default instead of making there be no hotkey for the item.

&gt;**Localization** 
&gt;&gt;* English strings are no longer locked inside language.dll, but use language_base.txt. Other languages will be converted to this new system in upcoming patches.
&gt;&gt;**Steam Stats / Achievements** 
&gt;&gt;* Single Battle Buildings Razed stat and Single Battle Buildings Lost stat was incorrectly using units lost and has been corrected. These stats/achievements will be reset on the official 2.5 release

&gt;**Cheats** 
&gt;&gt;* From 2.3, cheats for wood, food, gold, and stone are now 10,000 instead of 1,000 and should reduce the wear and tear on your ctrl + v keys.

&gt;**Lobby / Quickmatch**
&gt;&gt;* Quickmatch should match players with the closest applicable ELO ratings and should use DM or RM ratings depending on which mode is selected.
&gt;&gt;* You can now adjust the speed of quick match games. It was getting stuck on Normal whenever you readied yourself.
&gt;&gt;* Lobby games are now sorted properly, with games on top reported closest to host according to Steam.
&gt;&gt;* Regional settings for lobbies will be primarily based on your Steam download region settings, thus unsurprisingly it is recommended to select the download location closest to you.
&gt;&gt;* You can filter lobbies and quickmatch by regional settings including: 
&gt;&gt;    * Worldwide Shows everyone on the patch
&gt;&gt;    * Far Within a continent or two roughly.
&gt;&gt;    * Regional Your region and surrounding regions
&gt;&gt;    * Close Only games in the same region as you
&gt;&gt;* Additional information in the lobby browser. Clicking once on a game will display added info including: 
&gt;&gt;    * Names of players in game
&gt;&gt;    * ELO of players in game for the associated gametype
&gt;&gt;    * Indication of whether the game is RM or DM
&gt;&gt;    * Other misc information (i.e. scenario name)
&gt;&gt;* Double click to join a game lobby

&gt;**Performance changes from 2.3** 
&gt;&gt;* Internal frame rate is capped at 60 (from 20).
&gt;&gt;* User interface updates 10 times per second as opposed to once per second. (mini-map, progress bars, etc)
&gt;&gt;* Introduced pixel smooth scrolling over “half-tile” scrolling. You may want to adjust your scrolling speed options if you find it is too slow.
&gt;&gt;* Reduced “Command Lag”. This is new to the final 2.5 build. Previous builds (including 2.5beta) presented an optimized terrain rendering issue any time a building completed construction or a farm was placed. Previously, it would trigger a full regeneration of the map’s 3D terrain. As a result, this was introducing a significant “command lag” and undesirable performance tax. This was especially prevalent with rapid placement of farms. The official 2.5 patch has resolved the issue by regenerating only the affected terrain instead of the entire map. 
&gt;&gt;If you encounter any issues with frame rate unlocks, you can revert to the original behavior by running the game with -ORIGFPS. You can right click on Age of Empires II: HD Edition in Steam, go to properties. Then click on Set Launch Options and enter -ORIGFPS. It will remember this setting, so you may eventually want to remove it later

&gt;**Leaderboards &amp; ELO Ratings**
&gt;&gt;The ELO calculations have been completely rewritten from the live version in 2.3 and follow the old MS Zone calculations. These boards will be reset again at the go-live for 2.5. Here are the known rules 

&gt;&gt;* Leaderboard ELO calculations are only considered for games that contain exactly two teams and no AI players. Any other combinations of teams are not considered for ELO calculations, such as a 3 player free for all

&gt;&gt;    * There are two separate ranked leaderboards which encompass the following: 
&gt;&gt;    * Deathmatch games will be ranked on the DM leaderboard.
&gt;&gt;    * Random Map, Turbo RM, King of the Hill, Regicide, Defend the Wonder, and Wonder Race are part of the RM leaderboard.
&gt;&gt;    * Any other mode will not be considered for ELO score calculations and is unranked, such as custom scenarios.

&gt;&gt;* There is a minimum time that a ranked game requires before the game will be officially calculated on the leaderboard. 2 minutes for DM and 5 minutes for RM. Games under those time limits are considered pre-maturely completed and are not scored.

&gt;&gt;* A pre-game penalty is deducted for starting any ranked match. The 3 points is refunded back at the end of the game whether you win, lose, resign, or quit, irregardless of the time limits for determining whether an
&gt;&gt;ELO calculation kicks in (5 minutes RM, 2 minutes DM). It is designed to penalize players that pull the network plug to avoid finishing games.

&gt;&gt;* Any MP game that is saved and restored later will be considered an unranked game to avoid exploitation.
&gt;&gt;We are now tracking additional stats per leaderboard that will detect players that exploit disconnections. This information is accessible now to 3rd party websites, and may be displayed in future patches.

&gt;**Crash Fixes**

&gt;&gt;* We have fixed a random crash affecting Windows XP users involving issuing move orders – which could cause games to occasionally crash during gameplay.

&gt;**Known Issues**

&gt;&gt;* It is **highly recommended** when moving to the beta build (or when upgrading between builds) to create a new player profile to avoid any potential conflicts during the upgrade. You can do so within the game by going to options, deleting the current profile, and creating a new one.

&gt;&gt;* If you do a fresh install of AOE II HD after having the game on your system, in certain circumstances text may appear to vanish from in-game. This is a result of font files in the steam folder needing to be read on startup. (Windows thinks you got rid of the fonts and didn’t initialize them again when you re-downloaded the game). Simply restart your machine and the text will re-appear.

&gt;&gt;* We are tracking several rare crashes across multiple versions on windows XP during campaign play and will continue to investigate to improve stability.

&gt;&gt;* For some players the steam overlay may present a significant framerate drop when visible. We’re looking into this, but if you wish to disable the overlay in the game’s properties simply uncheck “enable steam community in game”. 

&gt;&gt;* Please ensure you are using a copy legitimately purchased through official retail channels (Amazon, Steam, GameStop, etc) and downloaded through Steam when attempting to play AOE II HD.

I am a scenario maker that have made a lot of multiplayer scenarios for Age of Empires 2: The Conquerors. After playing this new HD Edition for a few hours and playing some custom scenarios that were made for the old 1.0c game, I've found some bugs and glitches. Some are just visually weird and some kind of ruins the gameplay of some scenarios. Here are a few examples:

When using the invisible object trick by changing the unit frame in Trigger Studio to 4294936223 (http://i.imgur.com/0mxmiyD.png) the object became invisible in the old 1.0c version of the game, like this: http://i.imgur.com/O7s3o62.jpg. But in the new HD Edition, the units are visible in game, like this: http://i.imgur.com/1q8iHp3.png. In this case, the unit is meant to kick another player from the game if deleted. If the object is invisible, only player 1 can select it by pressing the idle military button. So when player 1 resigns, his allies will not be able to delete the unit. In HD Edition, the objects are only randomly invisible, but mostly they are not, so if player 1 resigns, the other players can kick each others.

Shoreless water data has been changed so the blending of the terrains around it is completely different from the old 1.0c version of the game. This is how it looks like in the old 1.0c game: http://i.imgur.com/fB3NTz3.jpg, and this is how it looks in the new HD Edition: http://i.imgur.com/qirIqfE.jpg. As you can see, the blending of the grass and water are completely different. Also, the shoreless water lacks the water animation that the other new water terrains has. Some more examples where the blending looks weird, here making it look like you can walk around the obstacles, but you can't:

Old, http://i.imgur.com/ZD6mWp0.png, vs new, http://i.imgur.com/bClPFcl.jpg

Invincible units with 0HP is also a well-known trick used in many scenarios, including many of my own. In HD Edition, the HP appears to be -2147483648 instead of 0. Many scenarios use the invincible unit trick for counting different things in scenarios, for example in CBAv9 it is used on a king as a kill-counter. Here's how it looks in HD Edition: http://i.imgur.com/iLKs1eK.png, while it should look like this like it does in 1.0c: http://i.imgur.com/ZoFas5S.png.

Farm terrains have changed too much, causing its use in older scenarios to look strange. It was quite common to mix the different farm terrains with each other to make it look a little better. It is also quite common to mix dead farm with dirt 1 terrain in the old game. In the HD Edition, these terrains look quite odd when put together and the blending is different when mixing it with shoreless water. Old game example: http://i.imgur.com/TKf6Mjw.jpg, and how it looks in the HD Edition: http://i.imgur.com/3iVTPBt.jpg.

Some other bugs that I've found and should be looked at:

When tabbing out of the scenario editor of the HD Edition causes the cursor to disappear. Cursor is really small when holding the mouse over a resource to task a villager to gather. And taking mapshots results in a black .bmp with only the relics visible and screenshots resulting in only the UI visible and the ""game"" itself is black.

Buildings are visible through fog of war as shown here:

1364342191.0,46,self.aoe2,1b2rwt,A 1v1 scenario that's easy to set up and can last hours and hours - I call it Island Advantage.,OhTheTallOne,47,1,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1b2rwt/a_1v1_scenario_thats_easy_to_set_up_and_can_last/,"A few months ago I came up with the idea for a scenario that's incredibly simple, incredibly stupid, can last a very long time, but is always worth a go if you fancy it.


HOW TO SET UP:
Go to scenario editor, generate a random map based off Islands or Team Islands for two player, and fill in the correct starting resources/pop cap. Now, you'll have a normal islands game.

However, this is where the Advantage comes in: simply draw around your enemy's coastline in deep water, preventing building of a dock. And that's all there is to it.

Now, this may seem completely stupid, but i suggest imposing a no-invading rule until about an hour in to ensure the enemy is good and defended. The objective when you begin this type of game is attrition. They will have no navy but a pure, focused boom and defend going on in their island with most resources consumed. Although you could invade earlier, it kinda defeats the purpose and removes any challenge - you'll just be rushing like usual, but without the threat of retaliation.


I've played this game type twice, once alone and once with a friend (both controlling P1 against a single AI) and both times it was very difficult. Custom AIs at high difficulties will have armies patrolling just waiting for your landing boats and islands covered in castles, meaning breaking through can be hard, even with your 'Island Advantage'. The last match took us almost 6 hours spread over a couple of days.

If anyone tries this, tell me what you think! 
Disclaimer: I'm fully aware it's completely moronic.

AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW GOTH DAMN, I'M GONNA BE DOIN' THE GOTHS TODAY. I PROMISED YA'LL THAT I'D BE ON THIS 

SHIT MORE OFTEN, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE I'M A LITTLE TOO SLOW BUT THAT'S AIIGHT I'LL KEEP TRYING.


**GOTH DAMN GOTHERFUCKER, YOU LOVE DAT GOTHIC HISTORY DON'T YA?**

The Goths of AoE2 specifically represent a group of Germanic peoples who migrated into Roman Europe around the beginning of the 3rd century. However, I feel like the Goths of AoE2 more broadly represent many semi-nomadic Germanic tribes, including the Vandals, Lombards, Alamanni, Gepids, etc. In AoE2, you first see the Goths filling in for Slavic tribes; you encounter the Goths as the ""Russians"" in the 4th Ghengis Khan scenario, then the Goths as the Poles in the 5th scenario. In the Barbarossa campaign, you fight against the Austrians, who are represented Goths, and then the Polish, once again represented by the Goths. Finally, the Saxons during the Norman Invasion of 1066 Battle of Hastings scenario are represented by the Goths. I like to think that early on in AoE2's development, the developers wanted to include the Slavs but felt that the gameplay ideas that they had for an Infantry flood civilization suited the Goths more.

As I've pointed out before in these, AoE2 is a eurocentric game on purpose. Japanese ""Cavaliers"" sporting feudal heraldry? Riiiight. But when cultures clash, they each view the other on their own terms. A French guy somehow encountering a Japanese army would believe that their armored riders are very similar to their own, and lacking the language of their opponents, they would refer to them as Cavaliers. So too with the Goths, except the Goths are viewed from the perspective of the Latin peoples of the Roman Empire.

We know the Goths migrated out of somewhere in Southern Sweden or so, and there is an island off the coast of Sweden bearing the name of ""Gotland."" The culture of the Goths is very similar to that of the Norweigens, Swedish, Danish, Saxons, and other early Germanic peoples. They settled in present-day Poland, Ukraine, and Russia and were recruited by the Romans into their army as auxillaries. In fact, many Goths fought against the Persians in the Roman wars with them. The Goths were then pushed into Roman lands by the invading Huns, along with many other Germanic groups.

The Goths had split into groups led by the Tervingi and the Greuthungi. The Tervingi called themselves ""Vesi,"" which means ""Good"" or ""worthy"" in Gothic. Thus, they were the ""Worthy Goths."" The Greuthungi were called ""Ostrogoths"" or ""east Goths"" or ""Rising Sun Goths"" by Romans. The Ostrogoths, as you can tell by their name, were mostly active in the Eastern part of Europe, although they did end up in many parts of Western Europe and the Visigoths were active around western Europe, though they were all over the place, as well. These two groups had their own succession of Kings and they fought each other constantly. The Visigoths often found a bit more favor with the Romans, having been ""given"" Spain (the Romans asked for their help in taking it from other Germanic tribes but the Goths were basically independant) while the Ostrogoths and Romans were pretty much at each other's throats for ever.

The Romans and Goths had numerous battles, and the Visigoths, Vandals, and Ostrogoths all managed to reach Rome and attack it, quickly raiding, entering, and raiding the city. For a while, most of the old Roman possessions were held by these Germanic tribes; the Visigoths had Spain and parts of France, the Ostrogoths had Italy, the Vandals in North Africa, and the Franks in present-day France.

The Italian Gothic kingdom was invaded by the Byzantines under Justinian, who obviously came as a Roman liberator. Justinian conquered Italy, but then the peninsula fell again to another Germanic group, the Lombards. The Vandal Kingdom was reconquered by Justinian, as well, but fell later to the Arabs. The Visigothic kingdom in Spain actually managed to stay standing well into the Middle Ages timeframe. Most of Spain was conquered by the Arabs, Moors, and Berbers and the Gothic Kingdom of Asturias was left in the North by the 8th century. It was a very Latinized kingdom, however, and it planted the seeds for the idea of a ""Reconquista,"" to bring Latin culture such as Catholicism, the Monarchy, Feudalism, etc. back to the entire Iberian Peninsula.

A group of Goths living in Crimea (a peninsula in the Black Sea, south of European Russia) were left behind after the Hunnic invasion, the remnants of an old Gothic kingdom. They managed to stay culturally distinct from the invading and conquering Huns, Byzantines, Tatars, and Slavs.

The Goths occasionally fought with and was incorporated into the Hunnic and Byzantine Empires, and also fought the Persians. They were forerunners to many tribes who would be incorporated into the Frankish and Teutonic Holy Roman Empires, as well as the forerunner kingdom to the Spanish kingdoms. The Visigoths fought the Saracens, as well, and if we were to expand the idea of the Goths in AoE2 to mean most of the semi-nomadic Germanic tribes during the migration period, then it was the ""Goths"" who invaded the British Isles, fighting with the Celts and each other. The Goths are related to the Vikings, and the Mongols, Turks, and other Turkic groups encountered the Crimean Goths, as well.

**THESE BONUSES BE SO BLACK THEY GOTHIC**

* Infantry cost -25% starting in Feudal Age

This bonus is the starting point to the Goths' entire playstyle, and it's either a huge historical innacuraccy, or a minor historical ambiguity depending on your interpretation of the bonus. The way the Goths are played implies that the Goths fought in huge Infantry formations, overwhelming their enemies. They are the Zergs of AoE2 and if you took AoE2 as pure, unadulterated history, you'd think that the Goths were the historical Zergs of the world. They actually were not, very far from it. The semi-nomadic lifestyle of many peoples in the worlds does not lend well to huge populations. The urban societies such as the Romans and Chinese had the biggest populations because they had stable food source, and also had the time and energy to invest in stuff like medicine. Historically, the Goths never had a numbers advantage, at least not due to their lifestyle (obviously, depending on the battle they would have the numbers advantage). The Romans in particular almost always outnumbered them. HOWEVER, many proud, recording keeping civilizations at the time had a habit of exaggerating the enemy force so that in victory they would seem heroic and in loss they would have an excuse. So the Romans depicted themselves as grave, disciplined legionnaries fighting huge barbarian forces. But we know for plain facts that the Goths could not sustain huge populations like the Romans could, and we know that the Romans frequently played with numbers. Funnily enough, the Mongols displayed a sort of reverse version of this; they were a semi-nomadic civ who never had the numbers advantage, but they decided to play up the enemy forces anyway for the sake of propaganda. It wasn't enough for them to be outnumbered 1 to 2, they had to be outnumbered 1 to 4. Anyyyywhoooo, the second interpreation, which the game manual inconsistently hints at, is that the Goths were simply able to turn their civillian population into a huge fighting force in a small period of time.

For those of you who do not know what [Elo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) is, it is a rating system originally invented to calculate the relative skill of chess players, but can be extended to any competitive game and is usually used in the gaming community.

With the new update 2.6, which I still see no announcement for, we now have the Elo rating of each player indicated next to the name in the lobby of the game. I am really hoping that, once the number of games played by the users goes up so that all our scores come to an equilibrium, this will really improve online play.

**Update**: Almost simultaneous to my post, an announcement went online!

Read all the improvements there, including:
&gt; * Detailed ELO information can be displayed in the main menu while in the multiplayer section. You can mouse over it for even more detailed information. 
&gt; * ELO rankings now show up in the lobbies, and update appropriately depending on mode.
&gt; * Whenever you complete a match, you will get details about how your ELO rankings were effected. It will also detail reasons why ELO rankings wouldn't have changed too, such as playing a game containing AIs, or aborting a match before the time limit elapsed.

Bugs:

- Mouse does not lock to game. Using dual monitors, I should be able use the game on one monitor without the cursor going off to the other. I should not need a third party application to do this.
- Showing the scoreboard lags the game very badly.
- Very often, when someone resigns and leaves the ""Multiplayer status"" comes up. Most of the time, when everyone clicks ""Continue Game"" it will not continue and everyone has to quit.
- Random crashes (seg faults?) and out of syncs
- Every game I play my wins increase by 1 and my losses increase by 1? Assuming ""Ranked match victories: x / y"" where x is wins and y is losses.

Bad Design:

- What is my rating? What is the rating of other players? How am I supposed to get a fair game? Let's assume it is 6 months down the road and all the ratings have balanced out. It is not possible to organize a game at the correct skill level because I don't know the ratings of other people. Every game I play the skill levels will be skewed so badly that it isn't fun for anyone.
- Why are the values I enter for quick match so arbitrary? What if I want to do a 3v3 or 4v4? What's the point in selecting civilization here?
- Why is game speed forced to be fast in quick match? Watch any recording of any Random Map game or any tournament and it is always normal game speed. Ask the pros (TheViper, DauT, ..) or anyone with some experience. Normal is the *normal* game speed.
- Need separate lobby browsers for Random Map and Custom Scenario...

People play this game for multiplayer, the matchmaking should be the game's pride and joy. If the matchmaking is going to be this half-assed then give us an API and the community will do the rest.

**Hun Building Set to Slavic Set**

1 - Look at the Slavic building set and tell me that it wouldn't fit the Huns really well, or at least fit them better than the Germanic set. Imagine the Tarkans wielding their torches wearing their heavy animal furs prancing around that gloomy ass Castle.

2 - The ""heartlands"" of the Hunnic Empire was the part of the world where the Slavs lived: present-day Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ukraine.

3 - Even today there are many Turkic tribes living in European Russia. The Huns disappeared from Europe completely after the 6th century but their cousins did not. After they were gone Europe was invaded by the Bulgars and Avars, and the Khazars, Cumens, Kipchaks, Kazakhs, and Cossacks (sort of Turkic) all stayed around European Russia well into the ""Imperial Age."" Making their building set similar to the Slavs would imply a continuity between the Huns and those people who neighbored the Slavs.

**Spanish and Byzantine Set Into Italian Set**

1 - The Western European set is based on England's architecture. It doesn't make much sense for the Spanish.

2 - In a similar vein, the Middle Eastern set is based mostly on Arab architecture. Byzantine architecture was similar to Arabian architecture in some ways, but it was more of the Arabs imitating the Byzantines.

3 - The Spanish would make more sense with the Italian architecture set, and also partly because many buildings are clearly based off of the Middle Eastern set. It makes sense for Spanish buildings to look similar to the Saracens, who are frequently used to represent the Moors.

4 - Obviously, the Italians and Byzantines are both descendents of the Romans. Italy's beautiful architecture is partly a result of Byzantines teaching the Italians. In this way, the Italian architecture style is descended from the Byzantine style and as I mentioned before, the Italian set looks similar to the Saracen one so you could finally infer that the Saracens imitated the Byzantines. Byzantine Churches look vaguely more like the Mosques than they do the Italian Churches but that's a price to pay for having the overall look more accurate.

**Indian Set**

Nobody's expecting you to make everything perfect in one go, and I will especially explain what I mean in a sec. You guys should totally [use this as a base](http://aok.heavengames.com/blacksmith/showfile.php?fileid=5376&amp;ci=eab487c4aa5a2bddb26f8f0432c2e376YToxOntpOjA7YToyOntpOjA7czoxNDoiU2VhcmNoIFJlc3VsdHMiO2k6MTtzOjM1OiJsaXN0ZXIucGhwP3N0YXJ0PTAmYW1wO3NlYXJjaD1pbmRpYSI7fX0=).

However that Indian set is not 100% complete yet and I don't think the author will complete it. So it will take alot of time for your graphics guys to finish it: with the Huns and Spanish thing, I'm assuming it's a much more simple effort of changing the folders and pathnames that the game accesses. But you should definitely use it as a framework.

With that done...

**Adding New Stuff In the Future**

I originally had wrote a bit suggesting a new civ but I realize that's kind of stupid.

What I really want to know is the possibility of adding to the expansion.

I remember reading apost on aokheaven's forums a long time ago from an Ensemble Studios dev and he implied that there's a limited amount of room for extra civs and map editor units. Is that true?

FE didn't add a far eastern civ, and my suggestion would have been the Khmer but that's unimportant.

**Renaming Unique Techs**


* Celtic UT: Strongholds -&gt; Turtithe

Furor Celtica is Latin and the Celts need a Tech in Gaelic! Turtithe means ""Tower Houses,"" which are actually the equivalent of Keeps. In real life, the Irish and Scots built a ton of these instead of big fat Castles that cost 650 Stone but you can't create Woad Raiders from Keeps so this will have to do.

* Mayan UT: Tlatoani -&gt; Tal Ka'ak Tumen Pa

Tlatoani is the Nahuatl word for their ruler. The Mayans are definitely not a Nahua people. My lack of knowledge of Mayan grammar notwithstanding, Tal Ka'ak Tumen Pa means ""To Make Use of Fire For the Purpose of Razing (a town),"" which is exactly what the attack bonus of the archers against buildings implies.

* Italian UT: Silk Road -&gt; Monopolio

This implies the strength of the Italian UT more than simply ""Silk Road."" The Italians had a near monopoly on the spice trade from the Silk Road for centuries and the fact that Silk Road reduces their Trade Carts to 50% cost implies their practice of wildly inflating the price of their goods when they sell them back to the other European because of their Monopoly. Furthermore, the word Monopoly comes from the Greek ""Mono"" and the ""polein"" to sell. This implies a continuity with the Byzantine Greek and Egyptian Greek world, from whom the Italians got their stuff.

* Teutons UT: Ironclads -&gt; Wagenburg

The Bohemians would use Wagons to as mobile fortifications and would frequently put artillery in these Wagons for protection. See where I'm going with this? The Teutons called them Wagenburg. Since we're never going to get Slavic War Wagons and the Bohemians seem to be considered Teutons (their descendants are the Czechs and Slovaks, who identify as Slavs) by way too many people, this is a good word to use for tougher Siege weapons. The Germans would later adopt some of these tactics, just not in the Castle Age where this tech is available. Also, ""Ironclad"" is almost universally used to refer to ships. :-\

* Mongol UT: Nomads -&gt; Yurts

I think with the Hun bonus, we're supposed to imagine them sleeping in invisible Yurts that are easily moved around. So too, with the Mongols.

* Viking UT: Chieftains -&gt; Shield Wall

Chieftains doesn't really make much sense. Shield Wall is one of the few documented Viking tactics used to combat cavalry.

* Hun UT: Marauders -&gt; Ataxia

Ataxia sort of means ""chaos"" and usually refers to a medical condition where one suffers from involuntary muscle twitches. I chose this name because it's sort of a synonym of Anarchy, the Gothic tech which has a similar effect, and it's also similar to the Gothic technology Perfusion, which refers to blood being delivered to a capillary bed.

* Inca UT: Andean Slings -&gt; Ayllo

An Ayllo is an Andean Sling.

* Indian UT: Sultans -&gt; Oceanic Trade

There's very, very little reference to the humongous trade network in the Indian Ocean in Age of Empires 2 but it was just as important as the Silk Road. 

* Magyar UT: Recurve Bow -&gt; Saggittis Hungarorum

I dunno, I personally sort of assumed Cavalry Archers are already armed with Recurve Bows. Saggittis Hungarorum is kind of similar to Furor Celtica, it's a Latin phrase. But unlike Furor Celtica, Saggittis Hungarorum has actual meaning: there's a Latin prayer popular in the Middle Ages ""Saggittis Hungarorum libera nos Domine,"" which means ""Lord, deliver us from the arrows of the Hungarians.""",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1357140220.0,,Blank,True,t3_15t9j1,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/15t9j1/a_few_nonbalance_suggestions_for_the_fe_team/,

**EYYYY VILLA, YA'LL NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE KOREANS FIRST MANG**

The Korean civ in AoE2 is most likely based off of the Joseon Dynasty of 1392-1897., along with some influences from the Goguryeo and Goryeo. The earliest Korean state was that of the Gojoseon, or the historian name of ""Ancient Joseon"" to differentiate it from the Joseon Dynasty.

The Gojoseon are in Age of Empires 1 spelled as Choson (Joseon). The earliest medieval Korean state is the Goguryeo dynasty of 37 BC to 668 CE. The Goryeo Dynasty ruled most of Korea from 918 to 1392, and it is from them we get the name of Korea from.

Before the Goryeo unification of the peninsula, there was the ""3 Kingdoms Period of Korea"" where the Baekje and Silla were in the south and Goguryeo in the north as the most dominant state. Relations between the three kingdoms usually consisted of two allying against the third. The Silla would also frequently bring the Tang Dynasty of China into conflicts, while the Baekje had Japan. Silla took over most of the peninsula after destroying the Baekje but broke down into civil war. The founder of the Goryeo Dynasty, Wang Geon, in turn conquered the Silla. To end the Middle Ages a rebel General took control of Korea to establish the Joseon Dynasty.

The polities of the Korean peninsula had to frequently deal with the Chinese and the semi-nomadic peoples such as the Mongols, Jurchens, and Manchu. They were almost like an eastern Byzantine Empire in that they were frequently attacked but rarely yielded. It was the Chinese who helped the Silla Dynasty reach the height of it's power and they would occupy portions of the peninsula many times only to be driven out. The Mongols invaded many times and conquered the Koreans who would nonetheless keep autonomy. The Jurchens were constant enemies and their Manchu descendants would conquer China and try to take Korea as well, only to fail.

Korea has also had an interesting relationship to Japan; the Baekje Dynasty were close allies of the Yamato and when they lost their territories to the Silla, they fled to Japan. The Japanese then organized an invasion of Korea to help Baekje reclaim their kingdom that ultimate failed.

The Koreans borrowed heavily from Chinese culture and transmitted it to Japan, to whom they are related at least by language. They also fought the Mongols many times. Korea's inclusion in AoE2 is great because like the Japanese they were so confined and remote that matchups like the Koreans vs the Mayans or Koreans vs the Byzantines could have never happened in real life.

**ANYONG HASEYO KOREAN BONUSEs BITCH**

* Villagers +3 LoS

If you look at it at face value, there's no reason for the Koreans to get this bonus. Korean people don't have better eyesight than most people of the world, do they? Gameplay-wise, it's obvious the devs wanted to give the Koreans a more general economic bonus because the Stone Miner one is not very useful to any civ's economy. The Stone Mining bonus allows for easier flush protection in the Feudal Age and maybe faster additional Town Centerss in Castle but that's about it. I will describe it's use in gameplay and from there we get hints to it's historical basis. First and foremost, it allows your Villagers to find resources earlier especially when you first start and they're standing around your Town Center. Like the Chinese, the Korean states were strong in the timeframe of the European Dark Age and this bonus allows you to get a small head start on your opponents by allowing you to find sheep and berries before they do. It allows you to see enemies coming from just over the stretch of forest they're chopping down. Because they had to deal with incursions from around Mongolia, from China, and occasionally from Japan, the Koreans built many forts around their cities and borders to allow them warning of attack. The Goguryeo employed lots of scouts and spies to gather intel for them. With that said, this is a creative bonus that has some historical basis.

* Stone Miners work +20% faster

The Chinese and Koreans were master fortifiers, building many walls and towers and forts all over their lands. Fortification was arguably more important for the Koreans as the Chinese could always fall back on their population to draw troops and resources. The massive bulwarks had to have come from somewhere so our Koreans get a stone mining bonus. Korea is also quite mountainous so finding stone was a fairly easy prospect for even the smallest towns. There are two especially notable series of forts and walls called Cheolli Jangseong that were built to defend against the Tang Dynasty of China and Mongolic groups such as the Khitan. How do you build something so extensive without the stone?

* Towers +1/2 range starting in Castle Age

If you think about it, this ties in to the Korean's LoS bonus. Korea was made up of small nations at risk of attack all the time, from each other, from China, and from nomads. They managed to survive somehow, and [the huge number of](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castles_in_Korea) forts and walls in Korea point to them surviving on defenses. Korean towers weren't especially notable and to be honest none of the civs in the game had especially ""notable"" towers. HOWEVER, the Koreans were an archery civilization much like their neighbors and you can imagine the archers who happen to be permanently stationed at Korean towers firing at anything that comes within 8+1 range were more skilled than Chinese or German archers because they relied so heavily on towers.

* Tower upgrades free; Bombard Tower requires Chemistry first

Another fortification related bonus. The Koreans possess a continuous civilization and probably innovated lots of fortification techniques long before most of the other civs in AoE2. The fact that the Koreans need to research Chemistry is not a result of this tidbit of history I'm about to tell, but it reminded me of it: the Yuan Dynasty of China kept a close guard on certain Chinese manufacturing techniques, especially that of gunpowder. A Korean scientist named Choe Mu-Seon traveled to China and stole these secrets and then worked on recreating gunpowder himself. He succeeded and also recreated the Chinese rockets and supposedly invented the MOTHERFUCKING HWACHA which I will tell you about in a bit. He was pretty much a badass military scientist guy.

* TEAM BONUS: Mangonel line +1 range

Heh, the historical basis of this bonus is awesome. Ensemble Studios decided not to make this the Korean unique unit. But what they did instead was make their Mangonel line awesome and then add another unit as a unique unit to give the Koreans more options. The Koreans didn't quite have longer ranged catapults or mangonels. But this bonus is meant to simulate [THIS FUCKING WEAPON RIGHT HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQhSXA3AKh4). ISN'T THAT INCREDIBLE!? THIS WAS INVENTED IN THE 14TH GODDAMN CENTURY. If you think about it, a weapon that fires an area of effect attack over a range would basically be a souped up version of an Onager. Hwacha were used mostly in defensive positions as well as at sea. The arrows used in that video were invented by the Chinese and called ""Fire Arrows.""",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1348645376.0,,Blank,True,t3_sl39k,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/sl39k/gameplay_vs_historicity_day_13_the_koreans/,

The world is gonna end this year, and hopefully I will have finished this series before it does.

I'm kind of excited to do the Mayans right now because they (along with the Aztecs) are so distinctly different from the rest of the civs in game, for obvious reasons. This distinctive feel actually gets translated fairly well in game.

**WHATCHU KNOW ABOUT THEM MAYANS, MAYYYYANNNN!?**

The Mayans of AoE2 represent the historical Mayans who existed any where from 3114 BC (the beginning of the Mayan calendar) to the first recognizeably Mayan settlements in 1800 BC. In AoE, you see the Mayans used as stand ins for many Central Mexican civilizations, and you don't see the Yucatan Peninsula at all, which is the nexus of Mayan civilization.

Unlike many of the civs in AoE, we have very, very few records about the Maya. The Chinese, Persians, Byzantines, and Arabs were meticulous record keepers, and the Europeans would would become very good about it, as well. In contrast, they are fairly mysterious to history, and actually not because of lack of effort on their part...

What we do know is that there were many Mayan cities and towns, independent of each other with lots of cultural exchange, warfare, and trade between them. The Spanish ended up burning many of the Mayan writings, and some others have not survived time. Most of what we know about the Mayans come from inscriptions on stone.

I'm not particularly knowledgeable about the Mayans' history. Each city had their own line of rulers and it's own history and no centralized government ever united all the Maya peoples. It's easy to talk about the Holy Roman Empire or the Abbasid Caliphate, but not a colection of city-states. What I can say is that historians separate the medieval Mayan history into 2 parts: the Classic period from 250-900 AD, which would be a flowering and high point of the Mayans in the Yucatan, and the Post-Clasic from 900 until the 1500s when the Spanish arrived. The Mayan civilization in the Yucatan peninsual collapsed around the 900s, and there is evidence of droughts, famine, warfare population centers leaving, and migration out of Yucatan, though no one is certain what happened. Mayan settlements outside of the peninsual survived continuously, and it's thought that the Huastec people who flourished in Central Mexico prior to Aztec domination were Mayans who migrated out of the Yucatan during the droughts.

It's thought that the Mayans were contemporaries of the Olmecs, who have been thought of as the forerunners of Mesoamerican culture as a whole, and that they invented the writing system from which many Mesoamerican alphabets descend.

Certain Maya peoples fought with and traded with the Aztecs and were conquered by the Spanish. Fun fact, the Mayans city-states held out until 1697, more than 176 years after the fall of Tenochtitlan (1521)

**MAYAN BONUSES**

* Start with Eagle Warrior instead of Scout Cavalry

The Mayan and Aztec civilizations have one, huge difference from the other civs in the game; their lack of Cavalry (they also lack Gunpowder, but so do the British, so they're not unique). Horses were in the Americas for sometime, but in the very distant past about 8000 BC. They were probably hunted to extinction by the ancestors of the Native Americans. Due to the lack of a strong draft animal, the Mesoamerican peoples (and in turn, many Native Americans) were fairly isolated and their governed territories were quite small. Compare this to Central Asia where horses were first domesticated, you had various peoples in contact and confederation over massive swaths of land. The Mayans and Aztecs had the wheel, but they didn't have much of a use for it due to a lack of strong draft animals. I don't know if the Incas used Llamas and the wheel, but that's a different story. The Mayan and Aztec Trade Cart has a funny sprite of a dude pulling a cart behind him. The Eagle Warrior was clearly developed as the equivalent of the Scout line, although the Eagle Warrior is actually an Aztec specific class of warriors, though the Mayans probably did have at least one or two guys running around with spears, wearing faux-Eagle feathers. The EW is fast (though not as fast as even a Knight, much less a Scout) and is resistant to conversion with an attack bonus versus Monks, but the Eagle makes up for it's lack of speed (as well as it's cost of gold as opposed to the Hussar's cost of food) and HP in comparison with high pierce armor and a great attack bonus versus Siege weapons. It also has an attack bonus versus Cavalry, although I think that's mostly specifically to beat Hussars; ~~EW do NOT counter Pallies or Heavy Camels.~~ Scratch that, fully upgraded Aztec and Mayan Eagles counter most Camels cost-wise. Mayan Eagles actually counter all Heavy Camels cost-wise, including meaty Saracen ones and cheap Byzantine ones. Heck, they can even beat Mamelukes but that depends on micro.

* Start with +1 Villager, -50 F

The high point of Mayan civilization, at least what we think it is due to archaeology, was from 250 to 900, which is completely before and after the Dark Age. So the Mayans get a small bonus to reflect that. I don't have too much else to say, really. During the Classical Period, Mayan population was in the millions, but it wasn't very notable unlike the Song Dynasty population.

* Resources last 20% longer

A weird but awesome bonus in game and not historical at all. But I'm going to analyze it and I have a pretty good idea about it. The Aztecs are given a similarly general bonus (Villagers carry +5), and both civs end up as economically strong. In game, they need a strong bonus to keep them in the game due to their lack of cavalry, which really hurts them in the Castle Age and arguably the Feudal Age. The Mayan one in particular is interesting from a historical standpoint because of the pop culture description of a Native American. If you live in America and you think of a Native American, you get a variety of ideas and pictures associate with them. The industrial and imperial Europeans taking the land away from the nature loving and peaceful Natives. The genocide of the Native peoples, as well as the destruction of their environment paints the picture of a ""noble savage,"" living with the ecology in harmony. But if you really dig deeper, you'll realize that no matter who they are, the Iroqouis, the Comanche, the Aztecs, the Incas, or the Mayas, they are just as bad and good as the Europeans and other people in the world. Their way of life is simply different due to their environment. The Aztecs are obviously warlike and offense-oriented, so the developers made the Mayans very defense-oriented (they planned for the Maya to be defensive, but the Mayans end up being good at both) and sort of stereotyped them to the tree-hugger Native American, on purpose. This is great because it works with the eurocentric nature of the game AND it makes the two civs, who share lots of similarities, totally different. Many past archaeologists, having not found much evidence for Mayan warfare, assumed the Maya were super peaceful. As evidence of cities being burnt, old weapons, and mass bruial grounds came to light people realized the Maya did engage in war but this bonus is very, very good at playing to the stereotype. The Celts chop down trees quick, the British put up new Towns very quickly, the Teutons and Franks cut down forests and put up lots of Farms, etc. The Mayans are conservative and extract more from the environment. I'll explain the idea of a defensive, peaceful Maya civilization when I get to the tech tree.

* Archers, Plumed Archers cost -10/20/30% starting in Feudal Age

There isn't really much evidence for the Maya having used lots of Archers. Mesoamerican archery tech was pretty terrible compared to the rest of the world; they didn't have a big animal with strong bones like the West Asians did to make their Composite bows. They didn't have iron-tipped arrows because iron is hard to maintain in that part of the world. The Maya and Aztecs, however, did not lack for strong missile technology. Arguably, their missile tech was just as good as Bows or Crossbows or Cannons of the world. The Spanish dreaded the simple Atlatl the most out of any weapon in the native arsenal. The Atlatl was a shaft with a cup to hold the projectile, and the shaft would act as an extension of the arm, held by the hand. Imagine the centrigual force generated by a yo-yo or a nunchuk, now transfer that into a projectile. That's basically how the atlatl worked. The atlatl threw ""darts,"" that were not quite small enough to be arrows, not quite long enough to be javelins. These darts would go straight through Spanish armor, and today's reconstructions can send darts flying over 93 mph (150 kmh). The upper range of a Longbow would be 136 miles per hour (about 219 kmh). That's fairly comparable speeds, especially at mid range, and with a cheaper production cost. I'm sure a Mayan or Aztec atlatl thrower could fire darts as fast as a Longbowman, if not faster. Maybe due to the atlatl, maybe not, but the Maya get a bonus to their decidedly defensive Archers as opposed to the offensive Infantry of the Aztecs. If the game were a bit more historical, the Maya would also be a melee infantry civ, too. But hey, gameplay first.

* TEAM BONUS: Walls cost -50%

A real obvious defensive bonus. Although most of the Mayan cities do not have defensive walls that stand to this day, they existed; take a look at [Tulum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulum), which has walls, gates, and towers. The Maya were excellent stone workers, and so this bonus makes even more sense.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1342651009.0,,Blank,True,t3_qvfbd,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/qvfbd/aw_hell_nah_what_up_dawg_gameplay_vs_historicity/,

WELCOME TO ANOTHER DAY HISTORY VS ANALYSIS GAMEPLAY CIV 6: TURKS THE

**YER A TURK TURK TURK TURK TURK TURK TURK TURK**

The Turks in AoE2 represent the Seljuq and Ottoman Empires. In the single-player campaign, they are used as a separate, Islamic faction from the Saracens in the last two Barbarossa scenarios, they are used as a Mongolic tribe in the first Ghengis Khan scenario, as the Sultanate of Rum in the Battles of the Conquerors Manzikert scenario, the Ottoman Empire in the Lepanto scenario, and as stand-ins for the Berbers in the Battle of Tours scenario as well as for an El Cid scenario.

Those peoples who identify themselves as Turkic span a very long group of people originating from the Steppes of Asia. They are related to the Mongols ethnically and linguistically, and the ones in AoE2 were Persianized and Islamicized. Today you have the Turkic countries of Turkey (Turk*ish* refers to them), Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. The suffix ""-stan"" is also used for Afghanistan, Pakistan, and to refer to India as ""Hindustan."" It's a Persian suffix for ""place of."" Tajikistan is another similar country, but the Tajiks were more related to the Persians; Persia has always had alot of influence in Central Asia. Turkic peoples also currently inhabit parts of Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, China (Uyghurs) and all over Russia. The Bulgars are a (at least, partially) Turkic people who invaded Europe after the Huns, and the Magyars (Hungarians) are genetically related to the Turkic peoples, as well, and you also get alot of people who are descended from the Ottomans in Balkan area, too. It's kinda weird; one Turkic group invades and dominates that area, and then nearly a thousand (more like 900) years later, ANOTHER Turkic group invades and dominates it, too. It's somewhat similar to the Saracen UT, Zealotry.

The first Turkic peoples were living in and around China and the Central Asian Steppes. They of course were horse people similar to how I described the Mongols in the last edition. The first Turkic state was that of the Xiognu Confederation, who may or may not be the Huns. They were driven out of China and into the Central Asian steppes, and it's possible that was the precursor to the ""barbarian invasions"" in Europe. The Xiognu were led by a ""Chan yu,"" and if you watched Mulan, you'd realize that it's the same title as the main villain, Shan Yu, master of the Huns. The next polity to emerge was that of the Gokturks, and by then the Chinese were calling them ""Tue Jue"" and occasionally ""Turuk."" Gok or ""Koku"" means ""Celestial,"" and the Chinese would often add majestic sounding words to their names for important political rivals and allies.

The Gokturks were disbanded in the same way the Xiognu were; internal conflict because they were a bunch of nomadic tribes who insisted on having separate identities. Afterward, many Turkic groups migrated southwest to the Middle East and northwest to Eastern Europe. There were several Turkic states in Eastern Europe before Russia, such as the Khazar Khaganate and the Kipchak Khaganate.

The Turks who migrated to Persia and Arabia were usually used as soldiers, but those soldiers rose up against the Persians and Arabs and took control for themselves. They took on the culture of their benefactors, especially the religion of Islam and their administrative traditions. For a while, the Arabs were the priests, the Persians the bureaucrats, and the Turks the generals. The Seljuq took over the Abbasid Empire for a while and held Anatolia (present day Turkey) for about 300 years, calling it Rum (Rome). The Mongol Empire attacked this area, and the Turks were divided into the Cairo Mamluk Sultanate and the Sultanate of Rum. Eventually the Ottomans would take control from the Mongols and Mamluks to close out the Middle Ages.

The Turks are related to the Mongols and Huns, fought the Chinese early on, fought against, for, and took on the characteristics of the Persians, Saracens, and Byzantines, and they fought many European civilizations during the Crusades.

**TURKISH BONUSES!? I KNOW**

* Gunpowder units +25% HPs

The Ottoman Turks were obviously not the first to use gunpowder; the Chinese were. The Koreans used gunpowder way before them. The Mongols and Europeans used gupowder before the Turks. But it's the Ottomans who created an empire with a huge emphasis on artillery. The Chinese mostly fought peoples whom they could consider to be Chinese, as well, and the Mongol's best weapon were their horse archers. This bonus also works out very well because the Turks were famous for not just their hand cannoneers, but their naval power and their ridiculously large cannons used during the siege of Constantinople. The Dardanelles Gun is an example of the super-sized cannons used during the siege. The Turkish Navy, armed with cannons, dominated the Mediterranean for a century until the Battle of Lepanto (they were still pretty good, just not dominant). The extra HP to the Janissary and Hand Cannoneers could be seen as a part of the Turks' zeal. The Turks were powerful soldiers and seen contemporaneously and historically as more zealous than the Persian and Saracens. It's easy to imagine the ""fanatical"" Turkish Jannisaries still fighting in spite of a few bullet wounds to teh chset.

* Gunpowder techs cost -50% to research

The devs were intent on making the Turks the gunpowder civ, so this is obviously it. I can't really say too much on this technology, but I will explain a few things when I get to their free Chemistry bonus.

* Gold Miners work +15% faster

The Turks didn't actually have prolific mining operations, at least not the point where they were considered expert miners. If a mining bonus should go to anybody, it should go to the Chinese. But I think this bonus represents a little bit more. Consider that Turkish lands always laid on central trading routes between China and Europe. The Turks grew rich off these routes, from the trade itself and from being their de facto administrators. This bonus is also the only other trade bonus aside from the Spanish and Saracen ones. The Market is used because it is faster than sending Villies to gather resources. By making the central resource of the Market quicker to gather, it makes buying certain resources faster than actually having Villagers gather that resource. You can instead have 5 Villagers mine gold rather than chop wood and, for a few buys, it's more efficient to buy the Wood. As far as the Market goes, this is not so dramatic and strong as the Saracen bonus but it's still considerable. And this bonus is better than the Saracen one in general, anyway.

* Chemistry free

Again, it would make more sense for the Chinese to have this bonus. But let's consider this idea: the Turks are the best (and possibly the only ones) at performing a Fast Imperial strategy. Prior to coming into contact with the Persians, Arabs, and Byzantines, the Turks were a nomadic civilization. They quickly adapted and rose to the top of those societies. You can sort of infer that all of the Turks bonuses are geared towards this idea. The Gold Bonus means you have an advantage when going towards the Castle Age (200 gold), as well as advancing to the Imperial Age (800 gold). The free Chemistry means you get Bombard Cannons available immediately. The Gunpowder techs being -50% means you can research Cannon Galleons and Bombard Towers quickly. This is also related to the next bonus; you can have an army of Elite Janissaries, Bombard Cannons, and Hussars out faster than anybody else can.

* Light Cavalry, Hussar free

This is the Turks' most historically accurate bonus. They were among the many horse tribes in the Central Asian steppes, so they get a tech. This is actually better than the related Mongol Light Cavalry bonus because FU'd Hussars are just as good as Mongol ones lacking Plate Barding Armor. You can consider the Mongol bonus to be ""free"" Plate Barding, but the Turks get the upgrades completely free and save more resources and time on the unit upgrades than the Blacksmith one. The fact that the Turks get free LC and Hussars also means that other civs' Monks aren't as effective against them, highlighting their religious zeal.

* TEAM BONUS: Gunpowder units trained +20% faster

There's nothing in history to suggest that the Turks fielded more cannons faster than anybody else, but again, all these bonuses work towards the idea that I highlighted a couple of paragraphs ago. the Turks did famously rebuild all of the Ships they lost at the Battle of Lepanto in only a few years after the Battle (nevermind the fact that they couldn't find anybody to actually MAN those ships).",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1358902812.0,,Blank,True,t3_qeuwj,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/qeuwj/civ_analysis_vs_historicity_day_whatever_the_turks/,

The league will be ongoing with a set season length. The idea is to run the first league go guage interest and skill levels, before creating further league tables for skill levels and game-types.

There will be more details poested in the coming days. But I'm currently looking for people interested in helping to moderate and run such an endeavor.

I am looking for two mods:

* One Mod for subreddit design and wiki maintenance

* One Mod to help admin the sub and to help manage scores and tables


If you're interested in either of the positions then please inbox me.

I'm also interested in livestreamers/commentators - please contact me for details.

Finally if you have any general questions or suggestions then please reply to this post. I'm hoping this will become a big community feature which continues to draw a regular player basis and draw new interest to the game.

I tested a Hussar up to 100 waypoints and he still started with the very first one set.

Not that you'd ever really need to set 50 or 100 waypoints, but it might be important to know that you can.

you play britons you have many bowmen but the opponent can just build many onagers or siege onagers depending on the civ, and crush them, even if he loses this siege equipement afterward, wich is impossible with 75 pop limit, because you don't have too much ressources, due to limited number of workers, so you have to make wise choices, and above all you can't lose troops you have to keep'em live as long as possible.

I see often on gameranger people putting a 50NR 35NR, wich eliminates the range of possible strategies, to just one strategy, build as fast as you can, and pump as many troops as you can, wich is just stupid it's no more a strategy game, and I think it's due to the 200 pop limit cuz with a 75 you can't just rush easily, because having too much troops in the feudal age means that you don't have many workers which means that if your rush is crushed you'll probably lose when your opponent reaches the castle age, and it also forces people to scout often because you can't just sit tight and wait till imperial, to start attacking.

**I WONDER IF YOU KNOW HISTORY OF TOKYO, THEY GOT SWORDS AND BOOOOOOOWWWWWWWS HAI HAI THEY GOT SWORDS AND BOOOOWWWWWWSS**

The Japanese in Aoe2 represent...the Japanese. There's only two scenarios with the Japanese, and the civilization is never used to represent other factions. In fact the Japanese in their history have never had prolonged conflict with anybody but each other. During the medieval period (and actually, I believe from Japan's entire history up until the 1800s), there are only 3 instances when the Japanese fought a foreign power!The Japanese are in AoE2 partly because Japan is around today, a culture with immense longevity starting in ancient times (they were in the first AoE as the Yamato). However the main reason for the Japanese is because of their lack of real-life conflict in medieval times. You never got to see a Samurai army versus, say, European Knights in real life due to geography. It's a bit of a dream match that is possible in AoE2 and in pretty much every strategy game with medieval warfare.

In 663 the Korean state of Baekje fell to the rival state of Silla, and their top figures fled to Japan. The Japanese had always been allies with the Baekje and sent a fleet and army to the Korean peninsula to help reclaim the Baekje territories. This failed due to the Silla alliance with Tang Dynasty China. This is the first instance of Japanese conflict with, well, non-Japanese and is even more interesting because this was before the Samurai culture and well-developed warfare techniques. The Silla had apparently staged a minor invasion or raid of Japan in 14 AD followed by a Japanese retaliation, and a Japanese empress was said to have invaded Korea and conquered parts of it. I say apparently because records of are scant.

Fast forward to 1274 and Mongols under Kublai Khan had finally conquered China and Korea, and wanted to add Japan. A Mongol fleet made land on Japan, beat the crap out of the Japanese forces, and withdrew for fear of a storm. The Mongols would try again in 1281 but the first conflict profoundly affected the Japanese. They built many coastal defenses that frustrated a landing of the Mongol fleet. In the haste to produce an invasion force, the Koreans and Chinese hired to build the ships made boats more suited to river fighting. As Japanese Monks prayed for deliverance, a huge storm known today as the Kamikaze (the divine wind) wiped out the Mongol fleet before they could land.

Finally in 1592 Hideyoshi invaded Korea. This conflict, the Imjin Wars, lasted about 6 years. The last major battle fought in this conflict was the Battle of Noryang, which most of us played in Age of Empires 2. Japan was defeated and cut itself off from the rest of the world for 250 years.

Japanese pirates had been raiding China on and off for centuries, but these were not official and organized military incursions. 

Japan had intermittent cycles of civil war and peace, and for the majority of it's history it had a powerless Emperor, who was more like the top priest, presiding over a gaggle of small independent territories. These territories were theoretically just rented to nobles by the Emperor but since there was usually no Imperial Army, this was true Feudalism and the nobles owned their land. Japan was like Europe, except in Asia.

Japan takes alot of cultural cues from the Chinese, by way of Korea. It's probable that the first inhabitants of Japan came to Japan via Korea and while many linguists can't quite figure out where Korean and Japanese languages go in the big web of languages, lots of them agree that the two language groups are related. Korean and Japanese architecture correspond period by period to Chinese architectural history. Buddhism also came through Korea. Japan got it's horses and iron weapons from Korea, as well. There was always trade between Japan and China since ancient times.

Japan has been linked to Korea and China for thousands of years, and they have fought the Mongols, as well. Otherwise, Japan has been quite isolationist.

**THE JAPANESE LOVE TO FISH AND SHIT, DAWG**

* Fishing Ships 2x HP (+60), +2 Pierce Armor, work +5/10/15/20% faster starting in Dark Age

The Japanese had a sea-reliant civilization. Obviously they originally got to Japan by the sea, and wherever you go in Japan you are not too far away from a beach. Fish was and is still a massive part of the Japanese diet. There is not a whole lot of arable land in Japan because it's a bunch of islands. So the vast majority of their protein came from the sea. And where there's economic success, there's theft so Japanese Fishing Ships had to be better protected due to rampant piracy.

* Mill, Lumber Camp, Mining Camp cost -50%

I'm not really sure where this bonus comes. HOWEVER Japan is a bunch of volcanic islands, and what little land they have is very fertile and there's lots of metal ores to be found.

* Infantry attack +25% faster starting in Feudal Age (+10/15/25 in 1.0c patch)

AoE is a eurocentric game and there persists a myth that the Japanese were peerless swordsmen wielding the best swords in the world. I would say that not only were the Japanese historically more reliant the bow and spear than the sword like everybody else, but the rest of the world was ahead of the Japanese in metalwork and the Chinese rivaled Japan in terms of martial arts. This is still a perfect bonus for a eurocentric view of the Japanese and they still had a history with the Sword. Many fighting schools developed around certain weapons, and schools were usually founded by Samurai. In the late Middle Ages the sword was their ""soul"" and it was a very ritual weapon. An attack speed bonus also implies ""skill"" rather than brute force like the Viking health bonus. Japanese swordsmen would study and train at these schools and challenge each other to single combat to test their skills. There is also a hidden depth to this bonus: Japanese Pikes and Halbs the best in the game. A Halb does about 37 damage to a Paladin per strike. Let's say that the Aztecs got Halberdiers (they don't). Their Halbs would do 41 damage per strike. However, in the time it takes an Aztec Halb to get 4 strikes in (for 164 damage), a Japanese one will have gotten 5 in (185). Japanese Swordsmen also beat Aztec Swordsmen, and Aztec Swordsmen only get +4 Attack in the Imperial Age. Samurai also made use of pole weapons such as the Naginata and the Nagamaki, especially against cavalry, before widespread use of the sword.

* TEAM BONUS: Galleys +50% LoS

Japanese seamen had thousands of years of experience and it makes sense that they'd be able to see very far and wide. If I designed this game I'd switch the Viking and Japanese Team Bonuses for history's sake, and also because it would make the Vikings less overpowered on water maps. Vikings were more well-known for the distances they traveled and the Dock bonus would work very well with the Japanese' Fishing Ship and Drop Off Building bonus. Japanese seamen were not *especially better* at navigation than Arab, Viking, or even Chinese seamen during the medieval period. Japanese ships were known more for their swiftness so if they had to get a bonus it should be some sort of speed bonus and maybe they'd lack Dry Dock or something to make up for it.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1355637578.0,,Blank,True,t3_s5h30,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/s5h30/we_at_it_again_dis_shit_dont_stop_historicity_vs/,

I've got a cool idea for a map, but I'm not good with the editor and don't know how to make things dynamic...

So Team Islands is a fairly well known map, where teammates are all on one island together. I call the new map idea I came up with ""Enemy Islands"". Here's the gist of it:

Assume (for now) that there are two teams and equal number of players per team.

Each player of one team gets matched up on an island with each player of another team. Thus there would be n/2 main islands for n players. Gameplay, as a result, is hierarchical - you can't really support your teammates without risking destruction, so you have to beat your matched up opponent first. This would lead to tournament-style dynamics, which I think would be really interesting.

Regarding the two team, equal number assumption, we can drop it and approximate the optimal pairings - if there are n teams then we can just do one-versus-all selection where you pair each member of team k = 1...n with some person on a different team (n-1 options). If there are an odd number of players, *then some island gets 3*, no islands with one. If one team has more players, we can do multiple pairings, with the constraint that no island has less than 2 people.

Anyway, that's the idea. I think it would be a really fun map, and would love it if someone could build it. Ideally, and I don't know if this is possible, it would be randomly-generated like one of the built in maps (black forest, team islands, etc.) so players can't adapt to a static map. Can anyone build this?

EDIT: I should clarify - I intended this map to be for the HD steam version, just because it's designed to have fun and different multiplayer dynamics.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1370194982.0,,,True,t3_1fhao2,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1fhao2/cool_map_type_idea_can_anyone_implement/,

Go to Set Launch Options

Enter '-dxlevel80' [No quotation marks]

I've always been a big fan of nomad maps, I really enjoy the extra randomness and feel that it adds a lot of flavor to the game.  There's nothing like losing the game in 5 minutes because your opponent got Chinese (I ALWAYS play Random Civs!) and you got Japanese...or building a house on the perimeter of your base only to discover the enemy right in your backyard.

As for strategy, you have to be very flexible.  You're not guaranteed x sheep, y boars, z berry bushes, etc. I usually have all of my villagers walk to a central spot and start building my town center asap.  I have played games where I've seen other players building a dock first so I'm curious as to how everyone else approaches nomad.  I always look for a sweet spot with as many resources possible in a central location to build my town center by, but I have played games where I made it to Feudal and still didn't have access to gold!

I usually play 2v2 team games, and I generally try to build by my ally but I have been in games where my ally is off in a corner and I have an enemy on either side of me.  Is it better in a team situation to always build near your ally?

1345667460.0,37,self.aoe2,ynnf4,Let's say a remake were to come out for AoE2. What would you change/add to the game?,TheBattler,41,4,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/ynnf4/lets_say_a_remake_were_to_come_out_for_aoe2_what/,"Say that Microsoft was bringing together the original developers for a total remake of AoE2.

What would you change about the game or add? What WOULDN'T you change?

I'm all about streamlining the experience.

I would cut down the number of Ages to Dark-Feudal-Imperial. The new Dark Age would be more like the Feudal Age, the new Feudal being like the Castle Age, and the Imperial Age basically staying the same.

The current Dark Age gameplay is repetitive and one-minded and I know that it originally started off as a way to make it easier for new players to play but you don't even have to be that good to get the Dark Age ""build"" down. I think that the game should start you off with a Town Center, a few more Villagers and some more resources. I would, however, remove the minimum range for towers and make Murder Holes a non-issue, so that it's easier to turtle in the Dark Age. Or maybe instead give the player enough stone for 2 towers early on.

The game also needs to be fun and dynamic at all times and also be fun to watch. So, taking more micro away from the economy means giving more time to the fighting.

I'm also not a fan of ""trash wars,"" where all players on the map run out of gold and have to duke it out with Skirmishers, Spearmen, and Hussars. I think that it's way more fun if the players get to use their cool, fully upgraded units in Imperial Age the entire game.

I'd sort of take a page from AoE3 and make Markets and Monasteries slowly produce gold for you, but it would be very, very slow and there would be a limit to how much. Another AoE3 thing would be to manage your own trade routes. You'd make much, much less gold from using your own Markets as using another player's Market and you'd have to really build a Market far away for it to be worthwhile. You could increase the gold you make by placing Markets in between; the Trade Carts would obviously take more time having to stop at more Markets but you'd make more gold as a result. This would also force the player to defend his trade routes. Gold mines would be the fastest way to make gold, however.

I'd like to make Sheep, wild animals, and trees regen but that sounds like it would add more micromanagement to the game. Every other resource seems to be in a good spot, just not gold.

Actually stone isn't so much so. Maybe the game would be fine if Stone Mines held more Stone or maybe you could salvage Stone from enemy structures. You destroy the enemy Castle and then you can then send Villagers to gather, say, 390 stone from it. Maybe even allow the player to deconstruct his defenses (this would take a long time, much longer than just pushing Delete) in exchange for his resources back based on how much HP the defensive structure had. 

The civilizations themselves could use a few tweaks. I don't think a few of them were quite accurate, and it's possible to make a historically accurate civ with different gameplay. I'd definitely change the UUs around, too.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1345668355.0,,Blank,True,t3_ynnf4,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/ynnf4/lets_say_a_remake_were_to_come_out_for_aoe2_what/,

I'm gray. That's an awesome color. I'm Huns. That's a fun civilization. I'm building my first house. Wait, what in the name of cat swinging rainbow punchers is happening? Also, why can I see all the sheep?

Apparently someone decided it would be a great idea to play a fog-of-war game with all technologies and high resources. Okay, I can live with that, it's still a fun game.

So I go castle in less than twenty minutes and hit twenty knights somewhere between Mister Green Player bowing out due to lag and Mister Blue Player quitting because his ally sent a few military dudes through his base. So now Yellow and Red are alone on the map against me, Teal, Orange, and Purple. We're pretty overwhelmingly going to wash them, right?

No.

I send my knights down to cut out the weak link, Red, and he goes down in under a minute. One town center in the Castle Age? So sad.

Following that, I send my knights and my newly-mounted camels over to raid Yellow. He's Byzantines and is in Imperial now, so I figure some camels are necessary. He's literally the only player left, probably a good two or three thousand points under my score. I wipe both of his town centers, destroy his food villagers, massacre most of his gold and wood villagers, and finally lose my 20 knights and ~10 camels to pikemen and cavalry archers.

At this time, you might be wondering, ""What's your team up to?""

This is also what I was wondering. They are nowhere to be seen. So, curious, I take a peak at Teal base. There are Aztec Jaguar warriors crawling out of the gutters and Eagle Warriors running around in circles like they're prepping for a track meet. I glance at Purple. Cataphracts lumbering all over the place. No movement. These guys have to have armies at least triple the size of mine.

So Yellow is basically down and out now, except for a few scurrying villagers and a stockpile of resources. I send in a stream of little knight pockets and manage to finally find his castle. The few remaining villagers he has have walled it off and, I'm guessing, he doesn't have enough stone to build a new town center. I don't have siege stuff.

Yada yada yada, I'm piddling around, finally Teal and Purple send in the waves. Orange helps out, but with much smaller forces, mainly just harassing the AI-stasis resigned Red, Green, and Blue players. Yellow is the only enemy still counted as playing, and I think he's frustrated, because he keeps his fellas wandering around like insidious bastards.

I'm still in Castle Age. This is frustrating because I don't have a fuckton of gold, so I start selling off wood to advance and research Spies, right?

Finally, about a second before I'm advanced to Imperial, Yellow GG's and resigns. I'm frustrated looking at the scores. I'm the lowest score on my team by more than a thousand points. Everyone else is in quintuple digits, I'm lingering around the end of quadruple. There are Teal, Purple, and Orange military units standing around doing jack-all everywhere on the map.

Game ends. GG Yellow, fuck those other guys. Quit current game.

Winning team. Lowest score. Most Valuable Player.

**HISTORY LONGER THAN SARACEN HAIR**

The word ""Saracen"" was originally used by a few Roman historians during the height of the Roman Empire to describe either all Arab peoples, including the Palmyrans and Bedouins, or a group of people separate from them. We're not entirely sure. In medieval times it came to mean pretty much most races beyond the the far outposts of Christendom, the Byzantine Empire and Armenia: the Turks, Persians, Berbers, Moors, and Arabs. The Saracens in AoE2 represent several historical civilizations, but especially the Abbasid Caliphate that ruled from Baghdad. 

The Saracens are also used to represent the Umayyad Caliphate that invaded Spain and France, and you fight them in the Charles Martel scenario, as well as the later Iberian Emirates represented in the El Cid campaign, and most prominently, the Ayyubid Dynasty founded by Saladin. So the Saracens are pretty much the Arabs.

The Arabs are a Semitic people, and they are related to the peoples of ancient Egypt, Babylon, Akkad, Judea and Israel, and Yemen. Other related, but not quite Semitic, languages are spoken by the Berbers and Ethiopians. Arabic is related to Aramaic, which was the major trade language spoken by the peoples of the Levant. In the Bible and the Qur'an, Abraham has two sons, Isaac and Ishmael, and Isaac is said to be the progenitor of the Jews while Ishmael is said to be the progenitor of the Arabs, and Arabic and Hebrew happen to be extremely close languages. The Roman Empire included a province called ""Arabia Petraea"" that was made up of the land immediately east of the Sinai Peninsula. 

Around the 7th century the Arabs began to expand out from the Arabian Peninsula, attacking and conquering the Byzantine and Persian Empires. At first this empire was unified and for a short period of time one government administrated a territory that reached from the Atlantic Ocean all the way to India. Eventually, the Empire splintered, with the Caliphate of Cordoba in Spain and Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt declaring independance from the Abbasid Empire. The rest of the Abbasid Empire would be divided into mostly independent kingdoms who swore nominal fealty to the Abbasids. The Turks were the real masters of the Abbasid Empire from 1016 until about 1256 when the Mongols came along.

Arab political power went into serious decline after the Mongol Conquest. The Mongols ruled the Ilkhanate that included most of modern day Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. The Armenians peacefully submitted to Mongol rule, and they even attempted to forge an alliance between the Mongols and Crusaders against the Muslim powers. The other major political power in the Middle East was the Mameluke Dynasty led by the Turkic Mamelukes. Eventually it was the Turkish Ottoman Empire that became the premier Empire of the Middle East, along with the Persian Safavid Empire.

When the Saracens conquered the Byzantines and Persians, they took on many characteristics of their subjects, reading their books, copying their art and architecture, and assimilating their administrative rules. For a time, the Arabs were the priests, the Persians the bureaucrats, and the Turks the soldiers.

The Saracens fought a wide variety of enemies, and as far as the civs in AoE2 go, they fought the Britons, Franks, Teutons, and Celts during the Crusades, they fought the Goths and Spanish in Spain, they fought the Vikings on rare occasion (especially the Normans), they fought against the Byzantines, Persians, and Turks, as well as the Chinese and Mongols. The only AoE2 civs the Saracens didn't come into contact with are the Koreans, Mayans, Aztecs, and the Huns, though you could count the Huns if you think of the Huns representing western Turkic groups; the Arabs definitely had conflict with the Khazars and Kipchaks in Russia.

**WHAT'S INSECT MY SCARAB? WHAT'S FISH MY BEAR CUB? WHAT'S BONUS MY ARAB?**

* Market trade is 5%

The Saracen's only economic bonus is one few understand well. Early on in the game Markets allow you to convert gold and wood, which are very quickly gathered, into food, which is very slow to gather from Farms. The Market is more flexible than that but early game it's much faster to push a couple buttons than wait for a Villager to dick around on his Farm. For the Saracens this becomes very, very, very efficient. The Trade bonus is very accurate to history because the Saracens were adept traders. They had the best geographical position out of any contemporary civilization; the Arab Empires straddled 3 continents by land and sea trade routes. From Egypt and Syria, they could reach Europe. From Persia into Turkestan and China. From Southern Arabia they could hit up Africa and India. They were the best merchants in the medieval world, linking the world together, and they fought myriad opponents to keep their supremacy.

* Galleys attack speed +20%

The medieval Arabs were a very naval civilization; obviously they need ships to get to the places I mentioned in the last paragraph! They had numerous naval engagements in the Mediterranean. In their battles against the Byzantines/Romans, they would lose couple of battles in the Byzantine heartland of Greece but were victorious in Cyprus, Italy, Sicily, Malta, Sardinia, North Africa, and Spain. The Arabs had gained control of Sicily, Sardinia, and Southern Italy for a time. The faster attack of the Galleys is might be a reference to the Arab invention of the torpedo: a Syrian engineer named Hassan al-Rammah developed a self-propelled projectile using gunpowder intended to be used on the water. You can watch an episode of mythbusters where the hosts build a replica and figure out that it is indeed a plausible weapon. It is more likely a reference to the Arab's penchant for archery and siege weapons. Ship to ship combat was mostly about the archers and catapults on board firing at each other. [Sandy Peters intended for the Saracen Navy to be an offensive one](http://aok.heavengames.com/gameinfo/civilizations#saracens), and it makes sense in history; the Arabs conquered land pretty quickly but had a hard time in keeping their gained territories against the Normans, Turks, Spanish, etc. HOWEVER in actual gameplay the Saracen naval bonus ends up being better than everybody else's bonus except for the Persians and the Vikings.

* Transport Ships Carry 2x (actually +5)

They especially traded in the Indian Ocean and notably they spread Islam quite far from Arabia, with Muslims settling in Madagascar and present-day Indonesia, Malaysia, and Phillippines having arrived in those places by sea. So it makes sense that their Transport Ships would carry more. The Arabs were notable settlers, and settled further areas than even the Vikings. This is an offensive bonus because you can put a few more soldiers on a ship and get them to your enemies. They attacked other lands by sea, and obviously had to land soldiers on their new territories.

* Cavalry Archers +3 attack vs buildings

I'm not entirely sure what to make of this bonus, but the Arabs created a very long reaching land empire. Their light cavalry was pretty well-renown; let's remember that ""light cavalry"" in real life history isn't a dude riding a very fast horse with a sword and a shield with 60 HP and 7 attack power but any cavalryman who had light armor. Cavalry Archers fall under this jurisdiction. They used Cavalry Archers quite often in their battles, and the Mameluke dynasty of Egypt even gave the Mongol Cavalry Archers their first real defeat. The Arabs were pretty good raiders, making quick raids into enemy territory, taking as much booty (GAWD DAMN SHAWWWTY) back to their own territories in order to assess how profitable the enemy settlements for conquering. So you get Cavalry Archers rushing into enemy territory, killing Villies, destroying Lumber Camps and Mining Camps and Houses (slightly) faster than other Cav Archers, and then quickly retreating and frustrating enemy forces by hitting and running.

* TEAM BONUS: Foot Archers +1 Attack vs buildings

I'm not sure what to make of this bonus, either, but hey it is what it is. Hand Cannoneers and Janissaries are the strongest ranged units for attacking enemy buildings due to their high attack power and they don't have to worry about missing a stationary target, either. Saracen Hand Cannoneers are better at demolishing buildings than other Cannoneers (except Spanish ones), so uh, yeah.

So we get a range-heavy civ with a penchant for raiding on both land and sea. And of course, they were the best traders in either arena.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1355801137.0,,Blank,True,t3_s3axl,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/s3axl/xxxg4m3pl4y_vs_h1st0r1c1ty_d4y_11111oneone11/,

**HEY KID! I'M A COMPUTAH! STOP ALL THE DOWNLOADIN'! READ THE WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE!**

The Britons in AoE2 obviously represent the Kingdom of England, which existed from 907 AD till 1707, although there were various kingdoms prior to the unification of England that would identify themselves as having a common origin. The original inhabitants of the British Isles were the Celtic peoples, some of whom still occupy it to this day (the Scots, Irish, and Welsh all have celtic cultures and languages). Next came the Roman Empire, who began multiple invasions of the islands starting with Julius Caesar's first invasion in 55 BC. The Romans managed to conquer much of Britain by 410 AD, but the islands were so far away from Rome both in a sense of distance and in a sense of the natural geography in between that it was hard to keep them stabilized and Roman. Caesar had originally justified his invasion by claiming that the Britons (a Celtic people) had aided the Gauls during his wars in Gaul (present-day France). After the Romans withdrew out of Britain, waves of Germanic tribes migrated into Britain and settled it, some of them driven out of their lands by Attila the Hun himself. These Germanic peoples included the Frisians (whose language English is directly descended from), Jutes, Angles, Danes, and Saxons. The Angles and the Saxons became the most prominent, which is why we refer to these inhabitants as Anglo-Saxon. Later on, much of England was settled by the Danish, Swedes, and Norweigens.

Great Britain is thus a cauldron of Germanic, Celtic, Roman, and Scandinavian influences.

Obviously, one of the main reasons the Britons were included in AoE is obviously because the Kingdom of England is the origin of the world's first, true superpower, the British Empire. Only the British Empire had colonies, protectorates, territories, and spheres of influences in every continent in every major part of the world. But that's for Age of Empires 3.

The Britons of Age of Empires 2 find their origins in an England divided by Germanic invaders and original Celtic inhabitants. The Germanic invaders established many small kingdoms on the island, such as Northumbria, Wessex, Sussex, and Essex, which refer to the Saxon invaders (West Saxon, South Saxons, and East Saxons), Mercia and East Anglia ruled by the Angles (England was known as ""Angleland.""), the Kingdom of Kent ruled by the Jutes, and the Celtic kingdoms of what would become Wales and Scotland. These Germanic invaders are very, very similar to the Goths and the Vikings, and these groups all share a similar mythology, culture, religion, ways of war, etc.

The King of Mercia in particular was the first to call himself ""Rex Anglorum,"" and after Mercia was conquered by Wessex, their king began to refer to himself as the King of the Anglo-Saxons (Wessex being Saxon and Mercia being Anglish) and adopted the title of Rex Anglorum.

Afterward, the Danes, who happen to be the Scandinavian group most closely related to these Germanic invaders as the present-day Denmark encompasses Jutland and Anglia, invaded England and took control of the English crown, and the Danes and Anglo-Saxons traded the crown for a bit. Finally, the Normans under William the Conqueror inavded England bringing yet another Scandinavian-influenced influence into England, this time with a bit of French. Due to the English King holding Normandy, this would entwine the Franks and Britons for pretty much all of history.

The word ""Briton"" comes from the Latin Britannia, which came from the Greek Pritani, both names for the British Isles. The Greeks and Italians both had several wars with Celtic-related peoples, so it is possible those names were transmitted to them from those peoples, and of course they bestowed that name upon the Roman conquered and administrated territory.

Thus the Britons are related to the Celts, Vikings, Franks, Goths, Teutons, and Byzantines, and have fought with the Spanish, Saracens, and Turks, and eventually the whole world.

**BRITISH BONUSES BRITISH BONUSES BRITISH BONUSES BITCH**

* Shepards work +25% faster

Shepherding has been an extremely vital part of the British economy; in fact, part of the reason for the Roman conquest  of the British Isles was to secure one of the best places on the planet for raising and tending to sheep, and the Romans established a wool production factory in Britain. In the future, it woudl be the British who would export Sheep to their colonies of New Zealnd. This bonus makes the British very, very fast at in the Dark Age. A little bit surprising that they would have such a specific and good bonus so early on considering that the Dark Ages were pretty ""miserable"" for England but hey, whatevs.

* Town Centers cost -50% W

The Britons were renown for their ability to colonize. Okay, not quite so much in the Middle Ages but they did encroach upon the Scots, Welsh, Irish, and French pretty heavily, and a Town Center is a great way to do that encroaching. This is fairly related to the Frankish bonus in that sense because the TC and the Castle are both strong buildings, the Castle for direct defense and the TC so that you can make more villagers; only one civ can get a Castle bonus, so the Brits got the TC bonus (which happens to be a very great economic bonus). They certainly became THE colonizers (or maybe I should say ""colonisers,"" hee hee) after the Middle Ages were over, so I can't really expand on that part. BUT we can analyze a deeper meaning; maybe it's inklings of their origins. Consider all those dudes who came to England and settled there, as well as the original Celtic inhabitants. The Bretons, for example, boated away from England during the Germanic migrations and settled in France (in what is now known as Brittany, get it?), as well as fairly far off Spain. Even the Romans were especially good at colonising territory. So with all of those influences, you'd think their descendents, the Britons, would be pretty good at it, right?

* Foot Archers +1/2 Range starting in Castle Age

The Britons possessed one of the only European armies armies where Archers were NOT despised and actually well-trained and equipped, aside from the Scandinavians (and I guess the Huns, but they don't really count). The reason why they get a range advantage and not another kind of advantage is because the British bows were still not the same as the Composite Bows of the east (I'll explain more later).

* TEAM BONUS: Archery Ranges work +20%

You may or may not have read in the manuals or other flavor text of AoE2, but at some point in British history, especially during the Hundred Year's Wars, the Britons banned all sports on Sunday except Archery. They also had a feudal system involving archers rather than Knights. In fact, a royal decree known as the Assize of Arms of 1252 stated that all landholders must train with a bow, and more wealthy landowners must train with a longbow. That's why we get this Archery Range team bonus. The preferred weapon of Richard the Lionhearted, especially during the 3rd Crusade, was the Crossbow, and he used a ton of them. This was obviously before the British started using Longbows.

**AWWWW YEAH, DAT's MAH ANGLO-SAXON, wIT DAT TECH TREE**

* UNIQUE UNIT: Longbowman

The Longbow was first used by the Welsh agains the British during their invasion of Wales. The Longbow is a bow roughly the size of the person wielding it, and it requires alot of practice to master it. These massive bows would fire massive arrows, and they were very accurate and very powerful. The British Longbowmen were a well-paid and powerful force, which is obviously why they are created from the Castle. In fact, you would think that the British getting an Archery Range bonus when, ideally, they wouldn't even use the Arbalest is kind of weird. In real life, the British Longbowman was replaced by cannoneers and crossbowmen because it was so much easier to train a man to wield those weapons rather than the Longbow. So it makes sense that it's easier to train the Arbalests rather than the Longbowman. Longbowmen had one main advantage over cannons or crossbows, though; they had a much higher rate of fire, something that isn't quite reflected in AoE2. They were also pretty damn accurate but again, not reflected in AoE2 because they lack Thumb Ring. Longbowmen are best on defense, when enemies are being stalled and standing in place because of walls and in real life, they did so well because they could set up defensive position with fences and mantlets and they didn't do so well when they didn't have the chance to set those defenses up.

* UNIQUE TECH: Yeoman

A Yeoman occupied a position between the aristocratic Knights and smaller landowners. In fact, for a long time, the word Knight meant ""boy"" while the concept for the Knight bore the name of ""Yeoman.""

HISTORICITY VS GAMEPLAY DAY 17 THE AZTECS,TheBattler,40,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/uj5d1/viva_la_raza_historicity_vs_gameplay_day_17_the/,"The other Mesoamerican civ in Age of Empires 2, the Aztecs were probably one of the first civilizations to be created for The Conquerors expansion.

In a few [forum posts on aokheaven made by Sandy Peterson](http://aok.heavengames.com/gameinfo/conquerors-expansion), he explains that they had a choice to create a new architecture set and they chose Mesoamerica. The one civ people know the most about would be the Aztecs, so it makes sense for the Aztecs to be first.

I did 2 Infantry civs previously and this is the last Infantry civ in AoE2. I'll be doing the Spanish next to wrap up this part of the series, which makes for a nice segue since the Spanish conquered the Aztecs (actually, Cortes didn't screw Montezuma, Montezuma screwed Montezuma).

**THAT VULTURE CAME TO TRY AND STEAL YOUR NAME BUT NOW YOU FOUND A GUN! YOU'RE HISTORY! THIS IS FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE SUN**

In AoE2, the Aztecs are featured primarily in the Montezuma campaign and are used to represent a couple of the other Mesoamerican tribes, especially the Tlaxcala tribe. The Tlaxcalans are NOT related to the Aztecs and consider themselves to have be among the first peoples to inhabit Mesoamerica, along with the Zapotecs and Mixtecs. The other major groups of peoples to inhabit Mesoamerica are the Mayans, although there are a few others.

Our Aztecs are the last groups of Nahuatl peoples to immigrate to Mexico known as the Mexica (pronounced Meshica); their legends state that they came from far to the north from a place called “Atzlan” and scholars refer to the Mexica as Aztecs due to the word meaning “from Aztlan.” Linguistic evidence shows that the language of the Aztecs, Nahuatl, is related to a number of languages of peoples north of [Mesoamerica]. Check out [this map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uto-Aztecan_languages) of the Uto-Aztecan languages and you can see that the Aztecs most likely came from way in the north. You could consider the Aztecs to represent the greater Nahua peoples as a whole, as various Nahua peoples had been in Mexico since 400 AD.

Similar to the Germanic invasions in Europe, the Nahua peoples came in waves. For instance, the Toltec peoples came to Mesoamerica first and the Aztecs consider their cultural betters and progenitors almost like how the Europeans viewed the times of the Romans as a golden age.

During the period of the Aztec Empire, Mesoamerica was a group of many small kingdoms centered around strong city states. Tenochtitlan, the great city of the Mexica, was the most powerful due to an alliance it had created with the city-state of Tlacopan and the city-state of Texcoco. What we know as the “Aztec Empire” is more accurately described as the Aztec Triple Alliance.

The Aztecs were seen as very oppressive and barbaric by their neighbors, and their origin story is pretty screwed up; in their early history, they were granted land by a related people known as the Culhuacanans, and after gaining favor with the King of Culhuacan as zealous soldiers they requested that they send his daughter to marry their King. So the King of Culhuacan sends his daughter and a month or so later he goes to see his living and married daughter. Instead, he sees *a priest wearing his daughter's skin as a cloak.* He gathers his allies and bumrushes the Aztecs and forces them into a the shallows in the middle of Lake Texcoco. The Aztecs were okay with this because they saw an eagle perched on a cactus with a snake in it's beak on an island in the lake. Their god Huitzilopotchli had told the Mexica to journey from the north to a place where they would find this symbol and settle there.

In the middle of that lake, the Aztecs would build Tenochtitlan, which was an incredible city. It was a group of islands created by piling mud and dirt on top of the shallow parts to create islands, and the city was connected by waterways. This island building method made for very fertile land to grow crops on that allowed the Aztecs to thrive until the Spanish conquered them mostly with disease and rallying the subjects of the Aztecs against them.

The Aztecs have fought and conquered the Mayans and had were eventually conquered by the Spanish.

**THE IDEA OF IMPEACHING A RULER COMES FROM AN AZTEC, THAT'S A BONUS TO THE AZTEC CIVILIZATION**

* All military units train +15% faster

For their entire existence, the Aztecs were seen as very barbarous and warlike. Their neighbors considered them excellent soldiers and military might was how they became so powerful. Tenochtitlan had the biggest population of any Mesoamerican city-state and the Aztecs always had lots of soldiers to draw from so a general bonus is logical. Aztec boys would have basic military training included in their schooling. The Aztecs lack Cavalry and have somewhat weak Archers so to make up for that they get faster creating everything and just so happen to be the only civ that creates Monks faster. Some thing that most people don't realize about the Aztecs is that their Empire was pretty [small](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Aztec_Empire_%28orthographic_projection%29.svg ). This was partially because they didn't have horses so they couldn't cover a huge area quickly. Also the Aztec civilization was ONE massive city (well, and one more counting Tlatelolco); if they had to go conquering or quelling a rebellion, the Aztec Army had to be dispatched directly from Tenochtitlan. When you play AoE2, you probably realize that building military buildings as a forward base near your opponents is a good idea but the Aztec buildings are very weak so it implies the Aztec's lack of colonies outside of Tenochtitlan. However your main base, your very own Tenochtitlan, is probably the best defended and you are able to field many units quickly from there.

* Monks +5 HP per Monastery tech researched

I can only find scant web articles about scant records about them, but the Aztecs sent priests into battle alongside their soldiers. The priests purpose was mostly for morale, sacrificing prisoners as the fight goes on although they did engage in combat. So we get this bonus for the Aztecs. The Aztecs were all about capturing prisoners and Monks who can SURVIVE ONAGER SHOTS make that so much easier. You can interpret their healing as boosting the morale of your troops and when they convert enemies they are capturing prisoners. If the enemy's have heresy, even better! This is a fairly expensive bonus, though, and it's kind of weird how the Aztecs need so much gold because they didn't really put much value on it.

*  Villagers carry +5

This is probably in reference to the way the Aztecs built Tenochtitlan and their floating farms. They created a system of agriculture using squares of dirt and mud floating on shallows called “chinampas.” These chinampas were made up of layers of mud alternated with decayed plantlife, and before crops were grown on them the farmers would put the seeds on rafts to be fed by the water (kind of like your 1st grade science project). Once the seeds germinated, they put the seeds in the ground. Chinampas were extremely fertile. This bonus is a very general bonus similar to the Mayan bonus. If your Villagers carry more resources while mining or lumberjacking or farming, then that means less total transit time between the resource and the drop off point making it much more efficient. In the Dark Age, this is actually a hurt rather than a help because you need resources faster than efficiently and you have to micromanage your villagers to get the food flowing but afterward this is a great economic bonus and it gives you extra oomph to your farming because farming is extremely slow. It's the only bonus that increases the efficiency of your farming.

* Loom free

I'm not sure exactly why the Aztecs get this bonus. It's probably the best bonus in the Dark Age because you don't have to worry about Loom at all, allowing you to just focus on creating Villagers and go for Wild Boars without any fear. Uh...I don't really know why they get this bonus.

* Start with Eagle Warrior, not Scout Cavalry

Similar to how the Fire Ship is a unit purely from the pages of Byzantine history, so the Eagle Warrior is from the Aztec playbook. The Eagle Warrior was a warrior order of the Aztecs that anybody could join so long as they had enough prisoners to their name. Eagle Warriors would perform separate rituals and wear different costumes and use different arms than everybody else. Eagles would go into combat  wearing silly looking Eagle costumes and wielding spears, atlatls, bows, and shields so their light infantry status in game is justified In the Montezuma campaign the protagonist, Cuahtemhoc, starts off as an Eagle Warrior and is “promoted” to Jaguar Warrior. In real life and in-game, the Eagle Warriors were the most feared out of any Aztec military units.

* TEAM BONUS: Relics generate +33%

So this brings me to a point on the Aztec's reliance on gold. I'm a broken record when it comes to this, but Age of Empires II is a purposely eurocentric game. The Vikings are superhumans who regenerate their HP and also have higher HP, the Goths throw swarms of their ill-equipped people at fortifications, the Japanese are superior swordsmen, etc. So the Aztecs have hidden treasures of gold that they are hiding from their conquerors, and the Europeans KNOW the New World has gold because their units rely on it; the average Aztec army uses 100 Gold  per Monk plus the Gold to research the techs to improve their Hps and 20 Food and 60 Gold per Eagle Warrior. So the Aztecs also receive stronger benefit from Relics, and this bonus can be interpreted in a few different ways: the Aztec's didn't mine for gold but their faith is a “resource” of some kind, or that the Relics are their hidden stores of gold and it's easy to hide your gold when you're not out mining it, or...that gold is just money in general and my more esoteric interpretations are just overthinking it.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1338774146.0,,Blank,True,t3_uj5d1,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/uj5d1/viva_la_raza_historicity_vs_gameplay_day_17_the/,

GWA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!

I'M A RAINY LITHUANIAN DANCING AS AN INDIAN

[SeaSquirrel](http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/18uwau/something_a_little_new_for_the_historicity_vs/c8i7tpd) requested the Apache for the last time, and while I didn't have too much info on the Apache, it was still a bit of a challenge to design another American civ and try to make it different from the existing ones. Honestly, the Apache ended up being alot like the Maya. Heh, but we'll see where we can take the next few civs.

**LITHUANIAN HISTORY**

So [Sex_E_Searcher](http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/18uwau/something_a_little_new_for_the_historicity_vs/c8ia860) was the one who suggested this civ and he stated that the Lithuanians were the last pagan kingdom in Europe. That got my interest piqued. Also dawg, I put the Khazars on the bottom of the list because you suggested two civs in one post. I want everybody to get their turn, so to speak.

Indeed, Lithuania was a pagan nation that participated in European politics. And in fact the religious beliefs of their ruler denoted whether or not they were a kingdom by European standards. The Pope could crown kings and proclaim the inhabitants of a kingdom as nominally untouchable, that is no other Christian nations could attack their independence.

Lithuania's stateship began when the Teutonic Knights began a Crusade into the Baltic regions, attacking the still pagan Balts and the Orthodox Slavs. The people of this region formed treaties and began to organize into a solid country, and Lithuania was first ruled by 21 Dukes. A Duke named Mindaugas took control of all of Lithuania in 1251 but of course there were those who opposed his rule. Mindaugas allied himself with the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Order to secure his throne, and converted to Christianity to seal the deal of peace. In fact Mindaugas was the ONLY king of Lithuania as he was said to have went back to Baltic Paganism. Lithuania became a Grand Duchy again although it would Christianize in 1387 fo good.

In those hundred years between Mindaugas and Christianization, Lithuania became pretty freaking big. They took territory from the Teutonic Knights, they took parts of Poland, and they ate up Kiev all the way to the Black Sea. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania was almost as big as present-day Lithuania, Ukraine, Belarus, and Latvia combined. Poland and Lithuania would unite, kind of like how Hungary and Austria would, to form a huge nation. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was the first Constitutional Monarchy, with a legislative branch to keep it's Kingly executive branch in check.

The Lithuanians frequently fought with AoE2's Teutons, the Slavs, probably the Vikings, and even had a fairly even contention with the Mongol Golden Horde. So I want to design a civ that has some aspects of the ""pagan"" civs in the game, like the Vikings, Aztecs, and Huns combined with the Knightly civs such as the Franks, Teutons, and Spanish. They should also be a late game powerhouse as their state was at it's greatest height by the Imperial Age especially after joining together with Poland.

I also want them to be kind of the polar opposites of the Teutons. The war between the Teutonic Knights and Lithuanians was very brutal, and the Order viewed the pagans as less than human. Lithuania was founded pretty much because of their war with the Teutonic Knights.

**LITHUANIAN BONUSES AND UNIQUES**

* MILITARY BONUS: Some sort of cavalry bonus. Free Husbandry?

Lithuania proper is located on the fringe of the Eurasian Steppe but they conquered large parts of it. So their horses should be pretty good but not as good as the other true horse civs. Free Husbandry would accomplish the goal of making their units opposite of the Teutons. It's resources saved and it makes a Knight rush fairly good. The Lithuanians should get a pretty good early Castle Age because that's when their political state emerged and that's when they expanded their empire.

* MILITARY/DEFENSIVE BONUS: Military buildings +20% HPs

The same way the Teutons have 3 small defensive bonuses (Tower garrison, TC bonus, free Murder Holes), I'd rather give the Lithuanians a few small Military bonuses in the same vein. The idea behind this is that even under constant warfare, the Lithuanians would be able to churn out soldiers to fight for them from their stronger military buildings. Your military buildings would most likely be on the border near your enemies so this isn't quite a defensive bonus. The Lithuanians would also get Masonry and Architecture, which means that in the Imperial Age their military buildings have the same HP as Byzantine ones but also have the added benefit of more building armor. Maybe even Castles could benefit. If we prevent the Lithuanians from getting Hoardings their Castles would have about 6720 HP, which would make them stronger than Castles with Masonry and Hoardings. This bonus also parallels the Slavic Team Bonus a little bit.

* MILITARY BONUS: Some sort of ""pagan"" bonus? Heresy free? Heresy costs 0 gold and researches in 2 seconds? Knights resist conversion like Hussars?

[Uhhhhh](http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/31450812.jpg). I'm not feeling too creative with the cavalry bonuses. [SO YOU GOTTA HELP US!](http://images.wikia.com/ideas/images/6/65/Hotel-Mario-Luigi-580x435.jpg). I came up with this bonus to reflect the pagan nature of the Lithuanians. I came up with the second bonus just in case the player doesn't want to research Heresy. If you don't, you can possibly reconvert your troops. So you'd have to build a Monastery and then actually click on it, and this gives the player the choice. The other bonus I came up with is basically making Knights into really strong Hussars: a Knight ends up being pretty much as strong vs Hussars vs Monks, except with way higher HP. This is the opposite of the Teuton team bonus, which affects all units.

* ECONOMIC BONUS: A farming bonus. I'm not sure, there's already like fifty farming bonuses in AoE2. Maybe something like Farms take up half the space?

Lithuania was all about the farming. Much of Lithuania's territory lay in present-day Ukraine, which has a TON of arable land and today is the largest producer of honey, sunflower oil, and nuts, as well as grain and sugar. Once the Polish and Lithuanian joined together, they grew a ridiculous amount of grain. So they should definitely have some sort of Farming bonus. The half the space thing is a bonus I came up with a long time ago for the Aztecs, since their whole thing was creating farms upon Lake Texcoco. It would still be okay for the Lithuanians.

* TEAM BONUS: Cavalry +2 Atk vs Cavalry

I know this is weird but I have a plan. I'm going to prevent the Lithuanians from having Halberdiers, so they'll be one of the very few civs without Camels OR Halbs. In exchange, their cavalry will ALWAYS beat the cavalry of other civs. Their Knights will beat even Frankish Knights 1:1. I don't really have a historical basis for this but again Lithuanian cavalry was always pretty good and I got this idea from Age of Chivalry. In that game, you have Lancers instead of Camels and Eagles, and Polish Lancers are among the best. The Polish armies and Lithuanian armies would have been pretty similar.

* UNIQUE UNIT: Bajorija

A Bajorija is a Lithuanian nobleman, fairly equivalent to the Boyar. My idea for the Bajorija would be sort of a combo of a Berserker and Slavic Boyar, sort of a combination of the two major cultural zones around the Lithuanians. A Knight with high armor stats, low HP, low Attack, slightly faster than regular Knights, and HP regeneration. They would be able to barely beat Knights 1v1 thanks to their Team Bonus. They'd probably be most useful for raiding, attacking Archers and Villagers.

* CASTLE UNIQUE TECH: Romuva

Romuva is the modern name for the Baltic religion followed by the Lithuanians. Romuva was purportedly a Temple in the Baltic area encountered by the Teutonic Order. Romuva supposedly had it's own ""Pagan Pope,"" and the similarities between the name Romuva and Roma are apparent. The Teutonic Knights might have made it up but at any rate, researching the old Baltic religion sounds pretty apt. I'm not sure what the effects would be, honestly.

* IMPERIAL UNIQUE TECH: Commonwealth

And obvious reference to the Lithuanian-Polish Commonwealth. I'm not exactly sure what this would be. I was thinking of taking away the the Lithuanian economic bonus and making this into sort of an extra Mill technology. The Commonwealth made ridiculous amounts of grain and exported it to Western Europe.

My ghetto meter has actually run on empty, today, so forgive me. I can't think up of any funny rap references to Persia.

Currently there are 4 civilizations left to talk about: the Aztecs, the Vikings, the Celts, and the Spanish. I'm probably going to move on to the Forgotten Empires civs, and I know that there is a user who's involved with that project here; I can't ask Ensemble Studios if my conjectures on their design choices are true, but I can ask somebody on the Forgotten Empires crew.

**HISTORY OF DEM PERSIANS**

The Persian civilization in AoE2 is seemingly modeled solely after the Sassanid Dynasty of Persia, but a few things about it seems to point to them also modeled after other Persianid civs such as the Khwarezm Empire and the Safavid Empire. The Safavid Empire in particular relied heavily on gunpowder and is touted as one of the 3 Gunpowder Empires alongside the Ottomans and the Mughals, and the Persians get all the gunpowder techs in the game.

In game, the Persian civ is used in only a few scenarios: the Saladin campaign uses the Persians to represent a Crusader State (Tiberias) in it's 5th mission and a ""Persian Outpost"" in the 6th mission which notably ships 5 War Elephants to your base. The Barbarossa campaign uses the Persians to represent Damascus in a fairly tough scenario where the city of Damascus shoves a seemingly unlimited number of Paladins, Onagers, and inexplicably War Elephants in your face. The Ghengis Khan campaign features the Khwarezm Empire and the city of Samarqand as the Persians. Finally, the first Hun mission has the Persian Empire as one of the 3 enemies you can defeat, and I believe this mission references the Hun incursions into Armenia, especially considering that the Huns are firmly in Scythian territory.

During the Dark Ages, the Sassanid Dynasty fought many wars with the Roman Byzantines and it's through them that many Persian ideas entered Europe, such as the heavy cavalry Grivpanvar, the Persian ""Knight."" When both empires were exhausted, the Muslim Arabs burst onto the scene and conquered many Roman holdings and all of Persia. From that point on, there would be no ""Persia,"" at least not in the political sense.

Persians would attain high positions in the Arab Empires due to them carrying on many Persian traditions, such as their bureaucracy and trade routes. Non-Arab Dynasties in Persia woudl exist as states that swore nominal fealty to the Arab Caliphte, most notably the Ghaznavid, Ghurid, and Khwarazmian Empires. These Dynasties were actually led by clans of Turkish slave-warriors, Mamelukes in fact, who were first taken in by Persian benefactors. Eventually they rose to higher positions in society, including becoming governors of cities and then regions and finally of whole countries. The Persians endowed tons of culture to the Turks, especially architecture considering the Turks were previously steppe nomads.

Those Empires were eventually incorporated into the Seljuq Dynasty's empire, which ruled much of the core Muslim territories of Persia, Mesopotamia, the Levant, Egypt, Anatolia, and the Muslim holy cities on the Arabian coast. The Seljuq Dynasty was still technically a part of the Baghdad Caliphate, and you could say that the Arabs were the religious leaders, the Turks the military leaders, and the Persians the administrators. And THEN, the Seljuq and Khwarezm Empires were mowed down by the Mongols.

After the disintegration of the Mongol Empire, Persia was incorporated into the Ilkhanate and this brought lots of Chinese into contact with the Persians. Theeeeeeeen, the Ilkhanate crumbled into many smaller states that were then eaten up by Tamerlane's Empire. The Timurid Empire owes a ton to the Persian culture and you can see it plainly in cities built and rebuilt by Tamerlane such as Samarqand and Isfahan.

The final Persian dynasty of the Middle Ages was the Safavid Dynasty, which was again led by Turkic peoples but these Turks identified themselves as Persian and it led to a revival of a distinct Persian culture; one of the most important parts of this identity was the Shiah sect of Islam, and today Iran is the main bastion of Shiites.

So anyhow, the Persians frequently fought with the Byzantines, and were conquered by the Arabs and Turks, they even had some small-scale conflict with the Chinese, they were conquered by the Mongols, and many Persians eventually took part in the Crusades especially the three-way conflict between the Mongol Ilkhanate, Mamluk Egypt, and the Crusaders. The Persians were definitely the forerunners to the Arabs and Turks and to an extent the Mongols.

**BITCH I RUN AROUND WITH MY BONUS POWERS LIKE I'M A PRINCE OF PERSIA**

* Town Centers and Docks work +5/10/15/20% faster; Town Centers and Docks 2x HPs

Every time the Persians were conquered, they had a habit of conquering their conquerors with their traditions, culture, and infrastructure. When a new administration came into power in other parts of the world, often times they would cut out the previous traditions and replace it with their own ranks and bureaucracy. Civilizations that neighbored Persia or were under Persia's suzerainty would see Persia as sort of a golden goose, and why would you ever kill the goose that lays the golden eggs? They'd often inherit and adopt the Persian ways, such as their roads, trade routes, etc. These civilizations included the Macedonians, the Parthians, the Arabs, the Mongols, and the Turks. You can interpret this bonus sort of like this: you can destroy the Persian player's Barracks, Stables, Castles, etc. but you'll have a much harder problem destroying their Docks and Town Centers and once you've eliminated their military, they will still have their economy pumping out Villies. The Persian economy is also an interesting one; only 11% of present-day Iran is arable for farming. The core Persian cities are set mostly on that arable land, and on natural harbors so a creation speed bonus makes more sense than, say, the British cheaper Town Center bonus or the Japanese cheaper Mill bonus. Persian ships were pretty good and fishery was important to them although they didn't have a massive military fleet especially in the Middle Ages, so I don't quite know why the Docks have such a broad bonus. I think the Greek naval traditions came from Persia...or not, I don't remember the actual research done on that subject. Still, the Persian Navy had holdings as far as present-day Yemen.

* Start with +50 F and w

The Sassanid Empire was among the strongest civilizations during the Dark Age. Nowadays the idea of the Dark Ages being particularly crappier (Dark was originally coined because we don't have many records of the period, so historians were in the ""Dark"") is starting to fade away. But one thing is for sure, the rest of the world didn't quite suffer from a Dark Age and neither did Persia. The Persians hit a 
low point in their civilizations just prior and during the Islamic invasion but during the majority of the European ""Dark Ages"" they were pretty well off. So you get this bonus. The Persians have a [famous refrigeration system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakhchal) for their food involving...uhh, undergroundiness and vapor. I think. So it makes sense for the Persians to have more Food than everybody else.

* TEAM BONUS: Knights +2 Atk vs Archers

Persia used the Composite Bow to great effect, just like much of Asia. However, this also meant their neighbors used them, too. Persia was situated right near the Central Asian steppes, which meant that they would have also had to deal with nomads utilizing the Horse and the Bow. Their wars with Babylonians, Assyrians, Scythians, Turks, Arabs, Indians, and Tajiks showed them how to use the Bow and also how to defeat Archers. In fact, Heavy Cavalry was probably innovated in order to defeat massed Archery; obviously a man wearing alot of armor could withstand arrow blows but he'd be too slow to catch lighter armored archers. A horse makes him mobile and able to mow down Archers. 
So it makes sense that Persian Knights are among the best archery counters.

**Livestream!**

Not a fan of reading? You can join me and the community team live tomorrow at 10AM Pacific twitch.tv/ageofempires – or right in the game launcher – for all of the info below and more!

**Steam Summer Sale!**

If you’ve been waiting for a sale, the steam summer sale is waiting for you! Between July 11 and July 22nd AOE II HD and AOEIII are participating in the Steam Summer Sale, along with several other Microsoft Studios titles. Keep an eye out for some huge discounts on some of your favorite games.

**Trading Cards**

I’ve been hearing a lot of comments recently around trading cards and the program Valve has started. Like many of you, we think it is pretty cool and are looking into the program to see what makes sense to do with it. I don’t have anything to announce at this stage, but keep your ears open, we’ve got a lot we’ll be doing with AOE II HD down the road! 

**More streams &amp; Blogs**

Over the next two months, we’re going to do an increase of development blogs, updates, and streams for the franchise. Got a suggestion on what we should talk about for a stream? Preferences on any particular people we should talk with or include on a stream or blog? A favorite custom scenario we should demo? Let us know by posting here! 
.
.

**Beta Patch 2.5**

We’re excited to announce our next beta patch, 2.5, now available for download. We’re expecting to be pushing this out to everyone to replace 2.3 over the next week or so as we iron out a few last quirks, but wanted to give you the opportunity to check it out immediately! 

**Ladders &amp; Rankings**

Since launch, the ranking system on AOE II HD wasn’t as good as we wanted it to be, and we’ve been spending some time working with the FE team to make a number of improvements. Due to the changes, 2.5 beta onward will be using entirely new ladders, so you’ll be starting fresh. When we go from beta to the masses, we’ll reset the boards so everyone starts as a level footing.

How will the new leaderboards be organized? The core functionality will operate on a ranked ELO system, something most competitive players have grown accustomed to over the years. Winning a game will grant you elo points, with the amount depending on the skill level of your opponent. Over time we’ll be investigating some additional techniques to keep the leaderboards interesting, and with 2.6 and beyond may see implementations of new short term “challenge” boards we reset from time to time, decay systems, and more. For now though our focus is on implementing a meaningful competitive leaderboard. 

To do so, we are separating RM and DM leaderboards into separate rankings, so every player will have multiple ELO scores associated with their profile. We’re seeing some exciting developments from 3rd parties in creating complex sites for leaderboards and ratings, and are really looking forward to seeing what they do with the new ladders. 

**Launcher Updates**

Our game launcher has been a useful way to provide some patch update notifications, but we haven’t been updating it with the frequency or agility that we’d like. To improve that, there have been some significant changes to how we’re handle information processing in the launcher. Most of these are under the hood, but will allow us to put up new information easier, and even create live streams right into the launcher. This particular piece will be finalized once we push 2.5 out to the public.

**Gameplay Changes / Updates**

Beta 2.4 was an experimental patch for us in many ways, we wanted to push the bounds and tried a few things we didn't know if it would make sense to put into 2.5. Because we weren't pushing it out as an official patch, this meant we were able to be a bit riskier on some changes. For the most part the results were positive, and it allowed us to identify a number of issues to fix that would otherwise not have been apparent. 

One of the biggest modifications in beta patch 2.4 was the unit selection size. While the 40 from the original game was often cited as restrictive, in upping the limit to 200 we ran into several new challenges. Such a drastic increase has an inherent effect on DM types of gameplay, where unit micro is critical for successful battles. Reducing some of the unnecessary APM for moving a large army wasn't on its own an issue, but combined with the second challenge it affected gameplay more than we were comfortable with.

The second issue has to do with unit formations and movement AI. Over a decade ago the command structure and pathing for the game was handled in a way designed for 28.8 or 56k modems and Pentium CPUs popular at the turn of the century. The movement logic is something we're delving into, but with 200 units in a single formation there were a number of unexpected and quirky behaviors. Because of this we've backed down the max unit selection size to a more moderate 60 units. This should provide a utility boost over the 40 previously available, while avoiding the negative performance and game effects from our experimentation.

**Lobby Changes**

The existing lobby system provides some basic information, but we’ve had a number of requests and we’re exploring different ways to improve it. You will see a few changes being placed into 2.5 already, just select one of the games and some information about the included players will be displayed, including their ELO for that ladder. 
The biggest lobby request we’ve heard is unfortunately surprisingly tough due to the steam matchmaking API. We’re not able to get ping numbers directly through steam, and it doesn’t show up until you’ve fully connected into a game. To save space, I’ll talk about this more on the live stream tomorrow about what challenges we face, and some of the things we are looking into, but to help you select your games better, we’ve added in a lobby filter titled “region” with several settings.

**Full list of Patch Notes (from 2.3)**
&gt;**Tech tree**:
&gt;&gt;* Implementation of unique unit with purple legend entry, and purple boxes for all unique units. Make sure any unique unit is not visible by more than one civ.
&gt;&gt;* Tech tree should show up properly at all scales on both the left and right side. There were several clipping bugs when the window was at a 4:3 aspect ratio.
&gt;&gt;* Scrolling to the left or right in windowed mode should feel right. Before it would only scroll in some cases when you were well outside the window boundaries. 
&gt;&gt;* Scrolling should be disabled when you are close to the bottom of the window so it doesn’t interfere with resizing.
&gt;&gt;* Scroll and close buttons are always centered now in any resolution/aspect ratio.



-----------------------------------
&gt;**Gameplay**
&gt;&gt;* **Maximum Selection Size**
&gt;&gt;* Increased from 40 (2.3) to 60 (2.5). Backed down from 200 in 2.4beta due to aforementioned reasons
&gt;&gt;* **Hotkeys**
&gt;&gt;* Reverted hotkey changes from 2.3 that caused incorrectly functioning shift + alt control group commands
&gt;&gt;* You can now hotkey groups 0-9. (An added control group over the original 1-9)
&gt;&gt;* The hotkey reset button will not scroll the menu to the top of the screen anymore
&gt;&gt;* Clicking “reset hotkeys” will restore the key to the default instead of making there be no hotkey for the item.

-----------------------------------
&gt;**Localization**
&gt;&gt;* English strings are no longer locked inside language.dll, but use language_base.txt. Other languages will be converted to this new system in upcoming patches.
&gt;&gt;* Steam Stats / Achievements
&gt;&gt;* Single Battle Buildings Razed stat and Single Battle Buildings Lost stat was incorrectly using units lost and has been corrected. These stats/achievements will be reset on the official 2.5 release

-----------------------------------
&gt;**Cheats**
&gt;&gt;* From 2.3, cheats for wood, food, gold, and stone are now 10,000 instead of 1,000 and should reduce the wear and tear on your ctrl + v keys.

-----------------------------------
&gt;**Lobby / Quickmatch**
&gt;&gt;* Since only a small % of players utilize the beta build, this will become more visible when 2.5 replaces 2.3 here soon.
&gt;&gt;* Quickmatch should match players with the closest applicable ELO ratings and should use DM or RM ratings depending on which mode is selected.
&gt;&gt;* Lobby games are now sorted properly, with games on top reported closest to host according to Steam.
&gt;&gt;* Regional settings for lobbies will be primarily based on your Steam download region settings, thus unsurprisingly it is recommended to select the download location closest to you. 
&gt;&gt;* You can filter lobbies and quickmatch by regional settings including:
&gt;&gt;* Worldwide – Shows everyone on the patch!
&gt;&gt;* Far – Within a continent or two roughly. 
&gt;&gt;* Regional – Your region and surrounding regions
&gt;&gt;* Close – Only games in the same region as you
&gt;&gt;* Additional information in the lobby browser. Clicking once on a game will display added info including:
&gt;&gt;* Names of players in game
&gt;&gt;* ELO of players in game for the associated gametype
&gt;&gt;* Indication of whether the game is RM or DM
&gt;&gt;* Other misc information (i.e. scenario name)
&gt;&gt;* Double click to join a game lobby

-----------------------------------
&gt;**Performance changes from 2.3**
&gt;&gt;* Internal frame rate is capped at 60 (from 20).
&gt;&gt;* User interface updates 10 times per second as opposed to once per second. (mini-map, progress bars, etc)
&gt;&gt;* If you encounter any issues with frame rate unlocks, you can revert to the original behavior by running the game with -ORIGFPS. You can right click on Age of Empires II: HD Edition in Steam, go to properties. Then click on “Set Launch Options” and enter -ORIGFPS. It will remember this setting, so you may eventually want to remove it later

-----------------------------------
&gt;**Leaderboards &amp; ELO Ratings**
&gt;&gt;* The ELO calculations have been completely rewritten from the live version in 2.3 and follow the old MS Zone calculations. These boards will be reset again at the go-live for 2.5. Here are the known rules
&gt;&gt;* Leaderboard ELO calculations are only considered for games that contain exactly two teams. Any other combinations of teams are not considered for ELO calculations, such as a 3 player free for all
&gt;&gt;* There are two separate ranked leaderboards which encompass the following:
&gt;&gt;* Deathmatch games will be ranked on the DM leaderboard.
&gt;&gt;* Random Map, Turbo RM, King of the Hill, Regicide, Defend the Wonder, and Wonder Race are part of the RM leaderboard. 
&gt;&gt;* Any other mode will not be considered for ELO score calculations and is unranked, such as custom scenarios.
&gt;&gt;* There is a minimum time that a ranked game requires before the game will be officially calculated on the leaderboard. 2 minutes for DM and 5 minutes for RM. Games under those time limits are considered pre-maturely completed and are not scored. 
&gt;&gt;* A pre-game penalty is deducted for starting any ranked match. The 3 points is refunded back at the end of the game – whether you win, lose, resign, or quit, irregardless of the time limits for determining whether an ELO calculation kicks in (5 minutes RM, 2 minutes DM). It is designed to penalize players that pull the network plug to avoid finishing games.
&gt;&gt;* Any MP game that is saved and restored later will be considered an unranked game to avoid exploitation.

-----------------------------------
&gt;**Known Issues**
&gt;&gt;* It is highly recommended when moving to the beta build (or when upgrading between builds) to create a new player profile to avoid any potential conflicts during the upgrade. You can do so within the game by going to options, deleting the current profile, and creating a new one. 
&gt;&gt;*  If you do a fresh install of AOE II HD after having the game on your system, in certain circumstances text may appear to ‘vanish’ from in-game. This is a result of font files in the steam folder needing to be read on startup. (Windows thinks you got rid of the fonts and didn’t initialize them again when you redownloaded the game). Simply restart your machine and the text will re-appear.
&gt;&gt;*  We are tracking several rare crashes across multiple versions on windows XP during campaign play and will continue to investigate to improve stability.
&gt;&gt;*  Please ensure you are using a copy legitimately purchased through official retail channels (amazon, Steam, GameStop, etc) and downloaded through Steam when attempting to play AOE II HD. We cannot support issues that may crop up with other versions.

**WE WILL BE VINDICATED BY HISTORY**

This is the most boring section so I’m just going to try and talk about some interesting stuff that you probably don’t know about. Well, this next paragraph is boring but the next few aren’t, trust me!

The word “Inca” means “Lord” in the Inca language, Quechua. The peoples of the Empire are called the “Quechua,” and the Empire itself was known as “Tawantinsuyu,” which means “Four United Regions” and refers to each district or “Suyu” of the empire. The entirety of the people became known as “Inca” because the Spanish integrated the upper classes of their new colony into their conquest.

South America is home not just to the Inca but also numerous other tribes and one of the things that really got my historical loins stirring is the story of the first European contact with the Amazonians. A Portuguese explorer whose name escapes me entered the Amazons and there the natives told him about a great “white king” who lived far to the west and the riches of his empire.

This explorer guy actually convinced an army of Amazonians to try and conquer the land of the white king, and got to Tawantinsuyu. An Inca Army had a skirmish with the explorer and his native allies. The explorer guy went back to the Amazons to regroup but the Amazonians took this as a sign of cowardice and ate him.

I think.

So that was pretty crazy.

Another crazy thing is that the Inca traded with the Muisca people who lived in present-day Colombia. The Muiscans had a small confederation of tribes and villages and were part of the greater Chibchah people, and the Chibchahs lived along Panama, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. We have evidence that the Chibchah traded with the Mayans and the Aztecs, and they also traded with the Inca. That’s the closest we’ve gotten to Inca-Meso contact.

There are some weirdos who think that a group related to the Inca migrated out of South America and made it to Mesoamerica and then called themselves the Purepecha AKA the Tarascans.

Out of all the civs in AoE2, the Inca fought the Spanish and...the Spanish. Hrmderohigadhoahaw.

**WE DOIN’ BIG INCA BE UNIQUE check ‘em out now BIG INCA ON BONUSES PEAK**

* Start with free Turkey

The Inca didn’t have Turkeys so right off the start you might think this is historically inaccurate. On face value it is, but I think I know what’s going on here. I would say the most important difference between the New World civilizations and the Old World ones is their lack of a draft animal. The horse, donkey, mule, camel, and the ox allowed far away civilizations to communicate with one another. Only the South American civilizations had a draft animal, the llama. I believe that this bonus represents this idea. If you also believe that the Incas represent a broader swath of civilizations, then you’ll realize that the Incas are a strong early game civ thanks to this and other bonuses. South America is home to the oldest civilizations in the Americas and this gives the Incas a strong base from which they derived their own culture.

* Houses support +5 population

I’m not really sure what this bonus is supposed to represent but I’ve got a few ideas. The Andes doesn’t have much wood, so the Incas would have had to be pretty good at conserving it. This bonus makes it so that the Incas spend 2.5 Wood per population vs other civs’ 5 Wood per population (remember that FE makes Houses cost 25 Wood, not 30).  Heck the Incas made a good portion of their buildings out of Stone and not wood, so when you combine this with their building Stone price reduction, you can pretend that the 15% of Stone for those buildings is secretly whisked away to the Inca Houses...or not, because that doesn’t really make any sense. The other main thing to consider is the fact that the Inca’s best tool was population. They always had the most manpower of any other state in the region. Their massive stone cities were built without the wheel and they needed a huge organized force to build them. Their armies were pretty huge and most adult males in the Empire were always ready for combat.  An interesting part of the Inca system was their use of diplomacy rather than conquest. They were conquerors for sure, but they often added other groups to their empire by lavishing their rulers with gifts and showing them the benefits of Inca society, thus avoiding conflict and adding a ready population to their polity.

* Villagers affected by Infantry Blacksmith upgrades

I can’t tell the exact historical significance of this, either, but there’s some things we can try. Inca males were all ready fighters, although this wasn’t moreso than European polities. But by the 16th century, there were more professional armies in Europe so the farmers and merchants and workers could be considered “soft.” Not so in the Inca Empire. Another thing is that the people of the Andes are hardier than people from elsewhere in the world. Their blood is thicker and their lungs can hold more oxygen, suiting them to an oxygen-scarce environment such as the high mountains. While the Incas didn’t have iron, they might have had more “iron” in their blood.

* Buildings cost -15% Stone

The Incas were expert stone masons. If you google search Inca buildings, you’ll see their characteristic stone walls (and also on their Wonder), which are overall rectangular-shaped but made up of a jigsaw puzzle of seemingly random shapes. The Incas would cut stone and shape them based on pre-existing fractures, and then they managed to place them on top of each other without any mortar to form pretty decent geometric shapes. That’s not to say the Incas just stumbled upon geometry: they also had buildings made of adobe and mortar that were more similar to Old World buildings and these were mainly for ceremonial places and temples. Their huge stone block buildings had rounded corners and edges and were usually sloped inwards so combined with their jigsaw nature, they have fantastic earthquake resistance. In gameplay, this means an Inca build a tower in the Feudal Age, and then build a TC in the Castle Age with their starting Stone, which is something no other civs can do. They are also the only civ to have cheaper Towers and Outposts, and have the Stone cost for TCs reduced.

* Team Bonus: Farms built +50% faster

Inca Farming was fantastic, and this bonus doesn’t really do it justice but 5ish other civs get Farming-related bonuses. At least they get something. The Incas had the most nutrient dense and cheap crop in the world: the potato. Once the Incas were conquered and the potato spread, it became a staple in the diets of nearly every nation and country. The potato is fairly hardy since the edible part grows underground,

* UNIQUE UNIT: Kamayuk: Anti-Cavalry Infantry with slight ranged attack

Kamayuks are officers in the Inca army. They have huge ass spears that give them 1 range but this is not accurate at all. Pikes are supposed to be like 12 feet long, so the Kamayuk spears should be like 20 feet long. Since the Inca would have never had to face a strong heavy cavalry enemy until AFTER the Spanish conquered them, they would have never developed anti-Cavalry techniques but who cares. A lone Kamayuk does not do so well vs most Infantry units in the game. They lose to Champions 1v1. Heck, I think they lose to Champions up to around 5 units.

* UNIQUE UNIT: Slinger: Anti-Infantry Archer

I like to think of the Slinger as the true Inca UU. It’s a really great unit. It’s a ranged unit that slaughters Infantry (though, that’s not it’s best use IMO) so it’s probably the only archer that counters Eagles by themselves. The Incas seem to be an “anti-Meso” civ, with a stronger early game as opposed to a ridiculous early Imp and the Slinger allows them to repel the Aztec and Mayan Eagle swarm. It also allows them to repel the other main early Imp unit, the Ram, and that’s why I think this dude is most useful. They also kill Trebs, and they only have 1 less attack than Arblaests. I mean, that’s actually rather significant but they do pretty well in the regular Archer role thanks to their UT which upgrades their foot speed. Anyway the sling is a weapon used by many cultures but it fell out of use in the late medieval period. The reason the Incas get a handy Slinger for the later stage of the game is because they made good use of slings as well as the ayllo. I’ll explain what the Ayllo is in a bit.

* UNIQUE TECH: Andean Slings: Slingers, Skirmishers lose minimum range

“Andean slings” tend to refer to the semi-unique Inca weapon, the ayllo. An ayllo is two or three or sometimes even more stone balls tied to ropes which are then tied together to one larger rope. The user swings the rope around above his head like a sling and throws it at animals or people. South American cowboys are famous for using ayllos, which are now known by their Spanish name “bolas.” I have no idea what it has to do with minimum range but it makes their Skirmishers unique. Skirmishers throw spears and the Inca had atlatls, which they call Estolica.

* UNIQUE TECH: Couriers: Eagles, Slingers, Kamayuks +10% movement speed

This tech is a reference to the chaskis, the couriers of the Empire. One of the prime traits of the Inca Empire was their road system and extremely efficient couriers. Inca roads were of course made with the Incas’ expert stone cutting techniques, and some of them had originally been built by the Wari Empire. When valleys separated the roads, the Incas would create [very unsafe looking bridges made of rope](http://www.proprofs.com/flashcards/upload/a4081993.jpg). These bridges would have to be maintained by the local villagers as part of their tribute to the Inca ruler. Another trait of the road system are the stop off points set at a day’s march from each other, which would be maintained with food by citizens in order to give the Chaskis and armies rest and supplies. Since much of the Incas’ state was in the mountains, so stairways were a common part of the roads. Llamas are very similar to goats and they readily climb up steep inclines but  Spaniards horses did not like stairs. Inca Eagles become as fast as Mangudai, and they are only slightly outdone by Light Cavalry.

* WONDER: Macchu Picchu, Cusco Region, Peru

This Wonder appears to be a juxtaposition of several elements of Macchu Picchu. Macchu Picchu means “Old Dude Mountain/Pyramid,” or “Old Mountain.” It also sounds alot like [Macho Pichu](http://gryphyn-bloodheart.deviantart.com/art/Poketars-Macho-Pichu-197200571). The top shriney looking thing is the [Temple of the Sun](http://famouswonders.com/wp-content/gallery/machu-picchu/temple-of-the-sun-at-machu-picchu.jpg). The sides [are terraced](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/ancient/images/sw/machu-picchu-stairs-975059-sw.jpg) and the front of the Wonder even looks like that particular picture, complete with long ass staircase. The “entrance” at the bottom might be a reference to the “Temple of the Moon” that sort of sits on the side of the mountain (the Picchu), although it looks nothing like it. The little slits above the entrance looks like [this](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_7iQgfkaWJAE/S_RelLhzwBI/AAAAAAAABRI/mSqQQJJ6ewc/s400/Machu+Picchu+159++4x3+.jpg).

* LANGUAGE: Quechua

Quechua is pretty rad I guess. There’s a whole bunch of Quechua related languages in and around the Inca Empire, as expected. It might be related to Aymara. Jeez, I don’t know. I DON’T KNOW, FUCK. One of the crazier things about Quechua (and Aymara) is that the past is in front of Quechua speakers while the future is behind, whereas most people think that we point forward towards the future while the past is left behind. I think the idea is that everybody has knowledge of what’s happened in the past while we can’t see the future or some shit.

1365371166.0,34,self.aoe2,1bvjrk,Rating/Matchmaking/Lobby are Completely Broken,mariano54,39,5,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1bvjrk/ratingmatchmakinglobby_are_completely_broken/,"Hi, I have been playing AoC for quite a while, and I played a lot on Voobly. There is a large number of players that come from voobly/gameranger, and have some experience with the game. However with the current state of the rating system, it is very hard to stay. Let me explain. I know there are problems with lag/connectivity, but hopefully these will be patched over time. This post is based 100% on design of the matchmaking.

In Voobly, it would be a challenge to raise your rating. You could see everyone else's ratings, and you would usually play against similarly skilled opponents, and try to improve your skills / increase your rating. Yes, there were many problems with voobly, but in general it was easy to set up a balanced game of up to 4v4. 

Now, in the HD version, this is impossible. Let me start by the quickplay option. In Starcraft 2, quickplay sets you up with a similar opponent, and then ranks you on the ladder based on your performance. Quickplay here though, has many issues.

* It does not let you choose normal game speed (I don't know who made this horrible decision).
     
* If you choose random, your opponent might not have random (bad for balance). Why do we have to choose a  civ before matchmaking?
     
* It does not let you change other game settings, such as size. 1v1 size is set to small (3 player...)
     
* It does not match you with similar skill opponents!! How is this possible? This makes no sense. In a game where even the slightest change in skill/experience will make the game one sided, this is horrible!

Ok so quickplay is not ideal, and it will result with one sided games every time I play. Therefore I have to use the lobby to play. However there are many issues with the lobby as well.

* No unrated games...
     
* No ratings displayed. How am I supposed to see how good people are?? Once again I have to specify (previous experience/no noobs) and yet I still have never gotten a balanced 4v4! Even if ratings are specified, however, it would mean nothing, since one can simply raise rating by playing quickplay and **winning every time** against average players. 
     
* Different regions for each continent. I have friends in Argentina. There are people with friends/family all over the world. We don't want to change some random file to fix this. Make this worldwide! People in Australia for example only see 5 games in the lobby.
     
* No custom Scenario lobby. Also custom scenarios don't have a different rating system. 

Now, the game could work perfectly with no lag, and no fps issues, but I don't think I can stand these matchmaking problems for too much longer. It is very difficult to set up an even game. I can imagine how frustrated better players would be. This rating system means nothing for them, since anyone can get to the top. There are no leaderboards, and you can't see another person's rating. 

I hoped that this HD version would revive the competitive scene of AoC. But it looks like this is not going to happen. I can't see any serious pro gamer playing the HD version with the current state of things.

However, these things aren't issues with not having enough time, these things can be coded and implemented in hours. We just need to let Hidden Path know that this is important, and it will increase not only the long term survival of the multiplayer aspect, but also their profit!

The couldn't get the stream live until 3 hours after the scheduled time.

Once they finally went live, the commentator co-oped daut. It wasn't long before everyone noticed that the game was out of sync! So it looked like daut had tons of idles and was playing like a noob. Even when dreams (who helped with commentary) pointed this out, the commentator siad everything look ""normal."" Even someone who's played half a dozen games could recognize that something wasn't right.

The commentator blamed the problems on ""ping"" and the ""streaming software."" Both are completely unrelated to the problem they were experiencing in-game. 

The host then tries to instead play through the first scenario of the huns campaign on moderate difficulty... and LOSES after 4 minutes and has to start over.

**I want anybody who reads this to make suggestions for the civ attributes and tech tree.**

**APACHE HISTORY**

I'm not going to go much into depth on the history of the civs for this series because this is honestly the most boring part of each installment. I will try to talk more about how the civ's history would apply to their design if they were in Age of Empires 2.

The Apache and the Navajo peoples migrated from around present-day Alaska and Yukon to head far south to the American southwest. Their mythology features a migration narrative and their languages are related to the people of the north. Heck, some scholars have shown a decent correlation between the languages of these North American peoples and small groups in Siberia in the Yenisei River area. How nutso is that!?

Most of our info about the Apache during the extremely late Medieval period (I'm talking 1540s-1600) comes from Spanish expeditions after the conquest of the Aztec Empire and we can make some extrapolations from their later history.

The Apache were a very nomadic, hunter-gatherer type of people and were regarded as expert strategists with a propensity for raiding.

The Navajo interacted with the Puebloan people and learned some parts of their sedentary culture. The Navajo grew crops so we can have them create Mills and Farms with little repercussions. Hell, that doesn't matter too much because when it comes to historicity Age of Empires 2 is more about the strategy and tactics than the logistics. 

Heck if one were to create some sort of North American expansion that included the Puebloan peoples, there could be a Pueblo Architecture set and it could include the Apache.

**APACHE BONUSES AND UNIQUES**

* ECONOMIC BONUS: Some sort of bonus relating to Hunting, Foraging, Survival. Maybe Natural Resources Last +40% longer?

While the Navajo did Farm, the Apache lived in pretty tough conditions on the plains, hunting and gathering and moving about. Hunter-Gatherers tend to be extremely good at getting the most out of their resources. My idea is to make their natural resources last longer, and this would include Forage Bushes, Deer, and maybe even Turkeys or Sheep or Fish. A hypothetical Apache player would get 196 Food from a Deer, which is another Villager. 175 from a Forage Bush, that's a whole Villager compared to a regular Forage Bush. They'd get 476 Food from a Boar, which is almost the entire Feudal Age.

* MILITARY BONUS: Related to Archery? Archers +10% attack speed in Castle Age and +10% in Imperial Age for 20% total?

I had an idea for the Apache. They'd lack Crossbowman and Arbalest but they'd bonuses and techs to compensate and ultimately save on resources and time in the long run. Their Archers would fire faster than any other Archer such that they'd be equal to the Arbalests of other civs. I think their civ should focus on high aggression.

* DEFENSIVE BONUS: Something related to Teepees. Maybe they fight better near their Houses? Perhaps they build Teepees instead of Houses. Teepees would still give +5 population but are weaker. Units can garrison inside but don't fire arrows. Military units nearby attack +10% faster when in LoS of a Teepee? 

In Age of Empires 3, the Sioux didn't need Houses, but they could build Teepees, and the Teepees would give nearby units a buff. The Sioux are not Apache, but their ways of life are fairly similar and a similar bonus could work. The idea here would be to encourage the Apache to build a forward  base. They'd have a strong Dark and Feudal Age and they could raid the enemy base, build a Barracks and an Archery Range, and build their Houses at their forward base. Think of how nomadic that sounds? Think of how warlike that sounds? Strategic? These are attributes of the Apache.

Maybe the Teepees could be a ""unique building"" of the Apache, and they build them instead of Houses. So you would always build a Teepee or two nearby resources or near your enemies.

* MILITARY BONUS: Start with Eagle Scout instead of Scout Cavalry

By the way, I don't think every civ should have one Economic Bonus, one Military Bonus, and one Defensive Bonus, I just came up with some random bonuses and framed them that way. A couple of civs should have 2 Military bonuses and a 1 Economic one. Or maybe be like the Teutons and have like 3 Defensive bonuses. I'm actually glad I had 1 bonus of each broad category just to demonstrate how this will work. Anyway, the Apache didn't have ""Eagle Warriors,"" but neither did the Inca. The Mayans didn't really, though judging by their imagery there had to be at least one guy who looked at their stone murals and thought dressing up as an Eagle for battle was a good idea.

* TEAM BONUS: MILITARY BONUS: Houses/Teepees +4 LoS? Archery Range units +2 Atk vs Gunpowder units.

I thought that the LoS bonus would go well with their whole Teepee shtick.

The Apache managed to defeat enemies with superior arms frequently so giving their Skirms extra attack vs gunpowder units would give them a unique niche compared to Eagles, who don't like Hand Cannoneers. Plus with the foot Archer attack speed bonus, +2 attack ends up being ALOT if they attack very frequently.

* UNIQUE UNIT: Tomahawk?

I know that these guys are supposed to be an Archer civ, but there's already 2 Archer civs that lack gunpowder and have no/shitty horses (Britons and Mayans) so I think their UU should be a melee Infantry unit. We have a glut of Infantry UUs, so this guy has to be different somehow. I was thinking of a UU with a high attack speed to match the high attack speed Archers? He'd have low base attack to reflect the quality of his weapons but he'd attack maybe like once every second to make up for it. The Tomahawk is not quite an Apache unique weapon and honestly it would work better as a UU for an Algonquin civ. I can't come up with much better: can you?

The UU should probably be an anti-Villager unit. See, during the Feudal Age the whole point of rushing your enemy is to interfere in his economy and possibly kill Villagers while avoiding the enemy's own military units. This fits the Apache raid idea perfectly, which is why I based the civ around it. An anti-Villager UU would carry on that idea into the Castle Age. 

* CASTLE UNIQUE TECH: Archers +10% Movement Speed? All military units 5% faster movement speed?

No other civ has faster moving foot Archers. I can't quite see this being too OP considering Cavalry Archers exist and plus it would be researchable only at the Castle. If this were a bonus and available all game, I can see it being utterly ridiculous in the Feudal Age. Age of Empires 3 features the Apache as a ""minor civ"" that you can ally with on certain maps and they provide unique techs and units at their fairly static base. One of the techs allows all of your military units to move 5% faster so that's where I got the inspiration for this.

* IMPERIAL UNIQUE TECH: Archers +30% HPs

Since our Archers miss Crossbow and Arbalest, they need a little extra HP to help them get by. This would give your foot Archers +30% HPs, making them comparable to other civs' FU Arbalests.

WE GONNA LEARN ABOUT HUNGARAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY




**LMAO MAGYAR HISTORY!? MORE LIKE MA-GAY-AR HISTORY HUR HUR HUR GET I PUT THE WORD GAY IN THERE LOLOLOL!**

The Magyars of Forgotten Empires represents the present-day Hungarian people starting with their very first appearance in Europe. The word ""Hungarian"" comes from the On-oghur Confederation that existed in present-day Russia near the Black Sea while the Hungarians ethnonym is Magyar. On-oghur means ""ten arrows"" in Turkish You'll notice that this is kind of similar to the words Avar, Bulgar, and Khazar, and that's because those guys were probably in the On-Oghur Confederation, too, and the original Hungarians intermarried with them but their language is completely different but I'll get to that later. Most Europeans believed the Magyars to be yet another wave of invaders from the same tribe that started with the Huns. It seems like the Magyars had no problem with this idea and probably identified themselves as members of a larger Turkish ethnicity at the time. Some of them even claimed to be descended from the Huns. For a long period of time you had Hungarians with Turkic names participating in European affairs, marrying and inheriting land. Byzantine Emperor would even refer to Hungary as ""West Tourkia"" and to the Khazar state as ""East Tourkia."" Tourkia is a cognate of ""Turkiyye,"" which roughly means ""land of the Turks.""

The Hungarians cameo in Age of Empires 2 fairly early during the Ghengis Khan campaign. The final scenario features a 1v1 battle between the Mongols and the Hungarian town of Muhi. Since the Magyars didn't exist back then, the Teutons represented the Hungarians and it ends up being somewhat historical because the Knights Templar and Teutonic Knights were present at the battle.

Our Magyars start off somewhere on the steppes north of the Black Sea. The Scythians, related to the Persians, had dominated that area for hundreds of years until Turkic tribes began settling. The ancestors of the Magyars probably lived somewhere further north, with some of them settling Scandinavia as well as far north in Siberia. A portion of these people were caught up with the Turks at this time, teaching the Magyars to use raise horses and fight as cavalry. We can infer that the Magyars did pretty okay and were not quite conquered because they retained their language. Langauges tend to spread because the ruling class who are frequently conquerors of a certain people will use that language.

The Hungarians were Christianized in around 970 and Saint Stephen was married to Giselle of Bavaria, a member of the Ottonian Dynasty of the Holy Roman Empire. Saint Stephen would be the first King of Hungary after asking the Pope to crown him. Stephen was a pretty good ruler. I mean, the dude was canonized. Hungarians had always been pretty tolerant of other religions and peoples and they ruled over a majority Slavic population. They invited many foreigners to introduce their customs. However over time, due to their relations with the Holy Roman Empire the Hungarians would favor Catholicism even more and create prohibitions on Muslims, Jews, and Greek Orthodoxy.

Even as an identifiably European power, the Magyars kept contact with their ""homeland,"" which was ruled by Khazars, Cumans, and Kipchaks. When the Mongols invaded the Cuman-Kipchak Khanates, many refugees from that area went to Hungary. There was some pretty terrible uprisings as a result but that's another story for anotehr day. Trade was obviously important and when the Mongols invaded Khazaria, many of the tribes living there fled to Hungary. The Mongol Invasion would be a hell of a turning point for the Hungarians as they trusted the eastern arrivals less and less and suspected them of helping the Mongols. They would become an Empire. Thanks to how fucked up the European marriage and land inheritance system was, Hungary was ruled by members of the Angevin Dynasty, the same Dynasty from which Henry II and his son Richard the Lionhearted comes from. Hungary and Poland was ruled by the same Angevin ruler for a while, Louis I.

The Hungarians participated in a few Crusades. Frederick Barbarossa convinced one of the Hungarian Princes to join him with a contingent. The Ottomans eventually conquered most of Hungary and the land was partitioned between the Hapsburgs, a Transylvanian rulership, and the Ottomans.

The Hungarians fought against the Huns, Slavs, Teutons, Byzantines, Goths, Franks, Italians, and Turks.

**POTLEK POTLEK POTLEK**

* Villagers kill wolves with 1 strike

This is pretty much their only ""economic"" bonus. The Magyars are sort of like the reverse Byzantines, a full tech tree with lots of offensive goodies and very few defensive tools but no real economic bonus for the entire game. This definitely references the Magyar's semi-nomadic roots as a people who would hunt and often compete with other, non-human predators. This might not have anything to do with anything but there are many shepherding dog breeds from Hungary. The Komondor in particular is a humongous dog with the craziest, heaviest, dreadlock looking coat you've ever seen and was meant to fight wolves, with it's heavy coat acting as armor against wolf bites. So I guess you can imagine a Komondor walking aruond with his owner, killing wolves in one hit.

* Forging, Iron Casting, Blast Furnace free (requires Blacksmith)

The bonus that makes the Magyars so dangerous. The Melee offensive Blacksmith techs are not researched too often in higher level games until economies are stronger in late Castle and Imperial, with those resources being put into the armor upgrades, instead. I can't think of any great Hungarian-related blacksmithing techniques like Damascus Steel or Toledo Steel or Chinese standardization and coal use. The Black Army of King Matthias Corvinus was always extremely well-armed and armored so maybe this is a reference to those guys. It also means your Scout Cavalry in the Feudal Age are pretty vicious. You can put resources into Bloodlines and/or Scale Barding Armor, and then your Scouts will kill Villies in 8 hits rather than 10.

* Scout Cavalry line costs -10%

The horse archer civs all get bonuses that benefit Scout Cavalry. Huns get 20% faster working Stables, Turks get free Scout upgrades, Mongols get +33% more HPs, and the Magyars get cheaper Scouts. This is something of a nod to their semi-nomadic roots but it's also definitely also a reference to the Hussars themselves who are built from the Stable. I had originally talked about Hussars here and ended up having nothing to talk about for the Unique Unit so I'll expound on the Hussar there. Present-day Hungary was very attractive to the horse archer civilizations such as the Huns and Bulgars because of the Pannonian Basin, a wide open plain that happened to resemble the steppes of Russia. It was a great place to raise horses so the Hungarians remained a great horse power for the entire Middle Ages. The Magyars have a pumped up Husssar as their UU but the regular Hussars is still useful because the Magyars lack Faith and the Magyar Huszar lacks an attack bonus vs Monks.

* TEAM BONUS: Foot archers +2 LoS

Owing to their semi-nomadic roots, the Hungarians became one of the few, recognizeably European powers with a good archery force. There are no Cavalry Archers in the Feudal Age so this was probably meant to give the Magyars something earlier in the game in order to simulate the ""arrows of the Hungarians.""The rest of Europe was so goddamn scared of the Hungarians they even came up with a very common Latin prayer ""Sagittis Hungarorum Libera Nos Domine."" The Hungarians. The Magyars used a bow made of composite materials (usually bones, hides, and wood glued together) in a reflex shape. They most certainly got the bow design from their time in Central Asia. This is akin to the Mongol Scout Cavalry LoS bonus, although not quite as strong as the Mongol bonus obviously affects their first Scout.

The Magyars are tough semi-nomads with a penchant for horsemanship and archery.

Actually I remember the Magyars having a few different bonuses than what they have right now: buildings cost -15% and foot Archers having +20% HPs. The building one might have been too strong of a bonus given how strong the Magyars are militarily, and the foot Archer one might have been seen as a little useless given that the Magyars were supposed to make extensive use of Cavalry Archers.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1360460995.0,,Blank,True,t3_1881e6,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1881e6/historicar_vs_gameplar_day_21_the_magyars/,

**EL HISTORIA DE ESPAÑA LOOK AT THAT TILDE BITCH**

The Spanish in AoE2 seem to be more representative of the unified Kingdom of Spain at the end of the Middle Ages. Pretty much every aspect of the Spanish in game seems to reference the Spanish colonial period. We first see the Spanish in the El Cid campaign, although you control the Saracens for 2 of the scenarios. To make up for that, we also get to play as the Spanish during the Battle of Lepanto, where they contributed to a massive, Christian naval alliance called the Holy League that set out to do battle with the Ottoman Empire. The Spanish are obviously the antagonists of the Montezuma campaign.

In Age of Empires 2, the Spanish also seem to represent the Portuguese, and Portugal started off as another one of the Kingdoms of Spain along with Castile, Aragon, Leon, and Barcelona. Portugal's  first King received recognition from the Pope to be a separate Kingdom. Portugal's Medieval activity is pretty similar to the Spanish, anyway, with naval and colonization efforts. The Portugese and Spanish are seperate civs in AoE3.

If you remember reading about the Goths, the final Gothic kingdom was that of the Kingdom of Asturias (and also the Crimean Gothic state way over in Russia). The Visigoths were pushed north to Asturias by the Moorish conquests, and from that point on they vowed the Reconquista. By that time, they had adopted Latin and many Roman customs and thus they could be considered Spanish. The word Spain comes from “Hispania,” which was the Roman word for Spain and might mean “western land.”

Spain was defined by it's 800 year conflict with the Moors, who conquered, coexisted with, and were eventually conquered by the Spanish. This was seen as Christianity vs Islam, although there were periods of toleration from both sides where knowledge flowed to and from each. Spain grew rich from the Moors who had translated Latin and Greek manuscripts on science, and they also had access to trade routes in North Africa that stretched to Arabia and thus even further east.

As everybody knows, a year after the final defeat of the Moorish governments in Spain and the unification of the Spanish countries, Columbus sailed across the Atlantic to the Caribbean and opened up the Americas to contact from Europe. This was Spain at the height of it's power, with a large naval fleet, colonies for population growth, and trade.

The Spanish are related to Germanic peoples such as the Franks, Teutons, Goths, Vikings, and Britons, with roots in Celtic Iberia, they've had conflicts with the Saracens, Ottoman Turks, and the Byzantines.

**PRIMAS DE ESPAÑOLES**

* Builders work +30% faster except for Wonders

The Spanish were probably not more notable as builders than any other European civ, at least in Europe. However, the Kingdom of Castile was famous for it's many Keeps, Towers, and Castles all over the region. Many towns and cities in Spain would change hands between the Spanish and the Moors, and occasionally the Spanish would tear down Moorish Mosques and use them as foundation for Cathedrals. This bonus probably reflects more on the Spanish colonization efforts in the New World. At the tail end of the Middle Ages, Spain would create many colonies with fortifications and government centers quickly in their new territories and just like in game, this bonus is much more powerful late game than early. The Spanish had to create many colonies in the New World somehow and this bonus really reflects it. What is kind of crazy is that the Spanish had been colonizing long before the discovery of the New World as the Kingdom of Aragon conquered many territories in the Mediterranean Sea and colonized them.

* Blacksmith upgrades don't cost gold

My theory that the Spanish bonuses are meant to reflect a technologically superior civilization leads us to the Blacksmith. The Spaniards are the only civilization to receive a direct bonus to the Blacksmith. The most prolific Blacksmiths in medieval times were the Chinese, who definitely produced the largest quantities of iron and steel and get cheaper Blacksmith techs overall, and the Saracens, who were the guardians of the incredibly high quality Damascus steel. Spain was very high up there, though, as the Steel foundries in Toledo produced high quality steel, as well, perhaps the technique having been transmitted from the Arabs in Damascus to the Muslim conquerors of Spain. And yet before the Spanish and Moorish wars the city of Toledo, known as Toletum, was a prolific site of foundries for the Roman Empire and supplied many swords for the Roman legions. Even today Toledo retains it's importance in steel production. Now turning back to the idea of the Spanish being “superior,” imagine the Spanish reliance on Steel in the conquests of the New World: Spanish and their steel crossbows, steel muskets, steel swords, and steel armor for themselves and their horses.

* Cannon Galleons benefit from Ballistics

The Spanish Navy was pretty damn powerful during the Middle Ages and for longer than this bonus would imply. The Kingdom of Aragon competed with Genoa and Venice in terms of naval activity in the Mediterranean, conquering Sicily, Sardinia, southern Italy, and even parts of Greece. The Kingdom of Castile, on the opposite side of Spain, took the Canary Islands and fought the Moors by capturing key ports on the peninsula. Spanish ships were important to finding and holding the New World, but the actual martial power of the ships came into play more often in the Mediterranean Sea in the struggle against the Ottoman Empire. Spain jockeyed with the Turks for control of the North African coast and was a key member of the Holy League during the Battle of Lepanto (and you control the Spains for the scenario in AoE2). The Spanish style of naval warfare was to ram and board enemy ships with their swordsmen and gunners, so it's a little weird that the Cannon Galleons get this bonus. In fact it's partly because of this style that the Spanish Armada lost to a British fleet which ironically won because their ships were designed with cannons and ranged warfare in mind.

* Hand Cannoneers and Bombard Cannons	fire +15% faster

Yet another bonus for gunpowder. Spanish HCs are better than Turkish HCs, though Janissaries still beat both. Their Bombard Cannons are not quite as good versus buildings as civs with Siege Engineers, and the HP and range of the Turkish Bombards would probably give them the edge when it comes to anti-personnel uses. Anyway, the Spanish didn't quite have especially better cannons than anybody else but again, it's to highlight the idea of the most modern civ in AoE2. If you pretend that the Spanish also represent the Portugese, you can also pretend that the Hand Cannoneers are actually using matchlock muskets which the Portugese are credited with transmitting to the Chinese and the Japanese, which would make them notable users of handheld projectile gunpowder weapons.

* TEAM BONUS: Trade units generate +33% gold

The Spanish received a ton of trade from North Africa and held contacts with the Middle East, from which the goods of Asia would have to pass through. Not only that but the Spanish are responsible for the greatest trade route of all time at the price of millions of people the Americas and the Old World: the Columbian exchange. Both sides of the Atlantic traded tons of goods, plants, animals, diseases, and people. Spain became rich from the trade and it's probably fitting that they get this bonus (remember, it affects Trade Cogs, too). Spain was given dibs on the New World by the Pope, while Portugal got the Old World (and a bit of South America that would be known as Brazil today) and those guys brought about a virtual end to the Silk Road opening the way for Europeans to get to Asia by going under Africa.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1343225482.0,,Blank,True,t3_wdhee,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/wdhee/juego_contra_la_historicidad_dia_18_los/,

Ah, I can't it any more. :-(

**VIKING HISTORY**

The Vikings in AoE2 represent not just the very specific ""Vikings,"" the sailors who left Scandinavia in the Middle Ages but also the Scandinavian countries themselves. However, the word ""Viking"" is a word for going on a sea expedition. So any Scandinavian on a ship going out for business, whether pirates, raiders, merchants, or settlers were ""fara i viking,"" going on an expedition. Vikingrs are the men who go a viking. However, due to the fact that AoE2 is about empire building over a long period of time (think about a multiplayer game where you advance through all 4 ages), the Viking civ has to be a Scandinavian country or a group of Scandinavian settlers. The two scenarios featuring the Vikings are the Battle of Hastings and the Vinland Saga. In the Battle of Hastings, Harald Hardraade of Norway makes an appearance leading an army of Berserks, and we can only presume the icy square of land his base is on is the most southern tip of Norway. You play as the Vikings in the Vinland Saga where you start in Norway, raid an English village, attack Greenland, and land in Newfoundland, Canada.

The actual Scandinavian countries are a big mystery during the Viking Age. There are scant runic inscriptions on stone and very few records exist from the actual political states. We know from the myths and artifacts of Germanic tribes south of the Scandinavians that they were related to groups such as the Goths and Saxons and especially to the Angles and Jutes. In fact, the few records created by Goths state that the Goths were from an island called ""Gotland"" right between Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. Attila the Hun, whose Huns played an important role in the early history of many Germanic peoples, is a character in a few Norse Sagas. Eventually we begin to get a much brighter picture 
of the Scandinavian Kingdoms during the Middle Ages, and we know that cultural exchange occurred between the Scandinavians and their southern neighbors which resulted in those nations becoming very Feudal.

One of the most important aspects of the Vikings that some people don't really remember is the fact that they were settlers. They were well-known for their raids and incursions, but they also settled land in a very long range. Obviously the Scandinavians settled Iceland and Greenland, and today Greenland is technically still a part of Denmark. Groups of Norsemen (north men) were granted land in northern France, becoming the Normans (obviously, north men). The Normans then went on to conquer Sicily and southern Italy, and most famously they conquered England. A group of Norse known as the ""Rus"" became overlords of the Slavic population in Eastern Europe, and they eventually became the ""Russians."" Some Rus warriors were enlisted by the Byzantine Emperor to be his Varangian Guard, which led to some interesting correspondence between the Eastern Roman Emperor and his ""Vassal"" the Western Frankish Roman Emperor about their shared experiences with Scandinavian dudes from the North. The Kings of Norway and Denmark were occasionally Kings of England and parts of Scotland and Ireland.	

But of course their raids were infamous and for good reason. The Vikings sailed down rivers and on seas, raiding England, Scotland, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Greece, North Africa, Turkey, and Armenia. The Viking way of war would be to ride swiftly down rivers on their boats in lighting quick raids. Many cities had to be next to rivers, and relied on rivers for defense. Normally, an enemy wouldn't be able to cross these rivers and enter cities and building ships nearby would be stupid and leave them open to attack. The Vikings would camp from an appreciably far distance, strike, and then retreat as quickly as they came.

The Vikings Christianized and were then participants in European feudalism, as well as trade. Arab coins could be found in Sweden, and the Arabs themselves described many encounters with the Vikings. One of the most important factions in Europe was the mostly Scandinavian Hanseatic League, a collective of coastal or near coastal cities in Northern Europe formed in 1358 to protect against other polities and pirates. Member cities included Berlin in Germany, Krakow in Poland, Stockholm in Sweden, Bremen in Saxony, Novgorod in Russia, Bergen in Norway, Bruges in Belgium, and London in England. Each city would provide for the others' defense, shipping supplies and troops by sea. 
Other important events in Scandinavia was the Kalmar Union, which saw all the Scandinavian states and their holdings become one, large nation. However, Denmark was clearly the self-designated leader and internal squabbling led to it's downfall.

So the Vikings are related to the Teutons and the Goths as a larger, Germanic peoples. They conquered the Britons and Celts a few times and lent much of their culture to them. They fought the Spanish, the Saracens, the Byzantines, and maybe even some Persians. If you consider the Rus to be Viking, then they had conflict with the Mongols, too.

**VIKING BONUSES**

* Warships cost -20%

The Vikings are one of the most premier naval civilizations; in history, the Koreans, Japanese, Saracens, Turks, Spanish, and Byzantines come close but the Vikings have a deeply ingrained maritime and militaristic culture. At least, to their enemies. The Saracens colonized and explored a territory just as far and wide as the Vikings, but their naval conflicts were not characterized by the same ""zealotry"" as their land conquests (which is probably because they won AND lost alot of battles at sea). The Japanese relied heavily on the sea, but did not conquer far and wide in the Middle Ages. The Chinese traded by sea, but did not have many overseas holdings. The Byzantines conquered, traded, and supplied themselves by sea but were pretty tiny through most of the Middle Ages. So the Vikings get the most general naval, military bonus. Your Fishing and Trading fleets are well-protected by large numbers of Viking ships. You save wood per Galley which can be used for Fishing Ships. This is simply the best naval bonus in the game, and it allows the Vikings to dominate the seas in the Feudal Age, which is very, very apt to history. It also makes the Vikings OP in any map with some water, but hey whatever.

* Infantry +10/15/20% HPs starting in Feudal Age

Vikings were renowned for their fury in battle, and so were pretty much the entirety of Germanic peoples. In actual gameplay, this means that Viking Champions beat non-Aztec and non-Japanese Champions, and it means that when you pit one Pikemen versus one Paladin they actually perform almost exactly the same or better than non-Japanese Halberdiers because their extra sliver of HP means they can get one more attack-bonused strike on their mounted enemies. It's not the same story when there's multiple Pikes fighting multiple Paladins though, because more Halbs means more attack bonuses being thrown around while multiple Pikes simply do not have the same damage output. It also means Viking Infantry perform better against Archers; that flash +4 attack from Garland Wars or the extra 25% faster attack speed doesn't mean anything if they die before reaching their enemies. Due to how high pierce armor is and how low Arbalest attack power is, it works out to be 17 arrows to kill a Viking Champ versus 14 on every other Champion. This is similar to how the Celtic Champs are better versus Archers due to their foot speed.

* Wheelbarrow, Hand Cart free

I'm not 100% sure about this tech. The main trait of the Viking's economic prowess in relation to everybody else was their ability to colonize other lands, so they would make more sense with some sort of Town Center bonus like the Britons. At any rate, the Scandinavian countries were heavily agrarian and their countries heavily utilized slaves (known as Thralls; make a scenario with the Vikings and the 
Goths and you can pretend you're playing Mass Effect). Vikings were also really good traders, sailing all over and around Europe for trade. In game, this bonus is one of the most potent economic bonuses in the game, probably second to the Hunnic house bonus. I suppose you could say that if the Vikings were to go off and build a new base in another part of the world, like Normandy or Sicily or Byzantium or Iceland or Greenland, they'd be able to quickly create a strong economy in no time. The bonuses also mean that when you are in the Feudal and castle Age, you do not have to let up on the creation of Villagers, whereas other civs might have to stop creating Villagers for a short period to research Wheelbarrow and Hand Cart. This *might* be a reference to the fact that the Viking Age was a result of Scandinavia becoming overpopulated, as the Vikings were colonizers as well as raiders.

* TEAM BONUS: Docks cost -25%

A fairly broad bonus to the Viking Navy; not only does it mean that you have more Docks and you can create lots of ships faster (and cheaper thanks to the other bonus), but it also means that your Fishing Ships have plenty of spots to drop off their fish, allowing them to Fish more efficiently. Oddly enough, Scandinavia probably does not have huge numbers of natural Docks, at least not more than other 
countries and one of the key advantages of the Viking Longboats were their ability to be easily beached without Docks. However all the ships in AoE seem to be easy to beach and we can't just have the Villagers build Ships out of thing air (well, we could but that could be overpowered) so we get the Dock bonus instead to make up for it.

I should probably give this a bit more in depth description, so here we go.

Like I commented below, the idea is that you and as many people as you can find to play, all start in the middle of the map with two villagers surrounded by stone and gold. You first have to make the choice to try and quickly kill an enemies villagers before they get back to their village or make a run for your own village.The start of the game is also made harder by the fact you start with no resources what so ever. I want to edit the map so you have to search for an available village even, but I found doing that made it impossible to play with AI, since all they do is run around and get killed by wolves. And speaking of wolves the precious little gold and stone not within the center of the map is guarded by many Dire Wolves for added difficulty.

When the games starts, I have 200 of each resource, the CPU has 200+500 of each, which is 700. He starts gathering food from sheep and creates couple of villagers, then on the 4th minute goes into Feudal Age (he has the resources already). Just when he reaches Feudal Age, another increase of 500 each resource pops up!

From there he keeps making Men At Arms and try to attack my base, my only defense was to make a ""wall"" around my base, and at the same time try my best to go Castle Age so I can make Knights. This meant no military at all. I was focusing too much on my economy.

I beat him to Castle Age and boomed my economy, and then quickly to Imperial, I wanted those Paladins asap.

The other cheat i noticed is population, while this game has max 200 pop, the CPU went to 210 and I expect he would've gone even further if I didn't start my attack.

My attack at him had two main points, attack from multiple fronts (reached 5 different fronts at some point), and the second is destroy his houses. The reason behind that is, I noticed he has lots of villagers and if I destroy the houses, then his actual pop will be more than the available pop, means he cannot create military any more.

His base was well built with lots of towers and castles, it took me about 30 minutes to penetrate it. The full game is 2 hours 20 minutes. The first half is all about booming economy and defending my base, while the second part is raiding his base.

**HUNNIC HISTORY, MAYNE**

The Huns are, on the surface, the most one-dimensional civ in the game as far as representation goes. They're the Huns, a nomadic people who invaded Europe from the East sometime in the 4th century, and lasted only until the 5th. After that, they were absorbed by waves of other invaders from the East.

The Huns were chosen as an expansion pack civilization by Ensemble Studios because they were Conquerors. Ensemble didn't want The Conquerors expansion to just be a Renassaince expansion. By including the Huns, they were extending the history of AoE2 earlier to very late Roman times. And this makes sense because the term ""Dark Ages"" and the term ""Middles Ages"" don't have a clear cut beginning, and they don't have a clear cut end (which is why the other 4 expansion civs made it like they did). In order to include the Huns, ES had to exclude other Eastern European civs such as the Slavs and Magyars. Forgotten Empires, an fan Expansion created by AOCZone, has designed, developed, and tested their own Slav and Magyar civs. Anyhow, just quick thing about the Huns.

The Huns occupy a very interesting place in history like the other Central Asian civilizations in history because they were both in Europe and in Asia, and may have helped to jump start many events on both continents. Actually, it is difficult to say that they were in China; this viewpoint is controversial and without much evidence. Because the Huns didn't have a written language and they were nomads, they left behind very few traces of their existence. We know that they were a horse people of the Steppes. We just don't know if they were an Iranian people like the Scythians, or if they were a Turkic people like the Turks.

The group of Huns themselves probably weren't homogenous; they were most likely a confederation of various races, and they showed signs of this by incorporating the Germanic tribes of the Ostrogoths, Gepids, Alamanni, Scirii, Rugians, etc. The Huns had their own language, and we only know from a few simple words and the names of their Kings that they might have spoken a Turkic language. One of Attila's sons was named Dengizich, and his name had roots in a Turkic name from which the very infamous name ""Ghengis"" came. The Huns spoke the Goth language as a ""lingua franca,"" a common language between themselves, their subjects, and allies.

As you might already know, the Huns drove many Germanic tribes ahead of them. The Goths, for instance, occupied the area we now know as Ukraine, and the Huns came from that direction and attacked them, causing them to flee to the Roman Empire's borders. You could almost say that the Huns, if they didn't start them, accelerated the ""barbarian invasions"" into the Roman Empire.

Some scholars associate the Huns with the Xiognu, a confederacy of Steppe peoples who fought with China early on in the millenium, and the collapse of their political state caused many of them to ride westward. The word ""Hun,"" or at least it's equivalent, is invoked by the White Huns , an Iranian people who invaded India about a decade after the collapse of the Hunnic Empire in Europe.

I like to think that the Huns represent a whole swath of Eurasian Steppe peoples, most definitely the western ones who came into Europe, and that they are secretly the Hungarians. They have a combination of fully upgraded Paladins and Cavalry Archers, after all, as well as Hussars. They also have access to Walls and Towers, something the Goths don't have.

The Huns are related to the Turks and Mongols, they fought with the Byzantines, Persians, Franks, Goths, people similar to the Vikings, Britons, and Teutons, and may have fought with the Chinese.

**HUNS AND THEY BONUSES HOME BOI**

* Don't need Houses, but start with -100 Wood

The main bonus that makes the Huns who the Huns are. It's a truly nomadic bonus. Not *quite* historically accurate for the semi-nomadic Huns, but about as close as it's going to get without being completely unintuitive; a real semi-nomad bonus would be moveable Houses or something, and that has lots of potential to be stupid and annoying for the player and their enemies. This is also made a little egregrious because the Huns still have veritable cities with Archery Ranges, Stables, etc. The Asian Steppe Peoples used big, portable tents called Yurts (and you can see them in AoE2). These Yurts would have walls and ceilings made of straw or hide pieced together to form a sheet, and then wooden logs would form the support columns and beams for the sheets. It was a simple matter of folding the sheets up and bringing down the logs and then putting them in a horse drawn wagon and moving, then doing the reverse when you needed to camp. Hunnic armies, however, would cross very large swaths of territory without stopping to camp. Hun riders had multiple horses, and would switch mounts when one of them would get tired. They'd cut their horses and drink their blood while on the ride, and they'd put meat between the horse's back and the saddle, and riding for a couple of hours would pulverize and tenderize the meat until it was edible.

* Cavalry Archers cost -25%/30% starting in Castle Age

The majority of Hunnic armies were Cavalry Archers, and in fact they are credited with transmitting the stirrup to Europe. I'll explain the stirrup thing a little later. Cavalry Archers in medieval times were overpowered. They couldn't be caught due to their riders wearing very light armor, all the while firing arrows from a range. Steppe horses were especially uncatcheable since they were faster and stronger than horses elsewhere. The nomadic lifestyle of a Hun or a Turk resulted in smaller stature, even moreso for back then. A steppe rider was smaller and easier for their horses to carry! The Huns used a composite bow, probably among the first to be used in large numbers in Europe. Composite bows are made of a combination of wood, animal bone, and animal hide, with fats and tree sap used to glue the materials together. The result is a bow that is very, very resilient and allows for a very strong draw, thus a very high velocity arrow. Hun Cavalry Archers become comparable to foot archers in cost, so you pretty much have no reason to use Crossbowmen or Arbalests. This is accurate since the vast majority of Hun armies were mounted.

* Trebuchets +30% Accuracy

I'm not sure why the Huns get this bonus. They were really good at sacking and destroying cities, but they weren't really all that high tech, and they didn't have Trebs. Of course, the Treb is supposed to be a common siege weapon for all civs, so taking it away from a civ would be kind of bad but giving a civ a bonus for something they didn't use is really weird. The Huns definitely used Roman siege weapons; they had a Battering Ram when they attacked Utus in the Balkans, and catapults and ballista when they could procure them intact.

* TEAM BONUS: Stables work +20% faster

Another cavalry bonus. This ensures that a Hun player will use both the Cavalry Archers AND their Stable units. The Huns in particular used lots of light cavalry, armed with lances. The invention of the stirrup meant that a horseman could sit in his horse and hold a lance while galloping at full charge. When he runs into an enemy, the stirrup means he won't just fall off his horse and die. The Huns were credited for transferring the stirrup from Asia to Europe, and thus they could be credited for the dominance of heavy cavalry during the middle ages.

**HOLLA HOLLA THE THE HUN TECH TREE PLAYA**

* UNIQUE UNIT: Tarkan

When the developers created the Tarkan, they probably imagined a unit that would walk into enemy cities, destroy key fortifications, and run out. The reality is not so great. In actual gameplay, the Tarkan attack a bit slower than other units: something like 1 per 2.14 seconds. Most other units do 1 every 2 seconds or less.  Because of the slow attack, a group of Tarkans end up doing the same damage to most buildings as an equal number Knights, but they falter in combat due to their lower attack and speed. One thing that they ARE good at is destroying Castles, and they do so significantly faster than Knights. Don't try to use them on Bombard Towers though. Let's analyze them historically. If you look closely, the Tarkans are primed for raiding. They are armed with torches (which would explain their lack of battle prowess, it's kind of hard to fight man to man with a torch), they have high HPs and pierce armor, which allows them to shrug off arrow fire from buildings. They are as fast as Knights, which is still pretty quick, so they can sometimes dodge those same arrows. This actually ends up giving them an interesting parallel to their fellow barbarian unique unit, the Gothic Huskarls; Huskarls have extremely high piece armor instead of extremely high HP, and as infantry, they have an attack bonus versus buildings (Gothic infantry in general also have +1 bonus vs buildings). The word ""Tarkan"" is a title like Duke or Lord. You can find the word Tarkan or Tarqan or Tarjahan used by various Turco-Mongolic tribes to denote a regional governor or a general. The Tarkan in AoE2 is supposedly light cavalry, but they are actualy just as fast as Knights and have almost as high HP, so that kind of goes out the window. If I had designed the game, I would have made the Tarkan similar to a Hussar, but with maybe less HP and higher Attack. Incidentally, the Forgotten Empires mod/expansion has what is essentially a higher Attack powered Hussar as the Unique Unit of the Magyars.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1367018547.0,,Blank,True,t3_qn17k,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/qn17k/its_that_time_again_civ_vs_history_analysis_day_7/,

* Mexicans are the most mentally tough people on the planet. They eat beans and rice every goddamn day and don't want to kill themselves.

* Actually what's quite interesting is that most civilizations subsist on some sort of grain + bean combo. Medieval Europeans and Mediterranean dudes would do bread and fava beans, people living around the Indian Ocean would usually have rice and lentils, up in Asia it would be soy beans and rice, and in ancient Mexico it was actually black beans and corn, while down in South America the staple was amaranth and quiche and potatoes. Heck the Chinese have been doing the rice and beans thing longer than anybody else.

The campaign is going to be like the ES campaigns on steroids. Better map design, AI, more comprehensive story, more triggers, etc. But the general focus will be on build and destroy with one fixed force scenario just like in the campaigns.

There's a [MacBeth campaign at aokheaven](http://aok.heavengames.com/blacksmith/showfile.php?fileid=7523&amp;ci=9958a3ed8b30eb2431ec117d7ae376c1YToxOntpOjA7YToyOntpOjA7czoxNDoiU2VhcmNoIFJlc3VsdHMiO2k6MTtzOjM3OiJsaXN0ZXIucGhwP3N0YXJ0PTAmYW1wO3NlYXJjaD1tYWNiZXRoIjt9fQ==) that I thought was genius as well as a [Mayan campaign that was good](http://aok.heavengames.com/blacksmith/showfile.php?fileid=693&amp;ci=3d276a49e7d332eeb4c35d5e3107b617YToxOntpOjA7YToyOntpOjA7czoxNDoiU2VhcmNoIFJlc3VsdHMiO2k6MTtzOjM2OiJsaXN0ZXIucGhwP3N0YXJ0PTQwJmFtcDtzZWFyY2g9bWF5YW4iO319) about a semi-fictional Toltec invasion and they have most of the elements of a build up and destroy. So if you've played those, you know what I'm working towards.

The campaign will be called ""Sapa Inca,"" which means Great Lord in the Inca language. It's not named after a specific ruler because the player will control 5 generations of Inca rulers, starting with Viracocha.

**Outline of the Campaign**

* The first scenario will feature Viracocha and Pachacuti fighting the Chancas. The scenario will start with the player defending Cusco from the Chancas and then he will have to evacuate Viracocha off the map. The second leg will feature Viracocha's son Pachacuti arriving with an army to retake Cusco. He might even have to sneak into the city in a semi-fixed force section. The third section will have you build up Cuscos' defenses as well an army for an eventual invasion of Chanca land.

* The second scenario will be a semi-fictional pure build and destroy and feature the player as Tupac Inca Yupanqui defending Cusco from 4 diverse enemies kind of like the first Barbarossa and Montezuma missions: the Anti, the Chimu, the Aymara, and the Nazca. I had a silly idea to make the Chimu Saracens who would use huge llamas in battle (Mamelukes or...get this...LLAMALUKES), and the Middle Eastern set works as a stand in for Chimu architecture. The Anti would be Aztecs, the Aymara would be Mayans, and the Nazca would be Inca.

I'm going to scrap it but this is what I intended for the second scenario to look like:

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0By9K2ql9Dei5SmJ1a3FoTnh6dTA/edit?usp=sharing

Also Tupac will speak like 2Pac, the rapper.

* The third scenario would be about Tupac attempting to consolidate the mainland area and capture a number of cities before attacking the Chimor capital of Chan Chan. The player must compete with Chimor to capture 6 cities: Quito, Cajamarca, Tomebamba, and a few others that I haven't decided upon yet. Certain cities will have different objectives. For instance, the player will have to build a Wonder in Quito far to the north but they might have to destroy a Chimor built Wonder there first.

* Fourth scenario will be the Battle of the Maule River against the Mapuche. Tupac will be present in the battle as well as his son and successor Huayna Capac who was born in Tomebamba a couple decades ago. I'm thinking it should be sort of a Black Forest type mission except with jungle trees and mountains and stuff instead. I'm not sure exactly how it will play out yet.

* The fifth scenario will be an invasion of the city of Chan Chan, which would be a big city on the coast in the middle of the map. By this mission, Huayna Capac will have taken over as general. The player will have control of Tupac, whose combat skills have diminished, and Huayna as Hero units. Once the player finishes that conquest one of the generals of Chan Chan, Biggansmallcan, will flee to the Galapagos Islands and the player will have to give chase in a naval battle. This would represent Tupac's legendary sea voyage in the Pacific.

* The final scenario will feature Huayna Capac in the final year of his rule. He dies pretty early in the scenario and his two squabbling sons take control of the throne. The player takes control of Atahualpa and the northern part of the map while Huascar is his enemy in control of the south. Atahualpa and Huascar will play out the Inca Civil War in the span of one scenario with a very enlarged and rich looking Cusco in the middle, and the scenario will close with a group of strange men riding on horses armed with rifles traveling from the North.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,False,,Blank,True,t3_1eflg5,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1eflg5/who_wants_to_help_me_make_a_campaign/,

A quick disclaimer; I'm ok at this game, but not brilliant. A lot of tactics go way over my head, and in this game I made a number of errors and bad judgement calls. I'm still learning.

Four-way match, random civs, Japan East Sea map. I (green) am the Mayans (a civ that I don't enjoy - I like cavalry), up against the Teutons (blue), Goths (yellow), and the Britons (red). I start deep in Manchuria, in the westernmost point on the map. I start doing all the usual early game stuff, and begin exploring. As I do, I realise something - I'm the only one on the mainland. The other three players are all in Japan. Here is where I make one of my bad judgement calls: I should have taken a more active roll in the fighting, but instead I decide to hang back and let the others kill each other before swooping in and sweeping up the pieces.

An hour and a half into the game, and the total death toll is mounting. I've lost more men to wolves than to enemy action (these wolves were bad. I had to form a little eagle warrior Task Force to hunt them all down). I have another stroke of luck - all five relics are on the mainland. I can't win with them (or a wonder), but I still snap them up pretty quickly. The fighting in Japan isn't as heavy as I had hoped, but it is still pretty intense. (I later found out that the Goths in the north and the Britons in the south had both tried to Drush the Teutons, and their rushes had kinda...met).

Fast forward another half hour, and I'm feeling pretty smug. I have a strong economy, a powerful army, infinite gold (so to speak), and heaps of resources. At this point I'm considering building a wonder, just for the hell of it. This smugness wouldn't last long. While the other three still had plenty of resources, they had used a bit of foresight and realised that they wouldn't last forever. So they started talking to each other, and they came up with a cunning plan. They turned allied victory off and became allies, with the aim of joint defeating me, building bases on the mainland, before resuming hostilities. They had made their own Nazi-Soviet Pact, with me, poor little Poland, about to be divided up between them.

The first battle is, of course, at sea. The Mayan navy is pretty powerful, and I have plenty of wood, so this battle is rather fierce. Eventually, however, my navy is destroyed and most of my docks blown up. I still have one left, located below Korea, and the remnants of my navy retreats to defend it. Here is another potential bad judgement call. I probably had enough wood to rebuild my navy and go on the offensive. But I might not have, and with access to fish now gone, I was relying on farms for food. I decided not to rebuild it, and I stick by that.

As that battle ended, another began. Enemy troops began landing on the beaches. Before this match, I didn't think much of eagle warriors, but this battle proved their worth. They were maneuverable enough to get behind the British Lbows and other archers and destroy them, while my halbs and plumed archers defeated the cavalry/infantry attacks. This Battle raged on-and-off for a while, and finally ended when the enemy resources ran too low for them to continue.

Then the third battle began - the invasion of Japan. I sent my transport fleet, guarded by my ravaged navy, round Korea to land on the southern end of Japan, below the Britons. The landing is almost unapposed, and resistance in Briton's town is mediocre. I destroy his base and set up a small one of my own, even stealing some of his buildings. Then I move up to attack the Teutons. The fighting is heavier here, but still lighter than I expected. Their attacks are often hit-and-run, and they seem to be targeting my more expensive units, such as monks and trebs. There are Goths and Britons mingled amongst the Teuton attacks. I decide not to pursue them, instead I destroy the Teuton base. I don't want any sneak attacks from the rear. Finally I reach the ford between the Teutons and the Goths. It is heavily fortified, and I finally understand why resistance was so light. All three of them had gathered their armies to defend the Goths. I assumed they had turned allied victory back on. Fighting is heavy, and they throw everything they have left at me. They even attack with trebs, although my counter-trebs make firewood out of them. I lose quite a few troops here. An eagle warrior battalion was decimated by the last of the Lbows while trying to cross the ford. I make a few more mistakes. But finally I fight my way through, destroy their armies, and blow up the Gothic town. They surrender, and I win.

I used your mom, faggot to randomize the list of all civs so this is the schedule for the next few months. The Incas were supposed to be today, but the majority of people on this subreddit don't play Forgotten Empires so I figured that two Forgotten Empires civs in a row might kill these threads.

***Some issues for this round***

Round 1 took a little longer than expected. I don't think anybody liked having to wait almost two weeks for the 2nd round to start, so we will be much more stringent on getting your game complete. **You have a week to get your game in. If your game is not played, you will receive a tie, which is basically a double loss.** 

I do this because I am not always going to be able to judge who is at fault for not playing a game. It is not fair to try to pick out who should get a point, especially when a game is not even played. I have applied this rule to a few of your games in Round 1, in case you are wondering why you tied. If a person goes multiple rounds without playing a game, I reserve the right to bring in someone else in their place who wants to play. 
 
*** 

***What to do if your opponent doesn't answer your messages***

Email or message me that you have tried to play your game. If your opponent is totally non-responsive to me and you, he will be kicked out and you will receive a win.

***

***If you are no longer listed in the brackets***

You have been kicked out of the tournament. Sorry, you didn't respond for almost two weeks to anyone, and there are other people who want to play. If you want back in I can add you to the standby list.

I used to play Age of kings when I was kid and this new HD version is a good way for me to play it again. But here is the deal, I know the game pretty well, I spent many hours on it, but never playing seriously...
When I didn't use Cheat codes, I just stomp the AI and that's all.
With the new online system, I just realize I'm soooooo weak at this game :)
I can build a good efficient economy pretty fast and keep it working but I have issues to create an army above it to defend and to attack... The only way I can win an online game is to find a good player in my team, and send him my ressources ... That's not really brave :D.

Even on standard difficulty, I didn't find it to be that easy. So I went on Gameranger and joined a 2vs2 noobs only server to see if there was any chance of me prevailing. It was going great until I stumbled into the imperial age and noticed that an enemy villager was near my wall. Upon further inspection, there seemed to be more. ""What is this"" I thought to myself. Then suddenly, a SHITTON of villagers and monks seperate themselves from the dark fog and start converting my troops and attacking my walls. Once they were in they started beating on my beloved watchtowers like it was styrofoam. Needless to say I got demolished in the most embarrasing way possible. You can imagine that such players are way more experienced than I am.

So I looked around a bit on the internet if there were any interesting guides I could follow; the best things I've found were [this](http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Your-Economy-Boom-in-Age-of-Empires-2) and [this](http://www.wikihow.com/Win-in-Age-of-Empires-II). The problem is, the beginning goes okay for me often, but once I've made around 20 villagers I don't know what to do with my new villagers and start wasting time by not letting them do anything. The dark age (and feudal sometimes) goes pretty well for me, but after that I just don't know what the next step is, whether it is building specific defences, building a navy, investigate stuff etc.

To wrap it up; are there any tips you could share about strategies, defence and economy (basically the whole game)? Or is all the ""skill"" needed to win just experience and should I just practice against AI? Also which civilization do you recommend? Thanks in advance, and apologies for the wall of text.

Also, I really need to figure out those shortcut-keys.

Anyways, here are mine! For what it's worth, I usually play black forest and michi. 

**Favorite:**

**Goths** - Spamming Huskarels and infantry is so satisfying hearing those barracks working non-stop. Huskarels are an awesome unit and are impossible to kill without strong military units and raiding is just so damn easy with them. All in all, Goths are just fun to play. 

**Persians** - I love me some war elephants! I love that i don't have to mass many elephants before starting an attack, and then just continually overrun their base with elephants, as I create them faster than they can kill them off. 

**Least Favorite:**

**Turks** - The lack of trash units is really frustrating to me, as all the units are really expensive. It's a lot harder to sustain military production if your gold/trade runs out, and spamming units is a lot harder in general. 

**Vikings** - As a civilization, the Vikings just lack personality to me. None of the bonuses are really that special, and I never really use their unique units anyways.

Leaving you guys in the dark while the transition was taking place was very frustrating. This is a great community and I have very much enjoyed interacting with you. I will still be around to answer questions, but, over time, as Skybox works their own magic on the code, I will be able to offer less and less insight into the nuances of the tech.

That being said, I think we are all in for a treat. Skybox has already tackled some really tough bugs - things like fixing the tech tree may sound trivial, but those were not problems that could be solved by someone that had not taken the time to thoroughly study the way the engine works. As they increase their experience with the engine I think we will start to see AOE2 grow into dimensions that up until now have not been possible. I am really excited!

I just recently joined this subreddit after a wave of nostalgia over playing AoE2 swept over me from seeing the trailer for the HD version. Starcraft is one of my favorite games and my absolute favorite strategy game, but I don't want that to stop me from playing other RTS's, especially old ones that dominated my childhood. I enjoy both Brood War and the latest Starcraft game, so to me graphics and minor mechanical issues (such as awkward unit movement, limited hotkeys, and strange AI) are not of concern.

I read many reviews of the latest game, and I must say that I am still unsure of what to say. Most of them ranged from good to very bad. I decided to take my questions to this subreddit, where from what I read the responses to AoE2HD are mixed. What do you guys think of it? Would it be enjoyable for playing single-player campaigns and competing online? I also heard the game has many bugs and glitches. Should I wait for them to be fixed, or when the price drops? How does the competitive scene of this game compare to that of Starcraft? Is there a decently-sized community dedicated to it?

FYI villagers delete what they are carrying if you switch them to a different resource type (even from sheep to boar), This is something most people learn early on. However I've never seen mention anywhere that there are massive exceptions to this.

basically it seems if you get vills to gather something then they make a mining camp/lumbercamp or even farm/TC they still ""bank"" those resources instead of deleting them, even tho they are switching resource type.

no wonder I find booming so fucking tedious I've been making each villie drop his wood before building each farm this whole time.

1365104211.0,26,self.aoe2,1bojcq,"Age of Empires II: HD - Developer's Diaries, Part 1",jessebright,32,6,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1bojcq/age_of_empires_ii_hd_developers_diaries_part_1/,"Hey, I'm Mark Terrano - Chief Creative Officer at Hidden Path Entertainment, and this is the first in a series of Developer Diaries for Age of Empires II: HD Edition.which feels a little weird for me because the last time I wrote one of these for Age of Kings it was 1999 (as Lead Designer at Ensemble Studios in Dallas).

Age of Empires II: HD happened because a lot of people wanted to keep that dream alive. The technology has moved forward - operating systems change, old software libraries die, even 'The Zone' faded away in 2006 taking matchmaking with it. For the last 14 years I've heard the dramatic re-enactment of people's favorite stories from the game ""No kidding, there I was - just me and the wonder against 4 other guys."" often sadly followed by ""I miss that game, I wish I could still play it"". Not game stories after all, but human stories- about friends and family, victory and defeat - and learning about ancient cultures as a nice side benefit.

It deserved a second chance.

Because a few people were still keeping the dream alive, we ended up talking to the right person at Microsoft who also really wanted to make that happen. We first considered a minimum possible port.just get it running on modern hardware and operating systems - easy right? If it was a 3 or even a 5 year old game - recompile with new libraries boom, ship it. But 15 years in the Internet era is a *really long time*. In 1999 people had just upgraded from their 56K dial-up modem and traded in their 486 PC for a Pentium class machine with a 14"" CRT monitor. Google was still in Beta, YouTube and Netflix hadn't been invented yet.

The fundamental libraries that the game was built on no longer existed, we weren't even sure if all of the game assets were around anymore. So we got all the digital assets that could be found collected together and made our plans. Engineering was going to have to re-build the rendering engine substantially just to get the game to compile. Multi-player would have to be completely re-built, and some of the tricks we did in the code had strange side-effects with modern compiler settings. It would take significant work just to get us to the 1999 version of the game playing on today's computers.

It was Summer 2012 - Microsoft said 'let's go bigger - what would you do?' - we felt that we really needed to fully support larger resolutions and wide screen - both full screen and in-window play (which meant re-authoring all of the game interfaces; we also sweetened the colors and retouched them for modern monitors and graphics cards). We wanted to definitely keep things compatible with the fan levels and content that had been created over the years, and have easy multi-player matchmaking. We wanted to improve the graphics as much as possible while still preserving the crisp unit contrast and 'feel' of the game.

There was a much longer wish list but it was pared down by the realities of the schedule and the game assets that could still be found (we had to extract language files from shipping disks and rebuild it to get all of the localized text, and sadly the original 3D units that we made sprites from had also been lost to time).

I'm so proud of what we've created together with Microsoft - it *is* in every way Age of Kings and The Conquerors. It wasn't re-interpreted, it wasn't re-imagined differently - it is the gameplay that you remember and love, but with new features (like achievements, Steam Workshop and multi-monitor support) added to the experience.

We had a great team here at HPE working on the game - a really incredible effort, and fantastic support and encouragement from the group at Microsoft and our testing partners - but I most want to thank the die-hard fans, that bedrock of the Age of Empires community - my most heart-felt thanks to all of you for keeping the dream alive. Because of you we will all have the opportunities to make new stories and friends with AOE II: HD.

I would consider myself an intermediate, I understand the game fairly well but don't have those little essential things down to push my game to the next level. I thought I would try and play in beginners on voobly but I keep getting owned time and time again.
I've been watching tutorials on youtube and reading all about them on the AoE wikia, but I still don't seem to have the essentials for resource management, and building units efficiently.

Do you have any tips to help a player like myself? I've been watching re-plays of my matches and I always seem to be behind the other guy(s) I am playing against by a couple of minutes when getting to Feudal and Castle, etc.

Our idea was to have a mod that allows each civ a total number of units for the whole game. So if that limit was 500, after your 500th unit dies, you lose the game.

This is to address the frequently used tactic of spamming units for any given task. 

I want to discuss the pros and cons of this.

The pros:
This tactic still calls for a lot of strategy and provides a reasonable proxy of attrition warfare. It targets economy and pure tenacity as requisites for victory. Keep pouring enough army into a town and choke their Econ, and eventually you will win. Doing this requires a high degree of skill and swiftness, as well as tactical skill. However,

The cons: 
I feel it allows for sloppy gameplay, abuse of 2 or 3 civs that excel at unit production, and completely steamrolls over very real elements of actual imperial domination. Sieging barely exists... Why siege if you can just flood their defense with enough units? Why use diplomacy if you have truly infinite resources (both economical and unit-wise)?  

This got us to thinking.  In real life, a nation may actually possess near limitless economical capital. However, they don't possess infinite human capital. You lose too many humans, you lose the war. In aoe, so long as you have stockpiles of Econ, you can come back from one villager.

What if, instead of a traditional pop cap, there was a mod that had a total pop cap. Meaning, you are only allowed to create 500 (or some other arbitrary number) units for the entire duration of the game. 

You would play slower, more conservatively, like nations are forced to in reality. Every unit costs you dearly. Perhaps certain civs get more total pop as a team bonus. for instance china might have a much larger one than, say, the franks.

Sounds like an easy mod and could create a fascinating dynamic. I can see sieges being more effective... Is it really worth losing 80 troops tearing down a wall and castle if I could just starve them out instead?

It would eliminate huskarl rushes entirely. It'd cause you to be more thoughtful with Econ instead of just spamming villagers because every vil is one less military unit.

What do you think reddit?

Tldr: A total game pop limit. Meaning you can have only X population for the whole game.

Try opening the Launcher.exe directly from the AoE folder in steamapps(right click the game in Steam, Properties &gt; Local files &gt; Browse Local Files).

2.  If it says you're missing mfc110.dll that means you need to update your Visual C++ runtime. There should be a copy of the installation files within the folder under _CommonRedist.

3. If reinstalling Visual Studio 2012 (what you need!) wont work because of an access restriction(see the error code) , search the folder C:\ProgramData\Package Cache &gt; right click&gt;properties&gt;security&gt;select Administrators or you Windows user and click modify here give Full Access to the folder.

4. Now execute the vcredist_x86.exe and vcredist_x64.exe found in c:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Age2HD_CommonRedist\vcredist\2012 

5. Relaunch to test if it works

**If the VC redistributable installation fails:**

1. Open command prompt and run the following commands

   Re-initializing the windows installer engine:

    `Msiexec /unregister`
   
    `Msiexec /regserver`

 Do these if you have a 64-bit copy of Windows:

    `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\msiexec.exe \unregister`

    `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\msiexec.exe \regserver`

2. Check the permissions on the following folders:
`C:\Windows\winsxs  `  
`C:\Windows\winsxs\InstallTemp`  
“SYSTEM” should have full permissions and
“TrustedInstaller” should have full permissions.  

**NOTE:**  
Please make sure you are running the latest service pack of your edition of windows. It took me hours of troubleshooting to realize it wouldn't work for me because I had SP1 instead of SP2

**Here are the required operating systems for VC++ Redistributable:.**  

- Windows 7 SP1 (x86 and x64)  

- Windows 8 (x86 and x64)

- Multiple Montior Support (play AOE on two montiors) http://i.imgur.com/Ylb2aeE.png
- New anticheat patch. It has been totally re-built and now unlocks widescreen for non-premium and enables AoFE to have rated games.
- Rated AOFE! Cysion and Voobly developers worked together for the past few months to get this accomplished. Thanks guys!
- Widescreen for everyone on both rated and unrated games.
- NAT 2.0 http://i.imgur.com/K7rLTuN.png
- Live Streaming linked to the lobby (released a few months ago)

The Voobly developers have been working for months on a lot of these new features. I've been playing AOE since 1998 and I can honestly say in terms of new features this is the best year since then.

-----------------------------------------

Edit:  As many of you know, I volunteer at Voobly as a CS lobby moderator.  I also speak with the developers pretty frequently.  Some of the posters below seem to think all these features were developed in the last few days.  Anyone who works in product development knows this is not how it works.  Layer on not having the an unlocked source code and it get much more challenging.

- The new anticheat has been in development for the last 3 1/2 months coinciding with the AOFE release.
- Multi Monitor support and widescreen both were added with the incorporation of AOFE....3 1/2 months.
- Widescreen previously had a backdoor hack vulnerability with the old anti cheat.  The new anticheat fixes this....3/12 months.
- NAT 2.0 was released February 2, 2013 and took many months of work from the developers.
- Live Streaming linking to account and lobby were added January 5, 2013

The general consensus seems to be Noobs who use Gameranger, playing Conquerors, and the best time to do it would be on the weekends. Since there's a couple people on Voobly, some who prefer Age of Kings, different skill levels, et cetera, we can make different rooms for different preferences.

**I'll be doing a trial run at 5:00 p.m. EST (2 pm PST, 9 pm GMT) today on Gameranger, for the sake of just doing a quick match it'll just be Conquerors for Noobs. I figured the time would be most convenient for the British but if the majority here are Americans who can't play until later, the time will change.**

**TL;DR**:Let's have a real game night.

I saw [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/157jal/we_havent_have_an_raoe2_game_in_quite_a_while/) and it seemed to have a lot of support but not a lot of organization, it was more of a loose suggestion.

I was thinking we should set up a legitimate game night, between as many people as possible from this sub, probably in separate rooms on Gameranger or Voobly (Gameranger seems to be the more popular choice, my name is Ace) based on skill level, 1 or 2 noob rooms, a medium skill room, and a high-skill room.

The date and time will need to be determined depending on what's most convenient for everybody, but weekend evenings I assume are best for most people. If anybody has a preference for Age of Kings or Conquerors that can be addressed.

If enough people show interest we can work out the finer details later.

***/edit*** 

Since there was a lot of interest in a tournament yesterday, I figured I would get the ball rolling for setting one up. I can set up a tournament on challonge.com, but I need see what format you guys would like to see. I posted these two format tests yesterday in the previous thread:

[Double elimination](http://challonge.com/RedditAOETest)

[Swiss style](http://challonge.com/AOE2SwissTest)

Let me know which one you would prefer, or if there are any other ideas. I think the swiss format would work well, because it accounts for multiple skill levels, and everyone gets to play every round (no elimination). 

In the meantime, we can start gathering a list of participants. If you are interested in playing, send me a PM with which versions of the game you have. I think we can throw something together fairly easily here. We can establish the pairings and have the players determine their own game time (with a deadline per round). 

I know there are a lot of details to work out, but let me know if you think this is a good start.

Britons have for long been my favorite civilization because of their archers, but recently I've started playing Mayans for the same reason. My go-to build orders with Britons were either an archer spam flush/base-raid, or fast-castle crossbowmen. The former used to work well in most cases. However, now with Mayans I'm having difficulty archer flushing.

With the Britons I had two main build orders: 

* 20pop feudal archer spam flush - 8 archers in the enemy base @16:15 with Fletching

This BO was incredibly badass. 8 archers @16:15 **with a 600 gold buffer** ready. With this BO I built a second archery range @17:00-17:30 and pumped out archers from both and didn't even halt my villager production at all, albeit my castle time was 25:00+.

* 28pop fast castle/crossbowmen - 8 crossbowmen in the enemy base @18:50 with Fletching, Bodkin arrow (with polishing I could probably get this down to 18:00-18:10)

This was the more high risk high reward BO. If my base was left untouched, this BO boomed waaay better, and Briton crossbowmen have a +3 range, +2 attack up on archers.

Now, with Mayans, I have no idea how to play them effectively. The fastest 8-archer flush I've gotten is @18:30 in enemy base, although I could get castle age by 21:00-22:00 with this flush. I don't see the point of a fast castle age either... I mean I can't get Plumed archers out fast enough, I lack Knights, and the Mayan crossbowmen are mediocre. A fast-imp is out of the question for the setting that I always play, which is tiny Arabia 1v1.

To Mayan players out there, how do you effectively flush?",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,False,,Blank,True,t3_1j7st2,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1j7st2/archer_flush_britons_vs_mayans_optimal_initial/,

So the match I had yesterday was a 2v2 on random land map although it came out much like Arabia. My ally was Huns (I think). My all was against Aztecs (red) and I was against some other guy that didn't use his UU (blue). I'm trying out a new strategy with Mongols, its a 29 village dark age with wheelbarrow in Feudal followed by castle. This leaves me set up for a sustained castle age battle while booming at the same time

My start-up went well, and it was quick. I used 2 mills (1 on deer) as I am Mongols and I was swimming in food. Blue gets to castle age slightly before me, but I build 6 cavalry archers and go. He tries to make a tower near my cavalry archers, I kill 2 villagers and move on before its built. Get quite a few villager kills but then get overrun by I think a couple of knights and a bunch of spearmen. I run off to Aztec instead and get a couple of kills there too but they all get killed. At home I'm booming hard. 3 TCs never idle.

Bit of a lull while I'm building up and I think by this stage my ally is getting pounded. He's all beacons and saying ""eagle warriors"" in chat. I say ""are you ok?"" and he says ""no"". Give a hell. I get attacked by my guy. 4 villagers, and a couple of skirmishers and spearmen. Maybe some knights but if there were he used them too aggressively and I killed them. I know I had some camels lying about. I upgrade to 2-hand swordsman and kill his newly built tower and his men. I build 4 barracks and about this time my ally quits. Aztec waits too long destroying my ally's buildings and when he comes at me with his 20 EW's (eagle warriors) I have 30 champions. 11. I push hard after wiping him and destroy all the buildings and units he's put in my allies base. At the same time another 25 champs go to his base and kill 3 TCs and lots of villagers. I'm expecting my guy to come hard but I check the scores and he's a noob. A noob with a fast castle time so that's lucky.

Aztecs is still making eagle warriors (possibly to counter my mangudai which I'm raiding his villagers with but he's also getting squads of jaguar warriors which are taking on my champs well and he has loads of castles in his base. He's also fully rebuilt his main base and villagers.  We have lots of battles all across the map with my champs and mangudais usually coming out on top. But when I push to his base I get mullered by TCs and castles. My guy comes hard (not). he builds 3 towers in range of my archery range and some knights or crap. I destroy the towers with trebs and then send 40 champs to his base. They made short work of his 2-handed swordsmen. 11. I destroy everything I can see and he's proper boned now, or so I thought...

The battles with the Aztecs are still raging but I expand into my allies space with more TCs, gold mines and barracks. I build up bigger armies with more mangudai and in particular more trebs to take his base out. He wipes the first group but took massive losses and I know I have him on the ropes. In the mean time my guy has built like 4 siege rams and taken out loads of my town. What a dick. I go for him in a big way. Floods of champs and mangudai rip through his land. He now ACTUALLY has nothing left! When I show up to Aztecs with 60 champs, 20 mangudais and 5 trebs he says gg.

Unfortunately, the person you're up against doesn't appear on the stats yet. It'd be a mistake to simply assume that this means they're not very good, and since you're dying for a game you ready-up and go regardless.


It turns out in game that your suspicions were essentially right, and you're in a game up against a complete beginner, or so the scores would indicate. You curse your bad luck and set the wheels in motion to bring the game to a speedy conclusion.


--But wait. 


The AoE:HD community is really friendly, I've yet to find someone who behaves badly, so why not have a chat with your opponent and see if you can help them improve their game?

AoE:HD has gotten off to a really good start, and in order to maintain the nice atmosphere and the bounty of players, we each need to do our bit.
You needn't let the game drag on for ages while you play 'the sensei', just enough to impart some useful information to the new player so they don't feel like they just wasted 30 minutes of their life.

The more vaguely competent players out there the better, and truly balanced 4v4s will start to exist, where there's no 'weak-link' on either team.

End explorer.exe. You can do this with the taskmanager, but that makes starting AoE harder.

Try making a batch file in Notepad:

    ping 127.0.0.1
    ping 127.0.0.1
    taskkill /f /im explorer.exe

The ping is just a timer, and the taskkill does just that, kills the task explorer.exe.

1375385657.0,19,self.aoe2,1jijeq,[BO] Mayans Fast Castle for pockets - 17:30 Castle,Philanthrapist,21,2,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1jijeq/bo_mayans_fast_castle_for_pockets_1730_castle/,"**Edit: This is NOT a 17:30 castle *age* - it's a 17:30 finished castle (the building).**

Hello!

I'd like to share one of my build orders for Mayans for pocket-positions. Since Plumed Archers are so cheap and fast they make for excellent hit-n-run economy raiding units, so the aim of this build order is to get a castle up as early as possible while still maintaining a decent economy therefrom.

What you will need: 8 sheep, 2 boar, 3 deer

What you will get: A castle and one extra town center @ 17:30 with enough resources to start producing Plumed Archers without any idle time.

Here it goes:

~~------------------------------------------------------------------~~

**Dark Age**:

* Hit Loom
* Build two houses with your 4 idle villagers. 2/2 or 3/1 depending on their starting positions, but 3/1 is preferred
* Once Loom is finished start producing villagers immediately. Put the first 2 produced villagers, along with the 4 starting villagers (for a total of 6) on sheep
* Put the next 4 on wood, let the first one create a lumbercamp
* The next villager goes to build a Mill next to deer
* The next villager goes to build a house and lure boar, after which he creates a farm
* The 6 shepherds -without the lurer- start boar collecting. Don't forget to send one of these 6 to lure the next boar once this one is low enough. Once both boars are finished let them go back to doing sheep
* Let the next 2 villagers join the villager who built a Mill next to deer, and put all 3 on deer
* The next villager creates a farm
* The next villager goes wood-chopping
* The next villager builds a house and creates a farm
* The next villager goes wood-chopping
* The next villager creates a farm
* The next 2 villagers create a mining camp next to gold and mine gold
* The next 3 villagers create a mining camp next to stone and mine stone. Don't forget to build a house with one of these three before you hit Feudal age
* Click Feudal upgrade (25 pop)

So far you have: 6 shepherds/boar hunters, 4 farms, 6 woodcutters, 2 gold-miners, 3 stone-miners

**Feudal age**:

* Start producing 2 villagers, both will go to mine stone
* Your 3 deer hunters should be finished with the three deer for some time already, make sure you've moved them to where you want. Build a blacksmith with one of them, and a market with the other two. After building those, all 3 go to mine stone
* Click Castle upgrade (27 pop)
* Once your 6 shepherds are done with the sheep it's up to you what you do with them. Observe, if your 8 stone miners aren't enough to get the 750 stone by the time you're Castle age, send some of the shepherds there. If rather want more gold/wood/food, feel free to split them however you please. If you want a forward castle, you can send a few of them forward. I would recommend putting at least two of them on gold.
* Regulate your stone miners; send them to other resources if you know you'll have the 750 stone by Castle age

**Castle age**:

* Build a Castle (with multiple villagers, preferably) and a TC

~~------------------------------------------------------------------~~

This BO is not one I use particularly often, because I only play 1v1s, but it's perfectly doable in a pocket position since it isn't dependent on anything difficult to pull off, such as stealing enemy boars. It is not fully polished either - I would guess it could be done with a 24 pop Feudal to give an earlier Castle time, but I just haven't tried it yet.

There is no other way. Sorry. I don't think a human player is capable of surviving against 7 AI on hardest through any honest tactics. 

Notes on the match:

* 7 AI (The Horde I believe, all Random civs) vs Me as Spanish
* 200 Pop limit
* Regicide (I wanted a quick end either way)
* Post-Imp
* Coastal map
* 'Aegis' turned on from the beginning. Wanted to see the worst case scenario
* AI rushed me within 30 seconds. I barely had 30 or so cars out to hold off the first onslaught. 
* Spammed cars, then had 70 odd defend my TC and Castle. Villagers and King garrisoned inside castle.  No other buildings or units. 
* Decided not to make more than 100 cars, and not to replenish stock. So if AI manages to overwhelm my cars, I'm done. Time was also against me, so it was in my interest to finish the game quickly.
* Took 30 cars and went on a roving trip from civ to civ, destroying the castle and killing the king. The AI the whole time had been multiplying and scouring resources like there is no tomorrow.
* Every single civ was more difficult to defeat than the last. First batch of 30 cars were completely demolished by the 3^rd civ's king's death. Had to retake 30 more from my stock of 70 for the next mission. 
* That lasted for 2 more civs. Final bunch of 30 with only 10 defending my home base took care of the last two. 
* Total match time - 27 minutes. I was sure if the match had gone on 5 more minutes longer I would have been toast.
* Total units killed ~ 1800, buildings razed ~ 85, buildings lost ~ 0, units lost ~ 72

It was a lot of fun and a good way to test out the 60 FPS. I know this was not a serious game, but I just wanted to have a GTA - AOE2 mashup and see how it goes. The AI is really really impressive. 

Also, the sweet sweet carnage. Skeletons everywhere. It was good.

I have played a fair share of this game in my time and with the release of the HD-version, I think it was about time I started playing again. I've read some posts on here and watched quite a bunch of AoE2 recorded games, narrated by BBQTurkman and ZeroEmpires. I realized how little I know and how much I probably sucked. I just used to play a random map on hardest and that'd be a nice challenge for me (to give an impression of the level I was on).
Needless to say, I'd probably get my ass whooped if I started playing online, but that's ok. I plan on learning.

- What is the more popular(/better) game client: Voobly or Gameranger? And what is the future of both with the release of AoE-HD soon (this might be hard to tell). I plan on playing a lot of games with people that are on the same level as I am and the most crowded platform will probably offer the most noobs. 
- Is it normal for a multiplayer game to play with a civ of your choice or is it normal to get a random civ? What about games with teams, can you choose the civs in your team so they nicely complement eachother or is that not done?
- If it is 'allowed' to choose your own civ, it's probably good to learn one civ through-and-through: what would be a good civ for that. Something that's not too hard to play and is versatile. I don't even really care if it's a storng civ, I think keeping everything simple would be key for me at this stage. I really need to get back in the zone. 
- What speed should I be playing at? I always used to play on 'fast', but when checking online vids, that doesn't seem to be the case.
- I've found AoCzone and AoKheaven, any other sources of info I should be checking out?
- I've been reading up a little about the differences between each civ, but I haven't found a comprehensive list of which upgrades/researches can be made for what civ. Could anyone provide a link? I have the fold-out leaflet (does anyone remember this? So pretty. I've started for HOURS at this thing) at my parents house, but I can't access it right now.
- What's the deal with Forgotten Empires? It's great the community made it of course, but how does it work? Is it yet another expansion and can you play it online too? And if so, is it popular? Are there any other expansions worth playing?

I'll start:

Chinese Scorpions are best in game IMO thanks to their Unique Tech, Rocketry, which increases their pierce damage by 4 (25%). That's HUGE since scorpions are anti-personal siege while not hurting your own units. Get some halbs in front of massed scorpions and you have a pre-industrial artillery squad. Plus, all techs are cheaper to research for Chinese, so you can get to that point even faster. Unfortunately, Chinese lack Siege Engineers so they miss out on the +1 range which is very important for Scorpions.

Celts would be a close match, with 20% faster firing 20% faster creation 40% more health 20% faster wood and access to Siege Engineers, but I personally find Celts to more likely use Onagers than scorpions. Plus, Celts can't ALWAYS have better siege :( Admittedly, they most likely do, but the damage output of Chinese Scorpions is just an amazing feeling &gt;:)",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1371359293.0,,,True,t3_1geb34,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1geb34/best_normal_units_cast_your_opinions_on_which/,

**Civilizations**: The rules for picking Civs have been simplified starting with Round 3. Each player will pick their own civilizations, with no limitations.

**Reporting results** : One of the players must send a screenshot of the end game screen showing the victory to me by email (jakedgaoe@gmail.com). You can also PM me an imgur link. Please list who played in the game, and who won, using Reddit usernames. 

**Participation**: If you and your opponent are unable to complete your game, you will be given a tie, which is 0 pts for both players. If you do not play your game or respond to me or your opponents messages, you will forfeit and be removed from the tournament! **Important note: If you are unable to get your game scheduled for any reason, you must let me know before the deadline, or you will risk being removed!**

***Tournament  Format***

[Swiss style tournament](http://challonge.blogspot.com/2013/01/swiss-tournaments.html)

**Number of rounds: 8**. This means you will have 8 guaranteed games.

&gt;Tie (only used when results are not reported and holding up the tournament): 0pts

   
After all rounds are played, the winner will be determined by points. If there is a tie for points at the end of the tournament, a playoff will be formed. This will either be one 1v1 game, or round robin as needed. 
***

***Frequently Asked Questions***

**Why am I not listed in the Round 4 matchups?**

Check the bottom of the bracket page. If you are still listed in the standings, you have a bye for this round. If you are not listed, you have been kicked out of the tournament. We have kicked out several people this round who have not been participating. This was not personal or anything, we just need a minimum level of participation for the tournament to function. If you have been kicked out and would like back in, let me know I will put you on the standby list. 


**My opponent will not answer my messages. What do I do?**

Let me know that you have tried to contact your opponent, so I know you are at least trying. I will try to contact them, and then we will just have to wait and see. You will remain in the tournament as long as you are in contact with me.

**Can I still join the tournament?**

Yes! If you have the HD version and would like to join the tournament, let me know and I will add you to the standby list. 

**Why are the rounds so long?**

They are long because it just takes a while for casual players to play their games. If we get all the games in early, we can move on before the deadline!

2) Why do people always build like 5 barracks and stables, etc.?  Does it increase the training speed at EACH barracks, or is the advantage simply being able to train more units at once?

3) Similarly, why do people build &gt;1 town center and what is a good number?

I seriously doubt I am the first to discover this. However a few google searches yielded no results.

For the first time, I noticed that Persian TCs had +100% HP. At first I felt like a complete noob for missing this, but then it got me thinking about how I could use this to my advantage in the early game, combined with the helpful +50 food and wood. I experienced a bit and came up with the following:

Start by building two houses with your starting vils and put all subsequent vils on sheep or boars. Do not build a mill or a lumber camp. The goal here is to pump out 14 vils as fast as possible. You can try this strat with more but I think it's too slow, not to mention the wood wasted on additional houses. As soon as your 14 are queued, switch everybody to wood and send your scout to find the enemy base. Once you have 275 wood, send your entire team towards the enemy. While they are walking, research loom at the TC then delete it.

Rebuild the TC to the south of the enemy's TC and within firing range. Since vils exit the TC to the south by default, it will be easier for you to shoot them down, and your own villagers will be safer. If enemy vils try to stop your cunning plan, micro your squad so that some of them ward off the attackers while the others continue building. Once the TC is up, ring the bell, pick off anything that moves, then start pelting the enemy TC with arrows. Since your TC has double HP, this is a duel you are bound to win.

With the TC destroyed, empty yours and fan out your vils in groups of 2-3 to track down the remaining enemies. In some cases your opponent will be able to rebuild elsewhere, but this will only delay your victory for a few more minutes.

This strat is obviously very risky to use against a human, however if done correctly, you are guaranteed to defeat a 1v1 Hardest AI in any land map except Arena.

In fact, I won a €100 bet with this: I told my brother that I would be able to beat a Hardest under normal skirmish conditions, under 20 minutes, in the Dark Age, and without building a single military unit.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,False,,,True,t3_15o4qh,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/15o4qh/funny_persian_drush_strat/,

- When using Turks, how do you know whether to train hand cannoneers or jannisaries? Is one better than the other at something? Is the jannisary better all around? Do you mix them up or just do one of them? Why?

I am well aware that they do bonus damage to infantry and archers, but paladins do plenty of damage against these units anyways. The only benefit I can see would be against spearmen, but even then, why would you be running cavalry against them? Use cavalry archers or hand-cannoneers or champions etc. 

And while I'm at it: the Byzantines are a jack of all trades civilization, but master or none. If any of you are very fond of playing as them, why is this? I would love to find a better excuse to use them, but I always come up with a better civ to play.

A mill costs 100 wood.

A farm costs 60 wood and gives 175 food (dark age). The equivalent cost of a mill is 1.67 farms so as long as you get 1.67x the amount of food then you're quids in (in terms of wood). 1.67 x 175 food = 292 food.

A deer provides 140 food. Call it 130 with rotting.

4 deer provide 4 x 130 food = 520 food.

Hunting is quicker than farming but villagers will have to walk to the deer - so probably about equal. An advantage is you can put 3 villagers per deer rather than 1 villager per farm. Good for the high food demands of feudal and castle upgrades.

My strategy has always been the boom-steamroller combo especial with a nation such as the Franks and Teutons,  whereby I rush to Castle Age, boom economy and fortify and then proceed to slowly expand my empire to in front of your doorstep. The key to this is stone and stone early. I like getting four groups of 3 villagers out at all the surrounding stone queries as soon as I can so I have a stockpile  ready for when I get to castle.   

The shortcomings of my tactic has always been the period between dark and castle age where I am very villager heavy and lacking most defensive upgrades. Normally I will have a single barks with 5-10 militia/swordsman standing around. This tactic I also find works bet on closed maps such as black forest or Yukon.

Now I'm no gaming expert, but I know that League of Legends is taking over the MMORPG genre, and in terms of RTS, SC2 is still king, but I find gameplay extremely boring to watch.

Meanwhile, AOE2 seems to be going through a new rebirth with two fantastic commentators providing the community with publicity, Steam releasing AOE2 next month, PVP becoming streamlined, all the old Civ players looking for another option, plus the simple fact that a lot of us 2000 gamers are becoming older, therefore better able to handle the complexity of the game, etc.

One thing I've been thinking about is that when AOE2 came out, it was during the height of starcraft/WC3 popularity.  Without the smooth platform of battle.net, AoE2 was never quite able to develop a huge pvp base.  

However, now that there are not as many RTS competitors (besides SC2), AoE2 *could* possibly come back as one of the biggest e-sports games.  The gameplay is extremely complex, races are relatively matched, and new strategies are still being discovered every day, due to the sheer scale of the game.

What do you guys think?

I thought I was a good player.  I can easily handle the computers.  I have read several guides on how to handle humans.

I do not waste time by having idle units.
I am constantly exploring with my scout(s).
I build some houses to get my villager count up.
My town center is not idle.
I know the hotkeys.

I list all that so I can ensure you that I am not wasting time and the simple tips on the internet aren't helping.

I played a 2v2 game recently (cheats were disabled) and I got to the feudal age the same time as my opponents.  We all had a score of around 700-1000.  The guy with 1000 score kept going up and up in score really fast.  He had 1500 by the time I had 900.  He was all over my villagers with Scout Cavalry.  He suffocated my base, I could do nothing.

My biggest question is how did his score get so much higher than mine before any combat took place?  Again, I was pumping out villagers and exploring and everything quickly, just like guides tell you.

Is it possible he cheated somehow?  I don't see how anyone could be THAT good.

I scouted my guy early and found his berries but no wood, so anyway I attacked with 5 militia and the EW and the first thing I found was a little forward at the front of his base; A lumber camp and a barracks. I was expecting counter militia but none came out. I killed 1 or 2 villagers on wood but damn are militia slow at killing things! He ran. Then I went to berries where there were literally 10... Got maybe 1 or 2 more kills and a few hits and he runs home. I find he's mining gold and stone (nothing intensive) and chopping nearby wood with the EW and I just harass him where I can. 
 
By now I probably have 28  villagers and I had enough on farms and deer to get the feudal upgrade. I take 2 deer villagers (they were forward anyway) to his base. The others back on wood. I feudal and get 2 ranges up, but then I realise I've got no damn gold. I get 3 from wood, 3 from berries and 2 more from TC onto gold. So first I get a few skirmishers and then archers after. He's feudal too and he gets a tower up near a new lumber camp on the far side of his base. The tower is protected by the TC (good placement). I erroneously got man @ arms upgrade and tried to kill the tower but the TC arrows killed them (hence finding out about the good placement). By now I do have about 8 skirms, 4 archers, and a couple of spears. Plus more archers all the time. He has ranges and stables and a few units but I have too many and he can't get a foothold. I've got a butt load of gold coz I left my TC rally point on gold but really short on everything else. I get a few more farms and eventually have the 800 food to castle. I'm getting mad kills with my archers/skirms. And the skirms can really take some TC punishment too. He's surely got nothing left...
 
I castle and build a siege workshop and a 2nd TC. He castles... WTF?! I could not believe my eyes. How did he have the food, or the gold? What did I miss? He gets out knights too, maybe 4 or 5. He kills everything I had. I make sure the ram is build garrisoned not outside and get pikeman upgrade. He doesn't see my forward villagers and instead comes for my base. I actually say ""gg"" at this point because I thought if he can get castle and knights his economy must be good. But I don't quit because CocaCola is still doing ok. He has knights too and is attacking his guy.
 
My first gold dries up with like 20 villagers on it. Forgot to change the rally point! So I get them to build a 3rd TC on a new gold. Garrisoning protects most my villagers but he gets a few kills. My forward villagers build 2 barracks and I get out pikeman. I manage to get 8-10 and 3-4 Eagle Warriors from the barracks in my base. He gets a few cav archers so I get skirmishers too (still have those 2 forward ranges). Earlier I managed to sneak out my ram while the knights were attacking the workshop and I hid that behind my Pikes and Skirms. I build another siege workshop and 1 more ram. Red quits from CocaCola's attack. Nice one! I attack with rams.
 
The knights and cav archers come but since the rams are the targets I can protect them with the pikes and he can't really run away. He says ""gg"" and ""you guys are really good"" and quits.
 
The map reveals and he DOESN'T have a 2nd hidden base or anything. How the hell did he castle and get knights? Red was shite, he didn't even have a barracks, just a market and a good economy... Have you twigged yet? Red was tributing resources and that's how they did it. He had nothing when the knights came. I thought my rush was unsuccessful at first but it turns out it completely ruined him! He had like 8 villagers by the end of feudal!

Plenty to learn from that. My economy went to shit and I had like 4k gold and 0 wood and food in castle age!!

Though many of them understand the basic concepts of the game, there is still much to learn. They are often very turned off by the prospect of being rushed. To solve this problem I came up with an idea based on a format of Magic: the Gathering called the ""King"" format. 

In any equally divided game of 4 or more players, at the 10 minute mark, the player with the highest score on the team is named the ""king"" of that team. The other players are supporters. The main rule of the game is that only the kings on either team can be attacked at their home territory. Supporters cannot be attacked at home, though any units or buildings not near their original town can be attacked.

We have played this format over and over again and few people want to go back to conventional random maps. It allows unexperienced players to hold their city, economy, and army un-harassed. It also shifts all military focus  to one front or the other which creates large battles and inspires teamwork in battles which is absolutely necessary. Sometime this results in a stalemate which means teams are required to out-think each other to win ground.

The format is played in conquest mode so that supporters can't build wonders and gather relics while they can't be attacked.

The format is insanely fun and eliminates the powerless position many new players experience.

If you have any questions or comments about my new format let me know. There is still a lot of gray area and situations that could result in new rules.

One con that I can think of is getting unlucky with random civilizations. In one game my team got dominated by Mongols, Persians, Teutons, and Saracens while we were playing as Vikings, Goths, Mayans, and Huns. We were absolutely outgunned in the late game, and the format discourages rushing by nature.

Excited to hear your thoughts /r/aoe2!

EDIT: I've seen some great ideas. I would encourage everyone to give it a shot if you know a lot of people who don't necessarily play competitively online but would be up for a casual game. Tell me the pros and cons you experienced as well as rules suggestions. Tonight or tomorrow night I'm going to try the format on an island map.

Are twice as many builders twice as fast at building a single building? Is there a diminishing-marginal-returns situation going on? If I have four villagers building four houses, should they each do one or build along as a clump?

2. Similarly: how much do multiple monks converting the same guy speed up the conversion process?

3. If I garrison an archer in a tower, does his arrow attack with the same strength he normally would, or with the strength of the tower he's in? If an archer out-ranges the tower he's garrisoned in, can he shoot further than the normal tower arrow? Or vice-versa does an archer's range in a tower upgrade to that of the tower? What's the limiting factor here? If I've got a handful of villagers in a castle, are there a few castle-strength-arrows and a few villager-strength-arrows being shot? What's the deal with all of that.

4. What actually was changed in the making of AoE2HD? Steam integration and yellow farms and new food symbol and what else? Both aesthetically and under-the-hood?

Steamrolling new players is no fun and some of the pros are just so good that you can't challenge them! Even the difference between a good and a poor intermediate can mean a short match with little challenge for the winning player! It's much more of a problem than other games like First Person Shooters I think...

What I'd like is to create a group of similar ""intermediate players"" so its easy to find matchups with people who are your same ability. Then you can get to know how good players are. The sort of level I mean is this. You can:

* Consistently get to castle age by 18-20 minutes (if you want).

* Rush or defend a rush in the Feudal age.

* Counter all unit types effectively.

* Attack effectively in early castle with knights or similar.

So firstly does anyone know of such a community? Not for pro's though! And if not is anyone keen on starting one up with me?

As for how to do it I think steam groups might work but open to suggestions.

Here is what I am thinking for game settings, again please give your input!

&gt;* Size: Tiny (2 player)
&gt;* Resources: Standard
&gt;* Population: 200

***Competition Format***

&gt;[Swiss style tournament](http://challonge.blogspot.com/2013/01/swiss-tournaments.html)
&gt;
&gt;Players are given their pairings and will determine their own game time, with a given deadline
&gt;
&gt;Win: 1 pt
&gt;
&gt;Bye (there will be a few): 1pt
&gt;
&gt;Loss: 0pts
&gt;
&gt;Tie (only used when results are not reported and holding up the tournament): 0pts


In terms of competition format, I was running some tests on the challonge website today. One thing I noticed is that with a Swiss system, unless you run a lot of rounds, a tie for 1st place is very possible. They have a tie-break system for this situation built in the website which is basically strength of schedule. So if two people are tied for first, they add up the scores of each of the two players' opponents, and whoever had the stronger schedule is named champion. 

I suggest this tie breaking method:
If after all rounds are played, and there is a tie for first place, a single game will be played to determine a winner. In the case of a three or more tied players, a round robin will be played. I think this is better than just naming a winner based on opponent strength. *Please let me know what you think.*

***Tournament Start Date and Length***

Let me know when you guys would like to get going. I think we should allow the rest of this weekend to get people signed up, and then get started. For this number of people playing, we will need a minimum of 5 rounds, but we can do more. *Again, I need input on how many rounds you would like to play.* I estimate a round taking about 3-4 days to complete. 

I know this is a lot of info, but the more input I can get here, the better the tournament will be. Thanks!

1365897811.0,14,self.aoe2,1caqlu,Streamlined Hotkeys,banthur,17,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1caqlu/streamlined_hotkeys/,"I have been working on an experimental set of easier to use hotkeys for AOE2. The basic idea is to make common tasks easier to perform.  

Here is a google doc showing the current iteration:  
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AlIy3ctG3WzbdDVWNUQyX29vcEZ6VERYZ0lKWHJiNEE&amp;output=html

The way this is laid out it is designed for heavy use of the ""Select Next ... "" keys and your hand will sit on the left half of the keyboard.  

Regular commands are on QWERT/ASDFG/ZXCVB
Select Next are on YU/HJ/NM  

[ QWERT ] [YU]  
[ ASDFG ] [HJ]  
[ ZXCVB ] [NM]  

This breaks the layout into two halves. Since multiple building select doesn't work too well in this game the layout is designed to optimize alternating hotkeys to spam unit production.  

For instance, Select Next Barracks is Y. Thus, the keys to build those units are WER, the place your hand will naturally lay if your index finger hits Y. This means to macro out a bunch of milita you can hit Y-W-Y-W-Y-W and this for most gamers should come out extremely quick.  

The same holds for the other 5 buildings in the Select Next .. block. Archery range is H and its units are on SDFG. And so on. It might take some adjusting to use this setup but it should streamline macro'ing out units quite a bit.

As far as the building hotkeys V and B are build military/economic respectively and the more frequently used buildings are clustered closer to those keys. Some buildings kind of got shafted here although this is due to military and economic buildings sharing the same hotkey set (!!). For instance barracks and lumber camp can't have the same hotkey despite the fact that it's impossible to hit the barracks hotkey from the build economic page. Ah well.  

I'd appreciate feedback anyone has on how to improve these.

What the stream will be covering then? I am planning on doing long tutorial explaining all that begginers need to know including; Scouting,  Dark age builds, Civilizations, micro and macro, 15 minute castle age, 10minute feudal rush and much much more!

If you join the stream later, i will have text running on the screen what i am teaching atm.

1365542897.0,14,self.aoe2,1c0mv8,"Posts about Persians, Teutons, Koreans...",Pr0xym4n,15,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1c0mv8/posts_about_persians_teutons_koreans/,"In the last few days we could see a couple of Posts about how to engage against ""OP"" units like Elephants,... (I am German, so sorry for don't recalling all exact names).

The main problem was the big number of enemies with a good amount of health and attack stacked at one place.

I thought I could share my tactics and experiences.

First my main point:
If an opponent can built 50 war elefants and without you being able to see it coming and make the preparations, I think you should focus this  as your main problem.

What to do:
- Scouting from beginning to the end. 
If you cannot get inside his base:
- Poke and focus his attention

Don't focus on making a biiiig army and then a final battle with all the units. This will most certanly not work against power units.

Ok but the question was, what to do if you are facing such a big army.

There are a couple of things you can do, but to be honest, it will be hard and dirty;)

- Know your enemie and his disadvantages
-- war elephants &lt;-&gt; monks, pike, arrows (not so good without mikro and the army must be just those slow ele.)
-- against the korean battlewagon also pike
...search the web or the original handbook (hrhr) there are lists with all units and their counters

- know that counter doesn't mean stronger!
A war couple elephant can pick apart a big amount of piks
Your advantage is the following: cheaper units =&gt; many units
Spam them, built a lot of production buildings
But don't send them in 1 by 1. Attack in groups.

- use your brain!
He uses slow units stacked together at one place?
Onagers will do damage. 
But think about their usage! Are there Paladins or scouts that can pick them apart?
Combine them with a regular attack!

- counter attack him! 
His focus needs to get away from his units!


Overall:
1) Try to prevent such events ;)
2) If he/she/it manages to put together such an army and can attack you, try to make a big amount of damage with lesser ressorces and hope he runs out of them 
3) Work on your knowledge about units, advantages and disadvantages
4) enjoy the game! 


Sorry for spelling mistakes. As I said, this isn't my motherlanguage.

I'd like to be able to finally test it out with some human players, and so I come to you, r/aoe2: fancy a go at it?

It's fairly heavily story-driven, and has what I hope are some interesting balance choices in its design. There are two teams, one of two players and one of six, but the terrain is designed to largely neutralise the issue of player numbers.

In any decent build order it seems like a waste to invest into it before you go castle age. But sooo many 2v2 and 3v3 games I have played allies quit early on because we aren't able to help each other soon enough if someone gets flushed for example. Not having allied vision kind of sucks because you feel very alone, and I know a lot of the time people quit just because they are getting beaten  in their own little 1v1 duel.

If they could share vision then I feel like people wouldn't give up so early since they can see if perhaps their allies are doing well, which gives hope for recovery. Basically what I am asking is do you think that Cartography is kind of a relic of a bygone age of gaming, and would team matches be improved by sharing vision right from the start.

Suggestions would be cool. Ideas that I have include:

Free cartography at feudal upgrade

Option in game setup for 'share allied vision'

Only one player needs to research cartography for all to benefit?

I do understand that in an ideal game players will communicate by chat and pinging the map etc, but this is not nearly the same. If a good player had shared vision he could see threats to his noobier allies earlier and help defend.

A slow start, a MASSIVE 5 on 1 battle and a fantastic end.",lifelesslies,19,7,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1eqaes/the_match_that_made_me_fall_in_love_with_aoe2/,"EDIT: meant 4 on 1 battle. my bad.

*Introduction:
So this game happened years back when microsoft still hosted online matches. It was the first online match i had played and it was the match that made me love AOE2. I am not the absolute best storyteller and there are parts that are hazy but i know a lot of it.

*Game setup Map - Nomad resources - high map size - giant players -8 (all vs all) my civ - Huns win type - conquest only my personal play style - Defender/Economy

**Game start - As this was my first play online I clicked on the first visible villager and immediately built a town center and started the game per usual. ( i was located in the North east corner of the map, map around me seemed very much like the highlands map) I then went and selected the rest of my units and had them start making their way towards my town center. the first odd thing I noticed is that even though My other villagers and scout were scattered across the map eventually they came all to one point to get to me. I thought this was odd but didn't think on it at the time too much. once I got my villagers I started creating farms and whatnot and raced towards feudal. At the same time I sent my scout out looking around. My scout kept running into cliffs (Him on top of the cliff). This was a pretty cliff-ey area apparently. So I had him go as far out as he could go to try to find other players, The scout once again made his way to the same point he came in at... this made me stop and check again... upon scouting even further I was to find out that a solid 1/6th ish of the map in my corner was completely closed off except for 1 path which was only about a gate wide. there were no other players in the closed off section.

**Me being a defense oriented player I immediately built a wall blocking off that single path entrance. I made my way to castle age without any player sightings... odd I thought... but maybe they were being defensive like me. I was sitting on about 150ish villagers at the time mostly farming and I would sell the food at the market for gold. I decided to ""up"" my defense, and sent out villagers and along the ENTIRE perimeter of my land (which sat on top of a cliff) I alternated between bombard towers and normal towers. In addition to this I built a military base on the pass out of my land, both inside and outside my land.

**Once this was done I was starting to get bored... I had no enemies, plenty of resources and wondering if any other players were even on. Thats when i figured out that you could chat in game (i believe? I may be mistaken) But I seen that people were talking or communicating in some way and that while i was sitting pretty and building all my defenses, the other players were all out arena brawling in the center of the map. honestly seemed to me like they all were just making troops and sending them to the center of the map to die. No one was teamed up. at this point in time I believe there were 5 players left including me. Meanwhile I was still building towers and walls and just tons of defense (very much like the ""great wall of china"" in the game)

**one of the remaining players must have been trying to be smart and go around the carnage in the center of the map, either that or they were going to scout my corner finally for resources. but for the first time a different color appeared in my map... I immediately went and looked and it was probably a group of 40-50 swords, calvery, and pikes. As soon as they came in range of my towers and bombard towers they were dead... they had no long range units and they weren't expecting there to be a wall of towers.

**This is where the game got pretty interesting for me at least. The guy who had his troops destroyed by me must have gotten a nice look at my city and how well fortified it was, because he somehow told the other players what he found and if any of them wanted to win ever they would have to team up and take me out.
So 10 or 15 minutes later all of the sudden comes 4 full armies into my view... ""o fucking fuckshit"" Immediately turned to my seige buildings (I had a lot of them) and started pumping out scorpions... within 2 minutes I had over 50-60 scorpions and put them right near the enterence of my military camp and the only way into my land. All the while I am still pumping out scorpions. The enemies armies are now ""at my doorstep"" and having a massive number of scorpions really helps cut down enemies lickety split. I also started making the bomb guys... ( i can't remember their name) and the push cannon-ers. I think the part that ""saved me"" was that these 4 armies and 4 players were still tech. enemies. Once my troops started cutting theirs apart and they lost control over the entire group of soldiers their own troops started fighting among each other.

**In the course of 10 ish minutes their armies were either killed by my towers or troops as well as fighting each other in a massive ""moshpit"" of death. This was very exciting for me personally because when I seen their armies I thought i was done. Instead now I was sitting with a full army and tons of extra resources from never fighting before this point and they were sitting on limited resources and no armies... I had and armyyy they had defenseless lands... of course I selected all my military buildings and started mass producing soldiers. Taking the army I had from the last fight I swung it like a fist right into the first city I came to. These guys had zero time to start rebuilding their army so they were finished in probably under a minute.

**I like to think of the visual of my troops leaving my city like a swarm, they came from all over the city and funneled through this tight space to spread out across the map.
the second city I came to was probably just as easy as the first outside of the fact they had some troops. essentially just picture tons of bomber units all over the screen just blowing up absolutely everything they could get to.

**the last two players were smarter and started banding together as well as sent a few villagers to run to corners of the map to try to rebuild. at this point I was starting to run lower on troops cause I used mostly bomber units to take out city 2. so my attack came a little later and I met a strategy much like my own. That is that they used a lot of long range units to try to cut me down. This worked for a little but ultimately failed. I destroyed their cities and every villager I could find... But both of them were still in the game... weird...
So I decided to rebuild my army and scout. I found them... They had holed up in a small walled area that they had just made town center for each as well as a castle and a few houses. each of them had about 15 units left. I rebuilt my army really quickly with trebuchets (sp) and calvery archers and so on and all as a group approached the hold.

**Upon making it to the hold one of the two remaining players ragequit. just boom resigned the game. now there was one guy left... with his 15 men and 1 castel and small little hold against most of my population limit in military units. Instead of smashing him.. I built a wall and towers around his hold so that if any of his units set one foot outside of the space he had they would get shot. at the time I thought this was hilarious, after 15 or so minutes he must have decided to try a last ditch effort and sent out all of his units (now about 40) and by the time they made it to my army only halfish were left, since the others were killed by my towers... The battle and game ended quickly...

**I do admire this dude though... He knew he was beat and he knew he was screwed but he fought right up until the end of the game unlike the guy that ragequit.
That is the match that made me love this game, It had everything. my great defensive and empire building, a massive battle that I thought to have lost but miraculously won due to enemy mistakes as well as just sheer numbers on my part (meaning I replaced units as fast as they died). And finally it had a great ending, with a small force of the other players men facing down a giant at their doorstep.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1369098260.0,,,True,t3_1eqaes,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1eqaes/the_match_that_made_me_fall_in_love_with_aoe2/,

The next game I played the host didn't ready up until the last second.  He made a secret switch to cheats on.  I had a good start but about 10 mins into the game he came at me with 20 cobras and destroyed my base.  It kind of sucked to take two quick losses to bs like that.

http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1ddlhh/reddit_tournament_round_2_kickoff/

***

We have created a steam group:
http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditaoe2tournament


***

The tournament is officially underway! Round 1 matchups are set and are ready to be played.   

  
The official link for the tournament is:

http://challonge.com/RedditAOE2Tournament
***
***What you need to do***    
&gt;1. Send me a PM with your email address, so you can get alerts. 
&gt;2. Visit the tournament link and determine your matchup. All names are reddit usernames.       
&gt;3. Contact your opponent and play round 1 according to the rules and settings described below.   
&gt;4. Report the results as described below, before the deadline of  **Monday, April 22, 11:59pm EDT** 

***

***Game Details***

Here are the settings that will need to be played each round.
&gt;* Version: AoE2 HD
&gt;* Random Land Map 1v1
&gt;* Size: Tiny (2 player)
&gt;* Resources: Standard
&gt;* Population: 200
&gt;* Reveal map: Normal
&gt;* Game Speed: Normal
&gt;* Starting Age: Standard
&gt;* Victory: Standard
&gt;* **Record Game: ON**

***

***Rules***

**Settings**: The settings listed above are intended as a default. If the two players would like to play with different settings, that is allowed as long as both players agree. 

**Civilizations**: The choice of how to pick civilizations will be up to the individual players, so you can choose to pick your own civs, do randoms civs, or use the same civ. If an agreement cannot be reached on how to set the civilizations, there will be a default civilization for each round that each player must play. This does not mean you can force the other player to use the default if you don't like their civ. If you agree to pick civs, you must stick to that. The default civilization for Round 1 is **Huns**. 

**Reporting results (recently updated)** : One of the players must send a screenshot of the end game screen showing the victory to me by email (jakedgaoe@gmail.com). This will be loosely enforced for the first round as everyone gets in the flow of things. I think this is the easiest way to verify the game result. 

***

***Tournament  Format***

[Swiss style tournament](http://challonge.blogspot.com/2013/01/swiss-tournaments.html)

**Number of rounds: 8**. This means you will have 8 guaranteed games.

Players are given their pairings and will determine their own game time, with a given deadline. **There will be a one bye per round, so don't freak out if you don't see a matchup for you.**

Points:

&gt;Win: 1pt
&gt;
&gt;Bye : 1pt
&gt;
&gt;Loss: 0pts
&gt;
&gt;Tie (only used when results are not reported and holding up the tournament): 0pts

   
After all rounds are played, the winner will be determined by points. If there is a tie for points at the end of the tournament, a playoff will be formed. This will either be one 1v1 game, or round robin as needed. 
***
That's about it, good luck and let me know if you have any questions.

We're using ""xOmicron's user patch 1.1"" which allows you to set the population limit up to 1,000. We originally thought this would be awesome and were excited about massive battles with large groups of troops. However, while having several hundred villagers doing their own thing is fine, it's really difficult to take full advantage of the larger pop limit when attacking as the groups you can make (highlight troops, press ctrl+1/2/3 etc.) are limited at 30/40 (I can’t remember which) units like they always have been.

Is there a way to allow you to group larger numbers of units to allow for the fact that you can now have much larger armies?

**EDIT :** I spoke to xOmicron yesterday and asked him about the possibility of increasing the population limit. He said ""The group size is currently 40 units. Increasing this would require a lot of time and work. Maybe someday lol."" I guess for now we'll just have to cope as best we can with groups of 40.",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1340973177.0,,,True,t3_vmgj6,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/vmgj6/increasing_group_size_to_use_larger_population/,

I sucked back then of course but now I came up with some idea to work with without watching any game play or anything like that. Long story short I play Britons because I find it easy to micro the Longbow men but just wondering if its bad to not spend all of my resources. Coming from a Starcraft 2 background I was always told to spend all minerals. In AoE2 I notice that my resources are random from 800 food and 200 gold and stone with around 150 wood in the beginning to around 1000 each when I'm done with my army and are mid battle.

***Rules***

**Settings**: The settings listed above are intended as a default. If the two players would like to play with different settings, that is allowed as long as both players agree.

**Reporting results** : One of the players must send a screenshot of the end game screen showing the victory to me by email (jakedgaoe@gmail.com). Please list who played in the game, and who won, using Reddit usernames. 

**Participation**: If you and your opponent are unable to complete your game, you will be given a tie, which is 0 pts for both players. If you do not play your game or respond to me or your opponents messages, you will forfeit and be removed from the tournament!

***

***Tournament  Format***

[Swiss style tournament](http://challonge.blogspot.com/2013/01/swiss-tournaments.html)

**Number of rounds: 8**. This means you will have 8 guaranteed games.

Players are given their pairings and will determine their own game time, with a given deadline. **There will be a one bye per round, so don't freak out if you don't see a matchup for you.**

Points:

&gt;Win: 1pt
&gt;
&gt;Bye : 1pt
&gt;
&gt;Loss: 0pts
&gt;
&gt;Tie (only used when results are not reported and holding up the tournament): 0pts

   
After all rounds are played, the winner will be determined by points. If there is a tie for points at the end of the tournament, a playoff will be formed. This will either be one 1v1 game, or round robin as needed. 
***

***Frequently Asked Questions***

**Why am I not listed in the Round 3 matchups?**

Check the bottom of the bracket page. If you are still listed in the standings, you have a bye for this round. If you are not listed, you have been kicked out of the tournament. We have kicked out several people this round who have not been participating. This was not personal or anything, we just need a minimum level of participation for the tournament to function. If you have been kicked out and would like back in, let me know I will put you on the standby list. 


**My opponent will not answer my messages. What do I do?**

Let me know that you have tried to contact your opponent, so I know you are at least trying. I will try to contact them, and then we will just have to wait and see. You will remain in the tournament as long as you are in contact with me.

**Can I still join the tournament?**

Yes! If you have the HD version and would like to join the tournament, let me know and I will add you to the standby list. 

**Why are the rounds so long?**

They are long because it just takes a while for casual players to play their games. If we get all the games in early, we can move on before the deadline!

What I'm hoping to achieve is a slight HP and attack boost for the aura, plus a conversion effect (like a Monk) for the spell.

Right now, for the aura, I have this trigger:

&gt;Condition0: bring object to object (hero to unit)

&gt;Effect0: change object attack (+2 to unit)

&gt;Effect1: change object HP (+10 to unit)

&gt;Effect 2: activate trigger (next trigger)

The next trigger begins deactivated:

&gt;Condition0: Timer 10

&gt;Effect0: change object attack (-2 to unit)

&gt;Effect1: change object HP (-10 to unit)

&gt;Effect2: activate trigger (previous trigger)

Basically, if the unit meets the hero, trigger1 gives the unit a bonus to attack and HP, then activates trigger2.  Trigger 2 waits 10 seconds and removes the bonuses, then reactivates trigger1.

In practice, this means that the unit gets the bonus whenever it's near the hero, except for briefly when it runs out and is renewed.

Is there a better way to do this part?

As far as the spell goes, I am mystified as to how to get conversion effect on command.  I want to activate it at will, so I thought maybe I could have an AI signal condition and use the chat in conjunction with an AI script...but I don't know how to use AI scripts, even simple ones.

Playing through more AOE2:HD and I've found the same issues I've had in the numerous times where I've reinstalled the game over the years.

There's a lot of clunkiness in the interface - it's all pretty dated, as should be expected from such an old game. In the time since I played AOE2 after school every day for 5+ hours, a lot has changed in the RTS genre. I've adapted to vastly improved control schemes. From simple changes like multiple building select to the advanced control present in Supreme Commander, going back to AOE2:HD is like returning to the stone age.

Age of Empires Online had a lot of faults on launch. PVP matchmaking wasn't even in for a few patches, and when it finally came in it was mired with issues. Building a custom game wasn't remotely simple or straightforward.

Over the months though, they've ironed all these details out with a lot of interface streamlining. The game is actually a *respectable* RTS now - and it isn't even a money grab either. The new Champion mode makes PVP concerns of progression and gear a non-issue as it gives everyone the classic same-footing you've always had.

There are a lot of things I'm liking a lot more in AOEO:

Interface improvements:

* Infinite unit selection
* Multiple building selection
* Attack-move (yeah)
* Better pathfinding
 - Flow-field
 - Clustering
* Faster pathfinding
* Better target selection AI
* Military quick select

Game design changes:

* Infinite duration farm (AOE3 did this right)
* Revised balance model
* Better siege AI (fires at clusters = more damage)
* Unit aesthetic is more discernible between types/roles

I could probably come up with a bunch more stuff if I sat down to think about it, but I think this pretty much represents the general idea.

I’ve been playing AoE II intermittently just-for-fun for 10 years now (not planning to stop: competitiveness is what killed all my interest in starcraft)  and I had a few questions:
 

1-Did you know that without the need of having an edge over the competition you can play a game for 10 years and still don’t know basic stuff? It’s true!  
  

2-Killing a boar (or deer) with a military unit (scout) will render it unusable (I used to kill a lot of mongol deer back in the day) but what if the last hit is made by a villager?
  

 

3- If I put an infantry or cavalry unit or even a monk or a king in an empty castle, its attack will have a (4) next to it (the number of arrows added to the standard 4 I assume) . Does that mean that it effectively increases its attack even though it isn’t a villager/archer unit in it? On that matter, all archers add 1 to the attack?
  

 

4- Teuton bombard towers filled with 10 infantry units should shoot two bombs? Because they don’t.

 
  

5- What is the civilization with best infantry? Teutonic knights are too slow and the infantry doesn’t get any bonus, Celtic fast infantry is useless and Goth infantry is cheap but not stronger. Viking champions or Japanese Champions?

 

6- Is there any unique unit the Samurai can’t beat in a mano a mano besides the War Elephant? (No ranged kiting) I tried and it could even defeat a garland wars-elite jaguar warrior.

 

7-Vikings’ unique ships are better than Galleons? Why? Why does amassing Galleons beat everything else at sea?

 

8-Turks can destroy cities and siege weapons with their cannons, demolish infantry or light cavalry with their unique unit and stop cavalry archers and archers with their free Hussars… but what they can do against a paladin charge? 

 

9- Since they lack bloodlines, French (or Frankish?) Paladins are still worth it?

 

10-Bloodlines and husbandry apply to cavalry archers and Conquistadores, no?

 

11-  Best Archer civilization? British (wait. they don't get ring, nevermind) , Mayans or Chinese?

 

12-Are there any upgrades to Hand-cannoners besides Faith and the blacksmith’s armors? (I.E: does ballistics affect them?)

 

13-Best cavalary civ? Mongols with kiting, Spanish without?

 

14-Spanish villagers are pretty resistant to harassing. Since they’re stronger than Hussars and cheaper, can they be used as military with enough micro or is it not feasible?

 
  
Sorry if there are any typos or grammar issues, I'm a bit tipsy ATM.

1373790996.0,12,self.aoe2,1i9niu,Planning on some AoE2HD generosity due to a need to cheer myself up. Read on.,riderkicker,12,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1i9niu/planning_on_some_aoe2hd_generosity_due_to_a_need/,"Hello.

So, I'm considering buying Age of Empires 2 HD. A four-pack to be precise via Steam. 

Doing this because I've never played the game, I can afford the sale four-pack, and I'm a bit frustrated with some work writing at the moment. 

I have someone whom I know on Twitter whom I've offered one copy to already, and I'll keep one. 

I'm offering one person a copy of AoE2HD from the four-pack. Thing is, since most of you already own the game, I want you to recommend me someone whom you know on Steam/Reddit who doesn't have AoE2HD and who might feel a bit cheerier if they owned the game.

My pick will be somewhat arbitrary (RNG picking, basically), and I'm counting on you folks to actually give me people who could use a free game in their library that they do not already own and who could use the niceness.

Depending on how this plays out, I may also throw in a game for the person recommending someone, and will likely message you on Reddit after I've the random number generator has spoken.

As such, please post the Reddit name of someone you're recommending. 

It's 4:30pm here, so I'll see what happens in around 8 or 9 hours. 

*hugs everyone*

UPDATE: According to a post on reddit, such a giveaway might be better served by going to a different subreddit. Apologies to the two who asked for copies, but I will likely check out one of the two linked subreddits below and make a post later on. :)",,False,self,t5_2sg7u,1373883632.0,,,True,t3_1i9niu,http://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/1i9niu/planning_on_some_aoe2hd_generosity_due_to_a_need/,

I could figure out if Parthian Tactics affected Mangudai armor (that's the question), but I always forget in-game whenever I'm Mongols, and since I was making this thread anyway, I thought I'd ask here. 

The other question is: do towers -- or stone walls, for that matter -- have much of a use in standard games, besides in tower rushes? I'm thinking 1v1, 2v2, and to a lesser extent, 3v3 or 4v4 games, starting from Dark Age. Towers seem too ineffectual and expensive to be worth it except in Feudal ""trushes"", and stone walls don't seem to last much longer than palisades.

Thanks!

...

I know the trade profit is proportional to distance. E.g. Long trade root = High gold per trip.

However, I can't tell if it's more profitable to have

* Markets far apart &gt; Increased gold/trip but long travel time; or
* Markets close together &gt; Less gold but faster

(Assuming straight line travel/minimal obstacles)

Does anyone know how 'trade value' is worked out? Is it:

1. Linearly proportional to distance 
    * you travel further, so you get more gold per trip, but the trip time increases by the same proportion
    * Therefore there's no value in having markets far apart
1.  Exponentially increasing
    * Higher 'risk' of longer trade route factored in
    * Better to have markets further apart, providing the trade carts have a fairly unobstructed path

Edit: another point

* shorter trade route requires fewer trade carts (population slots) to get maximum delivery rate (gold deliveries per minute) without causing congestion

I played AoE II when it came out and loved it. The Age of Empires and Age of Mythology franchise was a large part of my childhood. I've since played other RTS's like Starcraft and when coming back to AoE I missed a couple of their features.

For example, attack move is the biggest thing. Patrol works *okay* but it doesn't seem to work as well. Secondly, I miss the advanced queueing options like queueing different units or research at a time in a building and being able to read tooltips for research or units while they're being trained (I feel like this would help new users out a lot). Also, I can't seem to shift queue unit pathing or building structures. The unit just goes to the last action made.

Lastly, are balance changes going to be made? I wasn't too competitive back then because I was around 10 or 11 but apparently Koreans are pretty good.

---------------

Town Center upgrades: 

* Guardians (400 Food, 300 Gold): Town Center has +2 attack against units.

Mill upgrades:

* Agroforesty (350 Wood, 350 Food): Farms have +175 Food. Some civilizations don't get this.

Lumber Camp upgrades:

 I just reinstalled AoE2 &amp; The Conquerors and I was thrilled to see that there is still an active multiplayer community here! The Civ/History discussions are also *very cool*. I honestly didn't expect this much for such an old game. Anyway, I have a few questions about multiplayer and I hope you guys can help me out.

* Should I play using GameRanger or Voobly? 

* What are the differences b/w the two programs?

* Does one have a larger/better AoE2 community than the other?

* Is one more user-friendly/simpler to set up?

Also, are there any unofficial patches/mods that the community has made that are worth downloading/necessary for multiplayer?

Since I've ever started playing AoC multiplayer a few months ago, I managed to improve slowly over time. Dark, feudal and castle goes pretty much all like I want it to go. But here's the problem, I am *absolutely* terrible in imp, especially late imp.

Just yesterday I played a very enjoyable boom-centered arena 4v4 game. Dark age till mid imp went great. I had a reasonably sized army of hand cannoneers, hussars, pikes and trebs early imp. I managed to clear blue's castles in the middle. But always around mid-imp, I lose my jam and go incredibily slow with producing units and whatnot.
I usually have one army, and when that dies off, I forgot to make backup units, or military buildings. I always feel like it's too much pressure in imp, checking your economy whilst using villagers to create military buildings and castles whilst making units whilst making villagers. When I started playing multiplayer aoe2, I didn't have this problem that often funnily enough, since I didn't create many villagers and spend more time focusing on military.


Apologies for this rant, but has anyone any advice for this (I don't want to join BF or NR games anymore because I'll most likely screw my teammates over)? Just play late imp games till I finally improve?

***Tournament  Format***

[Swiss style tournament](http://challonge.blogspot.com/2013/01/swiss-tournaments.html)

**Number of rounds: 8**. This means you will have 8 guaranteed games.

Players are given their pairings and will determine their own game time, with a given deadline. **There will be a one bye per round, so don't freak out if you don't see a matchup for you.**

Points:

&gt;Win: 1pt
&gt;
&gt;Bye : 1pt
&gt;
&gt;Loss: 0pts
&gt;
&gt;Tie (only used when results are not reported and holding up the tournament): 0pts

   
After all rounds are played, the winner will be determined by points. If there is a tie for points at the end of the tournament, a playoff will be formed. This will either be one 1v1 game, or round robin as needed. 
***

***Frequently Asked Questions***

**Why am I not listed in the Round 6 matchups?**

Check the bottom of the bracket page. If you are still listed in the standings, you have a bye for this round. If you have a strike through your name, you have been kicked out of the tournament. We have kicked out several people this round who have not been participating. This was not personal or anything, we just need a minimum level of participation for the tournament to function. If you have been kicked out and would like back in, let me know and I will put you on the standby list. 


**My opponent will not answer my messages. What do I do?**

Let me know that you have tried to contact your opponent, so I know you are at least trying. I will try to contact them, and then we will just have to wait and see. You will remain in the tournament as long as you are in contact with me.


**Why are the rounds so long?**

They are long because it just takes a while for casual players to play their games. If we get all the games in early, we can move on before the deadline!

**Please remember to upvote this post for visibility, I don't get karma.** The games are starting to become more important as we move into the final three rounds. I realize that the standings are fairly bogus due to the amount of player drops, but it's fun to pretend. :) Good luck!

This is the guide that most people use I assume when flushing. My question:does the guide skip deer because they are not consistent? While berries and boar will always be there? I'm used to getting food in this order: sheep - boars -first mill on deer - second mill on berries - farms.

but this guide says sheep - boars - berries - farms, skipping deer altogether. 
I do agree that walking distance to deer is longer(and back when the deer are done), and the extra 100 wood for the first mill is costly, but I thought it was worth it in the long run because deer foood income is fsster than berries, and I can use my second mill for farms later. I guess I just answered my own question - the 100 wood and extra walking distance is not worth it in a flush,  but this question still remains: why skip deer altogether and go directly to farms?

is there any documentation available on the file format of recorded games? My colleagues and me play quite a bit of AoE2. We're impressed by the tools the Starcraft community has to ease learning like sc2gears and ggtracker, both of which analyse replays and highlight for example macro issues, important battles, ... and these tools are supported by Blizzard which released their own replay parser libraries for everyone to use.

The after-game screen in AoE is absolutely worthless when you compare it to the SC2 information available. We would like to experiment around with extracting useful information out of recorded games ourselves, but it is hard to get started. Existing open source projects like aoc-mgx-format and aoc-mgx-utils don't seem to support the HD version.

Maybe there's someone on the dev team who can comment on whether it would be possible to release specs/code for the recorded games?

I think it would be good if the next thing addressed were the lobby and ranking system. 

Some quibbles I have:

1. The ranking system is weird, it doesn't look like any ELO system I've ever seen. It's unclear if your opponents rating has any bearing on a move after a win or loss, and what's with so many players been stuck together on 3600?

2. It's hard to see players rankings without tabbing out and querying a fan made website. As such it can be difficult to get a balanced game going. ""Noob, Medium, Good and Pro"" is not granular enough to capture the spectrum of abilities in the game.

3. The lobby window doesn't seem to update when I'm tabbed out, even if the window I'm using doesn't cover the lobby.

4. It would be very nice to be able to see all available games, while in a game lobby. It's annoying to wait for ages as the 2nd person in a 3v3 game, not able to see if there's another 3v3 with 4 players in.

5. It's be nice if you could hover over the game name and see map. Lots of people pick BF without putting it in the game name, and it's not possible to filter for ""any but BF"" I think.
 
6. It's a pain to have to set the filters every time you join the lobby browser, especially as you get kicked out of it every time you leave a game lobby, for e.g. after realising the map is BF, or that pings are too high.

What we have now is enough to be going with, but it's not a modern match making lobby by any means.. in fact it's significantly inferior to the zone back in the aoe/ror days. It would be nice to see it brought up to scratch.

He quickly palisaded around the tower so my villagers couldn't do anything to the tower itself and I was unable to build a counter-tower being still in Dark. He then supplemented that tower with about 5 more in quick succession, hitting all my resources and basically trapping me in my town center save for 2 or 3 farmers and a wood chopper or 2.


Luckily I had a strong ally and he was able to attack the Korean player's base which deflected his attention from me. I eventually ended up just deleting my town center and relocating elsewhere with the help of some tributes from my ally but not before my score took a major hit (down to like 8 villagers).

* (keep) in the situation where units are attacking, bombard towers shoot to slow to ever hit the enemies units. keeps do a great job of killing off enemy military.

there also have a second unique unit, the mounted monk. (missionary) perfect for sending out with an army to heal them in battle without slowing them down like monks do.

For your convenience:

[Main thread on Voobly forums, posted by server admin](http://www.voobly.com/forum/thread/143620/0#pagebrowser1)


The Voobly community seem, as you'd expect, distrustful of the HD edition, and by-and-large fairly negative. Their comments range from scepticism as to how well the game will sell on Steam, to the effectiveness of VAC vs Voobly mods, to the way in which AoE:FE (&amp; pop. limits) won't be available (not true - Workshop). There are many naysayers aswell, predicting that as soon as the price drops, so does the curtain for Voobly.


I actually think that Voobly won't be affected that much. I really hate it as a service, but I think that the players it loses to Steam will be replaced by older gamers renewing their interest in AoE.


While not a fan of Voobly, I do appreciate the way that they've kept the online community alive all these years, and wonder whether we'd be seeing this new version of AoE without the preservation of the community through this service.

EDIT] [This post](http://www.voobly.com/forum/thread/143620/:702059#post702059) pretty much sums up how I feel - this thread makes interesting reading.

So I am working on an overall modspansion of the game inside of my head and on an Excel (actually OpenOffice) Spreadsheet. I'm going to learn how to use GenieEd to edit the game files some day but it's a little far off.

""Age of Empires 2: The Battlers"" would basically be like this:

* **3 Ages**

My game would be cut down to 3 Ages, the Dark Age, the Feudal Age, and the Imperial Age. This would basically be like starting in the Feudal Age in the current game. So the old Castle Age would be my Feudal.

The Dark Age would be pretty similar to the current Feudal Age. Attacks mostly focused on attacking the enemy economy and slowing them down with very little chance to destroy the enemy outright. I'd make towers stronger, maybe remove their minimum range. Defenses would be very strong and you'd get the chance to really establish your base.

The Feudal Age would have a big change. Monks would be less random but they'd be more durable. All Monks would be able to convert Castles at a range, and there would be no Heresy. Castles would be much stronger and not even, say, 4 Battering Rams would be able to take them down. But you would have a long range ""Siege Weapon"" in Monks (who would have a couple of range techs early on) to capture Castles. Also Monks would be much, much less micro-intensive. They'd attempt to convert enemies without your having to make them do it and have stances and heal units in an area around them VERY SLOWLY but automatically.

The Imperial Age would be where it all comes down, with strong siege weapons and soldiers. Offense &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Defense. Just like today.

* **Slightly Different Units**

Well, with only 3 Ages I'd change the units up. I'd also rename most of them to be a bit more historically accurate (but they'd generally be the same).

--------Dark Age--------

*Guard (new name for Militia/Man-At-Arms)*: The idea is that the Guards are the bodyguards of the local ruler of your small village that consists of one Town Center, thus his most trusted and skillful soldiers who don't do much besides fight.

*Militia (new name for Spearman):* Common folk most commonly armed with SPEARS. Get it?

*Bowman (new name for Archer):* The word ""Archer"" is going to refer to Cavalry Archers, just for simplicity's sake.

*Slinger (new name for Skirmisher):* Most of these soldiers don't really have a specific role in battle yet, so a Slinger is a less skillful guy wielding a sling. He's not a Skirmisher yet.

*Scout (duh)*

*Drafted Ship (Galley):* Galleys are rowed warships. The navies of the Dark Age kingdoms were frequently civillian ships pressed into action.

*Fire Galley:* I feel like it'd make more sense for the more historically advanced civs like the Chinese and Byzantines to have access to a ship that counters the Galley in the Dark Age as a general advantage.

--------Feudal Age--------

*Retainer (Long Swordsman):* An evolution of the ""Guard,"" he's implied to be a Retainer of the Knights you take into batle. Not quite rich enough to afford a horse.

*Spearman (Pikeman):* Now the commoner with a spear has a role in combat. Spearmen is both the name for a dude wielding a spear and a role in medieval combat, making it different from the word ""Slinger.""

*Eagle Runner (Eagle Warrior) -&gt; Eagle Warrior (Heavy Eagle Warrior from FE):* The idea is that he's just a Scout at first, but then he becomes a Warrior.

*Composite Bowman (old Crossbowman):* You'll see where I'm going with this, but it makes more sense for the Archer civs like the Vikings, Magyars, Saracens, Japanese, Koreans, Turks, Chinese, Mongols, etc to have Composite Bowmen than Crossbowman.

*Skirmisher (Elite Skirmisher)*

*Crossbowman:* So now the Crossbowman is a Hand Cannoneer before the Hand Cannoneer. I know it sounds like it doesn't make sense, BUT Crossbowmen and Hand Cannoneers were very similar in use and played the exact same roles in medieval warfare. I like the idea of a semi-cheap Archer that doesn't require many techs to research available in the Feudal Age.

*Mounted Archer (Cavalry Archer):* I don't like the words ""Heavy"" and ""Elite"" so the Heavy Cavalry Archer will be just Cavalry Archer.

*Elephant Archer:* I'm planning on having an Elephant Archer unit be a common unit for the Indian civs.

*Sentry (Light Cavalry)*

*Camel Rider (Camel):*

*Knight*

*Petard*

*Battering Ram*

*Scorpio*

*Catapult (Mangonel):*

*Moving Tower:* Siege Tower in the earlier age

*Galley:* The last battle to feature Galleys was the Battle of Lepanto. In 1571. Hmmm...

*Greek Fire Galley:*

*Demolition Ship*

--------Imperial Age--------

*Retainer -&gt; Man-At-Arms -&gt; Champion*

*Pikeman:* Halberdiers had different tactics than Pikemen, and Pikemen make more sense in the Imperial Age.

*Eagle Knight:* As an Aztec warrior society and social class, it makes more sense to refer to them as Knights.

*Reflex Bowman (Arbalest)*

*Cavalry Archer*

*Crossbowman -&gt; Hand Cannoneer*

*War Elephant*

*Cavalier -&gt; Paladin*

*Camel Cavalry (Heavy Camel)*

*Light Cavalry (Hussar):* Light Cavalry is a role and a Hussar is a very specific corps of soldier from Hungary. This quite weird now that FE is coming out with the Magyar Huszar.

*Capped Ram -&gt; Tortoise Ram:* I also don't like the word ""Siege"" thrown about everywhere.

*Mangonel -&gt; Onager*

*Scorpio -&gt; Cannon (Heavy Scorpion):* Now, I know what you're thinking. But this works with my Crossbowman -&gt; Hand Cannoneer thing and alot of the civs that get Heavy Scorpion already have a decent gunpowder theme (Turks, Persians, Chinese, Franks). Plus a Cannon makes sense as a technological replacement for a forward trajectory shooting weapon.

*Siege Tower*

*Bombard Gun:* ""Gun"" used to refer to a larger cannon for destroying immobile targets, while a cannon was usually a smaller one for anti-personnel purposes.

*Galleon*

*Fast Fire Galley*

*Explosion Ship (Heavy Demolition Ship)*

*Gun Galleon -&gt; Bombard Galleon (Cannon Galleon -&gt; Elite Cannon Galleon)*

* **Civs**

My dream list of civs is:

Britons

Celts - They'd lose the Siege civ thing and be more more broad with good, cheap units

Franks

Teutons

Vikings - With a ton more land oomph and less water craziness. They shouldn't taper out at in the Imperial Age quite like they do now.

Goths - They'd lose the Infantry spam thing and be more similar to the current Vikings (on land, anyway), more powerful in the early ages, less powerful later on. They'd have very few, super strong units in the Imperial Age.

Slavs

Magyars - They'd take up more traits of the Huns, who I'm not including

Byzantines - They'd be more of an early game civ with strong Infantry and Cavalry than the current trash civ they are right now.

Italians

Spanish

Ghana

Bantu - They'd represent the Principalities of the Swahili Coast and the Kingdom of 
Kongo and be more similar to the current Mayans with cheap Archers.

Saracens - I like the idea of a civ with very few bonuses but a nearly full tech tree more so than the Byzantines. I think the Saracens would fit that bill a bit better since they were EVERYWHERE moreso than any other civ. No Mamelukes but they'd get Paladins instead! :-D

Turks

Persians

Berbers - They'd sort of replace the Saracens, with a UU more like the Mameluke.

Sindhi - Northern Indians, more close to the Indians of FE.

Tamil - Southern Indians.

Khmer - They'd be a Siege civ.

Malayos (Srivijaya, Phillippines, Majapahit Empire)

Chinese - I'd make them less of a generalist civ and focus more on weird unit combinations and gunpowder.

Koreans - I'd make them the main Siege civ to replace the Celts.

Japanese

Mongols

Tibetans - They'd have some bonuses relating to armor, maybe co-opting the gameplay of the Teutonic Knight and the Teutons would receive a Monk-Infantry unit that heals everybody around him automatically very slowly.

Aztecs - They'd become a ranged civ, keep the Monks but the Jaguar Warrior would be an Atlatl thrower. In real life, their signature weapon was the Atlatl.

Mayans - They'd receive the Goths Infantry spam niche, with weaker Infantry overall, a less full tech tree (no Trebuchets!) than the current Goths but with actual economic bonuses and defenses.

Zapotecs - A bit of filler, but another civ with Eagle Warriors would be nice
