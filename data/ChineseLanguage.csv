Confucius says: If you sit by the river long enough, you'll see the body of your enemy float by.

**ORLY? WTF?**

This ""quote"" appears on [various articles](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1225153), [movies](http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/25557.html), [tv](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060912152437AAii9kj) and [music](http://www.amazon.com/Wait-River-Bodies-Enemies-Float/dp/B000BHANX6), but it's originally a really a badass misinterpretation by some Chinese illiterate fucktards.

Confucius originally [said](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Analects#Part_9)


    子        在 川    上   曰，  逝者        如    斯夫，不舍      昼   夜
    Confucius on river side says: the past    like  this  no matter day night
                                  the time             
                                  the previous
                                  the passing things
    
So basically Confucius said: 

    The time is passing like a river running day and light, sigh.

The fucked up part is the interpretation of 逝者, yes sometimes it means the passed away *people*, but it also means the past stuff, or the past *time*. Confucius never meant to say *enemy corpse* by any context.

This is a perfect example of how translation can go horribly wrong.

I have several. Here are my favorites:
Summer of 2010, I took the train from Shymkent, Kazakhstan, to Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. Only foreigner in the whole carriage, of course. I exchange a few pleasantries in broken Russian with the older Kyrgyz ladies who sit across me, but being curious, they pepper me with questions that I just don't understand. There is a Russian girl my age sitting next to me, I figure if *one* person here knows English, it should be her. So I ask, in Russian:

- Do you speak English?
- Niet! I only speak Russian and Chinese. (at no point then did I mention anything about living in China... turns out she lived in 西安 for 10 months)
- *thinking* You better not be kidding me..........

So she became the unofficial translator, and later, the ""official"" one when we crossed the border. A bunch of mean-ass Kyrgyz soldiers holding AK-47s come on board, inspect the passports, come at a stand still upon seeing mine in the pile, then start asking me shit in Russian. Add a bottle of vodka and a few beers to my 听不懂 stupor, and the soldier gets more and more impatient. Then, the Russian chick says something like ""I can translate"" and the soldier, relieved, says ""Oh good! You speak English!"" ""No, I speak Chinese."" He let out an audible gasp and said ""CTO?!"" (what?!). We managed to get through the border procedures smoothly. 

Then, last summer, I went to LA to visit a friend. I am standing in line at a grocery store, and the cashier asks where I'm from because of my sexy-ass accent in English. I was wearing a football jersey from 河南建业, so I pointed at it and jokingly said ""China"". He said ""Yeeeeah right"" and then some old black man (must have been in his forties or even fifties) comes up and starts chatting me up in pretty decent Chinese. We kept going for a few minutes, attracting a big crowd of Mexicans in the process who were not quite grasping what the fuck was going on.

And well... I talked with some actual Chinese people abroad as well, but this isn't as random I reckon.

Hope they can help someone else too!

[Chinese Grammar Wiki](http://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/grammar/Main_Page) - helps with your grammar, going from basic grammar to integrated grammar, really helpful.

[YellowBridge](http://www.yellowbridge.com/chinese/chinese-dictionary.php) - a translator I use for online, pretty useful about giving more information about a character, like what other characters it can go with to make another word along with stroke orders.

[ZhongWen](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/chinese?hl=en-US&amp;utm_source=chrome-ntp-launcher) - a plug in that goes with Google Chrome that allows you to mouse over Chinese characters and gives you the possible definitions along with Pin-Yin, really nice if you like to go onto Chinese news sites or the like.

[Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) - Flashcards! A (safe) downloadable program so you can do flashcards on your computer. If you mess with things a bit, you can get the cards so you have one with pin-yin, one with the definition and one with 汉语 to study all parts of the phrase/character.

[Chineasy](http://chineasy.org/) - Really basic Chinese broken down into images so you can see what a character is in diagrams. They have a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ShaoLanChineasy?fref=ts)

[American Mandarin Society](http://www.mandarinsociety.us/) - This one has some pretty great resources like documentaries and good books to look over, it is worth it to sign up (it's free!), and they have a ton of stuff to just surf through, it really is pretty cool!

[Memrise](http://www.memrise.com/) - if you just wanna learn some more vocab, Memrise is a good way to do it, lots of practice (and a ton of languages other than Chinese) really helpful, and clear. Uses Mems (user submitted or your own) so you can memorize the characters in a fun/visual way.

For smart phones and the like, I HIGHLY recommend Pleco. It is an awesome dictionary (doesn't require internet) and it helps by color coding pin-yin and just overall well done, KT-Dict is good too, but I found Pleco better, it has some cool features, like @ (wildcard) if you put, for example 生@ it will find all words that start with 生, pretty cool.

Any other huge resources I am missing? If so please help out! :)

I'm here to give my two cents, but obviously everyone can include their perspective. This is important because I think what is standard or common has a lot of regional variability.

**First of all, 你好**. Intermediate learners should know that it cannot be used as ubiquitously as ""hi"" or ""hello"" in English. But it certainly has its uses:

* A polite opener to get a stranger's attention. So asking a random person on the street for directions (or for any other request). Or calling for a fuwuyuan (你好，买单! [maidan]). It can basically take the place of that person's name when you're unsure about using 大妈 or 大姐 or 服务员 or 小妹 or 老板娘 [laoban niang]. 你好 is very safe, is perfectly polite, and can be used with anyone and everyone. You also don't need to pause between 你好 and whatever you say next. It would be weird for them if you wait for an acknowledgement. Just say 你好 and launch immediately into whatever you want to say. 你好请问一下解放街[jiefang jie]往哪走？ 

* As a formal opener in written communication.

&gt; Hello Mr. Smith, I am writing to inform you that your reservation has been booked for July 1. 王先生您好，我们已收到 [shoudao] 您七月一日的预订。

* As a greeting when meeting someone for the first time, in person. 你好，我是工号[gong hao]3577，有什么可以帮到您？ 你好，王经理，我们之前[zhi qian] 有通过[tong guo] 邮件[youjian] 联系[lianxi]。 你好，张主任，很高兴终于[zhongyu] 跟你见面。你好，李小姐，很高兴认识你。


For more details, see this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1b0nww/why_does_the_wiki_perpetrate_the_myth_that_nihao/c92m1nz and then feel free to browse the rest of the comments in that thread. I think most of them are accurate.

**早.**I use this a lot with people I know well. Friends, coworkers, family. It's a native contraction of 早上好. Used exactly the same way as ""Morning!""

**饭吃了吗？**To me, this phrase is used a lot more in 2nd and 3rd tier cities, and in older generations. Young people in 1st tier cities typically don't greet each other this way. Anyhow, you can ask this in various ways like 你饭吃了吗？饭吃了没？饭有没有吃？ etc. Usually a direct answer is expected (as opposed to the English ""What's up"", which can be replied with a ""Hey"" or ""Hey what's up?"" instead of a ""Nothing much""). A simple 还没 or 嗯 [en]，刚[gang] 吃完 is sufficient. But, like I said, I almost never encounter this in my daily life, besides with older generation folk. Your mileage may vary.

**在干嘛？[ganma]** What are you up to? Really casual, used much more widely IMO. When used, it needs to make logical sense. So, if you're calling someone, you can first ask 干嘛呢？喂[wei] 你在干嘛？Or if you see someone on the computer, you can walk up to them and ask the same thing. But if you meet your friend for the movies at 3pm, you can't then walk up to them in front of the cinema and say 在干嘛？(even though ""Hey what's up?"" would make sense in that context).



But ultimately I think the most versatile and direct greeting you can have is your **嗨 [hai]. Which is Hi.** But this will also be generationally dependent. Don't expect to say 嗨 to people 45+ years old.

Translation:
Early this morning, I went to the ATM with a friend to get some cash.  It was super cold.  We happened to get there at just the same time as an armored truck, and had to wait for them first.  My friend asked me ""Are your hands freezing?"", to which I replied ""yup"". In the blink of an eye, we had four guns pointed at the two of us, and were being taken to the PSB.  On the road, we stayed silent until I asked my friend ""Why won't you say something?"" Suddenly, there were eight guns pointed at us. A policeman asked, ""What's your name?"", to which I replied ""Jiang Ying Yu"".  He then said, ""What is your name?"".

For those who don't read Chinese yet, this joke is based on three puns:

1. 动手不     冻手不    The first means to attack the guards; the second is asking if your hands are freezing.

2. 开枪      开腔      The first means to fire a gun; the second means to open your mouth and start to speak.

[HanziJS.com](http://hanzijs.com)

There is definitely a lot more development that needs to be done here. Here are the current limitations:

* 1) Can only lookup one character at a time.

* 2) Only breaks down the character into two parts.

* 3) Some characters break down into REALLY weird glyphs, which can’t be shown by the average browser.

* 4) Some character decompositions show numbers instead of their components. This is how the data is structured. It will be solved soon. This is especially apparent in more complex characters and 繁体字 (traditional characters).

* 5) The decompositions aren’t all radicals. They are “parts” rather than radicals. Well most of it. I will set out to show all the radicals eventually.

* 6) When decomposing a radical it displays an “undefined” next to it. Will remove it in the next update.

I hope you guys find this useful. I'm going to continue developing it. For the coders out there, the module is available as a Node.js package called Hanzi. Fork it on GitHub if you like.

Original Thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/zwup5/character_sets_with_sound_information_whats_your/

It's been in my mind for a long time. I wanted to know this myself! I recently coded a feature into [HanziCraft](http://hanzicraft.com) which automatically tries to find pronunciation clues in the character.

Using this tool, I ran it against the 6800 most frequent characters and created two lists:
1) where the pronunciation of the component is exactly the same as the character, and
2) where the syllable of the component is the same, but the tone differs.

I put the two lists online [here](http://hanzicraft.com/lists/phonetic-sets).

I limited each set to three or more characters, as less than that becomes not worthy of mentioning.

I mention on the page there's another variable to consider, which I'm working on, called combinality. This is the trustworthiness of the component to provide the pronunciation information. Basically, how many characters with the component provide 'good' clues to pronunciation versus how many characters with the component provide 'bad' clues.

There are some experiments I can run for you guys, if you're interested.

The first character means 'hair'   
The second character means 'pool'/'pond'/'damp'/'moist'        
The third character means 'east'   

(Bonus points to those who can figure out what characters I had in mind)   

Seriously people, any schmuck with the browser pointed at nciku.com or with pleco and OCR can look up every single character one by one. However, the meaning of a Chinese text doesn't come from breaking the characters apart from the text, but assigning their *correct* meaning and *grammatical function in context*.  

So far I have seen people translate names literally, character by character, without ever mentioning to the non-Chinese reading OP that it was a name. I have seen people claim 法 means 'law' in a Classical Chinese context where it meant 'emulate', and I have seen people claim 去 meant 'to go' when it invariably means 'to leave/depart' in Classical texts.  

Seriously, if you are not able to piece together the overall meaning of a text, you are not able to provide a translation. You are doing yourself, the OP, and other people a disfavor by providing the thread with nothing but noise, and by perpetuating the myth that Chinese is some weird ideographic painting style where lofty and obscure words come to mingle without any clear-cut function or purpose.

[**一月三日 天气晴**](http://www.kanunu.org/jimmy/BeautifulSolitude/616_2.html)

梦见

走在无人的旷野，

视线朦胧，

手上的光亮即将隐去。


我在寂寞的世界

不停地赶路，

不断地告诉自己，

就快到了，

就快到了。


路不断展向前方，

狂风在我耳边呼啸……


呼的一声，

我突然凌空飞起。

---------

**Yī yuè sān rì Tiānqì qíng**

Mèng jiàn 

Zǒu zài wú rén de kuàngyě, 

Shìxiàn ménglóng, 

Shǒushàng de guāngliàng jíjiāng yǐn qù. 

Wǒ zài jìmò de shìjiè 

Bùtíng de gǎnlù, 

Bùduàn de gàosu zìjǐ, 

Jiù kuài dàole, 

Jiù kuài dàole. 

Lù bùduàn zhǎn xiàng qiánfāng, 

Kuángfēng zài wǒ ěr biān hūxiào…… 

Hū de yīshēng, 

Wǒ túrán língkōng fēi qǐ.

-------

**January 3. Weather: clear skies**

I dreamt of

a walk through the barren wilderness,

my line of sight bleary,

a handheld light moments from stowing itself away.

In this lonely world, I am

Incessantly racing ahead

Continually telling myself,

I'll be there soon,

I'll be there soon.

The road continues onward,

Fierce winds howling beside me...

With a single whistle of air,

I suddenly fly off into the skies above.

----------

(1) 梦见 is literally ""dream + to see"" and means ""to dream about"" or ""to see in a dream."" Synonym: 梦到

Here is a nice use of the word in a discussion of Zhuangzi's dream of being a butterfly:

Original (ancient Chinese): 昔者庄周梦为胡蝶，栩栩然胡蝶也。不知周也。俄然觉，则蘧蘧然周也。不知周之梦为胡蝶与？胡蝶之梦为周与？此之谓物化。

Meaning (modern Chinese): 其大意就是庄子一天做梦，**梦见**自己变成了一只蝴蝶，梦醒之后他发现自己还是庄子，于是他不知道自己到底是梦到庄子的蝴蝶呢，还是梦到蝴蝶的庄子。在这里，庄子提出一个哲学问题——人如何认识真实。如果梦足够真实，人没有任何能力知道自己是在做梦。

(2) I translated 无人 as ""barren,"" but literally it means ""without people.""

(3) 手上的光亮 was a bit tough to translate, particularly since the picture (click the Chinese title link) shows him holding a lantern.

(4) Note the use of 地 (""the third de"") in sentences such as ""不停地+verb"" and ""不断地+verb"". Even native Chinese speakers will often not pay attention to this grammatical formality, and will opt instead to use 的. Strictly speaking, though, 地 is correct.

(5) The author uses 不断 twice; I translated the first as ""continually"" and the second contributed to the verb ""continues.""

(6) 呼啸 is tough to translate as well; the dictionary entry is ""whistle,"" but because the winds are fierce (狂风) I translated it as ""roaring,"" but have changed it to ""howling"" at the suggestion of /u/Color_Wolf. Even if you didn't know this word, by the way, the 口 on the side of each character should have let you know that it is related to sound. Note that the literal translation is that this sound was ""next to his ears""; I translated it to ""beside me.""

(7) Note also that 呼 is used in the following line again, so perhaps I should have reused ""howl"" in its translation.

Well, as it is my first post here I probably should give you a quick introduction. 

I have been living in China for 5 or 6 months and though I have not been studying my ass off I have certainly made some ground work IMHO. I have a fairly limited vocabulary of around 600 words, I am well aware this is not great but I am currently happy with the level I am at. The location I am currently living has almost 0 foreigners and almost nobody speaks English - apart from one friend and the 4 private tutors that I hired during my first 3 months. All whom spoke seriously, seriously limited English.

Since I got here I made the effort to speak to people every single day for at least a couple of hours which at the beginning was exceptionally painful and pretty much useless. My name resource is Chinese pod along with Pleco that I use as a general dictionary and flash card application. Whenever I have a spare minute I always flick through my flash cards.

Before I started studying I can remember reading and old post on here which almost prevented me from even trying - something along that lines that it would take years and years of serious study before it was even possible to have the most basic of conversations.

Granted, I may not be able to talk about politics/banking or odd subjects but everyday general conversation I really don't have much problem with - people understand what I am saying and most of the time I understand what they are saying. I have no problem spending a Saturday night with my friends and joining in with some, obviously not all of the conversation.

Anyway, I hope that my Mandarin improves dramatically in the next three years to the point I am able to converse on most subjects.

To anyone who wants to learn Chinese just go for it and see where it takes you!

I already have a text file on my computer called 成语日记, and every day I will add a new one to it along with an example sentence (I just steal one or paraphrase from the book if I cannot come up with one on my own). 
Unless people are opposed to the idea, I plan to post my new chengyu on here once a day as well. Please comment and tell me if I am understanding this chengyu incorrectly!

Reading: 书香云集 is an app on the iPhone which is essentially like owning a kindle. Free books and magazines and you can search by genre. Can change the text from simple to traditional at anytime. There are other similar apps. PLECO is a must. 

Writing: Though I don't practice handwriting anymore these days I think it's still important to be able to write on the computer, and it helps with grammar, speaking etc. I think Italki's community style journal correction system is great. You write and others revise. QQ is also good of course for chatting it up. 

Listening: PPTV is great for finding shows and movies. I love the show 传奇故事. Sometimes reminds me of that unsolved mysteries show. If you have the extra money and cable provider has the Chinese channel package, it's much  easier than Internet hunting. Around $25. Tuneinradio is another app that one can lookbup radio stations in pretty much any country which means China and Taiwan. Listen to talk shows and music, and even record what you want. 

Speaking: Meet people. Italki or QQ and exchange skype. Summer programs or any immersion setting program. Some large universities may even have a Chinese language club that is open to the community, even if you don't attend the school. I say this because the school I attend does, and one of our most involved members is a community member.

I'm looking for some best self-study practices/tips and motivations on how to start and keep a rhythm of study down. I've studied Chinese throughout undergrad so I have a strong foundation on tones, vocab, and sentence structures so I'd say I'm in the upper intermediate/advanced stage while my speaking skills are lagging from not using it in a few years. But I'm working on a Master's thesis in history and I need to improve my Chinese for research purposes (and I hope to return to China after graduating).

I've used Chinese Pod, flashcards, etc. before but I never know how to stick with using them. I also have a handful of textbooks and easy to read novels for intermediate students. Should I create a study time/schedule? I'm rather lazy and tend to forget. And if I do create a schedule, what sort of methods should I use to study? Should I vary it out over the week? Or is it better to find a local language partner or tutor? 

My research also examines activity on Chinese social media, so any resources for learning/keeping up with internet vocabulary/lingo would also be a big help.

1346546799.0,16,self.ChineseLanguage,z7jg6,A lesson: Why it's 東西 and not 南北!,,24,8,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/z7jg6/a_lesson_why_its_東西_and_not_南北/,"Just something that you might find interesting in the learning of Chinese. Learning Chinese isn't just about learning the language, but also the culture behind it. Each individual character/hanzi has it's own meaning (bar a few). 

The Mandarin word for ""object"" or ""thing"" is 東西/东西 (traditional/simplified). As you might know, this literally translates to ""East, West"". 東 meaning east and 西 meaning west. 
But why is it East/West? Why not North/South? Why not *compass orientation 1/compass 
orientation 2? This is because of the meanings that are attached to the words 東, 西, 南 and 
北 (add 中 for the full compass, middle). Don't herp derp, read on!

In Chinese medicine (don't disregard it, it's very intertwined with Chinese culture), the 
directions are each attuned to their own element (and organ and season). For some reason or another, the ancestors thought it'd be a good idea to flip the compass, making the following (organ then element). Don't worry about what organ the element attunes to for now. There's a whole bunch of complicated stuff that I'm not going to explain. 

南 = 心/火 (South becomes ""north"" if your body was a compass. Located at the heart. Fire rises to the top.) 北 = 腎/水 (North is uh...south now apparently. It's your kidneys. Waterflows to the bottom). 東 = 肝/木 (East, from someone looking at you. Liver, wood.). 西 = 肺/金 (West, lungs, gold/metal). Also, 中 = 脾/土 (Center, spleen, soil/earth.)

So, you're probably still wondering what the heck I'm talking about. Yeah, I'd be too. It's like punching a giraffe in the neck, except you're too short to punch a giraffe in the neck and the giraffe would probably kill you for it. So don't do that. 

As you probably noticed, each direction had it's own element. Explaining what the elements mean is the next step to understanding why it's called ""東西"". 火(南) is not only burning and so on, but also represents war and all that violent combaty stuff/selling arms. 水(北) is the selling of oil and to an extent, chemicals. Selling of oil leads to wars (in ancient as well as modern times). These are bad. &gt;:[

On the other hand, 木(東) is wood; you can make paper out of wood. Teachers and scholars use paper. Paper good! 金(西) is gold/metal (but in this case, gold). This represents the everyday use of buying and selling what you need. Necessities, in short. This is also good. Hehe...gold...

Now we come to the word for ""make"" (it actually has many meanings, like [what]""action"", ""to write"", ""to be""...) that you might be familiar with, ""做"". The words 東西 are typically used after 做 as in ""making something"" or ""what are you making"" (你在做什麼東西*啊?). 

But now that you know the extended meaning (can't find a better phrase) of each of 東, 西, 南 and 北, it's clearer as to why it's 東西 rather than 南北. You want to make the good things rather than make the bad things. I'm sure I'm missing something in the explanation, but I can't figure out what I'm missing. 

*啊 is just a sound. It can sometimes clarify what emotion you're expressing. It feels more natural too..

Something else too. My mum wrote this chart thing up for me. It has the organs, seasons and directions as well as some other stuff (like, protect your lungs in winter! something).

I have an app on my phone called Worldictionary. It is able to recognise Chinese characters in an image (e.g. a photo of Chinese characters from your textbook) and convert them into text format so you can paste them into Google Translate and get their pinyin.

So the full steps are as follows:

1. You have a page of Chinese characters in a book.
2. You open Worldictionary on your iPhone or Android phone and use it to take a picture of the text. It will automatically recognise all the characters.
3. Use Worldictionary to e-mail the characters to you.
4. You will receive an e-mail with all the characters in it.
5. Paste them into Google Translate and you now have the pinyin (as well as Google's attempt at translating them).

This is saving me loads of time trying to translate blocks of text. I hope it can help some of you too!

This post will go into some individual phrases that you may use in such meetings. You'll only be able to use them once for each meeting, but they'll sound pretty native and you'll probably get a small chuckle and a 哇 你的中文很好！ and a thumbs up.

**贵姓  (gui xing)**: Last name/family name. This is a formal way to ask someone's name. 贵 in this context means honored or honorable. They will ask 贵姓？ or 请问贵姓？ or 请问您贵姓? If they are not your equal, eg if it's a customer service representative fixing your bank account or tv cable, you can directly say 我姓李 or say your whole name 我叫李刚 or simply 李刚. But the formal reply is 免贵姓李 (mian gui), meaning that you are not some haughty aristocrat of noble birth, and there is no need for the 贵. (免 here means to be removed as unnecessary, as seen in 免税 (tax free)). The 免贵 phrase is mandatory if you are speaking as equals (business partners) or you are speaking to a superior (a boss, a boss's potential business partner, a client you are trying to court, etc.).  贵姓 is a really really standard phrase so I advise everyone to learn it.

**久仰 (jiu yang)**: This is the Chinese version of ""Your name/reputation precedes you."" Typically it's said 久仰久仰 or 久仰大名. It's said semi facetiously. (You wouldn't typically say ""Your reputation precedes you."" with a 100% serious face unless you were a Bond villain.) You should say it with a laugh to show that you are not 100% serious, but it's still a sign of respect (ie 90% serious).

**再会 (zai hui)**: This might be a regional thing, but this is another way to say 再见, but more precisely meaning ""We will meet again."" In the south, people say 再会 a lot in their local dialect as a direct replacement of 再见, but in business settings 再会 is still said in standard mandarin as a more formal version of goodbye. I'm not sure if they use this in the north though.

**工作愉快 or 合作愉快 (gongzuo yukuai, hezuo yukuai)**: Pretty self explanatory I hope. Just means ""To a good working relationship on the upcoming task."" The key here is that we need to use 愉快 instead of 开心 or 快乐. Standard phrase.

**成交 (cheng jiao)**: Means ""Deal!"" But it's quite casual, so you can't exactly use it after negotiating a 10 million RMB deal, or even 10,000 RMB deal. I suppose the same is in English, in that you don't really say ""Deal!"" after agreeing to sign a contract. It's something you can say facetiously if you are striking a bet with someone.

**Transcript:**   

孩子呢天生是顽皮好动的，尤其是有些小男孩儿都是皮得不得了，上天入地，无所不能啊。最近在山东莱芜一个两岁的小男孩儿玩儿着玩儿着，突然大哭了起来。怎么回事呢？他的小弟弟被卡住了。   

卡住小男孩儿生殖器的就是这一列红色玩具小火车。虽然只有大人的手掌这么大，但镜下可把小家伙疼得够呛。   

孩子哭，家长急，[...]小家伙的命根子被火车轮胎里转轮紧紧得卡在了里面。消防队也发现用手指根本解决不了这道难题。  

这么敏感的部位可不敢使太大劲儿，小家伙疼得直冒冷汗，大人们也都急得使大汗淋漓。为了避免破胎过程中的震动伤了孩子的命根，消防队员一边固定住小火车，一边细心地调整角度和力度。经过十分钟的努力，小火车一侧的轮胎轴承慢慢松动了。最后，转轮终于被拆了下来。  

（谢谢了，谢谢）  

咳，小家伙得救了，竟然一声也不哭了。一般检查后没啥问题。谢谢消防叔叔咯！  

这么小的火车玩具平时小孩们塞一点儿东西也塞不进去，你说这小家伙到底怎么弄的呢，这个孩子真有本事的。不过没事，长大了就好了，就不会玩儿火车了。再次提醒一下，当家长的一定要看好自己的小家伙们

**[《又寂寞又美好》](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beautiful_Solitude)** is a collection of poems by 几米. The poems are good for Chinese learners, since they are not overly challenging, but still use some well-chosen words - occasionally in non-standard ways.

A fair amount of the book is available [here](http://www.kanunu.org/jimmy/BeautifulSolitude/616_2.html), and I was thinking maybe we could post the poems with their pinyin, a translation, and additional translation notes.

**In other words:** I am proposing a collective endeavor by users of this subreddit to turn this book of poems into pedagogical materials for Chinese learners.

---------

**Notes:** 

For the purpose of standardization, [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/158z4e/%E5%8F%88%E5%AF%82%E5%AF%9E%E5%8F%88%E7%BE%8E%E5%A5%BD_%E4%B8%80%E6%9C%88%E4%B8%89%E6%97%A5_%E5%A4%A9%E6%B0%94%E6%99%B4/) can be used as a model in terms of titling the post, the header, and the sections.

**Note 1:** to produce the line break just type in a bunch of hyphens.

**Note 2:** to get the pinyin quickly, put the poem into Google translate and click the umlauted A.

**Note 3:** the goal of the translation notes is to provide some insight into the conversion from Chinese to English (which is rarely word-for-word/逐字的) and also to give some pointers to learners at all levels. You can see in the first post that the notes address a range of levels, from grammatical pointers (e.g., using 地) to written characters (e.g., recognizing 口字旁) to classical Chinese (e.g., the selection by 庄子). Hopefully this comes off as ""something for everyone"" rather than haphazard; so look over what you can understand, and come back later to whatever is confusing.

**Note 4:** At least one of the poems in the online version is missing the date/weather. If you want to translate a dateless poem, just link to it and I will check through a physical copy of the book to figure out the missing info, as well as to correct any online typos (of which there are a few).

**Note 5:** It appears redditor interest was insufficient to continue this project, so I have moved on to other things.

All the resources i've read have pointed out that there is a significant learning curve between English/Chinese and i'm just wondering if I could conceivably learn enough to carry on a reasonably broken conversation by 2013 (as i'm sure i could do with the spanish language).

I know it's not a race, but I also don't want to be still at a beginner's level three years from now. What would you consider a reasonable expectation for Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced/Expert conversational skill in Mandarin Chinese (Reading/Speaking)?

This chengyu is **content with what one has**. The meaning is: knowing you have enough, you can experience happiness everyday (and for a long time to come).


用法: 就算时常有烦恼缠绕着自己 就算晴天过后也会有乌云 我也要知道快乐依旧会存在 晴天也还会回来 太阳会升起也会下落 海水会潮涨也会潮落 风水总是轮流转 **知足常乐** 乐观面对 一切问题 也就会迎刃而解 

Usage: Even when feeling anxious, even when the clear day has passed and the black clouds move in, I will know happiness can exist as before. The clear day will return. The sun will rise and fall. The seawater(tide) will rise and fall. The fengshui is always alternating states so just be content with what you have. If you confront every problem with optimism, it will easily be solved.

It's vs. Its, Their vs. They're vs. There, spelling errors, etc are all very common mistakes in the written English language.

So I was wondering what are some common mistakes in Chinese? Apart from the internet-lingo (which is obviously applicable in the Western world as well), what sets aparts the ""noobs"" from the ""pros"" when posting on discussion boards?  

Is it just the breadth of their vocabulary and the puns they make?  I know Chinese can mistype characters (I've seen it happen before), but that doesn't seem very common and certainly doesn't entirely have the same connotations of idiocy as the misuse of you're/your does in English.

------

**大龄文艺女青年之歌**


王小姐三十二岁了

朋友们见到了她

都要问一个问题

你什么时候打算嫁呀？


可是嫁人这一个问题

又不是她一个人可以决定的

她问她爸爸

她问她妈妈

他们都说你赶紧的


你看，你看

你看人家那那那那那

你看，你看

你看看看那那那那


大龄文艺女青年

该嫁一个什么样的人呢？

是不是也该找个搞艺术的

这样就比较合适呢？


可是搞艺术的男青年

有一部分只爱他的艺术

还有极少部分搞艺术的男青年

搞艺术是为了搞姑娘


搞姑娘又不只搞她一个

嫁给他干什么呢？

搞姑娘又不只搞她一个

奶奶奶奶奶奶的


朋友们介绍了好几个

有车子房子和孩子的

他们说你该找个有钱的

让他赞助你搞创作


可是大款都不喜欢她

他们只想娶会做饭的

不会做饭的女青年

只能去当第三者

不会做饭的文艺女青年

只能被他们潜规则

奶奶奶奶奶奶的


这一首歌纯属雷同

如有虚构实属巧合

请不要自觉对号入座

然后发动群众封杀我


你看，你看

你看她只会做西红柿炒鸡蛋

你看，你看

还要就着方便面


那是非常好吃的

mia mia mia mia mia mia mia

那是非常的好吃的

mia mia mia mia mia mia mia


哦，哦，这是一首悲伤的歌

哦，这是一首——

mia mia mia mia mia mia mia

mia mia mia mia mia mia mia

I am the academic director at a language school in Montreal, and I've been teaching Chinese (Mandarin) classes for the last two semesters in person. We're planning to expand a large section of our course curriculum online to supplement what we do in the classroom as well as to give learners from other places a chance to learn with us too, so I'm interested in what feedback and experience you all can share with me. 

Right now, the plan looks like this: 
Online courses would be divided up into lessons / chapters matching a textbook and workbook (that we will publish this summer), with videos for each topic in each lesson, and small memory exercises for terms and characters, like what you see at memrise and other flashcard sites. These would be used to accompany explanations from the textbook, from the videos and from in class, and would allow us to have a sort of ""flipped classroom"" model. For online-only learners we would have weekly skype / video chat sessions to help students with specific issues they are having. 

We also want to develop some general tools, and these are the ones I've thought up: 

An animated character lookup

A database of sample sentences for characters and phrases (à la NciKu)

Recordings of our teachers pronouncing characters

A font / writing style converter for simplified / traditional as well as to see how characters render in different writing styles.


Is there anything you all would add? Do you have any experience taking classes with this format? What kind of tools on other sites do you find useful, and would like to see put in one place? Any other suggestions or questions?

Am trying to learn all forms of standard Chinese here (both spoken and written forms), and it seems I'm encountering things that i don't quite understand or get when reading the pinyin, as how I understand it's supposed to sound differs from the spoken word from which I'm hearing.

Sometimes when hearing people or sometimes even audio programs speaking Chinese, the pronunciation seems to differ a long way from its Pinyin.

In Rosetta Stone for example, ""一个男人"" (yī  gè  nán  rén) differs from how I read it.. when the speaker gets to the second ""n"" of the third syllable she seems to just keep the n and the r silent and replace it with something like a ""y"" sound.. also I thought the r sound was supposed to be heard like the '""dg"" sound in ""judge"".

The only special rule I know so far is the ""33 becomes 23"" rule, which states that in words which have two 3 tones in it, the first tone becomes a 2, dropping sound. Like how ""nǐ hǎo"" becomes ""ní hǎo"".

I recently stumbled on [this page](http://web.mit.edu/jinzhang/www/pinyin/tones/index.html#discerntone) which states a lot of stuff like how the 3rd tone is actually rarely pronounced in full in actual speech. It states some other stuff too which I don't really understand very well as the explanations there are ""well, you'll figure it out by yourself"".. leaving me quite perplexed.

I've always been a little confused as far as when to use ""着."" I would often say things like ""他在吃饭"" or ""他在跟他们开会,"" but never ""他吃着饭"" or the like. I came across some examples that follow the structure ""他正吃着饭。""  Do 正 and 在 both stand in for and mean 正在？

So I guess my other question is: when do I need to use 着？ Is it paired with adverbs or is it commonly used on its own to show tense? I just so rarely heard it used in daily speech, but my listening comprehension is not perfect so I could be missing it.

/r/JudgeMyAccent is a continuously growing sub with the intend to help language-learners of any language with their pronunciation and speaking skills. The idea is that learners upload an audio or video of them speaking freely or reading from a text and natives or advanced learners give feedback where the pronunciation or grammar still needs work.

It already works really well with languages like English, French and German, but we lack learners and natives of some important and popular 2nd languages like Spanish, Russian, Mandarin (or Cantonese of course) or Arabic.

If you are a learner or native who loves to help others visit us and either post an audio file or help the people who posted already. Some threads still have no answers or general answers like ""sounds good, but I don't speak that language"" and that's not really helping at all in my opinion.

I hope to see you there.

In this sense, you could say that Chinese is quite primitive, but it can contain a lot of imagination in that when you’re reading it, you’re not so confined by the writing. In fact, when you are reading, you must participate in adding many things, a process that takes place subconsciously. It is a bit like viewing art. When you view an artwork, you are constantly thinking, adding and extrapolating.

* 乒乓	pīngpāng	ping-pong
* 忐忑	tǎntè	perturbed / fidgety
* 旮旯	gālá	nook / out-of-the-way place
* 曱甴  gaat6zaat6  cockroach (Cantonese)

Then there are some words where there are two related characters that are joined together to make one word, but where the individual characters have a meaning on their own (so they have two morphemes as opposed to the above words, which I argue have one morpheme).

* 凹凸	āotū	bumpy / uneven
* 本末	běnmò	'root and branches' (beginning to end, fundamental and incidental)
* 上下  shàngxià	up and down

Extra note: Another interesting category of words are two-syllable one-morpheme words who share the same radical but which have phonetic parts to indicate the pronunciation. One of my teachers said that many of these words were originally loanwords.

* 疙瘩	gēda	lump
* 蜘蛛	zhīzhū	spider
* 蜻蜓	qīngtíng	dragonfly
* 蟑螂	zhāngláng	cockroach

Can anybody think of any other words that are like these? Any other thoughts about these words?

Edit: I found a couple more similar words:

Is a passing score for HSK 5 would ever be considered by a Taiwanese university? Likewise, is a passing score for the TOCFL 4 would do for a university in China? Should I really do both if I want to keep my options open for both Taiwan and China? The HSK is probably more widely recognized so probably a better investment.

**[一月九日 天气阴](http://www.kanunu.org/jimmy/BeautifulSolitude/616_3.html)**

我打开门，请你进来。

屋里光线昏暗，

让我为你点一盏灯；

你若能暂时停留，

我会为你泡一壶热茶。

屋外异常静谧，

天也渐渐暗了下来。

阶前的花猫，

专注地凝视远方，

一只野鸟突然从矮树丛里蹿出，

惊慌地飞入乌云里……

世界时时刻刻在变幻，

我们必须找寻一个缓慢悠静的时空。

你还在犹豫吗？

门要关了。

**January 9. Weather: overcast**

I open the door and invite you to enter.

Inside it is dimly lit,

So I turn on a small lamp for you;

If you would just stay for a little while,

I would put on a kettle of hot tea for you.

Outside it is unusually tranquil,

The sky gradually growing darker.

A calico cat on the front stoop

Gazes intently off into the distance,

A bird suddenly leaps forth from the short shrubbery,

And flies with a fright into the dark clouds overhead...

The world is constantly fluctuating,

We must seek out a slow-paced time and place.

Are you still hesitating?

The door is about to close.

-----

(1) ""Dimly lit"" probably doesn't do 光线昏暗 justice; note that 光线 has a literal translation closer to ""beam of light."" Also, observe that the pinyin for 昏暗 is ""hūn'àn""; this is not a typo. Writing ""hūnàn"" would look like ""hū nàn"" instead of ""hūn àn.""

(2) I added a ""so"" to line three. More literally, the 让 in this sentence would lead to something like: the lack of light indoors *causes me to* turn on a small lamp for you. Here, *causes me to* is the 让我.

(3) 若 is a fancy way to say ""if""; even fancier is 倘若. Other ways to say ""if"" include starting a sentence with 如果, starting a sentence with 要是, or ending the antecedent with …的话. One might even say, for example, ""要是……的话，……""

(4) 花猫 has many names. For the Chinese wikipage, check out [三色猫](http://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E4%B8%89%E8%89%B2%E8%B2%93); it can be translated in English as [tortoiseshell cat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortoiseshell_cat) or [calico cat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico_cat), though I could probably have just written ""striped cat.""

(5) I translated 野鸟 as ""bird,"" though the first character means ""wild"" (in the undomesticated sense). This line also has two typos in the online version: 从 should be 丛; 窜 should be 蹿. Both are corrected here.

(6) 乌 means dark/black, as in 乌黑. As for 乌云, it is often used in conjunction with 笼罩 (lóngzhào), which means ""to envelope"" or ""to cover."" For example: 乌云笼罩着森林 = Dark clouds enveloped the forest.

(7) Notice the use of 时时刻刻 to mean ""every moment.""

(8) 缓慢悠静的时空 was the toughest part to translate. 缓慢 means slow, but 悠静 is not a standard adjective. It's a character for ""leisurely"" combined with a character for ""quiet,"" so I translated 缓慢悠静 somewhat roughly to ""slow-paced."" 时空 is a combination of a character for ""time"" and a character for ""space,"" so I (again somewhat roughly) translated to ""time and place.""

(9) Notice the last sentence 门要关了 should *not* be translated character-by-character. Do not read this as ""the door wants to close (past tense)"". Most importantly, note that the 了 here is *not* to indicate the past tense, but rather to indicate a change of state (i.e., the door changing to a state of *closed* after being open).",,False,,t5_2qyz1,1356324174.0,,,True,t3_15chq3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/15chq3/又寂寞又美好_一月九日_天气阴/,

[**六月二十四日 天气阴沉**](http://www.kanunu.org/jimmy/BeautifulSolitude/616_47.html)

魔术师们的高帽子，

在荒野召开大会，

他们决定一起施展魔法，

让世上所有寂寞的人，

全都快乐的在一起。

一阵狂风吹来，

打乱了他们的节奏，

帽子如落叶般随风四处飘散，

只留下寂寞的人在风中大声叹息。

**Liù yuè èrshísì rì Tiānqì yīnchén**

**June 24th. Weather: gloomy**

Magicians' hats,

Called a meeting out in the wilderness,

And decided to put their powers to good use,

To make all of the lonely people on earth,

Happy together.

But a great gale arrived,

Throwing off their rhythm,

As hats were blown all over like fallen leaves,

And the lonely people were left sighing in the wind.

------

(1) 高帽子 in this context means ""top hat,"" but it can also mean ""dunce cap"" (the type of cap worn in public in order to humiliate someone).

(2) 施展 means ""to use fully or completely"". Since we are talking about magicians getting together to alleviate loneliness, I took some liberties with its translation.

(3) 节奏 means rhythm, tempo, cadence, beat. I think it is meant to invoke some musical or dance-like quality of the hats moving about in the wind.

(4) 如(落叶)般 means ""like dead/fallen leaves."" There is a grammar pattern ""如……般"" being used here. As another example, one might say: 群众用如雷鸣般掌声迎接英雄的到来。

(5) 四处 literally means ""four places/locations/spots,"" but it translates to ""in all directions"" (what with there being only four cardinal directions) or ""all over the place.""

I posted a topic a few days ago in /r/China about Beijing's accent (in which I know I came off as an immature ass, I got told several times. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/12xlxe/beijing_dialect_and_erhua/) it is if you're interested). I basically didn't like the accent very much and wanted to know if it would be a good idea to study somewhere else instead, like in Shanghai, where they have an accent I like.

I've done tons of research these last couple of days about what different options I have, and yesterday I stumpled upon a forum where someone mentioned that scholarships are easier to get to study in Taiwan than in China. This made me consider Taiwan as a choice. What had always put me off before is primarily their use of traditional characters, as I'm currently learning simplified and don't want to have to start over from scratch. Otherwise I like their accent, the country as a whole seems almost as interesting as mainland China, and of course, it's not a downside that it's a democracy with freedom of speech. ;)

So now I'm thinking, if I could get a scholarship to go to Taiwan and study Chinese, I could study there for a year too, as well as in China (for which I'd take student loans). I always wanted to study Chinese for two years but due to the economical issues that loans bring I never thought I could.

What I want to ask you guys is: Would this be a good idea? Would having to relearn characters set me back too much for it to be worth it? In which order do you guys think I would be best off doing this, China or Taiwan first? I think I have decided that I'll go to Beijing if I go to mainland China, even though I'm not particularly fond of their accent. For the reason to be constantly be surrounded by Putonghua.

Help is very much appreciated! Does anyone have any experience with studying Chinese in either country? Would you recommend it? How much will the switch of scripts slow me down? Is it really easier to get Taiwanese scholarships? Anyone who has anything helpful to say regarding any of this, please do so!

Also, I actually looked for these scholarships to go to Taiwan, but I couldn't really find them. There were supposed to be three of them from the Taiwanese government, as well as some from different universities.

I'm a native English speaker from the middle of the U.S. (Kansas) with only a little Spanish and German as foreign languages. I'm 25 and work about 60 hours per week as a chemical engineer. I don't know any native Mandarin speakers, but I live in a college town, so I may be able to meet some if I attempt to. Getting to conversational competency in a foreign language, specifically Mandarin, has been on my bucket list for a while and I was recently inspired by Benny Lewis' AMA on Reddit to get serious about Mandarin. After a few weeks of prodding around the internet, gathering resources, and reading about different approaches to learning Mandarin, I think I've decided how I want to tackle it.  
  
My problem is going to be time. I've committed myself to spending 30 min to an hour every day working on Mandarin. I have an hour commute to and from work that I typically listen to podcasts or audiobooks and I plan to (eventually) fill the drive with material from Chinesepod.com and similar sites but more on that later.  
  
**My first 1-3 months:** I'm going to work through the first unit of Rosetta Stone for Mandarin. I know Rosetta Stone isn't a fan favorite among some polygots, but I needed a place to start. I'm spending time (during lunch, etc.) going through a Lonely Planet phrasebook and trying to remember essential words and phrases. I'm putting a heavy emphasis on pinyin and pronunciation, less on characters (for now) and grammar. I've also considered getting the Michel Thomas program to listen to on my commute for this period. 
  
**3 months to 1 year:** This is where I shift to heavy immersion and vocab. Change all the languages on my computers, phones, etc. to Chinese and start hitting Anki hard and also memrise. I might pick up a copy of Remembering the Hansi, but I've gotten mixed reviews on this resource as well. I'll start watching Chinese TV shows (children at first) and trying to read daily chinese-language newspaper websites. I also will try to find native speakers and/or try to communicate in chat rooms.  
  
**1 year onward:** Continue expanding my character set. Within three years I'd like to have ~2,000 characters, which I think is easily doable. Potentially plan a trip to China. I plan on going back to school for an MBA or Masters degree in a few years and I'd like to try and take formal classes on Mandarin while I'm back in school.  
  
I think this is a fairly reasonable outline of how I'd like to go at it, but I wanted input from you guys on if this seems reasonable or if I'm leaving anything out.

To illustrate what I'm talking about, I'll give an example: when I first went to China, I met a girl who was basically the opposite of me. Whereas I was a Chinese major,  she was a communications major, which meant all her coursework and classes were in English. When we first started hanging out, it was on the idealistic basis that ""we can be language partners and help each study!"" but it almost never worked out that way. She'd always feel like the amount of time we were spending on English was lacking, and I felt the same way about the time we were spending on Chinese. Ultimately, the partnership was a really tense, with both of us always feeling like we were being slighted.  At the end of the semester, neither of us liked the other very much, and we were meeting less and less (probably just for one meal a week).

Here's another example of a situation I'm sure many on this board know well: You go somewhere, like a store or restaurant, and speak to the worker there in Mandarin. You get a reply in English. You respond to  in Mandarin again, but you just get another reply in English. It's frustrating, because both parties seem to want to practice their languages skills. On one hand, you've paid the price and made the sacrifice to live in a foreign place to learn the language; from another angle, the other person might just be trying to be accommodating.  

I hate these kinds of situations, and find them awkward to no-end, so I'm curious to see what kinds of things people who've gone to China have done to combat this. I myself have come up with a few solutions as well, which I'll share with the group in a bit if an actual discussion gets going.

I now have the solution thanks to /u/SuperNinKenDo

Since AnkiDroid only imports **apkg** files and Pleco only exports txt and XML, the process is a bit longer. requiring the desktop version of Anki.

The wall of text is more intimidating than the actual process itself.

The export settings in used the Pleco

&gt; File format: Text File (I couldn't get Anki to properly read Pleco's XML exports)

&gt; Text encoding: UTF-8

&gt; Character set: Both (You can choose whichever suits your needs, I may do separate decks for myself just for added practice)

&gt; Categories: No (This seems to cause problems, for which I don't have a solution as I don't require the use of categories)

&gt; Card defitions: No (Unless you've edited certain cards)

&gt; Dictionary definitions: Yes

In Anki (Desktop version)

&gt; Tools &gt;&gt; Manage Note Types... &gt;&gt; Add &gt;&gt; Add: Basic &gt;&gt; Give the new card type a name (I named it, ""Pleco"") &gt;&gt; OK

&gt; Fields &gt;&gt; Add &gt;&gt; Create a name for your new field (I named it, ""Definition"") &gt;&gt; Close

&gt; Select ""Pleco"" from the list &gt;&gt; Cards... &gt;&gt; Add the &lt;br&gt; {{Definition}} bit in the picture below &gt;&gt; Close &gt;&gt; Close

&gt; http://imgur.com/u68glo9

Connect your phone to your computer such that you can browse it

&gt; File &gt;&gt; Import &gt;&gt; Find the txt file &gt;&gt; Open

&gt; Type &gt;&gt; Pleco

&gt; Deck &gt;&gt; Choose or add a new deck for your Pleco cards

Everything else should be in their correct places but if not

&gt; Field 1: Front

&gt; Field 2: Back

&gt; Field 3: Definition

&gt;  Click on ""Import""

You should now have a new deck with the imported cards, and to bring this deck into AnkiDroid

&gt; in Anki ... File &gt;&gt; Export... &gt;&gt; Include: Choose your new deck &gt;&gt; Export...

&gt; In the file browser (still on your computer), go to your phone and save the apkg file to the AnkiDroid folder

You can now disconnect your phone.

On your phone, open the AnkiDroid app

&gt; tap on the three vertical dots at the top right (This may vary on different versions of Android, I don't know) and choose, ""Import cards"" then click, ""OK"" and choose the file you save and then tap, ""Add""

That's it!

I find it much easier to create decks with Pleco's built-in dictionary but prefer using Anki for studying. I just can't seem to get the process right.

(Annoyingly, it's usually not the ""left"" radical, or the radical you look up in a dictionary, its the ""other one"" - do any linguists know the best terminology to describe what I mean? **Edit**: thanks qeny! ""The component that represents the sound is called the 声旁, and the other part can be called the 形旁. In English, they're often called the phonetic and the signific"").   

In a certain sense, these sets of characters represent an evolutionary mid point between ideograms and alphabet. They *do* carry sound information - it's just that there are still a hell of a lot of exceptions.    

I reckon these ""sound sets"" are one of the easiest ways/hacks to memorize characters in bulk. 

I call ""1st Order Sound Set"" a group of characters that have the exact same pronunciation (both pinyin and tone), where the shared phonetic character element, or 声旁, is *also* a character in it's own right and is itself within that set. (It doesn't matter if this 声旁 is found in other characters with other pronunciations).    

I call a ""2nd Order Sound Set"" a set of characters that have the same pinyin and tone pronunciation, but the 声旁 as its own character is pronounced differently.


I would love it, and I'm sure others would too, if you help find other sound sets, or suggest your favourite sound sets (the ones with a lot of characters) so that we can practise them. 

And I'm curious - **does anyone know which is the biggest?**    



---------------------------------    

**Some sets following the ""First Order Sound Set"" rule**:    

ba1 - 巴 - 巴疤芭笆粑鲃吧

bi4 - 辟 - 辟避壁臂璧薜嬖

ma3 - 马 - 马蚂玛码吗骂 ""The Horse"" set

man4 - 曼 - 曼慢漫幔缦熳 ""The Bankok"" set

yi2 - 夷 - 夷姨咦侇峓胰荑痍蛦羠 ""The Barbarian"" set

yu2 - 俞 - 愉逾瑜榆渝

zheng1 - 争 - 争睁铮挣筝

zheng1 - 正 - 正征怔症

zhi2 - 直 - 直值植殖




----------------------    



**Some sets following the ""2nd Order Sound Set"" rules**:

ban3 - 版板阪坂舨钣 (however, 反 is fan3,fan1)


pao2 - 袍咆庖匏狍龅 (however, 包 is bao1)


yi4 - 艺忆亿屹 (however, 乙 is yi3)

jiao3 - 佼狡皎饺绞铰 (however, 交 is jiao1)    


-----------------------------------    

(Side note: I find them extremely easy to memorize in this manner: e.g, my favourite is yi2 夷 = ""The Barbarian"" set, and it's easy to imagine Conan the Barbarian with each other radical in turn, a woman, grass, moon etc, saying what they mean in his accent).    

I wonder what could be other types of sound set? (**Edit**: qeny shows a list of characters that have the same ""final"" sounds/pinyin (but different tones) and same  声旁 component. E.g. 尧 for ""-ao, or 青 for ""-ing"". This is my new **3rd** type of phonetic set.)

Naturally, our listening ability will grow as we gradually become exposed to Chinese, but what I'm talking here is deliberately trying to improve listening ability during a relative short period of time (a few months, a semester). The most important thing of all is of course quantity, meaning that if we don't listen enough, we won't get anywhere regardless of what we're listening to.

Another factor which feels important is the level of the audio we're absorbing. I think everyone agrees that listening to very simply Chinese isn't very helpful if we want to improve listening ability in general (but might be helpful for other reasons). I personally don't find it very useful to listen to something I don't understand at all, but I know some people advocate that as well. The question then becomes how difficult things we should listen to.

I just wrote an article about a phenomenon I think is quite common. You can read the article here ([Triggering quantum leaps in listening ability](http://www.hackingchinese.com/?p=400)), but I'll summarise the basic idea. In essence, I've noticed that I sometimes tend to shy away from material I can't handle comfortably. Still, I have started listening to much harder material a few times in my studies and each time I've found out that if I just give it enough time and stay focused, listening ability tends to catch up. My feeling is that the initial fear of not understanding everything or close to everything has been holding me back.

After talking to quite a number of other learners and reading about other people's experiences, I've found that I'm not alone. My theory is this:

*Most people could improve their listening ability faster if they just had the confidence and the determination it takes to increase the difficulty of the input.*

I'm not talking about studying more here (although quantity is still very important) or about all people, but my impression is that many learners would benefit from trying to listen to more difficult Chinese, relatively speaking.

Been experimenting with watching Chinese TV shows on the internet to try to improve my listening skill and general vocabulary.

I'm not sure the best way to go about it, so I'm wondering if any reddittors can help me.

Usually if I just watch the TV show I find that the dialogue is too quick or complicated to understand, also I find that my eyes are drawn to the Chinese subtitles which I find easier to understand than the spoken dialogue. The result is that I am half reading the subtitles, half listening to the dialogue and only understanding broken fragments.

I have tried covering up the subtitles and just focusing on listening and trying to get as much out of it as I can. Which is difficult and I'm not sure if I am really learning very much.

I have also tried watching it through while pausing frequently to look up unfamiliar characters from the subtitles in a dictionary. This seems to help and I feel like I learn new words this way, but it is painfully slow and I'm afraid that I am not really practicing my listening ability and instead relying on my reading comprehension.

Has anyone found a better way to do this?

Maybe I should quit trying to watch Chinese TV until my overall language skill is better?

After recently spending more time with her family, I have been picking up some 景德镇话.  
It's very different from 普通话, but also has a lot in common with 南京话 and other southernish 方言. I thought I would share my observations with everyone. I'm interested in hearing about other 方言 in areas I have never been to. Please feel free to post your own observations.  
  
  
In  景德镇话 there are major sound shifts that kind of map to 普通话

 * ke is ko (almost like kou口 but different)  
 * sh &amp; s are the same. There is no real difference between  四 and 事  
 * all ending g's are dropped。 So 因and 应 are the same  
 * h's are f's, so 结婚 is jiefen  
 * x's are h's 下载 and 吓到 hazai  and hadao  
 * 水 sounds like 许  
 * 冷 sounds like 狼  
 * 狼 sounds like 龙  
 * 龙 doesn't sound like anything in 普通话 but it is still close to 龙 different vowels  
 * 日 is 昵
 * 头 is kinda like dou2  
 * 热 sounds like 乐 (so you have things like 热的菜 sounds like 乐的菜, 然 like 蓝)
  
There are also major vocab differences. For example:  

 * 太阳 is 日头  （ni4dou5 sounds like needle a bit)
 * 开水 is 滚水 (sounds like 滚许 a bit)

edit: even though 头 is kinda like dou2, the vowel is clearly different, the mouth takes on a shape that is not used in 普通话, to me it kinda sounds like a cute lazy southern US accent. (Don't know if that makes any sense)

First, let me say that I am really glad this place exists.  It is nice to connect with other Chinese learners!  I wanted to make this post to inspire beginner Chinese students.  I feel that some people here perpetuate the attitude that it is ""impossible"" to learn fluent Chinese in one year, and that you must devote 3-4 years of your life to Chinese in order to make any sort of progress.  Please look at the following post made by Glossika about his Chinese studies.

http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=326&amp;PN=0&amp;TPN=3

He became fluent in spoken Chinese and had around 4000 characters memorized after 14 months.  His situation is a little different, because he was already a seasoned language learner when he began his Chinese journey, and because he had 4-5 hours a day to devote to study ( Immersion too).   This is not the case for all of us, but some people do have time to study the way Glossika did.

I agree with people here that say you must devote serious time to the study of Chinese to make progress.  I also think that if you are driven enough and have the time you can make an amazing amount of progress in a year.  So, don't let the idea of Chinese being difficult prevent you from starting your studies.

Iv been learning Hanzi for about 4 months (with a break, read further) . I started off trying to really work with mnemonics etc... But a day ago I became interested in the Japanese alphabet so I set out to learn it. I want to get them done quickly so what I do is I just drill them in short bursts constantly untill I don't even need to think, I just have to see them and immediatly I will punch in the sound (I use Memrise).

Now I want to try this same system with Hanzi, my question to you guys is how did YOU learn Hanzi. Was it by way for brute force drilling untill it became second nature or a more mnemonic driven approach?

Could you also elaborate on the long term effects of your method. I want to drill Hanzi because I like that method, nice straight to the point and hardcore. I still might use a mnemonic in the beginning but my focus is on recognizing the character and knowing its meaning without having to resort to tricks of the mind.

But! In the back of my head I have this sensation that I might also easily forget the words I drill. So just talk about your experiences about learning vast amounts of characters. Note: I keep practicing my known words constantly so its not like I stop looking at them once I know them. This is important because perhaps it doesn't matter HOW you first learned the word, if only you keep brining it up from time to time. Complicated issue.

On one hand I wanna just get the characters out of the way in a brute force manner, and then use them as much as possible in sentence exercises. On the other hand I want to take it slowly because I don't want to forget them easily. Then again I have stopped learning them once before because of alot of work in school and I forgot them almost all. I had 750 words. Once I saw the word and the meaning again it was re-enforced in my mind so I didn't have to start the process from zero but still.

Its amazing how fast you can forget stuff. Imagine forgetting 750 characters you worked your butt of everday for 3 months to know.

My grandpa passed away on Friday after a long fight with cancer.  I grew up with the man, but in his final years, he was in and out of the hospital for surgery and had to deal with dementia and memory loss.  My parents asked me if I wanted to leave anything in his casket-- I have some personal effects and I wanted to include a letter as well.

I was born here in the US and I don't read or write Chinese.  I knew enough to converse with my grandpa, but he is strictly a chinese speaker.  Can someone help me translate this letter to him?  I am unsure of the differences with traditional and simplified... he was a teochew speaker who spent most of his life in Cambodia, if that helps.  If there's a chance he may understand one format but not the other, I'd like to include both translations if possible.    

I tried Google translate and went through the translation word by word, but it seems to be off each time.  I didn't want to take a chance, seeing as how this is my only opportunity to leave something for him.  I would appreciate very much if someone could help.  Here is the letter below:



Grandpa,
I am so sorry I didn't come sooner to visit you when I heard news you passed away.  I was afraid.  I didn't want my last memories of you to be on your deathbed.  I think back about my childhood and you are in so many of my fondest memories.  I remember waking up early in the morning and taking the bus to Pioneer supermarket.  We would walk to down the hill to Chinatown.  You would get a newspaper and I would get a Chinese doughnut.  I remember how much you would love to watch the Lakers play on channel 9.  I remember how much bread you would bring home.  I know you didn't have much money, and I appreciate that you always bought the expensive brand because I liked it best.  The whole family is sad you are gone, especially my mother.  We all care about you very much.  You've had such an impact on my life and I am very grateful for everything you've done for me.  I want you to know that I love you and I miss you very much.
Your Grandson

长长的十二月，有相信的理由，
即将来的一年会比今年好
我不能记住你离开前的最后一件事
日子过得太快了

又在谷里呆了一天，
又在台上呆了一夜，
如果你觉得我能被原谅，
希望这样

冬天医院里的味道，
我就感觉，人们像霜打的茄子，没精神  （我就感觉，人们像寂寞的牡蛎，没珍珠）
众里寻他千百度，蓦然回首了，
那人就在灯火阑珊处

又在谷里呆了一天，
又在台上呆了一夜，
如果你计划着加州之旅，
欢迎你来

我通常在两点以后，开车去山边别墅
谈论着过去这一年
好像冬天冰封了你的一个笑颜，
让你低声倾诉着，不能对她说的秘密。
过去了长长的十二月，有相信的理由，
即将来的一年会比今年好
我想不起来多少次提醒自己
不能让这些回忆悄然逝去

又在谷里呆了一天，
又在台上呆了一夜，
我已有很久没看到大海，
我该去了

I've only just started learning to read Chinese (mandarin, simplified) and I'd like some exposure to the 'real' sounds of the language.
I read a good article on LifeHacker by a guy who learned Spanish by watching Spanish-language films; first with English subtitles, then with Spanish subtitles, then with neither. It meant he could learn the story first, then get to grips with the language once he already knew what was going on in each scene.

Obviously for this approach to work I need plenty of really good Chinese-language films. Sadly, I'm not much of a film buff and my knowledge of the area is almost nil.

Can anyone suggest some really great films (in Mandarin) for me to watch that will stand up well to repeated viewings? I don't really mind what genre, but I am particularly partial to action, adventure and comedy.

(also posted in /r/ linguistics and /r/ Chengyu)

I'm doing a project for my (teaching) ESL grad school class about idiom congruency in Chinese and English.

Essentially I'm going to test on the learnability of certain English idioms, and I hypothesize that the students will learn those idioms better that have equivalents in Chinese. For instance, in Japanese, they have the phrase ""A rolling stone gathers no moss"" almost exactly, thus if you presented that idiom to a Japanese speaker, the idea is that this would be learned easier.

Any thoughts? I could Google a bunch of Chinese idioms but I thought I'd reach out to see if any Chinese speakers could provide common, well-known idioms that may have comparable phrases in English.

Here are some that I've gathered so far. I am NOT a Chinese speaker so please let me know if any glaring errors here:

两肋插刀 ""stick knives into both sides of your ribs"" [“I’d take a bullet for you”]

说曹操曹操到 － ""speak of the devil and the devil appears"" [""(same in English)""]

入乡随俗 － ""enter village follow customs"" [""When in Rome...""]

Also I am told Chinese has:

""Two heads are better than one""

""Blood is thicker than water""

""The journey of one thousand miles begins with one step""

*this would probably be the easiest to learn for a Chinese speaker, since the origin of the quote is Lao-tzu

Any thoughts are welcome, thank you!

**EDIT** per sco_t's comment below: I am definitely interested in literal translations v. English interpretations.  It's important for me to distinguish between ""sayings/expressions"" that are *syntactically* the same in English, and those expressions which are merely *semantically* similar.

For instance, I learned recently that in Chinese there is the expression ""the walls have ears"" that is directly translatable from 隔墙有耳.  Sayings like these, I hypothesize in my study, would be the easiest for a Chinese-speaking English learner to learn.  Furthermore, they'd (hypothetically) be able to retain the form as well, if form were emphasized in the quiz.  English interpretations of Chinese expressions might only be easier to learn if *meaning* were emphasized, since the learner need only recall the ""English equivalent"" once it's learned.  

I hope that makes some sense.  So, I'm not a Chinese speaker and I need to be sure about that distinction.

There's also some political aspect behind it... almost every Chinese newspaper in the US, and wikipedia articles, prefer to use Traditional. I know that overseas Chinese communities have historically used traditional characters, which would explain the newspapers... but why does the writing system with around ~50 million users seem to be so much more prevalent than the system that around 20% of people in the world use?

What do you think, r/ChineseLanguage?

Edit: I mean that it feels political that it is so hard to find a newspaper here printing in simplified, or that wikipedia opts to use traditional hanzi in their English language articles (see the article on [the Daodejing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching)) to see what I mean.",,False,,t5_2qyz1,True,,,True,t3_kc6pe,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/kc6pe/traditional_vs_simplified_characters_the_ultimate/,

A little background: I'm considering studying Mandarin. However I live in Brooklyn NYC and have a number of Chinese neighbors. From what research I've done so far (Wikipedia, etc.), many Chinese immigrants in New York hail from the Guangdong province and Hong Kong and speak Cantonese, although this has begun to change recently with more immigrants coming from mainland China.

I suppose the straightforward way to find out which language they're using would be to simply ask. Would that be viewed as ignorant or rude?

I have this pretty thick vocabulary book that I like. Like most vocabulary books, it's divided into subsections based on concept group and is overall organized based on the routine of a day starting with waking up in one's bedroom to going to work, hobbies, etc. It has an ample amount of sample sentences using all the vocabulary. But the problem is the translation of these sample sentences.

I haven't taken any classes yet; I've only learned from podcasts and self-study, so I'm not sure if I've translated them accurately. Can anyone check my translations to make sure they are correct and accurate?

I'm hoping this isn't a bother to anyone, and hopefully a chance for other beginners like me to boost their vocabulary. If others want, I can post each section, section-by-section after this.

So far I look up unknown words that I find frequently reoccurring, words where I know all characters but not the meaning, and key-words that would otherwise prevent me from comprehending what's going on. I've been tempted to create a specific Anki-deck, but I am afraid it is going to fill up with more than I can manage.

I've been a member of this subreddit for ages and while I don't usually post self-promotional stuff, I'm involved with Popup Chinese and wanted to share a new show we're putting together for upper-level students in the hopes of getting feedback. This is episode one:

http://popupchinese.com/lessons/quiz-night/welcome-to-the-quiz-show

Why post now? Basically because we're trying to solve the problem of advanced vocabulary acquisition that most teaching podcasts (in my opinion) fail to handle very well. I've outlined some reasons why in our lesson discussion and would be happy to talk about that too, but what I'm really hoping to get from this discussion is a sense of what feedback you guys have on the concept and format, and particularly how you might tweak things to improve the show if you could.

So if you have 16 minutes to listen please do. Feel free to rip the show apart, or share any other thoughts you might have -- you won't hurt my feelings. And if the flash player on the site gives you trouble or you're on iOS, you can also grab the show along with our latest 199 other episodes from our RSS/iTunes feed at https://​itunes.apple.com/us/​podcast/​popup-chinese/​id292036117

I hate to ask that question which is probably awfully redundant by now.. but I couldn't see any links/references to it elsewhere.. so here goes. 

I want to move to Hong Kong in a few years time. I figure I should start learning the language now, before I go so I will enjoy the culture more once I arrive.

One, obvious question... Cantonese or Mandarin? I understand Cantonese is more prevalant in Hong Kong, but I don't know ... someone out there might have some sort of insight I'm unaware of. 

I'm a westerner. Currently living in London.

On Friday, I am scheduled to sign enlistment papers to join the US Army for active duty. This will be much to the surprise of my family and grandfather, none of whom were informed about what I'm doing (long back story... I'll spare you all unless someone's dying to know.)

Before I go off I need to write a personal letter to my grandfather. My grasp of Chinese is... comical. His grasp of English is as much as he needed to work in a hotel kitchen. Thus, we've never communicated much though we interact almost daily. Despite this, all my life he has been a rock-solid support, male role model, somewhat the father my father never was, and the only member of my family I truly care about. I need to tell him why I'm enlisting and how much he means to me. And I need to tell him in Chinese. 

Obvious question - Why aren't I just going to someone in town? Answer - I've been unemployed for some time. I can't afford a translator in town. I'm hoping one of you or someone who knows someone who knows someone can help me do this on the cheap or free. If you live in the Chicago area, I can also trade some writing/editing, video making or photography for the translation. (My portfolio - www.thomasmchan.com)

The letter will probably be about 1000 words - I haven't written it yet, so that's just an estimate. I have a friend willing to do the back-translation/whatever you call it (Chinese to English) to verify accuracy. 

Also, if this first letter goes well, I may ask you/the translator to translate more letters in the future (fully paid from my Army paycheck)",,False,,t5_2qyz1,1363225316.0,,,True,t3_1a8ku4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/1a8ku4/soldier_to_be_needs_a_personal_letter_translated/,

A quick bit of background, I speak and read Japanese reasonably well (I'm probably around 1kyuu level, read ~2000 characters and 10k words etc) so the characters come to me very quickly. I just finished going through IKnow Chinese Core 2000, which covers 2000 common words and gives two sentences for each giving context and showing how they are used. All of this I've put into Anki and I'm doing lots of daily reviews. 

I started studying 4 months ago, and just started a Chinese course at Xiamen University here which I'll go to each morning (3 hrs or so). Otherwise I have nothing but free time. I have a Chinese girlfriend already so get to practice all of the time with everything new I've learnt (she doesn't speak English)

So basically my progress has been very fast so far, but having finished the Core 2000 I'm a bit unsure where to go next. I appreciate that things like watching lots of TV help, but I really want to be able to continue building vocabulary as fast as possible. 

I'd like to be able to learn at least 30 new words a day, ideally up to 100 although that might end up being too much. I'm just looking for the most efficient way of finding the best input sentences in the first place, so I can slam them all into Anki and then review throughout the day. 

Perhaps going through everything in ChinesePod would be best? I don't mind paying for the best resources if it will let me keep improving at the same rate or faster. I'm in an extremely fortunate and unique position right now where I don't think my Chinese study environment could be any more ideal, so I want to keep moving forward as fast as possible :)

I realize I am crazy but I have decided to learn Chinese over the next couple of years. I do a lot of business with Chinese companies and my best friend just moved to Guangzhou with his Chinese-American wife.

I realize Cantonese is more common in Guangzhou but I've decided to study Mandarin because more people speak it.

My question is, should I focus on traditional or simplified characters? I've just begun studying the basics and just want to make sure I spend my time wisely.

I plan on eventually taking the HSK test(s) if that helps. Haven't been able to find confirmation on which one that is in.

**EDIT:** I now know the HSK is in simplified characters. Will I be able to pass it if I study traditional? Which one is most widely used in society? (online chat/websites, newspapers, subtitles on tv, advertisment etc.)

*I realize I come of as a total beginner here, which would make sense since I definitely am one. I learned English pretty much on my own and passed the Cambridge Certificate in Advanced English so don't give up on me just yet.* ;)

It combines ChinesePod and Anki. I tried simply listening to one ChinesePod lesson per day for a while and found I wasn't retaining enough to make it worth the time. I tried downloading Anki decks and using those, but the lack of context made it difficult to incorporate new vocabulary. Here's my method, which I feel maximizes both:

1. Start with a folder or playlist full of chinesepod lessons that you haven't done yet. Choose one.

2. Listen to it straight through. While you listen, have Anki open and create a new card for each new vocabulary item that you're unfamiliar with.

3. Move the Chinesepod lesson to a new ""review"" playlist.

4. Repeat steps 1-3 as many times as you want, until you have a decently populated ""review"" playlist (or around 30-50 new cards in your Anki deck).

5. Review your Anki cards until you know them all.

6. Go back through your review playlist. For each lesson, just skip to the first dialog and listen to it. If you understand it 100%, move it to another playlist for ""completed"" lessons. Otherwise, leave it in the review playlist, review your anki cards more, and try it another day. The dialogs are usually only 30 seconds or so. Just listen to it and move it appropriately.

7. Repeat all the above. By managing the time you spend on each step you can keep a quick pace, cycling lessons from the ""new"" playlist to the ""completed"" playlist. Every once in a while, go back to the ""completed"" playlist and listen through all of the dialogs. Move it back to ""review"" if you have any troubles.

The reason this method works well is that it maximizes the potential of ChinesePod. As a daily lesson it's ineffective (IMHO) because there's a low signal-to-noise ratio and not enough repetition. Listening to Ken define each term 3 times in a row is a waste of time! While he's doing that, you should be building a deck. Listen to the subsequent discussion once to get some of the valuable comments on structures etc, but after that there is no reason to listen to the whole thing again. Stop listening to the english portions, and just listen to the dialogs. You can review 10 lessons in just a few minutes that way.

This is a way to work smarter, not harder. I can attest that my listening has improved a lot since I started doing this.",,False,,t5_2qyz1,False,,,True,t3_ke6jh,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/ke6jh/quick_way_to_develop_listening_using_chinesepod/,

I found out recently that I received a scholarship to study in China for one year. Since it was recent that I found this 
out, and it starts soon, I'm kind of scrambling to brush up on my Chinese so I'm prepared when I get there. I have a 
background in Chinese, I studied it for the past 3 years in college, but it definitely needs improvement. 

I've looked to get books, but the only ones I can find are beginners which are a bit below my level (though I do wish 
to reinforce the basics.) Are there any materials that any of you know of that are worth getting? I'm willing to spend 
some money but preferably cheap or free. Also any recommendations for methods of language learning that are efficient like watching specific television programs or movies, etc. are appreciated.

Or if anybody has any experience with re-learning or improving a language that they weren't a beginner with, I'd be 
very interested in general ways to do so.

Has anyone come across an effective English translation for this four character combination? It can easily be broken up into 道德 and 绑架, which mean something like ""moral"" and ""kidnapping,"" respectively.

For an example, I could say to my friend, Willie Sutton ""you are such a generous guy and care so much about children, you should donate some money to my children's cancer research fund."" Thus I have trapped him by setting high expectations for his morals and forcing him to do something for me.

I thought something like ""guilt-tripping"" would work well, but then realized that when you guilt trip somebody, you make them feel bad and ""guilt"" them into doing whatever it is you want them to do.

I pass the thread to my tutor and my assistant so that they know what words I want to practice.  I can access the list on multiple devices (phone, tablet, PC) . I guess I should mention that my speaking is fairly advanced, but reading / writing sucks.

I'm wondering how other people organize their vocab list.  Furthermore, I'm thinking that reddit could be a cool place to share lists.  We could create a thread, then everyone just reply to their own posts.  That way you can have your list in there with everyone elses... When you want to see words other's learn, you easily browse their list.  This could also facilitate discussions about specific vocabulary words.

We got into a big fight and I can't stop crying. People don't realize how lucky they are for being able to speak the same language as your parents. Please, kind strangers of the Internet , if someone could take some time to translate this (I know it's long) it would be greatly appreciated

Mom,

Recently, very recently my mood has been very unpredictable. Do you think I've been mean my whole life? I wanted to say 80% of our fights is about how messy our household is and my frustration with not being able to find things. in the fall, I'm trying to take Chinese class!

With my job, I'm learning that everyone wants you to work for free. They never expected a 19 year old intern to do as well as I have shown them. I think I'm very good at what I do. I wasn't even expecting to work for them. I initially Went in for an interview to sell  ice cream at stores for 11$ an hour. During my interview they liked me so much they have me this current position. At work I purposely don't do work because then they will expect more and more. I could do a lot more for them but I feel like my hard work is overseen. I don't think they value me enough. In the past 2 months I've gotten events for them for 15,000 people, and I'm consistently doing impressive work. But they dont show me enough appreciation, and as soon as I'm done doing one thing I'm already being told to do something else. Just this weekend they told me to do a delivery which took an hour just to deliver 3 boxes of ice cream to someone's house. Clearly they do not value my time. I'm very good at what I do, but they never want me to be proud because they don't want to admit I go far beyond their expectations. I do about half the work I am able to do because I don't think they deserve to see me at my full potential.

I feel like dad never listens to me, and is just interested in dropping the argument. I try and tell him a problem but he's so quick to say ""okay I'm wrong"". It doesn't matter if he's wrong I just want him to listen. I try so hard to have conversations with him but his responses are very abrupt and doesn't leave room to make conversation, he just says what he thinks I want to hear.

Mom I don't have anything wrong with you or dad when I say I hate being home. I just really feel trapped with all the messy things. I cannot be physically or mentally at ease. 

I'm sorry I haven't been spending time at home, even for a few years, I think we have a lot of catching up to do.

I read a funny conversation online today asking parents what the weirdest thing they've seen their kids do. Also another one asking what the weirdest thing they've found in their kids room. What's your answer?

I also want to know what you write in your journal. Mom what are your hobbies and what do you love to see and do? I feel like I need more hobbies or else ill be sad

Thank you for being ever so forgiving, as always. I tried to not fight today, I don't know if you could see that or not.

I had a really mature conversation with my friend recently that reflects how far I've come in terms of how I view the world. I think I'm growing up with a very positive outlook.

Her: Life is hard
Me: that's what I always say
Her: It's true. The more I'm alive the more I'm just so done 
Me: it's not so bad
Her: Not usually. But I'm just very tired and I'm still so young. This society is too fast paced to keep up with. It's too twisted to deserve being kept up with 
Me: Idk girl I feel like we don't have much to complain about
Her:But everything is just so damn complicated.  Humanity had to go and give everyone these unrealistically high expectations and make life really expensive to live if you want to do good things like travel and eat well 
Me: Trust me I used to say the same shit but you gain perspective. we are in NYC, you go to one of the best schools in the country, you got to travel recently, you're given all the food and resources you want and you're free to explore one of the best places in the world. I know that we're young but everyone went through the same thing which is one of the many things to look forward to with age. we have so much freedom compared to the rest of the world. people may have dumb perspectives and biased judgement on who deserves to be at the top of the hierarchy, I know. but even at the bottom were luckier than most parts of the world. I used to complain a lot too before I realized how blessed I am. I realized I should change how I see the world bc there's no point in complaining about things you can't change
Her: Cause having to put so much effort into living is draining  Like obviously hunting for food and surviving is draining too, but it's more natural. But I'm conflicted because I do like the pursuit of knowledge and art and things that modern convention have allowed us to pursue. 
Me: No one is forcing you to do anything you pursue learning art and whatever you like BECAUSE you like it. If you think you're putting in all this effort and you're not enjoying it then maybe you need to pick a different path. I work as hard as possible  learning all I can about psychology and I lose sleep all the time but in the long run I really enjoy working hard at something. It kind of sounds like you're just complaining for the sake of complaining which is what i did for like my whole life and what a lot of people do

I'm sorry I don't make enough time to talk and spend quality time with the only Two people that deserve it. I waste all my emotion on people that don't care nearly as much about me as I care about them and not even 10% of how much I know you love me. I realized its easier for me to blame you and get mad at you for things that are my fault. For instance, I get mad at you for not talking to me when it's actually my fault for not being home and always in my room. When I feel bad for you driving me at 2 am you can notice that I get mad and make you feel bad. I thought a lot about my actions and realized it is a mental defense mechanism. I make you feel bad to make you think you owe me a ride. Because I'm mad, you driving me will make me not be mad. How could I be so evil and selfish?

**Edit:** Well thanks everyone for a lively debate. Up-votes all round.

What I learned from this is that it is 晓得 is a very widely understood term throughout China, but it is mostly used in the south, including Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui and others and is the same character in Cantonese. So you need to be able to understand it when others use it. 

It could come up in the HSK, but there is some debate over whether it is Putonghua or not and clearly there are people who strongly think it isn't. It is probably also not a word that will be used on CCTV and it is apparently somewhat informal anyway. So consider your audience and the tone you want to express before using it, or just don't use it.

[**二月二日 天气湿寒**](http://www.kanunu.org/jimmy/BeautifulSolitude/616_61.html)

月亮升起来时，我抹去眼泪。

一只座头鲸，忽然跃出水面，

在我眼前欢快的跳舞唱歌。

但是我为什么仍然无法遏止

心中那源源不绝的悲伤呢？

------

**Èr yuè èr rì Tiānqì shīhán**

Yuèliàng shēng qǐlái shí, wǒ mǒ qù yǎnlèi. 

Yī zhī zuòtóujīng, hūrán yuè chū shuǐmiàn, 

Zài wǒ yǎnqián huānkuài de tiàowǔ chànggē. 

Dànshì wǒ wèishénme réngrán wúfǎ èzhǐ 

Xīnzhōng nà yuányuánbùjué de bēishāng ne?

------

**February Second. Weather: Cold and damp**

As the moon rises, I wipe away tears.

A humpback whale suddenly leaps out of the water,

Cheerfully singing and dancing in front of me.

But why am I still unable to stop

This endless stream of sorrow within me?

------

(1) Note the grammar pattern for **when**: ……时 or ……的时候 or 当……时; note also that 每当……时 means **whenever** … 

(2) The term 座头鲸 comes from Japanese: 座头 is Japanese for [琵琶]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipa), an instrument somewhat similar in shape to the humpback whale. Note also that the first two characters appear in 座头市, which is the Japanese name rendered in English as [Zatoichi]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zatoichi). Some of you may recognize this name from the many blind swordsman movies.

(3) Note also that 只 is the correct measure word for 鲸鱼 (whale). It’s a tough word to figure out the measure word (量词) for, since whales are very large aquatic mammals. 条 or 头 are probably fine too; but 只 is the best.

(4) 跃出水面 means to **leap** (跃) out of the water. A more common saying is 浮(fú)出水面, which literally means **to float up to the surface**, but can also be used more figuratively to mean, e.g., **to emerge.** For example: 真相终会浮出水面的 = **the truth always comes out in the end**

(5) 眼前欢快 should be read as 眼前 欢快; the first three characters form a separate phrase [眼前欢](http://www.nciku.com/search/zh/detail/%E7%9C%BC%E5%89%8D%E6%AC%A2/67793) meaning **fleeting pleasure**, but it is somewhat obscure. 

(6) In English, we tend to say **singing and dancing**; in Chinese, the order is reversed: 跳舞唱歌

(7) There’s a typo in the link, corrected here: 遏制 should be 遏止 (though they are synonyms).

(8) 源源不绝 is a chengyu (four character idiom). Literally, it means **stream source stream source doesn’t end**; thus, its meaning is something like **endless**. I maintained the word **stream** in my translation in order to preserve the poem’s water motif (damp weather, wiping tears, whale in the sea, +stream of sorrow).

&gt;&gt; 從十年青梅竹馬走到悲劇收場

&gt;&gt; 若說原由是個性不合這種官腔說法

&gt;&gt; 其實太過牽強

&gt;&gt; 從青春初期我們一起成長

&gt;&gt; 自然連會笑的點都很像

&gt;&gt; 但再像還是會有不一樣

&gt;&gt; 從小我喜歡歐美的開放

&gt;&gt; 而他嚮往日本的文化

&gt;&gt; 成年開始我們有了不同的方向

&gt;&gt; 說話的頻率還是可以完美的對上

&gt;&gt; 但縱始我們再像

&gt;&gt; 同年紀的我跟他

&gt;&gt; 一男一女社會觀感會使我們變化

&gt;&gt; 隨著年齡往上爬

&gt;&gt; 分層出更多相反的方向

&gt;&gt; 我想我還是愛他

&gt;&gt; 但我清楚也明白

&gt;&gt; 我現在要的

&gt;&gt; 他辦不到也給不了

1348656440.0,6,self.ChineseLanguage,10i1g0,What do you think about Heisig/Matthews mnemotechnic methods?,,7,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/10i1g0/what_do_you_think_about_heisigmatthews/,"Hello;

I would like to ask you your opinion on the Heisig or Matthews methods to memorize Hanzis? 

These methods explain how to use mnemotechnics to learn and remember a very large number of hanzi in a short time. 

For instance: 直 (straight)
Heisig tells us that by combining ""10"" and ""eyes"", we imagine a situation where 5 scientists are discussing whether a line is straight or not (10 eyes are watching the straight line)

Apparently, using this you can learn the 3000 most common hanzi within 2 months, if you're really dedicated.

The critics and complaints I've read about this are:

* It doesn't care about the real etymologie, but rather creates a new one

* It doesn't teaches you the pinyin, only the hanzis.




About me: I am a beginner in mandarin (I started 4 weeks ago), and I've been dedicating all my time to it so far, I am eager to learn, I want to improve fast, but I also want to learn properly.

What do you think?",,False,,t5_2qyz1,1348657203.0,,,True,t3_10i1g0,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/10i1g0/what_do_you_think_about_heisigmatthews/,
