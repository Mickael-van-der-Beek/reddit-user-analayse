1360081622.0,61,self.videography,17xsrd,"10 Quick Tips for Budding HDSLR Wedding Videographers (1st Post: Be Gentle, lol)",rsandelius,68,7,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/17xsrd/10_quick_tips_for_budding_hdslr_wedding/,"Been in the HDSLR wedding videography game for several years now and have been having a GREAT time re-learning videography and building my business, which had previously consisted of photography by itself. Now, HDSLR videography obviously has it's limitations but once you accept them it's actually a pretty awarding way to film weddings. That being said, here's a couple tips that I've picked up over the last couple of years that have made my life much easier and might help you get started and/or become a little more efficient as you go along.

1. Get a monopod. The Manfrotto 561 model is awesome and you'll wonder how you ever shot without it. I sold my expensive shoulder rig after using this support and never looked back. It can double as an impromptu (not super effective, though) steadicam as well, in a pinch.

2. Ceremony coverage (for the most part) should go something like this: Set up your shot. Hit record. Take your hands off of the camera. Keep your hands off of the camera. Did I mentioned keep your hands off of the camera? Fidgeting with the camera every minute will cause a lot of headaches in the post production, so save yourself some time and let the couple's/officiant's actions do the talking. 

3. Don't have the budget for the big-budget, name-brand primes? Look into Samyang/Rokinon lenses. They have fantastic image quality, they're built like bricks and their prices are about 1/4-1/3 of the name-brand equivalent. Trade-off? They're manual focus only, which really isn't an issue since you'll most likely be MF'ing while you're shooting video anyways. 

4. Don't have the budget for a glidecam/slider/follow-focus/etc? Don't sweat it. Good coverage with a solid mix of wide shots, close ups and good audio will always trump those more dramatic shots. 

5. Trying to figure out what to do for your audio gear? Let me give you some suggestions: 
(a) Lavaliere microphone + recorder: Williams sound Mic090 + Zoom H1. I tried the AudioTechnica ATR3350 lav mic, and while it sounds ok it has two downsides: it requires a button battery (which you can't monitor the battery life, so you end up using a new battery for every gig and can be inconvenient to change out) and the 2nd is that it comes with around 25' of cord which is bulky and unnecessary. The Zoom H1 is small, economical, records high quality format(s) and supports the Williams mic, which uses phantom power and is sized perfectly for lav use.
(b) Tascam DR50. It's the new Zoom H4n: cheaper, same functions, and it has a safety feature called Dual Record, which records an audio feed at a normal level + a second track at a set decrement, in case your audio peaks, which helps avoid clipping. Works great for tying into sound boards at ceremonies and receptions. 
(c) Tascam DR5. Perfect for satellite recording/placing on lecterns, near musical performers/speakers, etc. It's too big for a lav recorder and doesn't have enough options to replace the DR40, but it's perfect for an auxilliary/ambient recorder. I usually have 2-3 of these stashed around the room. 

6. Get your exposure/color right in camera. HDSLR video has very little latitude when it comes to color correction, so err on the side of taking the time to nail it in-camera. The rule for shutter speed is double the frame rate (1/50 for 24fps, 1/60 for 30fps, 1/120 for 60fps), but it's not iron: you can speed up or slow it down by 3-4 stops without getting too much noticeable motion weirdness. As for color, start with your presets and stay away from auto white balance. Auto works pretty well if you're in a static location, but if there's ANY mixed light coming in you're going to be in a world of hurt when your colors starts shifting mid-shot. It's a REAL pain to correct... and it's not worth it. 

7. If you're shooting outdoors, plan on using an ND filter, even if it's on a cloudy day. On a brightly-lit summer day, at ISO100 at 1/60sec, you're going to be struggling to get anything lower than F9-F11, which kills the ""cinematic look"" that HDSLR's are so good at. Getting a ND6 filter (B&amp;W, Tiffen, different strokes for different folks) are perfect for bringing your aperture back down to F4 or better. 

8. Avoid gimmicky gadgets. The accessory market for DSLR video is ridiculous. For example, you can easily spend $200-500 on a follow-focus system, which requires a lot of tooling/a platform to mount it to, etc, and the only time that you'll really appreciate that (for weddings) is when you're shooting details, like the ring/flowers, etc. Consider a rubber jar opener as an alternative. $3-4/ea and while they're certainly not perfect, it'll give you an easy &amp; cheap way to easy in and out of focus while you're perfecting your hand-held rack focussing, which is the ultimate end goal. 

9. A couple other gear selection considerations as well:
-Monopod &gt; Shoulder Rig (less fatigue, more useful)
-Rode Videomic &gt; On-Camera Tascam DR40 w/ line-in to camera (in-camera audio is usually used as reference/in a pinch and the difference between what your camera gets and the DR40 gets is negligible. 
-Lowel Pro Light &gt; On-Camera Light (nobody likes a light in their face: it's not flattering, the angle of the light is very harsh, and most on-camera lights have a VERY short light through, so you have to get really close to them.

10. Use off-camera lights. Same reasons as listed above. Turn them on, point them where they need to be (especially during the reception) and leave them be. Invest in a dimmer for your light and slowly ramp it up and down to where it needs to be and nobody will even notice that it's there. Putting the light by the DJ stand helps because people just assume it's part of the DJ set up.

So yeah... just a couple of quick tips to help you get started and to not freak out when you're getting started. 

Like I said in the title, this is my first post, so I'm sure that this is not going to be a front-page trend... but if even just one person gets some use out of this (and learns from what I've learned, then I'm totally happy.

I am not limited to this music I have posted here and I am fairly confident I can create what you might be looking for, weather its dramatic, dark, dissonant, anything. Some things may be more challenging than others, but that's why I'm here and doing this in the first place.

I am also not opposed to any of the music I have posted here being used in your project if you find something you like.

My current gear includes a t3i body i've had for a while, a tokina 11-16mm 2.8 lens, a rokinon 85mm 1.4 lens, a rokinon 35mm 1.4 lens, rode videomic, zoom h1, flycam nano, good manfrotto tripod with fluid head, monofrotto bhdv561 monopod, slider etc. Anyways I feel like I need to upgrade to a 5d soon since I've outgrown my t3i. I've noticed that the 5d mark ii bodies are insanely cheap, only like $1,200 in good condition, as opposed to the mark iii's which dont sell cheaper than ~$2,800. The mark ii seems to be a good upgrade from my t3i, but what do i know. I'm thinking of selling my t3i (for about $400) and the tokina 11-16 (for about $500) and that would basically pay the bulk of a 5d mark ii body. Obviously the tokina is a crop lens so it wouldnt even be worth keeping. I think that the lowlight advantage of the 5d mark ii vs the t3i would be worth the upgrade. I know people say to get insanely good class before full frame, but it's hard to resist, and I have decent lenses. After I get the 5d mark ii (if I got it) I thought I'd save up for the canon 16-35mm 2.8 L lens which I could afford in a couple of months easily. Would this upgrade be advantageous? Of course I'd need to buy new batteries and sell my SD cards for CF cards (im assuming) but that doesnt bother me.

EDIT: Basically what I'm asking is, would it be worth updating from my t3i to a 5d mark ii now, or should i really save up for the 5 mark iii and use my t3i for awhile longer. It'd prob be at least 6-8 months till I could afford a mark iii",,False,self,t5_2qwgz,1361847956.0,,default,True,t3_198enf,http://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/198enf/5d_mark_ii_vs_mark_iii_worth_the_extra_money/,
1351999453.0,15,self.videography,12lhrl,"I've figured out the fastest way to make DVD for live events. It takes about 1-3 minutes. 
",knellotron,20,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/12lhrl/ive_figured_out_the_fastest_way_to_make_dvd_for/,"I do a lot of filming where I would be filming a live event with a 3 camera setup and production switcher. The event would get recorded into a computer for an HD master, but I'd also be recording it to DVD to deliver within minutes. To get that DVD burned, I was using a Pioneer PRV-LX1, a professional DVD recorder released in 2004. It works pretty well. By 'professional,' I mean the quality was good because ours had the SDI input module, which meant we could have a totally digital record path.

Unfortunately, it died last week, so I was in a big rush to get it replaced. I couldn't get the unit serviced, because Pioneer discontinued the unit in 2007, and ceased parts and service in 2010. I then looked at replacement DVD recorders, but I couldn't find one that was really professional quality. All the ones I found had only analog inputs, usually S-Video. Even a Firewire (DV) port wasn't satisfactory, because the 4:1:1 colorspace of MiniDV translates very poorly to DVD's 4:2:0. JVC was the only company that still makes a DVD recorder with a proper input (SDI,) and that unit costs $3500.

So I figured out a better way, using open source software. I wrote a bash script in Cygwin that takes a live HD-SDI input from a Blackmagic or Aja HD-SDI card, encodes it to DVD compatible Mpeg-2, authors the DVD, then burns it, all in realtime. There's about 1-3 minutes in between hitting 'stop' on the recorder and having a completed DVD in your hand. 

[Here's the basic version](http://pastebin.com/egW6bK0b). It's done mostly with ffmpeg. It was originally written on Linux with an HDV camera, but now runs on Windows via Cygwin. It's Windows only because it interfaces with the SDI cards over ffmpeg's DirectShow input filter. I can't get it to work at all on a Mac, but maybe there's still a way. It's very much tuned to my specific setup, so it won't run anywhere else with out some editing right now. I'm working on fixing that, and also a port to Python so I can make a GUI for it.

After I got the script working, I realized that there's got to be a huge demand for this script out there. I've seen a lot of forum posts over the internet that ask for something like this, and leave empty handed. Usually the recommendation for people who want to do this is to get a deck unit, with the price and quality complaints I mentioned. I know a couple churches that have also had Pioneer DVD recorders that died, and they replaced them with crappier units. They'd love to have some of the features that this setup adds.

I also have some 'beta' versions that do a whole bunch more tricks, such as displaying a monitoring window, and simultaneously recording an HD version of the input to ProRes. You can premake menus and extra features in advance, and include them on each disk. I think Blu-Ray authoring is feasible too. 

Any thoughts? I was pretty excited about pulling this off because the consultants said it was impossible.",,False,self,t5_2qwgz,False,,,True,t3_12lhrl,http://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/12lhrl/ive_figured_out_the_fastest_way_to_make_dvd_for/,

This all started with a google search for high dynamic range video cameras and I stumbled into the world of industrial imaging. It makes sense that industries (such as the medical industry) have many uses for high resolution, high dynamic range cameras. A company called Basler has created an affordable solution.

[Here](http://www.baslerweb.com/products/aviator.html) is one of there cameras with impressive stats, and is quoted under $1000. Of course, it is just a box with a sensor, but I figured with a little modification it could work for a videographer. 

It turns out that I'm not the only one thinking this. [Here](https://vimeo.com/30018802) is a test from a company that has taken a Basler camera and modified it for film and television. [Here is a PDF](http://www.baslerweb.com/media/documents/BAS1207_SuccessStory_Easylook_EN.pdf) about the product. You can buy their camera for $6,000, or you can get one directly from Basler and mod it yourself. 

I have no idea how practical this really is, but I thought it was interesting. I guess what was interesting to me is how much more is out there than just Canon/Red/Blackmagic etc..

My son is attending a performing arts high school and has started to get interested in filmmaking (he started there last year in writing). His 16th birthday is coming up and I want to get him a decent starter camera that he can use to film short videos with his classmates and edit them for school.

The computer I set up for him is currently running Linux Mint. I have heard that there are great Non-linear Editing programs on Linux. I can change his OS if there is a better one for editing but I would like to keep him on Linux. I do have Windows boxes too. His school uses Final Cut on Mac.

I don't really know ANYTHING about cameras and hardware considerations/OS considerations. I am a programmer and my hardware experience is aout 10 years outdated so maybe I am worrying about compatibility when I don't have to be?

If this isn't the right place for this can you please point me to where I should ask? Thanks!

TL;DR Need a starter camera for a 16 year old film student. Any recommendations?

EDIT: Thanks for all of your input. I think we are going to wait and buy a better camera we can add on to at x-mas. It makes sense to buy something he can use for the rest of high school instead of just buying something cheap now. If he sticks with it then we can add lenses, etc as he progress. I really appreciate the feedback.

Honestly lighting knowledge in general is one of my weakest areas of video production.

I'll be doing some corporate videos for a company and I need to recommend equipment for them to purchase. We'll mostly be doing a bit of green screen shots and a lot of case study interviews (talking head shots in various offices with room light)... All of these videos are designated for the web and I'm trying to keep their budget reasonable (for example, I'll probably recommend they buy a DSLR to save money as opposed to a more expensive camcorder).  I'll likely be handling all of the video shoots as a one man operation.  I probably just need something simple.

I know LED is far more expensive, but awesome. I've heard Flourescent is less bright, but the bulbs don't get nearly as hot as tungsten (which I guess helps in breaking down the kit quicker). I imagine i'll need a simple kit that has a key light, fill light and back light. There will potentially be a bit of traveling involved so the more portable the better.

Any recommendations? I spent a bit of time looking on bhphotovideo.com, but I could use some advice. If possible, I'd like to give this company a few options, ""Good, better, best"" and let them decide what they are willing to spend.

Thanks in advance for any help.

I know this camera has been announced a while ago and it's not yet released, but It hasn't gotten any love on this sub. 

To anyone who has never heard of it, it's a camera that likely will replace gh2 for many people. 
It has: 


* Focus Peaking that shows the peak of focus in MF and AF+MF mode
* EV -3 - 18 (ISO100 equivalent) AF Detective Range,
* 1080p@60fps video in Extra Tele Conversion (ETC) mode (the GH3 tops out at 1080@30P in ETC),
* 7 fps @16Mpix&amp;AFSingle, 5 fps @16Mpix&amp;AFTracking and 40fps burst mode (versus 6fps@AFS and 20fps in GH3),
* 1,728-zone multi-pattern light metering system (versus 144-zone in GH3),
* Stop Motion Video, Sweep Panorama
* 1,036K dots TFT LCD screen (versus 614K dots OLED LCD in GH3)
* Adjustable HDR mode. While the Panasonic G5/GH3 have an in-camera HDR mode, there is only an On or Off setting with no scope to tone down the effect.
* NFC +better Wi-Fi: The G6 have wireless recording function with start/stop recording and 30fps video stream feed to tablet/smartphone. GH3 can only start recording/no video stream feed.

It's only been a week, but so far:

He sets ridiculously tight deadlines. As if I'm supposed to go home and work on them cause I have nothing else better to do. 

I come up with a simple, elegant idea that he changes into this terribly unfunny mess. 

When we are in meetings, he tells me to stop typing (as I'm taking notes) and look at him. As if he controls where I look.

He wants me to come in everyday from 2-5. But notes how expensive the coffee in the office is (i.e. don't drink it).

His clients are trash. Think companies with ""depot"" in their names.

There is absolutely nothing preventing me from getting these clients myself. Except I wouldn't prospect them because they wouldn't look good on my portfolio.

And, to top it all off, one of our projects is me doing speculative work that the client may or may not pick up. 

I set my priorities, as I am juggling multiple projects at once. And this just isn't one of them. I haven't been to work in 3 days.

As a general rule, a videographer has a standard day rate for any project, and they will charge overtime after eight hours of filming. A standard rate for a day ranges anywhere from 200-1600 dollars based on the production value of the shoot and experience. My day rate is 300 dollars for a standard shoot.

With most projects, editing is usually the most consuming task. For a 2.5-3 minute video, editing can take 2.5-6 hours conservatively. The entry-level rate for an editor is around 25 dollars per billable hour. If your company were to be dealing with a big name production studio, editors may charge anywhere from 200-1000 dollars per hour based on experience. My rate as an editor is 40 per hour. As a rule of thumb, a client is billed for one hour of editing for each minute of the final product. 

I price my projects accordingly. 


EDIT: This is my current portfolio, I never went to school, I've always worked for myself producing videos. I'm really just starting out. I really appreciate this feedback. You can see most of my recent work here: http://vimeo.com/album/1517555

I'm looking for some opinions on items or accessories for less than $100 that are a lot of fun to own or enable you to get some cool shots.

So, if someone has all the equipment he plans on buying for a while and has $100 burning a hole in his pocket, what would you recommend and why?

My examples:

LCD Screen Viewfinder - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005EM6G7U/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1 - Make it possible to see your LCD screen when outside in the sun and helps with focusing. I love mine.

Tripod Dolly - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YB862E/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1 - Cheap, fun, and useful. Don't expect it to be perfectly smooth or act in any way like a legitimate dolly. But the price is low and I have been able to get some nice shots that I wouldn't otherwise be able to get. It works pretty well on hard wood floors, firm carpets, and sometimes even tile (depending on how big the cracks are and how well you handle it).

Hot shoe mounted light - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TJ6JH6/ref=oh_details_o08_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1 - Again, pretty cheap. Helps when you're on the go and can't bring lighting gear. There are several occasions when I just use this guy because it's easy and it works.

After I shoot the video in 720 p 60 fps how do I conform the footage to my 29.97 sequence timebase?  Should i run it through mpeg streamclip?  Will this make the footage slo-mo or do i then need to change the speed in the timeline (I use FCP 7).

I currently work within a company shooting mainly corporate messages, product demos and training videos.  It is time for putting together a budget which is usually decimated, however this time around people are starting to understand how much video costs when getting external companies in to do it.  
So I think I have a good chance of getting approved hopefully a decent amount.  Last year I had about £3-4K to buy equipment, however this year I want to put in a budget proposal that essentially would include what it would cost to kit out a multimedia outfit.

I imagine that the maximum I would be able to get through would be around the £20-25K mark.  So I am looking for advice on what you would do with that money in terms of putting together the key items for a studio, equipment and edit suite.  One thing to bare in mind is that I am a one man production unit so equipment which makes the job easier / faster would go to the top :p

I will list here what I have already bought in previous years:

I shot and edited the video in 2 days, which I'm afraid made the process seem easy. CEO LOVED the video and showed it off to everyone she knew. So it's now assumed that I'll do more.

My only concern is that I don't want my boss and coworkers to think that creating video is an easy task that any young 20something can do. Most of my coworkers are tech illiterate and have no idea of the amount of work that goes into tech related projects. I was once asked if I could create Farmville. I had to explain that it takes MANY highly skilled &amp; paid programers/developers to create an online game such as Farmville.  

My goal is to create enough videos and continue doing so it'll lead to a possible raise or promotion early next year. I'll be saving them a ton of money compared to hiring local video production companies. How can I make my work truly appreciate and understand the work I put into making video?

1369103712.0,9,self.videography,1eqmd0,I am in desperate need of some advice for a huge production I'm in charge of later this summer!,risherwood,10,1,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/1eqmd0/i_am_in_desperate_need_of_some_advice_for_a_huge/,"Hey everyone!

I am in charge of a huge video project later this summer for a conference over the course of about 3 days with about 75 speakers total. In short, my job is to capture static (on a tripod) video of the speakers and edit in a couple slides for each speaker. The catch is there are 4 conference rooms with 4 speakers going simultaneously. Therefore I am in charge of finding 3 more shooters (which isn't a concern for me right now) and the equipment needed to make this thing happen. I'll be bringing my workhorse editing pc to the hotel so that I can ideally get day 1 speakers uploaded sometime during day 2 and so on. Again, all these videos will be very basic. The average length for each of the speakers is ~30 minutes. 

Traditionally I shoot on dslr for clients. I KNOW I am about to get a huge barrage of anti-dslr comments for this type of event because of the record limit. The only reason I am even considering using 4 t2i's despite their foolish record limit is because of their low light performance. At the conference last year, the production company used camcorders that totally fell apart under low light and made all the videos look very grainy and bad. Lowlight performance is a big consideration. It would be VERY nice to have a camcorder that shot in full hd (maybe shooting in 720p would be better for this event?), did well in lowlight, AND had easy to process files in premiere that could be imported/exported very quickly (i can go through h.264 dslr files like butter on my computer). I am looking to rent FOUR setups for the four different conference rooms. I already have a t3i with several good prime lenses (rokinon 1.4's) and a bunch of support/audio equipment. What I'm guessing is that I need to rent three solid tripods (i have my own already), 3 dslrs (with lenses) or 4 camcorders. For audio I was thinking of just using 4 zoom h1's with lav mics on the speakers. I could also slap a rode videomic on each of the cameras as backup. I have never undertaken such a big production, but the client is creative director I have done lots of work with in the past and he is confident I can pull it off. Can anyone help me find the right equipment/workflow?",,False,self,t5_2qwgz,False,,default,True,t3_1eqmd0,http://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/1eqmd0/i_am_in_desperate_need_of_some_advice_for_a_huge/,

I just recently upgraded to my first DSLR after years of shooting with small consumer camcorders.  For the most part I love the results, but while practicing with my T3i to prepare for a larger upcoming project, I realized that several of the shots looked extremely washed out in places, which I can only attribute to overexposure.  (sample: http://i.imgur.com/VDLI9zm.jpg).  

After messing around with the three-way color corrector and RGB curves, it seems that the data in some of the face shots like above might just be unrecoverable.  

Are there any tips for avoiding this sort of thing in the future?  I was shooting at 24fps, so I went with a 1/48 shutter speed, had the iso all the way down to 100, and set the aperture as closed as I could while still maintaining a narrow-ish depth of field, and these were still the results on a relatively cloudy day.  I do plan on utilizing the zebra stripes option on Magic Lantern, but is there anything else you could recommend for avoiding this sort of problem in the future?  Is this what lens filters are for?

I currently own a canon EOS t3i (600D) and have the 18-135 kit lens. This preforms well at the lower end and falls off as you zoom in. This is fine because I'm mostly looking to do simple music videos/short films (still in High school!) So I won't need the zoom factor that much yet. 

I own a cheap steadicamish device and want to be able to use that with a lens that isn't too heavy, and is preferably a prime, which brings me to this Sigma 30mm. 

I've looked it up, read/watched some reviews on it, and I feel like it would be a good choice for things I want to do. Many people say get the ""Nifty-fifty"", but the 600D is a crop sensor (x1.6) DSLR, and I feel it would be too ""zoomed in"" for me.

So, what are your thoughts about this lens? I would most likely be using manual focus, and perhaps magic lantern. Thanks!

I volunteer as a videographer for a nonprofit organization that goes to a lot of events. When I have to take footage of people at their events, I often find myself hesitating to take longer shots because I feel that people despise me for my recording. It's understandable in this modern day and age, but my frequent hesitation is a huge obstacle between me and better footage.

For example, a recent event we did involved children accompanied by their parents. It was obvious that some of the parents didn't want their children to get on video, but I had permission for shooting and my job as a videographer to do so. Either way, I usually got nervous and cut my clips short because I felt people deterring me. I just felt nervous.

Ever since I discovered recording video on the Nikon D90 back in 2009, video has since peaked my interest. I would always dabble in film as a hobby but am starting to get more serious with it.

I bought a Canon 7D in 2010 and just recently sold it, hoping to invest in a camera that can further my videography.

I was initially going to get a video camera, looking mainly at the Canon XF105. I wanted a camera that had HD-SDI output should I ever need that in the future. The one thing that I didn't like was the $2900($2600 used) price tag and only 10x zoom.

So I looked back at dslrs. My dream was a full frame cam, 1080p60 or 60i, with manual audio with headphone jack. Well, I couldnt find any full frames with 1080p60p or 60i. I then started to look at the GH3. It has all the features I want except no full frame. 

At this point in time I am leaning towards getting a panasonic gh3 for these reasons. I realize I'm not a professional videographer(...yet) so why invest in a super expensive camera right now if im still honing my skills and edits. The dslr may not be a true video camera but I love the versatility of having dof, beautiful time lapses, as well as all the video features in one package. 

With that said, I feel the gh3 is the product im looking for. Any advice from fellow videographers would be greatly appreciated. 

I film mostly action sports and am looking to get into the more documentary lifestyle side of sports and actually telling a story through a video. Here are some links to some of my recent work. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

* Small Sennheiser lav receiver
* Zoom H4N
* 1/8"" to 1/4"" audio cable (x2)
* Extra AA batteries (x8)
* 2-3 CF cards
* Extra SD Card
* Small flathead/phillips combo screwdriver (3-4"" long)
* Pen/paper
* Lens caps

Nice to haves:

* GoPro Hero2 with LCD backpac
* Extra battery
* 3-4 SD Cards
* Charging cable
* Handlebar mount
* Tripod mount
* Headphones hook

He needs the audio to be as clear as the video so that anyone speaking in the boardroom will be accurately heard.

He has a pretty hefty budget for this, though obviously savings are great, and his highest priority is that the ""old board members"" can operate it flawlessly without calling me.

We filmed and edited a video for a client we met on Model Mayhem, a low paid job but a trade off for experience in a new field and it was fairly local to us so we didn't mind so much. 
So we had two short days of shooting on location and edited a short motivational video to his specifications (he knew exactly what he wanted for the overall feel of the video and we filled in the rest), it took us a little longer than we would have liked due to other work commitments but he knew this would happen. 

All the time we spoke about the video he had a song in mind for the background, we knew it was a great song, however it wasn't copyright free and we didn't want to risk it. We all agreed we would find a copyright free song we could use to the same effect and he seemed fine with that, we sent him a couple of drafts and tweaked a few things for him and considered him re-recording his monologue and sending that to us as we weren't 100% happy with the audio. We didn't hear from him for another week so kept working on it and sent him our final version yesterday, we were pretty happy with it.

This morning he replied and told us he had already uploaded and released the video on his own youtube. He had re-recorded his monologue and used the non copyright free song instead of the song we'd edited the video to and uploaded it to youtube, where it now has almost 200,000 views in the two weeks its been up. He didn't tell us he was doing this and now we're not entirely sure how to feel about the whole thing. 

If the question of copyright comes into play here, who would be responsible for this? We're releasing our official video on our Vimeo and possibly YouTube on our own channel so we can show future clients as we're happy with the work, but we're really annoyed that he did that behind our backs and didn't say a thing about it. We'd just bought the song and probably wouldn't have bothered spending that money if we knew he would do this. Does anyone have any idea where we stand with this? 

For those interested, his version can be found here. It looks a little disjointed because of the music swap. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0mh0f6Ldug

A non-profit church that I help out purchased a [Canon GL 2](http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/camcorders/professional_camcorders/gl2) for filming videos for the church community.

Their goal is to simply create ""how to"" videos for the church ministries, or to create ""promotional"" material for those church ministries.

The problem is that I'm the only one with any experience regarding film that helps out with the committee.  

Compounded on that is the GL2 is a miniDV format, and *absolutely no one* has a computer with firewire, nor the processor to handle the import from analog to digital.

So - should we ""upgrade"" to a newer camera that has a more friendly interface (particularly regarding the analog-to-digital formatting)?  Or do we just need to spend money on a computer that can handle the GL2 and suck it up?

Is the GL2 really that good of a camera as it seems?  It's still retailing for close to $2800.  But with lack of experience (and not many good tutorials), we're at a loss.

Any advice would help!

The question I'm asking is, has anyone really experimented with HDV tapes? Are the picture qualities good or on par with that of digital HD camcorders? Is the transfer process relatively easy (I'm tech savvy enough to figure it out, but wish to not have to jump through endless hoops each time I want to transfer). Because I will ultimately be transferring the tapes to digital media so that I can edit, its important that the transfer process be relatively lossless and straightforward.

I know many of you will scoff at the notion of choosing a GoPro over a new lens, but I think the GoPro would allow me to get some great shots because of how small and versatile it is. However, a new lens would be great to improve the existing visual quality I have. In particular I was looking at the Tamron AF Di II VC 18-270 PZD, because I seen this video with the 550d:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wY2ynTUQlUA

I need to replace this system with a camera that provides similar fps AND better colors, manual control and the ability to zoom while recording video. Our budget is around $5,000.

I got a call from a guy I've done a bit of work with in the past. I don't love working for him, but I could use the money and it wouldn't be that tough of a gig. However I don't have the equipment needed, nor do I know anyone personally who does. I'm looking to see if any of you guys have an idea to make this situation work.

The gig is for three cam ops (me being one) shooting a 2 hour music concert. He wants to be able to run all three cameras the length of the show, and jam time code once at the top of the performance. He is very insistant that none of the show is missed by any of the cameras. This is definitely the job for an Hd camcorder. Problem is, all I own is a 60d, and everyone I work with has cannons as well. I do mostly interview and roaming on the shoulder event stuff, not long form live events. So i don't have the equipment, or really know what to use.
The pay is low enough (~$350/per) that if I rented anything out, it'd cost most of my day rate thus negating the work in the first place.

I'd rather not go through the trouble of finding three people and handing them off for the gig if it means I don't work it myself, or get anything out of it. (this contact is not my favorite, and the guys I'd give the work to would be strangers, selfish I know, but oh well)

I offered a solution of running four DSLR cameras with onboard sound for reference. I would shoot two on the wings and two in the center. than, between the center cameras I could ensure that one would be rolling at all times, so as though not to miss anything. Than he could take all the footage, upload to FCPx which he uses, and sync multicam to the audio and voila -he has two hours of usable footage. 

Is this a reasonable solution to the problem? Yes the cameras would miss pieces of the performance, but in the end you would have at least two angles rolling at any given time. And I feel with FCPx and multicam sync, your data management wouldn't be too terrible as compared to having three long clips.

If I leave without any of the footage, I will have literally nothing to show for this experience. In order for me to obtain any of the footage, I'll have to contact them and then they'll send it to me with watermarks (these are my own videos, mind you). Despite the fact that they don't have the technical know-how to watermark videos, this really isn't feasible. I guess I'm wondering what you guy's would do.

So far I have been enjoying learning the differences ISO, focal lengths and aperture can change a photo (I am mostly a writer so please forgive me if I sound a little naive).

So on my way to work I pass a equipment rental store and I would like to rent some lens to get a better idea of what they can/cannot do in a shoot.

So if there are some guys you would recommendations, advice or conversations about DSLR's let me know!

It's tough, because this isn't the normal, everyday use of a camera. Most people won't really focus on a camera's ability to stream from their HDMI connection. I'm looking for cameras that are able to live stream from their hdmi connection. I will be using ustream to stream the events live.

The setup that my friend has contains a souped up computer with a lot of black magic cards and 4 Sony Handycam HDR-CX210s, plus he streams using Vidblaster, which he then connects to a mac mini that is the actual computer that streams. There is also live commentary throughout the tournament, so they have headsets, soundboard, headphone amp, etc, but I have that area covered.

I basically have to start from scratch. I have a decent knowledge of working around a computer, but I'm nowhere near being a ""guru."" 

All the items in the list below come from the research that I've done over the last few weeks, but I'm just not sure if this is the absolute best options, since I'm very new to the live streaming aspect/programs.

Here's the list that I've come up with from the internet connection to the cameras.

Modem: Linksys WRK54G

Ethernet Cable: I have a 25 foot one, but I would like to find a 50 or 100 foot one that would be on the cheaper side like this: http://www.amazon.com/BLACK-100FT-PATCH-ETHERNET-NETWORK/dp/B001AVW6BO/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF

Computer: I figure I'll need to get a desktop for this project. I'm sure I'll have to add an HDMI in card. I was looking at this computer, but it's a bit on the pricey side - http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=3988232&amp;CatId=114 . I'm not sure if this is overkill, not enough, just right, etc. The price ($870) is fairly on the expensive side for what I'm budgeting. If anyone has any suggestions, I am open to them. I have a decent monitor, a mouse, and a keyboard, so I only really need the PC. In order to stream the HDMI signal, I'll need something similar to the black magic card, but I cannot afford $1000 for one. If anyone could offer a suggestion.  I saw that there is a black magic intensity pro card that's $200, but that's still on the expensive side. 

HDMI Cables - I know I'll need a lot of these. For the final matches, I'm sure that I'll be putting a few cameras down lane, so I'll have to have a lot of cables.  I figure I can get like 5 of these and some couplers so that I can lengthen to suit. http://www.amazon.com/HDMI-Cable-50-FT-15/dp/B000QKKAPE/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363291691&amp;sr=8-2  I also know I'll need some HDMI to mini-HDMI adapters, so I'll most likely get cables and couplers so that an adapter isn't weighting the mini-HDMI plug in from the camera.

Cameras - These are the kind that they use: www.amazon.com/Sony-HDR-CX210-Definition-Handycam-Camcorder/dp/B006K550PY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363288201&amp;sr=8-1  If anyone has any suggestions as to similar cameras there aren't as costly that offer the same functionality (or a website with some deals) that would be great. I'm trying to keep it around $350 for 3 cameras to start.

HDMI Switcher - I figure that this would suit my needs for switching between the cameras. I can use the remote to switch between the cameras.  All the audio will come from the commentary and an ambient microphone, so I don't have to worry about the audio from the HDMI cables. Also, would I be able to buy two of these and connect the output of one to the input of another, thus expanding my HDMI capabilities to six cameras if I should ever expand to that many cameras. http://www.amazon.com/Monoprice-Enhanced-Switch-Equalizer-REV-3-0/dp/B002J10W74/ref=sr_1_1s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363246168&amp;sr=1-1

From the HDMI Switcher, I'm hoping that I can plug in the cameras to make it from three HDMI connections into one HDMI connection.  I figure that ustream will allow me to select the hdmi input from my computer so that I can stream from the HDMI connections. One of the concerns that I have is that I am wanting to 1) record the streams 2) put the logos of my sponsors (maybe a way to put messages) on the screen while I am broadcasting.

Thank you for reading. I appreciate any help that you all are able to provide.  I'll respond back to any questions as soon as I possibly can.

I went to the market yesterday to test out my new kit, and made my first DSLR video. Any and all feedback welcome.

https://vimeo.com/56875684

Some notes:

* I've been making corporate 'DIY how-to' videos for a couple of years but have always worked with Z1/EX1/XF300 type equipment. I used to set everything to full-auto and point and forget about it.

* However I wanted to move into world of DLSR videography and actually be able to make visually engaging videos too.

* So I got a 5D3 two weeks ago and have been teaching myself the basics from scratch. 

* It was just me at the market so there is very little point to the video. It's just B-roll and music.

I don't have a budget limit but I'm going to have to justify any money I spend. So i should probably keep it under 1000 but that's not a hard limit.

The camera can't primarily connect by firewire.  Because i have no foresight, the new linux box i built has no firewire connector and neither does the server PC.  Also i would like something that will preform in a dark environment.  We occasionally use black lights and florescent paint in our videos.

I have included our youtube page if you guys want some better ideas of the videos we make. Any help you guys can provide would be awesome.

http://www.youtube.com/user/TSGPhysics

**Edit 1:** thanks for the replies. 1000 is the limit on our p-cards but if I'm not going to get everything i want of 1000 i can fill out all the paper work and get the department office to order it.

So we have both a Panasonic Lumix Dmc-FZ18 and a Canon vixia HV30. The vixia still shoots to mini dv cassettes and uses a firewire cable to transfer the raw video to one of our Macs. This is the one i was looking to replace / upgrade. I would normally just buy a new mother board with a firewire port on it for 200 but firewire is being phased out in even apple the new apple hardware.

I guess i should have ask does it make more sense to get a DSLR or an HD camcorder?

Sorry i'm kind of a camera / camcorder novice

**Edit 2:** I should say we have plenty of audio equipment which we are slowly learning how to use.  Here's an example that hasn't made it to youtube yet.

Recently Ive just got back into film making, partially as a hobby, but now with my new form of study looking to get into making more professional projects. Now I know that the film maker is more important than the gear, and that decent gear will not make a decent film - however, I feel that there are certain things that will definitely aid me in my quest to make a more professional looking film!

In any case, my main question is what is a decent DSLR slider that isn't too expensive - my budget being around £100-150. On amazon I have found the opteka for around that price, but the reviews are mixed and im undecided.

Im thinking of, in combination with a slider, purchasing a manfrotto 055xprob tripod and a 501 hdv fluid head, if that makes any difference to your reccomendations - and my camera is the 550d. I won't be using many heavy lenses, primarily the 50mm 1.8, 10-20mm sigma, and the 70-300 tamron, maybe bringing in a rode videomic aswell.

So any advice/reccomendations is highly appreciated!

I've nixed the camcorder idea, based on my in-depth knowledge of using DSLRs and the fact I need a more advanced one anyways. I bought an EOS-7D after I saw a refurbished one at Adorama at a price too low to pass up. The EOS-7D is going to be really useful for the amateur sports photography I occasionally do, in addition to being a lot better handling that the Rebel T1i I currently have. Also, it has a pretty good HD video capability that will meet my needs for my pseudo-documentary. 

So, currently on my list of things I am thinking of getting are the [Tascam DR-40](http://amzn.com/B005NACC6M) to feed mics into for sound, a [clapper](http://amzn.com/B00126XT5E) to assist in clip organization and sound synchronization, a [Flashpoint Cool Light 4](http://www.adorama.com/FPCL4K.html) for lighting, and this [Shure SM58 combo pack](http://amzn.com/B00105V5MQ).

I am planning on doing mainly fixed shots indoors, so I'm starting to wonder how much of what I am thinking of getting I will actually need. I was thinking of getting a shotgun mic, but I'm realizing that for indoor shots there will be a limited amount of background noise. Also, I can set up the mic not far out of the shot, and if I have more than one person speaking near each other, I would need two shotgun mics to get both people, as opposed to one cardioid to record both. Lastly, I am thinking that just one set of lights may not be such a hot idea if I want to get balanced lighting, especially as the Cool Lights are daylight-balanced fluorescent and will not even come close to color balancing with household tungsten or CFL. Would I be better off getting multiple less powerful cool lights (such as two of [these](http://www.adorama.com/FPCL1A.html)) if I am going to get portable lighting?

EDIT: I'm now thinking that a cardioid mic is actually not right for most of the sort of filming I want to do, due to the lack of range. I'm thinking that lavalier mics might do the trick, but what I'd really like is something directional that has a response pattern like a cone, which I can point at the subjects from just off-camera, or next to the camera for closer shots. Also, I think I'll be mainly using available light for a more natural effect.

EDIT #2: I think some people are misunderstanding my goals and methods here. I'm not making a film for public release, and I can't hire someone to work with me. My goal is to make a nice-looking no-budget edited home video/pseudo-documentary that is at least a few steps up in quality from home movies made with just a basic consumer camcorder, and the method will consist of me as a one-man volunteer ""filming and production team"", with occasional help from friends with transport and setting up gear. 

EDIT #3: Now considering [this LED light](http://amzn.com/B002SWKK4E), mainly for its portability, seeming compatibility with my light stands, and the ability to adjust the color temperature. I am worried though that the price to light output is very poor. If I'm going to use portable artificial light, it needs to be both easy to transport and capable of being balanced with tungsten light while still giving good light output. Also, I'm looking for recommendations for a microphone with a cone-shaped receiving pattern.",,False,self,t5_2qwgz,1339433115.0,,,True,t3_uuz0m,http://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/uuz0m/assembling_a_videography_gear_set/,

I use a 5D Mark II with a selection of lenses, which is also what I would like to use for this project. Photo Tripod for steady shots is covered as well.

Now, what else will I need (realistically)? I would guess a microphone on the camera, maybe a steadycam?

so, I'm working at LAN event live stream, which will be streamed to twitch.tv.

My idea of the set-up for this is:

* streaming with XSplit software

- using 2 HDMI/component cameras - 1080p (full HD)

- commentators PC connected with HDMI to BlackMagic Intensity Pro capture card

- using 2 Wi-Fi connected cameras - 720p

- sound from commentators going to audio mixer connected with USB to streaming PC

The problem is I'm not sure how should I connect that two HDMI or component cameras to my PC, I'm looking for best and cheapest solution!

As I'm not sure will it work to stack 3 PCI-E BlackMagic Intensity capture cards into PC, selecting 1st card as HDMI with audio for PC connection, 2nd card as HDMI for full HD camera, 3rd card as component for full HD camera video. 

As I saw that BlackMagic has one control panel for selecting one source at a time!

Will XSplit or any other live streaming software realize that I have 3 different sources (physical capture cards) and not only one (because of the same brand, name = same capture cards)?

Does anyone has any good solution for this?

Also, don't forget about USB 3.0 BlackMagic capture cards, and how will stacking work with them too??

These cards doesn't have to be BlackMagic, but I took them as an example!

I'm a still photographer and was asked to do video and stills for an event tonight. I've done video before but not an event. It's indoors and it's a drag show where there will be lip-syncing etc, loud and proud, bright lights and what not. I'll have a 3 camera setup for video, one stationary camera and two run and guns. One of the run and guns will also be used on a 6ft jib for when the performers enter the stage, allowing the 2nd run and gun and stationary to pick up what the jib camera can not. We will not be able to plug into sound, I have a zoom H1 and am now sure how to handle the sound aspect seeing as it will probably be very loud. We will also be doing some interviews with the queens, I'm looking to do that BEFORE the show however.

She is obviously interested in some media production for it, and I told her I did media way back when and jokingly said if she doesn't want to hire a film crew I'd be happy to talk with some friends of mine for a refresher and do it myself. Turns out she isn't quite ready (i.e. doesn't have the resources) to hire a professional film crew and fly them out to Uganda for 8 days.

* What kind of camera will I need? (Has to be somewhat small, and fairly rugged, while still producing a high level of quality)
* How much film should I be prepared to take?
* Should I bring any Glidecam or Steadicam equipment, or just a tri- or mono-pod?
* What lighting equipment will I need/can I take?
Keep in mind the equipment I do decide to bring needs to be pretty compact, as I'll be the one carrying it on the trek.

I have been out of videography for some time, but was pretty serious about it back in high school, so I have a very very mild background. I had a knack for decent shots and good editing, but never pursued anything in college.

I often find myself doing short arc, track and dolly type shots. [Here is an example](http://youtu.be/1U8WxQZ9QEQ)

When I want to be super mobile I just use a 5DM3, a Zacuto Zfinder and go three points of contact. I typically plant my feet and move my upper body 2 or so feet to get the shot that I want.

However they are never as steady as I want them and often have to resort to Premiere's Warp Stabilizer to get what I want. As in the above example.

I was thinking of using a monopod and a ball head to give me the shots that I want but with that fourth point of contact for much increased stability. 

My questions are:
Is there anything wrong with this idea? My Google Fu seems weak on this one - perhaps I'm using the wrong terminology.
Have I chosen the right kit?

I was thinking of [this monopod](http://www.manfrotto.co.uk/fluid-video-monopod-with-head-560B-1) paired with [this head](http://www.calumetphoto.co.uk/eng/product/giottos_ball_head_series_ii_with_quick_release_10kg_/755-001b). 

Already have a [Manfrotto 701 head](http://www.manfrotto.co.uk/pro-fluid-video-mini-head) in my kit for tripod duty. I suppose I could use that head with the monopod but its only two degrees of movement. I imagine I would need a ball head for three degrees of movement?

Any and all advice appreciated.

I'm mostly a noob, but am willing to learn; Good cinematic videos (shallow dof, etc) is more important for me, but nice photos is a plus.

Where I'm at right now:
-Canon T4i (650D): Seems to be a good compromise, and easy to use. But the autofocus (STM) lenses seem expensive &amp; not so great (slow AF). 

-GH2: Has been praised many times here for the videos; but I have a weird feeling that you need to spend a lot of money on good lenses to get what you'd get on canon (like Voigtlander 25mn f0.95 at $1k)
Photos aren't supposed to be great, but; eh.

-Canon 5Dmk2; wasn't part of my initial plan, but it's quite cheap now, at $1500 new on Amazon (dropped $1000 in the last year); Is it the perfect moment to buy it? Are the advantages of full frame really worth it? Will it allow me to spend much less on lenses vs. the options above?

I guess my question is, what's the best setup from scratch (inc. lenses) from 1000 - 2000$ to be able to make cinema-like movies (Just talking about image quality here, I know I'll have to invest in sound down the road :-/ )

Suggestions?

If there are any objections, speak now or forever hold your peace.",Plazm,6,0,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/13pvh8/settling_on_the_5d_mkiii_as_my_first_upgrade_to/,"So I've been shooting on my trusty VX2100 for the last 6 years. I do everything from event videography to corporate stuff. Since February, I realized I sorely needed to upgrade to HD. Since then, I've researched as much as possible about my options. 

I decided that the DSLR world really appeals to me for a number of reasons. Form factor, interchangeable lenses, sensor size, ability to also take stills (photography is a hobby I'd like to explore.)

I've honestly spent hours upon hours researching everything from Sony, Canon, Lumix, Nikon etc. For some time I was settling on the 60D or GH2/3 but I really want that full-frame sensor.

From the beginning, I fell in love with the look of the Canons. There's just something inherent about that look I haven't seen replicated anywhere else. Plus the ecosystem seems great.

I waited patiently since August I held out to see what the new FF offerings from Sony, Canon and Nikon would bring (A99/VG900, 6D and D600 respectively.)

The A99 (which I was really holding my breath for) video functionality seems underwhelming from what I've read, the VG900 is apparently not that great, the 6D is supposedly disappointing as is the D600 in some regards.

So I think I've settled on the 5D MKIII. I have a budget of $5000 for the body, some lenses, some NDs, a shotgun mic and a stabilization system.

Do you think the 5D would hold me over for the next few years or it somewhat close to be being old news?

I know some of you will recommend I just go for a large chip video camera to begin with the closest one to my budget would be the FS100 which would be about the equivalent of $8000 without any lenses or accessories (I'm in South Africa, things are more expensive here.) and I've heard there're a lot of niggles on that camera.

But really what I'm basing my decision on is the look of the 5D. Pixel peeping and line-skipping aside, from the countless other videos I've watched from different cameras I just haven't been as impressed as I have been with the Canon.

I'm planning on making the purchase before the end of the year. Are there any thoughts? Am I making the right decision or blowing a whole lot of $$$?
 
For those who own the camera, what are your thoughts - how relevant will it be four or five years from now?

Excuse the vent, and thanks for any advice. :)

**TL;DR - 5D MKIII for 90/10% videography/stills - yay or nay?**

Edit 1: I generally shoot full manual all the time, so I'm not too fazed about the DSLR learning curve.

Edit 2: This probably deserves its own thread, but seeing as I have your attention I might as well ask here. :P

I have a lightweight Velbon CX686 tripod and a ProAim 2' slider. I've never been able to get decent slider shots because when the slider's on the tripod and the camera's on that, the slider tends to slant quite noticeably when the camera's on either end of it which is just yucky. I'm going to need another tripod too. Any recommendations that won't kill my wallet too much? Would a tripod with a head that's separate from the legs make any sort of difference in sorting out that issue with the slant?

We do media production and we wear many hats. We do all types of video, weddings, commercials, corporate videos, whatever the need is we are there to film it. We have been in the industry and have been working with video for several years, but recently have started flight into profitville. We are still not in the air yet though. We recently leased a ""studio"" close to home where we no longer have to have our business where we sleep and we can seriously start doing work. In just one month we have done a few videos with our church, a commercial that will have a local spot on a cable channel as well as online, we have a youtube show and we filmed a rather large wedding. We have a few more things lined up before the month is over and every day is a 12 hour day. I still have a day job, but my husband is fully self employed. We have recently invested quite a bit of money into equipment to go head-on in the wedding side of the company. We have 2 t2i's and a cannon XF100. We have 2 cranes, a shoulder rig, lots of audio equipment, lights and heavy duty tri-pods. We have very talented photographers that work with us as well. 

I truly love the wedding side to our company...to be a part of someone's happiest moments of their lives is such a blessing. I love the fast paced, think on your toes, get creative, capture the moment...and then after a week of editing seeing the result and enjoying the moment again, set to montage music, its priceless. At the end of a long day I end it satisfied knowing that their video is in good hands with our team. 

Some people would totally freak out with such a large responsibility of wedding videography and photography, but I love the challenge, the adrenaline in the moment, its true clarity for me. So much better than a mundane sit down all day, type till your fingers bleed, thank you for calling, boring day. I love my job...

Our end goal is much more grand than I can see right now, but I know our hard work will not be in vain.

No matter how much I play with the bitrate or other settings on various popular compression programs, I can never get such efficient compression.

Just as an example, here I have a 4-minute 1080p video straight from a DSLR that's over 1GB, and even after finding the optimum settings (~6Mbps) I can only get it down to around 250MB. Four minutes. 1080 doesn't compare to 720 but you get the point and I've had instances where the terrible MB/second ratio is present. That's unacceptable. Shit, I'm sure most videos on the popular sites like Vimeo and YT don't accept obscene ratios like that.

I've always liked recording events and such and then editing the videos after.

I've only used Windows Movie Maker, I know it's not that great of a program for professional videos, and I know I'll have to get Adobe Premiere and learn that later.  I'm a Windows user and loathe Mac's and don't want to use their video editing software.

I think I've got a pretty good grasp on making decent videos but I know there's a lot that I do now know and a couple of classes would do me good.

I'm thinking about recording weddings and events for the career part.  My wife is an aspiring photographer and likes doing family and wedding photos, so we would eventually have our own company that combines the two.

So finally to my questions:

1. What kinds/types of classes are there that I can take? Should I take them at a university or like an arts college?

2. I've been meaning to buy a new camcorder because mine IS IN NO WAY good enough for professional services.  So should I buy an HD prosumer camcorder and upgrade later or go ahead and by a professional one?

3. What types of accessories are there for what I want to do or some that I should look into?

4. Since I want to learn Adobe Premiere would it be best to get a book, look at video tutorials on YouTube, or take a class somewhere?

5. Are there any websites or good forums, besides here of course :-), that I can look into that can maybe show me what I may be getting myself into or have weekly challenges that I can challenge myself to get better?

6. If you don't like Adobe Premiere what other video editing software is out there that you would recommend?

As far as the classes go I live in the DFW area of Texas and would like to stay around here if you of anything around here.

Anything else you can think of please let me know.  Any help is appreciated!!",,False,self,t5_2qwgz,False,,default,True,t3_pfkcp,http://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/pfkcp/thinking_about_going_into_videography_for_a/,

I'm now in a school video club, and will become head of the club next year when the seniors graduate.

I immediately went to the key of the test and found Film &amp; Video Production, number 946.  I filled in the ""potential major"" box accordingly.  Until this moment, I had never considered film as a career or really a future, it just seemed like a hobby until then.  But this has me puzzled.  Should I just go to conventional college at a university (I can get into most universities, as I have a 3.8 GPA) and aim for the ""highest ranked"" university, or should I pick a school with a killer film program and start there?  Video is my passion, but I'm not sure if going to Film School will close options for me later in life.

Then he had the idea of me doing a wedding video, and I declined  again, but he persisted and said he just wanted something small, and that he would understand if it didn't work out. So I said, why the hell not, the kid is only 18, so I don't think the marriage will last forever, so we will have another go later on in life. (I married young and it didn't work out, so I like to poke fun at him about getting married young..)

Anyways, I've only been to two real weddings in my life, but I have watched some wedding videos, and even some how-tos from stillmotion and some other sites. the thing is I'm doing this solo and don't have access to a lot of gear, and I'm not getting paid enough to invest in any extra gear, but I do have access to some canon lenses that I can ""borrow"" from work.

what I do have:
canon 5d mark 2 with 24-105L
a decent tripod with a decent fluid head
a cheap monopod that I could put the fluid head on, a shitty ball head, or use it straight on
a roland voice recorder, and a shotgun mic that I don't think works very well
a gorillapod mini-tripod that had that ball head.
a crappy shoulder/chest mount that is in the mail and I haven't used yet

from work I can use
canon 50 1.4
canon 70-200 f4 IS (maybe the 2.8 non-IS)
canon 40 2.8 stm
canon 100 macro 2.8 non-L

basically I work at a retailer, and those lenses are either demo's or open boxes that I can just buy, use and return without upsetting anyone (since they are already ""used"") I would also be able to buy some higher end consumer camcorders, gopro hero 3 black, and maybe another DSLR, but I would have to pay out of pocket until I return it.


My plan, was to use the monopod to move from place to place and get everyone doing their meet and greets before the ceremony, then stand near the back centre (out of the way of the photographer -they are more important) and use the 70-200 on the monopod (or tripod?) and go back and forth and get shots of the groom and bride as they are doing vows, while having the recorder sitting upfront taking in them talking. I would prefer and over the shoulder shots, but they I would either only get the bride OR groom, unless I ran back and forth which may be a little obtrusive.

Then at reception, just a lot of B-roll of everyone eating and talking, then first dance and throughout the evening. I was thinking of 50mm 1.4 (for low light) on the shoulder mount for stability (or use the monopod?)

maybe I'll get the macro with the fluid head on the monopod to do faux sliding shots of the decor, church, food, little things for more b-roll footage.

I only want to make like a 5-10 minute thing, I don't think it really needs to be longer or no one will bother watching the whole thing.


one thing I worry about with getting different lenses is switching them out, I don't really want to carry an extra body or two (i know it's a good to have backup anyways, but budget)

I do a lot of corporate work on my canon 6d dslr and am in a bit of a pickle. I have recently gotten enough money (about ~$1600) for a lens of my choice. I have already a lot of money invested in audio equipment, stabilization, etc so I'm pretty sure I want a nice lens. Not sure exactly which canon L series lens to go for. Currently I have a tokina 11-16mm 2.8 (made for crop sensors so its a little soft in the corners even at 16mm), the rokinon 35mm 1.4, and the rokinon 85mm 1.4. I do lots of slider shots for my work and was thinking that since my tokina was made for a crop body (and a little vignetted) it would be best to get a wide angle lens to replace it. Currently, I'm leaning most toward a canon 24mm 1.4 L lens which is about $1,550 and it would replace my tokina for wide shots (glidecam, slider, etc). I was thinking that if I did this I'd probably also sell my rokinon 35mm and replace it with a canon 50mm 1.4 for now (because 24mm and 35mm seem to close to each other in terms of focal distance).

I've always enjoyed filming things. Sceneary, cars, sports, cooking, etc.  I took on a persona and invested money in a Sony CX760v and this was just 1 year 8 months ago.   

You can't even buy that camera anymore and I feel like I'm sitting with a paperweight, partially because it can't be bought, maybe because it's not the newest on the block, who knows.   Anyway, I bought 4 lights (not really expensive) a handheld mic, a tripod, all kinds of extra things to make either a documentary, or further this other persona of me.  

I would like to put 2 links please.  One is to something Sony did and it says they are filming with the CX760v, 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUvFOPbfzTs&amp;t=1m20s

and this link is me filming with my 760v

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xabtv6_CBE4&amp;t=0m18s

My question to anyone out there is, you can see how the top link of filming looks like its a movie or TV possibly in the mold of ""CSI"" and the bottom one (mine) looks like ""married with children""  I'm probably not saying this right, but I want my work and shows/filming to have that look of any other TV show/Movie as opposed to the look of a ""married with children"" or ""America's Got Talent""   

Is it my frame rate?  Is it something else, what can I do to obtain something that doesn't have a ""live"" feel to is and more of a produced movie/tv show feel to it.

Thanks, and sorry for the wall of text,  I'm new and frustrated, there aren't classes here where I am to get better and I can't afford to go to a film school for weeks or months.

Take care everyone.

Sometimes I'll keep the raw footage.

The problem I'm having is that these files are huge.  Each of the video files is like 10-20GB in size.  I have a nice huge hard drive but I'd kind of like to recover some of this space, especially for the older videos that never get back orders or anything that I'm unlikely to ever really need again.  

So I'm wondering what a good format for storing these is that will preserve most of the quality in case I ever needed to go back and use it, while keeping the size down (maybe 2-3GB a video?)

However I don't have a huge budget and it doesn't seem as though usb 3.0 is fast enough for that. Is it best to keep os and programs on my 120 ssd, leave my old 1tb wd green drive alone since its almost full, use my new 2tb wd black drive for projects (I'd make a new folder for each project and i'd include the project file, assets, footage, and scratch disk), and use the 1tb wd black drive for final exports? So far I've just been backing up to my external 1tb hard drive. I'm a little lost in a sea of hard drive questions. I'm not necessarily looking to buy more drives, simply utilize the ones I already have now.

Recorded audio with a basic handheld unit (tascam dr-05) set to .wav format.  Added audio into adobe premiere and synced it up. Exported to vimeo and  everything works great...except it wont play on smartphones. ipad's work, iphones dont. Im either going to have to reshoot this video, which i dont want to have to do, or if someone can figure out how to make it work, it will save me a massive headache.

Heres what ive tried:
change settings on dr-05 to mp3 -&gt; record something random -&gt; add into premiere -&gt; export to vimeo... it works on mobile
convert original wav to mp3 and add into premiere... doesnt work on mobile
play audio through soundcard -&gt; headphone jack connected to cable connected to mic jack on dr05 (set to mp3) -&gt; import into premiere -&gt; export to vimeo... doesnt work on mobile
convert original wav to mp3 -&gt; burn onto audio cd -&gt; import audio track through itunes -&gt; bring into premiere -&gt; export to vimeo... doesnt work on mobile

ive tried different render settings for the audio, tried exporting to youtube, tried a million different things. audio never works on mobile smartphones.  

The only thing that works (using that term loosely) is playing the wav file through speakers and recording a new mp3 file with the dr-05's microphone next to the speaker.

whoever is the first person to post a link to vimeo where the audio works on a smartphone, I will paypal $20

I'm an amateur camera operator, if I can even call myself that. Filming has been my hobby for ~one and a half year. I've filmed four weddings and many events. Even some commercials and promo clips. Obviously nothing too professional. I've just received an offer to film a wedding this summer and I'm not sure of what equipment to buy right now on my extremely tight budget.

Basically. I'll be buying a new camera (a dslr) at the end of the summer, but until then I'm using a Panasonic hmc40. A semi-pro camera that I've learned to love and hate. 

I have a decent video tripod, an led light and that's about it. I'm just wondering about the audio. I'm thinking of buying a zoom h1 mic, but I'm not really sure if that would be the best all-around option for a wedding. So I have a few questions:

1. Could I record everything - the ceremony, the reception and additional interviews and speeches just with the zoom h1? Obviously I'd have the built-in mic as a back-up.
I cant really afford any lav mics.

2. What about agc. I know it's bad to use, but wouldn't it be too hard to control the levels (e.g. sudden loud music). How do I operate the mic in this case while operating the camera at the same time.

3. Is there anything like plural eyes for windows?

4. any tips on getting the best out of the zoom mic?

Short video by Drive that illustrates what I'm going for, http://youtu.be/eAY5fRglsb4

As of right now I'm looking to put out a really good pilot episode. Ideally the main 3 shots will be:
* interior shot [inside the car, recorded dialogue while driving]
* stationary shot [with the car either static or in motion, stationary camera
* exterior shot [camera mounted to car body or to a window]

I've been bouncing this idea around in my head for a while and whats coming out right know is that theres 4 main pillars to producing something worth watching.

Obviously content is key, if people aren't interested in what they're watching they'll tune out. Clear picture, this means at least 720p video or higher as well as good lighting. Clear sound, this will mean shotgun mics or lav mics. Lastly good editing/post-production to tie it all together.

The base plan is to rent a car and the equipment for a weekend and get all my shooting done in that period of time. I'll be borrowing a friend for the tripod shots while the car is in motion. I figure I'll need to rent a decent camera or two, (possibly some action cams, gopro/contour) tripod, mounting equipment like suction cups, a slide for some dynamic shots, and maybe could get away with a hotshoe mounted shotgun mic.

My idea is basically to go on a road trip or two, pic scenic locations to shoot from for the stationary shots and nice roads to shoot for the exterior shots.

I have access to FCPX and AE, and while not versed in them I am a very quick learner and pretty creative. So I should be able to tie it all together. I'm just curious if I'm missing anything or if the idea itself is improbable.

A little background: I've shot stills with a DSLR for few years and with all honesty I can say that I can get pretty decent shots with my camera. I've had a camcorder for years, but the huge dof among other things just started to look bad in my eyes.


I just got a Sony NEX-6 as a travel/second body/video camera and I've really fell in love with the video capabilites.


My parents took tons of footage of me and my brothers when we were growing up and now the videos are priceless. I want to do the same for my kids. So I won't be making any commercial stuff or anything.

iMovie is almost good enough for me. It does what it does and it's free so I can't really complain. What I find that it's lacking is color correction abilities that I'm used to get with processing raw footage from my DSLR stills.

So could FCP X be a good choice to upgrade? My projects would be small. I just want to take footage of my family and then make it look ""professional"". Should I stick with iMovie and try to get everything correct in camera or just pay the 300€ (which is not that bad considering how much I have invested in my photography gear).

1360688884.0,6,self.videography,18dwa9,Red Giant: Please complete PluralEyes V3 for Windows. ,rsandelius,6,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/18dwa9/red_giant_please_complete_pluraleyes_v3_for/,"Back in late October/early November, Red Giant announced version 3.0 of the newly-acquired PluralEyes synchronization software from Singular Software, the original owner. At the time of launch, it was announced that Mac versions of the software were ready to go and that the Windows version would be ready shortly afterwards. 

It is now mid-February. There has been several releases &amp; updates since, and Windows users are still left out in the cold, forced to using a Version 2 of the software which is slower and has a horribly dated UI despite their having paid for the latest version. 

(If you've never used the version 3 of the PluralEyes software and shoot using second-system sound (digital recorders that you re-sync back over the less-than-stellar on-camera audio during editing) you really need to go out and download a demo... it's amazing!)

All messages to Red Giant's customer service has returned a generic ""it's coming soon"" or ""it'll be released in version 3.2"", and Red Giant's Facebook page is set up to not allow any FB'ers (whether you like the page or not) to post on their Timeline... only as comments on existing posts made by them. 

Red Giant: It's now been almost 5 months since I paid for my PluralEyes software license (version 3) and I have yet to be able to use it, forced instead to use Version 2 and use proxy AFF &amp; XML files to shuttle back and forth, at a snails pace. I know I'm not the only one who is frustrated by this lack of support. 

Every day that Red Giant delays the deployment of Version 3 of PluralEyes for Windows is another day that customers/purchasers of the license are essentially pissing away their investment. 

I'd love to get the attention of someone at Red Giant who can actually DO something about this issue. I'm a pretty laid back guy and I understand that sometimes there are delays/setbacks in R&amp;D, but the only thing more ridiculous than the delay itself is the stonewalling/lack of customer service by Red Giant. 

Please share/spread the word if you are frustrated with Red Giant's actions/inactions as well. Thank you.

I want to get a more normal focal length, so I was seriously considering the sigma 30mm 1.4 for about $300 new. However I realized I could sell my tokina for about $500 and for another $400-$800 (depending on used deals and if I get mk1 or mk2) and buy a used Canon 16-35mm 2.8 L lens since it covers the focal lengths of both the tokina and the rokinon. However I'd have to sacrifice the 1.4 I could have gotten on the sigma and go with a constant 2.8 on the canon. I currently have a guy on craigslist who will sell me a canon 16-35mm 2.8 L MARK ONE for about $700. Should I sell my tokina and just go for the canon L 16-35? or should I get the sigma 30mm 1.4.

From studying films, it seems like shoulder-rigs/handheld is primarily used when there is a lot of movement in the frame, specifically unpredictable movement. When should a tripod be used though?

Dollies seem to be used when you want a smooth shot, usually from the side or in-front. I have some confusion on when to use Steadicam vs Dolly, but I'm guessing that  a steadicam should be used when there is no opportunity to put down dolly tracks and/or the movement is very quick?

Plus a lot of us only have enough for the new camera and then don't have any money for good lenses. What he plans on doing is instead of spending money on a new camera he will invest in really nice lenses. Then the next time he needs to shoot something he will just rent the camer he needs.
I figure that if he spend $3000 every year on a new lens (instead of a new camera) he will have an amazing collection of lenses in 5 years that won't be obsolete and work with what ever camera he wants to rent.

-Additional lenses?  

-A cheapish light kit ... I'll mostly be shooting indoors with room light always present.  I'd prefer a fluorescent or LED kit, because I've had problems shooting with tungsten.  Probably only need 3 lights.  

-Sound - We actually already have a solid USB mic for voiceovers and a wireless mic, but I probably should supplement that with a boom if there's anything left

-Tripod

-Extra batteries, memory cards, carrying cases (travel will be involved), bulbs, etc...

Suggestions?,Garzilly,8,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/10lvhe/4k_budget_looking_to_invest_in_a_new_camera/,"So my client base is starting to expand, and I need a camera to take me to that ""next level"" so to speak. I currently own a Nikon D300s (which has never impressed me from a video standpoint) and I have a Nikon D7000 on permanent loan from a client of mine. I've grown to really enjoy the D7000 and the quality of the videos this little camera can churn out. It also works out well, as I have some pretty good Nikkor lenses:

* Nikkor 24-70 2.8
* Nikkor 50 1.8
* Nikkor 70-300
* Tokina 12-24 f4

I'm finishing up a pretty big time-lapse gig coming up, and I'll have a good chunk to invest in a more suitable, or ""pure"" video camera. The question is, what route do I take? Do I stick with a Nikon body, and pick up a D800 to use alongside my lenses? Do I go a completely different route and pick up a Canon or Panasonic camera? DSLRs work pretty well for me, as I tend to take a wide variety of still images for time-lapse, and the video features seem to be just good enough.

I feel as if I'd be taken a little more seriously by future clients if I show up to a shoot with a serious rig, as opposed to a tricked out DSLR. So r/videography, what do you suggest? Stick with a still/video body (D800 most likely) or go a completely different route? What would you do?

For the sake of more information, I have the following equipment to pair a new camera with:

* Manfrotto 055X Pro B Tripod Legs
* Manfrotto 502 Video Head
* Glidetrack Hybrid
* Cheap Soft Boxes &amp; Stands
* Audio Technica Lav Mic
* Rode VideoMic Pro

I'm actually an Executive Chef by trade and run well respected restaurant. For about the past year, I've been running an educational website called [StellaCulinary.com](http://stellaculinary.com/), with the purpose of teaching professional cooking techniques to the general public, for free. I have an audio podcast and I've currently released 123 instructional videos that are all available in 720p format, for free, on YouTube and my website. 

Recently I've had a few different educational and consulting companies within the culinary field contact me, requesting the production of educational cooking content to use as in house training material. As part of the deal, I would not release their specific version(s) of the video(s) to the public, which means I would receive no add revenue. The problem is, I have no idea what to charge. 

Now while I'm a complete amateur, I do think I have a few unique things going for me that could add value to my videos. I believe my main selling point is that I'm a one stop shop when it comes to educational cooking content. I can test or develop recipes, demonstrate any technique, shoot, edit, photograph, voice over and encode your video in the desired format. In most cases you would have to pay a chef to demonstrate (and if he/she were any good, that alone would cost around $50/hr), hire a separate camera man/video editor and then rent a kitchen that you could shoot in.

Also, even though I am a major amateur when it comes to video production, the reason why these various companies are contacting me is because they've watched my videos already and obviously have liked what they've seen. 

To give a frame of reference, a simple video like [How to Julienne an Onion](http://www.stellaculinary.com/podcasts/video/how-julienne-onion) can be shot, edited and voiced over in about an hour (including set-up and break down time). On the other hand, [my three part food science video on emulsification](http://stellaculinary.com/podcasts/video/what-is-an-emulsion-a-cooks-guide#what-is-an-emulsion) took me about 80 hours from start to finish, including research, layout (I used Keynote with screen recording) and voice over. 

The current company that I'm talking to wants me to shoot 20-25 ""simple technique videos, around 3-5 minutes each."" They will be sending me a shoot list next week, but from what we were discussing, it sounds like the ""average"" video would take me about 5 hours from start to finish.

So, what's the ball park figure that I should be charging? Should I charge by the hour, by the video, by the finished video minute, or give them a package deal on all 25 videos?

Sorry for the long post, thanks in advance for any advice you can offer.",,False,self,t5_2qwgz,False,,,True,t3_wh2iw,http://www.reddit.com/r/videography/comments/wh2iw/another_how_much_do_i_charge_question_from_a/,

A lot of the shots are OOF or soft.  (ignore the shitty color correct, shake, an what not)

I use a flycam and a 550d.  Right now, my widest focal length is the kit lens (18-55), but I plan on getting some new L glass soon.

More background is, I have to run around filming.  I end up getting a lot of OOF shots, partly because it's awkward to hold the focus ring in a flycam set up for me.  Are there any tools or tips that could help me out?

For the last few years I've been shooting with a Sony VX2100 as a freelancer, I know it's finally time for an upgrade, but I'm not sure what to go for.

I currently shoot music promo videos as a freelancer, but I really low-ball myself when it comes to payment because I keep getting myself into the mindset that I shouldn't charge a lot seeing as I'm using old technology. Watching jaw-dropping stuff  working the same market just kind of depresses me. :P I'm also a bit out of the loop regarding new models and video tech which probably isn't a good thing.

What should you suggest I look at, with a $2500 budget? Something 1080p (can these also shoot as 1080i?)  with good low light capabilities that can achieve a relatively decent shallow depth of field would be ideal, but I'd prefer a camcorder over a DSLR. Or should I seriously think about shooting on DSLR?

oh and the first video cuts out early because i simply didn't have enough video for the song length, but there's an ending.

I'm looking to get some freelancing jobs making online video for local universities, nonprofits, and small businesses, to help pay off my insane student loans. I made a simple website to showcase my work, but I'm not sure how I feel about it.

Here it is: http://i.imgur.com/Db3yB.jpg

The images at the bottom are video screengrabs. When you hover your mouse over the image, the screengrab gets grayed out and a white triangle appears. When you click on the image, a lightbox pops up and plays the video. I know there's some redundancy here, what with the 'promotional' videos and the 'scholarship campaign' videos being right on top of each other, but I'll mix that up later.

I looked at a few other video portfolio sites for reference. Some videographers included a list of their skills (editing software, web design, graphic design), some listed their equipment, and others just put way more information up about themselves than I did. I'll include my skill set on my resume, but I don't know if it's necessary on the website. I'm just starting out and have some basic equipment, but I don't think my equipment list is impressive enough to list on the homepage just yet, although maybe I would consider listing that on my resume too (I own a Canon 60D, which isn't a top-of-the-line camera).

I want to look professional, and most important, I want to get hired. So what do you think, r/videography? Is my website comprehensive enough, or do I need to put more info on there?

We can't use the mac built in webcam because we need it to face away from the screen while someone monitors the livestream.
3) how can I get decent audio? doesn't have to be perfect.

I'm the multimedia editor for my college's newspaper, and we've traditionally used Vimeo. However, I want to pitch the idea of switching to YouTube. I think people are more familiar with it, and we'd draw more views. The reason we've stuck with Vimeo up until now was past editors felt it was more professional and it had better embed features.

Does anyone have strong opinions either way?

I've put off making my demo reel for a while now. I have a lot of experience and good quality footage to compile but the industry can be a little intimidating. It is comfortable just being freelance and taking what I can get but I'm ready to do more. I've put off making this for a while now, mostly because I'm afraid I'll do one thing wrong and ruin the whole thing.

I'm looking for at least the functionality of the Sony HVR-MRC1. I like especially that it understands the camera's commands to start and stop recording. HDMI recording would be even better as long as I can at least keep my workflow in removing pulldown. Of course, it would be great if this device removed pulldown automatically, especially with the Canon HV20's finicky 24p.

Anyway, I'm sure I'm not the only one who has a camcorder being held back by tape. Is there a product out there that can solve this or can someone please make one? I know there are other products out there, but they're huge and expensive. Hopefully these can be smaller, stylish and cheaper by now in 2013.

My friends and I film short videos for fun. We started off with a crappy handycam and we're now using my D5100 with the kit lens to shoot. I have a few questions regarding this. 

1. Since the camera is obviously built for pictures. Am I damaging the camera / lens in any way by recording hours of video? I didn't know if maybe the sensor wasn't built to handle the constant exposure it receives from shooting video for a few hours a day. 

2. Will my battery degrade by shooting video? I noticed that I can't as many shots off when taking pictures before it goes dead. It's not that old either. 

3. When filming, I don't see many options for locking in exposure. We have lights on stands that we use to light up the characters and the backgrounds. There is an ISO reading on the screen and that was constantly changing. This causing the whole screen to change in brightness and it's very apparent. It's also grainy at higher ISO. I'd love to have control over the aperture so I can set the lens wide open and have the ISO the lowest. Most of the backgrounds in our films don't matter that much so I'm not worried about it blurred out. For example inside it wants to be around 1600-2200 ISO and it will fluctuate around that, even with lights. However if I take a picture I can open the lens up and be at 400 ISO. The noise is drastically different. When I shoot outside during the day, I can be at 100 ISO for video and the shots are super clear. I'd love to be able to have my indoor shots be that clear as well. 

Thank you everyone who can answer my questions and and help me out. I hope this is in the right place. I've learned a lot about photography from you guys so I'm hoping there's some knowledgeable people out there who know some things about using your DSLR for video as well. 

For anyone interested, here's the latest 'short' film we shot over the summer. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onVnlSB8tGo

The goal was to showcase all the different pianos they work on, create &amp; sell at the shop. I'm looking for any type of feedback - positive or negative - in order to improve the video, along with my overall skills. I shot everything other than a few handheld shots; the owner insisted on doing them himself. All the editing was done by me.

Here is the [link!](http://youtu.be/7bHTIv41E7Q)
(It's set to unlisted)

Tech Specs:
Cameras used: 7D w/ 50 1.8 (which broke while filming)
Canon PowerShot ELPH 330HS
iPhone 4s
Konova k3 Slider
Pianos recorded via GarageBand
Mixed/Mastered via ProTools
Edited/Color Corrected in Premiere

Couple more things I'd like to make note of: I realize that the PowerShot and iPhone aren't the best for a job like this, but if you don't get your pants in a fit about the quality, I think video came out pretty good - most of it due to slider. Oh, and yes - I should have used a tripod/monopod for those handheld shots.

Also, too many light leaks?
