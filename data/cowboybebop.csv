This show was easily one of the most beautiful and fulfilling creations I've ever had the pleasure of watching in my entire life. I had never sat down and watched an actual anime before and upon a recommendation from a friend decided to give Cowboy Bebop a shot at 1:00 in the morning a couple of nights ago. Boy was that a good move. Stayed up till 5 AM that night completely glued to my computer screen.

Everything about this show was amazing. The universe, the animation, the characters, the music. As a Jazz musician and fan all I can say is holy shit. Whoever wrote this soundtrack is now one of my favorite people.

**Session #1: ""Asteroid Blues""**

**""Asuteroido Burūsu"" (アステロイド・ブルース)**  

**Original Airdate: October 24, 1998**  


**Synopsis from Wikipedia:**   

Fellow bounty hunters Spike Spiegel and Jet Black head to the Tijuana asteroid colony on their ship, the Bebop, to track down a bounty-head named Asimov Solensan, who is wanted for killing members of his own crime syndicate and for stealing a cache of a dangerous combat drug called Bloody-Eye. Asimov and his girlfriend, Katerina, are ambushed at a bar by his former syndicate while attempting to sell a vial of Bloody-Eye, but Asimov manages to fight his way out by using the drug himself. Later, Spike comes across Katerina and reveals to her that he is a bounty hunter searching for Asimov; Spike is promptly assaulted by Asimov and is nearly killed before Katerina intervenes, though he is able to steal Asimov's Bloody-Eye vial before the two leave. Spike confronts Asimov at a staged drug deal with the stolen vial, but Asimov escapes with Katerina in a ship when the two are interrupted by an attack from Asimov's former syndicate. With Spike giving chase in his own ship, Asimov attempts to take another dose of Bloody-Eye, but a horrified Katerina shoots him before he can. As Spike approaches Asimov's ship, it is destroyed by attacking police cruisers. The episode ends with Spike and Jet once again traveling through space on the Bebop.

This episode pays homage to [Desperado](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112851/), with Asimov resembling Antonio Banderas's mariachi character and Katrina resembling Salma Hayek's character.

I'm thinking about having a community rewatch of Cowboy Bebop, one episode at a time from beginning to end.

But I need your help!

I've never done one of these before and it's becoming clear that there are a number of different ways we can do this.  For example:
 
* One episode a day for 26 days with one extra for the movie and we discuss throughout the day
* One episode a week and we watch it together in real time and discuss while watching

*Setting up a Conflicted Work* 


In a series known for its juxtaposition of conflicting styles and bounty of anachronisms (visual, cultural, verbal, and musical), much like the later Samurai Champloo, the first we hear of Cowboy Bebop—“Memory,” I believe--can only be described as akin to a music box—soft, gentle, something we’d want to go to sleep to. But combined with the visuals of the church shootout (at this point a mystery to us), it immediately presents a conflict within the work. Other shows take whole episodes to introduce some sort of conflict, but within the first 45 seconds we are immersed in contradictions at their basest forms: sight and sound. This, I believe, contributed immensely to the series’ popularity—its ability to wrap the viewer into something interesting right away. Because that’s what we find interesting—conflict.   

The conflicting styles continue as the opening pops onto the screen—“Tank!” is loud and thumpy to contrast brilliantly with the music-box from before. This time, however, instead of the bleak, drained church shootout scene we just watched (reminiscent, I thought, of the visual style in Schindler’s List) it’s colorful and just kind of pops out at you. After that we get another song—this time with a harmonica as its foundation. I never really noticed it until now, but for the first three minutes of the episode, we are never without music. Then it breaks with Jet’s voice. By now, we’ve had three totally different styles of music paired with three totally different visual styles: “Memory” with the bleak shootout; “Tank!” with the poppy opening; and “Spokey Dokey” with a very Westernesque view of Mars. And we’re only three minutes in. 

This, I think, is what I’m going to focus on for this episode—the very distinct mish-mash of styles that appear in what many know to be their first fore into anime. 

As the episode progresses, we see more and more of these varied styles. One such situation that I found especially unusual (and that I only noticed this time around) was around six minutes in—when Spike is taking off to scout out for Asimov, he’s very casual about it. We know virtually nothing about him—or Jet, for that matter—other than that he’s a dangerous type, they’re low on food, and that the two of them have clearly gone after baddies for long enough so that it’s just another job. 

Following this, we get our first look at Tijuana topside, with the song “Felt Tip Pen.” Again, not what you’d expect from a show that—at this point—is set up very much to be a sci-fi. It’s very clearly a Western kind of style. The older folk we see in the bar are exactly the kind of people you’d expect to see in a saloon in the old West. Then, right around the seven-minute mark, we see Asimov and whats-her-face for the first time. Right there, we get another contradiction—this time in age, demeanor, what have you. The old men are just sitting around playing cards, complaining about the past and the lack of thanks they receive for their work. They’re disgruntled, crabby, just plain old. Then in walks the relatively young Asimov and what we think to be his pregnant partner. He, too, sounds disgruntled, but he presents himself far differently than the older men. 

As soon as the exchange of bloody-eye is initiated, the music stops. It’s no longer the Old West. Now it’s a drug deal, complete with dim lighting and a sudden shift in tone. Then there’s a shootout to break the silence, and we are finally introduced to Bebop’s distinct method of presenting action scenes. But, of course, we all know about that. 

Throughout the rest of the episode, we are presented with more scenes of a similar fashion—calmer moments with suitable music juxtaposed with very intense, music-less scenes—that is, until the final exchange between Spike and Asimov. Personally, the fight scene set to “Rush” is my favorite in the entire series: it’s smooth, loud, but most of all it’s where the music and the action for which Bebop is so celebrated finally come together. 

Then there’s that transition into the ship chase set to very different music than “Rush” and we see the somewhat tragic end to Asimov and his lover: Adios. Then we get back to “Spokey Dokey” to round it all out, and we’re back where the episode really started—with bell peppers and beef.

Though not as much as the later Samurai Champloo, Cowboy Bebop is very much about contradicting visual and musical styles. It’s a show about action, adventure, crime, suspense, but even more, it’s about the sometimes subtle fusion of sound and sight. It’s fascinating, I think, to see just how much the juxtaposition of conflicting styles really sets up the show to be something different. From its outset, Bebop is perhaps one of the greatest experiments in anachronism and style in the last few decades.

I've always wondered if a company could do a bebop video game right, and how they would do it right. I am aware there was one made before for the PS1 but I remember it being a game sort of like star fox and the one for the PS2 but I think there is potential for then that for a Bebop game (not knocking on star fox ofc.) It would be pretty badass if in the next E3 they start up Tank! and then the trailer for the game would roll.. I would probably buy it no matter what kind of game it was xD

But yeah I would enjoy seeing what you guys think would be cool to implement into a Cowboy Bebop video game.

***Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.***

Synopsis from [Bebopedia](http://cowboybebop.wikia.com/wiki/Sympathy_For_The_Devil): 
 
Spike has a flash-back that he is being operated on by surgeons in a room where human organs and a fish float in water-filled tubes. He wakes up in a nightclub where a kid is on stage playing a blues tune on a harmonica.
  
Faye inspects the refrigerator on board the Bebop and finds only a can of dog food. Ein is waiting by his food dish but Faye instead eats the dog food herself.
 
Jet and Spike are at the nightclub talking about blues music. Spike uses his computer glasses to identify their three million Woolong bounty head, Giraffe. Jet goes to distract an old friend of his that gets in the way. Giraffe leaves the club and Spike begins to trail him. They watch the kid, Wen, from the night club enter a taxi with an old man in the wheelchair, Zebra. Spike follows Giraffe, who followed the taxi to a sky rise hotel. Giraffe enters a suite and goes crashing through the window to the ground.
 
Spike, flying his Swordfish II, narrowly catches the falling Giraffe. Before Giraffe dies he gives Spike a ring and says not to be fooled by the way he looks.
 
Back at the Bebop Jet and Spike talk about selling the ring. Jet goes to lunch with his old friend, Fatty River, who was also trying to catch Giraffe. Fatty explains that Giraffe and Zebra were the leaders of the Self-Defense Volunteer Squad and Wen is supposedly Zebra’s son.
 
Fatty River explains:
Ten years ago they had a confrontation with some space raiders. A land dispute. It all came down at some R&amp;D facility near Mars. A few days later the raiders are wiped out, Zebras missing, and Giraffe is found blindfolded in a silo. They say Zebra double crossed him so he could run the squad solo. Later, Zebra turns up in a wheelchair with the kid. Guess it didn't turn out the way he planned.
 
Spike goes back to the nightclub and follows Wen and Zebra after the show to a warehouse. Jet and Faye find Wen in an old newspaper article from 30 years ago where he looks the same age.
 
Wen takes the high ground and fires at Spike. A flashback of Wen’s childhood show him with his family on a terra-formed Moon when the hyperspace gate crashes and annihilates the environment. Wen, however, emerges from the charred remains of the ground unharmed.

Wen explains to Spike that he stopped ageing and captured Zebra when he hit the R&amp;D lab. He then asks for the ring and when Spike plays dumb, he continues to shoot. Spike finds cover and fired back, knocking Wen’s gun away.
 
Spike hits Wen in the face and knocks him down a floor but Wen escapes.Spike returns to the Bebop with Zebra who has tears in his eyes but is otherwise paralyzed. They use a brain scanning machine called the Alfa Catch to record his memories as video images. They witness how Giraffe got shot at by Wen in the hotel room. Giraffe explains that the stone can return ageing to Wen—the only thing that can kill him now.
 
Jet explains:
When the gate exploded, a coordinate system was created from the resulting twists in hyperspace—a kind of singularity that drew in vast amounts of energy, enclosing and crystallizing them into a single faceted stone. The gem that makes up ring. The same energy broke Wen’s circadian rhythm. His pineal body continually produces a substance like melatonin that inhibits ageing. That’s the theory in a nutshell.
 
Jet crafts a bullet out of the gem and Spike loads it into a Thompson Center Contender. Spike goes to leave but Faye is worried he won’t come back.
 
Spike flies his Swordfish II and tracks Wen in a stolen taxicab. They travel away from town and Spike shoots at the taxi, causing it to crash into an abandoned gas station. Wen emerges from the fiery explosion unharmed and faces down Spike, who has landed and gotten out of his ship.
 
Wen fires three shots with a sadistic smile on his face: one lands at Spikes feet, the next wide right of his head, and the third just grazing Spike’s cheek.
 
Spike shoots Wen between the eyes, who stood still expecting to survive another bullet wound, but the gem works and turns Wen into an old man. Wen falls to the ground and dies, saying he finally feels at ease. With his last breath, he asks Spike if he understands.
 
Spike replies ""Yeah, as if"", tosses Wen’s harmonica into the air, points at it with his finger and says ""Bang"".

Edward's Dad is VT's Husband, the legendary bounty hunter... Urel Terpsichore


Compare Urel and VT's picks in Heavy Metal Queen at 22:05 to Ed's dad in Hard Luck Woman at 15:28. Similar?

Doesn't young VT in the photo at 22:05 look a lot like Edward?


In Heavy Metal Queen VT says Urel was the only other person who liked drinking a Prairie Oyster. Guess who loves eggs as well? Loves them enough to carry around a full basket of them.


What would be some qualifications to be the most legendary bounty hunter? You would probably have to be able to beat people up like a boss right? Who throws Spike around like a rag doll in Hard Luck Woman? Ed's Dad.


Wikipedia keeps saying that Spike guesses VTs name and that it sounds like Ed's last name, Tivrusky, but I don't get that one... Neither in English nor Japanese do the names sound alike. Am I missing something here?


Anyway, with young VT looking like Ed, and with Urel looking like Ed's Dad, and most importantly, Ed's dad being able to beat up Spike, I feel like this is a definite yes. And the egg thing I guess. Also seeing as how Ed's dad's name is known to translate roughly into Turkish as ""Excuse me, check please"" I feel like it's another clue in showing that he's not all that he seems to be.


So why does VT think Urel is dead, or is it a lie? Why was Ed left in a Nunnery if both mom and dad exist? 


Here's a 3 o clock theory for you:

VT and UT have a child and decide to stop bounty hunting. UT's past catches up, however, and one night a bunch of thugs come into their home and beat UT senseless. Literally to the point where he now has strong retrograde, and slight anterograde amnesia. He does not really remember his past, or chooses not to accept it, and he quickly forgets anything in his present.


VT becomes a truck driver to make money, leaving Edward and UT on Earth as a way to keep their past away from her. VT leaves Ed at a nunnery, hoping to one day come back, but not being able to deal with a child by herself.


Ed, being the curious genius she is, finds out about her parents, follows her parents along on her computer, and once VT comes into contact with the Bebop crew becomes very interested in Bebop. She garners strength from their tribulations, and decides to run away. And when they come to Earth, she joins them.


Over the series and movie she slowly gains more and more strength as she lives with the dysfunctional Bebop family and finally decides to meet her father who can't remember her. Which is way easier than trying to meet her mom who chooses not to deal with her or her father... In her mind she hopes that she can catch her dad, and bring him to her mom, and somehow they would start the family anew... But life isn't always that easy.

There's something about Cowboy Bebop that really takes you into the real life of a bounty hunter.  I never really enjoyed Faye as a character, yet I had to constantly deal with her occasional outbursts, much like Spike and Jet.  The main plot is quite stale by my standards, and I do feel like it ended abruptly.

But my god, the characters.  It's so easy to attach yourself to the characters.  Through their misfortune and adventures, you learn about each small flaw and the deep introspective personalities each character has (including Ed).  You get so attached that you don't even realize when Hard Luck Woman comes around.

I heard Call Me Call Me before I watched the series and loved it, and the montage only makes it even more powerful.  The way each character leaves almost suddenly is shocking.  Again, you don't see it coming at all.

**Session #5: ""Ballad of Fallen Angels""**

""Datenshi-tachi no Baraddo"" (堕天使たちのバラッド)

Original Airdate: November 21, 1998


Synopsis from [Bebopedia](http://cowboybebop.wikia.com/wiki/Ballad_of_Fallen_Angels):   

***Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.***
 
Mao Yenrai, Capo of the Red Dragon crime syndicate, and Carlos of the White Tiger crime syndicate meet at Mao's high rise to sign a truce agreement. They are both tired of the bloodshed that has affected their rival organizations. Vicious, a member of the Red Dragon syndicate, and his henchmen kill Carlos in his ship by causing it to explode as he leaves the meeting. Vicious then uses a sword, his weapon of choice, to kill Mao Yenrai who intimates that Spike could have prevented this.
 
Jet and Spike find a new 28 million Woolong bounty is placed on Mao Yenrai for an unknown crime. Spike is ready to go after a lead they have but Jet is worried about the bounty and thinks Spike is hiding something he knows about Mao. Spike asks Jet how he lost his arm and Jet asks what that has to do with their conversation.
 
Faye arrives from shopping and tries to join the conversation but is told to stay out of their business. Spike leaves in his Swordfish II. Jet leaves the room as a video signal comes into the computer with a new lead on the bounty, and Faye answers the call.
 
The lead takes Faye to an opera house where she can find Mao Yenrai at his box seat. She is dressed for the formal occasion, in one of the few times she ever has a change of clothes.
 
Spike goes to see Annie, his lead, who was a close friend to Mao back when Spike was a member of the Red Dragon himself. She is taken aback because she felt Spike had died 3 years ago. There is a picture on the store counter of a younger Annie and Mao Yenrai looking like friends.
 
Faye is invited into Mao Yenrai's opera box at gunpoint by Vicious' henchmen. They know her name and tell her to sit through the opera performance next to Mao's body that has been propped up in a seat.
 
Annie gives Spike a gun and bullets but asks him not to get tangled up with Vicious again. She regrets that Spike is a show-off and never listens to anyone. Back on the Bebop, Spike retrieves grenades and more guns. Jet tells Spike that he's walking into a trap--that Mao is already dead--and Spike says he already knows, but he has a debt to pay off.
 
Faye calls in to the computer's video phone to ask them to rescue her from Vicious. Spike goes, but says not for her. At the meeting place, a Cathedral, Spike meets Vicious and kills the henchman holding Faye at gunpoint. A mob of henchmen appear from hiding places and start to fire. Spike kills several people and races upstairs towards Vicious.
 
On a balcony next to a large stained-glass window Spike and Vicious duel with gun and sword respectively. They both draw blood and Vicious manages to grab Spike by the face and throw him through the window. Spike falls to the ground and a montage of his former life flashes before his eyes.
 
The images speak without context but show Spike fighting alongside Vicious; Vicious in bed with Julia, and Spike walking underneath Julia's window with a bouquet of red roses. The image of a red rose laying in a puddle in the rain is shown in both this flashback and the closing credits.
 
Spike then recalls a memory where he is recovering from injuries at Julia's place and she is humming. Spike is awoken from the dream by Faye humming, which he says is off-key so Faye smacks him with a pillow.

***Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.***

Synopsis from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Cowboy_Bebop_episodes): 
  
The crew of the Bebop chase a bounty named Decker, who is running a load of high explosives. While nursing a hangover at a diner, Spike meets a cargo hauler pilot named V.T., who hates bounty hunters, but ends up lending him a hand.
  
The character Otto was modeled after the character portrayed by Bunta Suguhara in Trucker Yarō (""Trucker Guys""), a series of ten films from 1975-1979 directed by Noribumi Suzuki. The names of other trucker characters, including Love Machine, Sneaky Snake, and Spider Mike, originate from the 1978 film Convoy. The line ""Breaker One-Nine,"" stated in the episode by the character Victoria Terpsischore (V.T.), also originates from Convoy, though it is an actual term used by truckers, ""Breaker"" meaning a driver is coming on to a channel, and ""One-Nine"" being the East-West bound travel in North America, ""One-Four"" being North-South travel. Watanabe said that he liked watching Convoy and Trucker Yarō as a child

As far as actors go for a live action Cowboy Bebop, who are believable actors you feel could capture the actual personalities and feel of the characters from the series as opposed to simply looking like them?",SgtPepper00,26,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/cowboybebop/comments/1fz7ba/i_know_this_topic_has_been_beat_to_death_however/,"* **Spike**:

Ideally, I would take Heath Ledger. Although I mentioned that physicality has no bearing here, he does have the tall lanky build with wide shoulders, big curly hair, deep pronounced voice, and we know he can definitely get into the mind of his characters. (His character in 10 things I hate about you was also a pretty ""cool"" character derivation from Spike). 

However, since he is deceased my pick would be [Ryan Gosling](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0331516/). His character in Drive has that ""removed"" vibe that Spike has throughout the series while still being very piercing with his [impactful moments](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWy3twwTEyc). Not only that, he definitely has the ""cool"" vibe going with him as well, and is undoubtedly a draw at the box office, (also can really capture the young woman demographic.) While I don't think Spike has ever been personified perfectly by any of Ryan Gosling's roles, he is definitely close enough to what I feel Spike could be for a live action movie, and with some subtle tweaking (namely during more light hearted scenes or his general ""disinterested-ness"") Ryan Gosling could be a very solid choice for Spike.

=============================

___________________


* **Jet Black**

This one was pretty tough, but I would choose [Laurence Fishburne](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000401/). From his imdb description alone he is known authoritarian roles, and while Jet is a very badass character, I definitely see him as a more of a caring father figure ultimately for the rest of the Bebop crew. I definitely feel Laurence can capture this strong, powerful character with a somewhat broken past, however has still chosen a life of good. Not only that, his voice can match Jet's as well (I always thought Jet had very Black American sensibilities about him, while not being too stereotypical of black men in film/animation.) If not Laurence, I would probably choose Jeff Bridges, actually (I feel it's a pretty close contest between the two). 

=============================

___________________


* **Faye Valentine**

DKR SPOILERS

Ideally, I would choose [Anne Hathaway](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004266/). Her role in the Dark Knight Rises is pretty much exactly how I imagine Faye would operate in a live action characterization of her. Whilst being this sultry, deceptive woman, she is also brazenly confident (still not without her soft spots however). These are both seen in Anne Hathaway's portrayal of Catwoman in DKR and in Faye's in Cowboy Bebop. Anne Hathaway is [brilliantly manipulative in this scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAzXwlmQ0b4), as she uses her sexuality as a tool to gain what she wants, however is still willing to get very physical (much as Faye has done throughout the series). Additionally, Anne is very deceiving of the main characters throughout the movie (as she needs to ""get hers""), while still ultimately being on their side at the end, very similar to Faye as well. Both characters also pretend to be unattached from our main characters although they really have feelings for them (whether they be romantic or not). 

=============================

___________________


* **Ed**

I honestly have no idea who could play Ed, as I feel this is a really demanding character that needs to be EXTREMELY well handled in a live action movie. It would be very difficult to make Ed a believable character in a real life scenario, even with Bebop's stylization, and this would only be exacerbated by real life actors. I don't think I've seen a very similar character to Ed portrayed in any live action movie I've seen, so it would be difficult to choose an actress. Ultimately, I would prefer someone young (in the 12-16 range), who can act comfortably silly. I think the most important aspect of Ed's character is how other characters react to her in the series, as they would have to be generally indifferent towards her crazy antics, even if she does things way out of social norms. Characters could also potentially have a line or two talking about her behavior, and merely shrugging it off.

Ex: ""Does she always act like this?""
""Kids.""
or something.

The 1st one was Full Metal Alchemist. I guess I have a thing for tragic heroes and bittersweet endings.

Second, I watched it in a slightly different order, with the movie coming last. While (in hindsight) I know that the movie could've clarified some points, it actually felt better seeing Spike and the whole gang together one more time.

Third, I've seen a lot of comments about the last episode but for me the greatest sad moment (maybe because I was caught completely off-guard) was when Ed left and Jet only realized it as he read the message. That moment along with the one where he says he's better off alone show how (IMO) he was actually happy with what they had together.

At last, the ending. I know people usually dislike ""unhappy"" endings. Probably there were lots of people hoping that Spike would come back and move on with Faye or some other troublesome girl he'd meet along the way, but an ending like that wouldn't **carry** the same meaning. Watching the movie afterwards brought me some closure. Spike's death ultimately set him free, much like Vincent (and immediatly linked me to Prison Break since it made it clear to me that his death wasn't totally unjustified). My only real doubt is if Faye and Jet would at least keep on working together. I mean, they literally have no one left...

To the matter at hand: I think Spike is, for the duration of the show, stuck in a coma that occured three years before the series began when he escaped the syndicate.  Jet, Faye, Ed, every bounty they come across and every challenge the crew faces are separate elements of his subconscious that Spike's mind creates to occupy him while he dreams away, trapped in his own brain activity before he finally defeats his inner demon, Vicious, and is released to the higher realm that Laughing Bull speaks of every time he watches a star fall (see: Gren's death where Laughing Bull calls the shooting star: &gt;'...a lost soul who has finished his battles somewhere on this planet. A pitiful soul who could not find his way to the lofty realm where the great spirit awaits us all.').

Spike doesn't die, instead, when his star fades away he wakes up to resume his life and go after Julia.

But here it is! I hope you enjoy it.**

**Session 2: Stray Dog Strut**

*Wild Wild West*

To the untrained eyes and ears, when one thinks of anime, you think giant eyes, cartoonish expressions, and over-the-top action sequences. People tend to think of the Big Three (for the uninitiated, those are Naruto, One Piece and Bleach). They don’t think of anime as having western influences or themes. As far as I know, Bebop was one of the first anime that very much so had a Western feel to it. You had contemporary shows like Trigun that rivaled Bebop as far as “being Western” was concerned, but it really was Bebop that came onto the scene and became the really definitive “western” anime. As a result, Bebop was established as the “gateway” anime for many American viewers.  

“Stray Dog Strut” really sets Bebop up as Western in both tone and influence. By this, I mean this episode establishes Bebop as Western in the “old West” meaning, complete with our beloved Big Shot Bounty Hunters (more on that later). At the same time, it is Western in that its overall style (music, action, characters) are all very Americanized. But once again, more on that later.

It may seem like a pretty obvious observation, but the title itself: Cowboy and Bebop embody the series’ dual Western nature. The “cowboy,” of course, representing the Old West, whereas the “bebop” signifies the jazzy, American spin put on it. 

Regarding the episode at hand, “Stray Dog Strut” contrasts itself with the previous episode both in tone and in the number of characters introduced. Although one thing I have always found a bit odd was the fact that the scene immediately following Abdul Hakim’s introduction—the shots of Mars from space—were extremely reminiscent of some of the beginning scenes from the previous episode; but, of course, that’s just a little observation. 

There were two primary observations I made throughout the episode regarding the Western style. As previously mentioned, Bebop is a series of contrasting and conflicting styles. In this episode, the first conflict I noticed was the sheer number of (speaking) characters introduced. In “Asteroid Blues,” we have Jet, Spike, Asimov, his lover (still don’t know her name…), the bartender/drug dealer, and the trio of grizzled old dudes. Here, we see the villain of the week—Abdul Hakim—the men chasing him, Jet, Spike, Punch &amp; Judy, the Professor (or whatever), the bug-drinking guy in the bar, the dude with the suitcase, the pet store lady, Ein, the bickering truck guys (one of whom reminds me of Ravi from Planetes), the kids Hakim threatens, and the street man with the tracker bird. 

Most of these are one-scene characters, and aside from Ein, Spike, Jet and Punch &amp; Judy, we don’t see most of them again. The point I’m trying to make with regards to the unusual number of speaking characters is that it contrasts with the typical cast of a Western. Going off my knowledge of Old Western films, there’s the typical lone wanderer, perhaps his sidekick, a damsel in distress, maybe some Indians or train robbers, and a mishmash of town folk. Granted, my knowledge of Old Western films is fairly limited. Anyway, it takes the tradition of a Western having a relatively small cast and turns it on its head with the number of new characters. 

The second was, again, a great contrast from the first episode, this time in tone. Whereas “Asteroid Blues” was at all times either dark or action-packed, “Stray Dog Strut” was much more light-hearted. That is to say, it’s not just more light-hearted in terms of dialogue or characters; the colors and visual style of every scene is so much brighter, so much more alive than in “Asteroid Blues.” But where the humor really comes into play is in the context of the series as a whole. There are dark episodes of Bebop (see: “Ballad of Fallen Angels”) and there are very light-hearted episodes of Bebop (see: this one) and there are just plain weird episodes of Bebop (see: “Pierrot le Fou,” “Toys in the Attic”).

Where it conflicts with the series’ Western roots is the fact that Bebop so well balances its humor with action, suspense and drama. Your average Western series (note: average) isn’t so well balanced. Likewise, an Old Western film is typically void of humor or even happiness (see: Clint Eastwood). It’s just unusual for a Western to have such a sense of humor without it being overpowering or out of place.

Without it sounding too much like a review, “Stray Dog Strut” is easily one of my favorites. I need to mention the standout songs from the episode: “Want It All Back” and “Bad Dog No Biscuit.” It’s always a pleasure to watch this one, and even more so to observe the series’ Western roots so early in the series.

1.) When spike goes in knowing its a trap, he says:
&gt;I'm not going there to die, I'm going to find out if i'm really alive.

I feel like i'm so close to getting this but I can't articulate my thoughts.

2.) Why does Spike say ""Bang"" at the end? I can't tell whether he was playing around, whether it was foreshadowing from ""Sympathy for the Devil"", or whether he finally understood what Wen said (from that same episode). It makes me really sad but I can't explain why.

I'm trying to figure out why.

I heard that they dropped him because he was so poorly received, and that frightens me more because the way hollywood is now they'll probably say to the guys who pick him ""you had your chance now put in shia labeouf and michael bay"".

abrupt to me.

4. What does Spike's last word ""Bang"" mean?
