It brought back the close encounters of the first season and the emotion of the second without cutting to any scenes of Andrea and the governor taking care of Woodbury. 
At times it even seems like there are two shows in season 3: the slow-paced, dull Woodbury drama and the fast-paced, gritty prison action. Only when I look back on season one, do I realize how much better the show was before Woodbury became half of the show. Does anyone else think that Woodbury is keeping the show from being as good as it used to be?

Edit: I like the conflict between the prison and Woodbury, I just think the switching between the two is not the best direction for the show. (Just to clear that up)

**Please keep subreddit rules in mind when submitting content:**

Reposts are against subreddit rules to keep content fresh. This is a rather large subreddit for a rather large media inkwell, there should be plenty of content without having to repost things from two weeks ago.

On top of this anything not directly related to TWD might be subject to being removed. This includes but is not limited to screenshots (FB, YouTube, Twitter, texts, etc), generic memes and reaction gifs, and generic zombie content.


Feel free to message us moderators if you have suggestions or concerns about these.

A reminder:

We ask that you do not share illegal stream sites and torrents *on* the subreddit.

If you need to share these types of things please just use PMs or join us on the IRC channel (mentioned below).

We simply ask this to maintain the subreddits legitimacy towards the show and its creators for past and future events (like AMAs and contests).

----

A reminder II: Electric Boogoloo:

Reposts are against subreddit rules to keep content fresh.  This is a rather large subreddit for a rather large media inkwell, there should be plenty of content without having to repost things from two weeks ago.

On top of this anything not directly related to TWD might be subject to being removed.  This includes but is not limited to screenshots (FB, YouTube, Twitter, texts, etc), generic memes and reaction gifs, and generic zombie content.

Feel free to message us moderators if you have suggestions or concerns about these.

----

**EDIT: IT APPEARS SNOONET IS DOWN AT THE MOMENT.   I APOLOGIZE FOR THE INCONVENIENCE, US MODS HAVE NO CONTROL OVER SNOONET, HOPEFULLY IT WILL COME BACK ONLINE**

Join us on IRC for live discussion. We allow stream links to be shared on IRC, but not on the subreddit. Server: irc.snoonet.org Channel: #thewalkingdead

Reposts are against subreddit rules to keep content fresh. This is a rather large subreddit for a rather large media inkwell, there should be plenty of content without having to repost things from two weeks ago.

On top of this anything not directly related to TWD might be subject to being removed. This includes but is not limited to screenshots (FB, YouTube, Twitter, texts, etc), generic memes and reaction gifs, and generic zombie content.

You made an AMA request for Norman Reedus and I pulled all my resources together to contact both his manager and Norman personally. I can't go into many details here, but I've just heard back from his manager and right now Norman isn't really capable of doing an AMA since he is a very busy individual. We certainly did get his attention though, so maybe one day it will happen.

I didn't make this post just to let you guys down, though. I've gotten pretty good at this sort of thing and I have almost direct contact with most of the cast of The Walking Dead. From the cast of The Walking Dead, who else would be your preferred actor to do an AMA?

Edit: Keep in mind that it helps if the actor is active on sites like Twitter, Facebook, etc. It also helps if they have an official website with a contact page.

It is becoming increasingly clear that the two factions of the prison and Woodbury cannot peacefully coexist.  Bullets have been fired, and causalities have been suffered (Poor out some of your 40oz for our homey Axel).  As a result we have been left with a lot of questions: has Rick finally stepped down as mayor of Crazytown?  Does Michonne possess the facial muscle capabilities to express joy?  How will Carol's happiness be stifled next?

We'll just have to find out together as we watch this week's episode!

I posted sometime last week on a thread and was told that I should do an AMA by a few people, and with the help of Edify we set up a time and place and everything and here we are! I'm not sure who would actually be interested in what I'm up to, but if anyone wants to ask the smallest character in the history of the show anything I'm all ears!

Real quick, edify asked if there was any charity organization that I wanted to bring awareness to, and while I have your ear I have two that I would really appreciate you guys checking out: 

*  My big sister was Diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis not too long ago and it would mean a lot if you guys would take a look around the [National MS society](http://www.nationalmssociety.org/index.aspx) and do what you can to help out. 
* On top of that Laurie and Norman are really involved in this charity for Pancreatic Cancer called [The Lustgarten Foundation.](http://www.lustgarten.org/) 
Any help at all you guys want to give for these great charities would be amazing.

I believe that's all for now, ~~I wanted to go ahead and open the Post for questions, but last I announced, I wouldn't be able to begin answering until 10AM Pacific time.~~

The fire has definitely died down, but if anyone ever wants to know anything that wasn't answered, or if you just don't feel like scrolling through and want to ask again, definitely feel free to message me or comment on this post, I'll periodically check back to make sure no question goes unanswered.
