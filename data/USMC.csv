I work as a bouncer here in Jersey at a pretty popular nightclub. Now there really is no military presence around here so I never expect to run into anything military related. I was working my shift standing watching the crowd making sure no fights were going on. Then our dancers come walking in and some guy is with them(never seen this guy before). The first thing I see are dog-tags hanging outside this guys shirt. So immediately I am already pissed at seeing this but wait it gets better! Then I am looking at him to find more details and I shit you not this guy is wearing black boots and has his pants bloused.

So I start to ask the guy some questions

Where did you learn to blouse your boots? - Whats a blouse?

So are you in the military? - (Points to his dogtags)

What branch? - I am a Marine

Oh what MOS? - RECON

Oh who were you with? - errrrrr 1st platoon 2 battalion division 4

Did you deploy? - Hell yea, I went to chechn..... Iran...... Some other secret places

OK so at this point I already know this guy is full of shit. I simply waited till the dancers were taking a break and he was with them. Informed them the guy was a scumbag liar and was never a Marine. To which they defended him saying he was (I think he was dating one of them). But I kicked his ass out of the club and the dancers were pissed at this point and complained to the owner. This is the best part, The owner is also a Former Marine and backed me up 100%",,False,self,t5_2qswv,1370767569.0,,,True,t3_1fz2gg,http://www.reddit.com/r/USMC/comments/1fz2gg/had_me_one_of_those_fake_marine_encounters_tonight/,

Enjoy.",evilpettingz00,104,13,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/USMC/comments/1k3yc7/im_bored_feeling_nostalgic_heres_my_favorite/,"The CIA had a top secret mission to accomplish. It was so secret they couldn’t even trust their own agents to conduct it. Having no other option, they decided to pull from the armed services as it was an all-volunteer force that is severely underpaid so they MUST be dedicated enough for this mission. 
They found the most badass Army Ranger they could find. They then approached one of the most savage and decorated Navy SEALS. They thought for sure one of these two would be the one for the mission, but just for good measure, they went to a Marine chow hall and grabbed the dirtiest motherfucker in there. They didn’t bother approaching the Air Force…

Now, they still had to put these men through a “test.” So they brought them to a secret base in the Nevada desert and staged a scenario. They would give each man a gun full of blanks, assure them that it was loaded with real bullets and test their patriotism. 

The first to go was the Ranger. They gave him the gun and told him that inside the next room was America’s greatest enemy. He must go in there and kill them. The Ranger charged into the room, weapon at the ready. He was shocked to see his mother calmly sitting at the table. He lowered his weapon, believing it to be full of real rounds, and exited the room crying.
“I don’t care if what you say is true, I can’t kill my own mom.” He told the agents. They assured him he was a good man, and that this was only a test, but told him he wasn’t right for this mission. He took his mom and went home.

Next up, the SEAL was given the same brief, same fake weapon, and charged into the room. Sitting at the table was his sister. He froze, and immediately exited. 
“If she is what you say then you’ll have to get someone else to do it. Not me.” 
The agents revealed the test, assured him he was a good man, but sent him and his sister home. 

Next was the Marine. The agents were a bit nervous now as he was the last candidate left. They gave him the gun and the same instructions. The Marine barreled through the door, only to see his wife sitting at the table. There was silence. The agents outside began to think this experiment was a failure, until they heard two gunshots. “Success!” They shouted, but then they were horrified to hear screaming and banging. They ripped open the door and saw the Marine covered in blood.
“What- what the hell happened?!” They asked in shock.
“You fuckin’ idiots gave me a gun full of blanks! I had to kill the bitch with a chair!”

TL;DR: fucking yut!

The lines pretty long so it's looking like I'm gunna be stuck with this guy for a bit so I resort to vague grunts and one word answers while playing on my phone.

 Then I made the fatal mistake of disclosing the fact I was a Vet. Instantaneously this guys eyes light up, he felt he had found a kindred spirit, no he wasn't also a vet he was a raging racist and apparently my prior service made me also a racist......

This man proceeds to go on a 10 min rant about the gays, mexicans, and blacks that he ended in ""now I'm not racist, I just think there is a difference between niggers and black people"" (which obviously there was no difference to this guy). 

So I respond back ""yea dude, totally, like there is a difference between Americans and 'Muricans."" Which the guy agrees to immediately then pauses to look at me suspiciously........... 

""What's that?""
 ""Oh, you know; there's real Americans who understand that we are a nation thats built on personal freedom and individual progress....."" 
""Sure, sure.""
 ""And then there are 'Muricans who whine, moan, and bitch about how everyone else is responsible for there complete lack of worth, and that it's not there fault there lazy and decided never to make anything of there lives."" 

Suffice to say after the 30 seconds it took this guy to process what I had just sad, 1.5 seconds of searing anger, followed by .5 seconds of the realization that I was twice his size and he didn't stand a chance, he got out of line and walked away.

1375384464.0,60,self.USMC,1jihlc,This Motherfucker..........,theguy63221,76,16,130,http://www.reddit.com/r/USMC/comments/1jihlc/this_motherfucker/,"/u/Ankalagon is shitting up reddit with his ""I was totally a Marine"" bullshit and making us actually look bad.  So I have compiled a list of his shit and placed here.  Flaming knife hand this shitbag into oblivion.

Cute story.

&gt;This happened to me when I was in the Marines, so I checked the uniform of the guy who put their laundry in place of mine and realized it was a junior from another platoon. I put mine back in and threw theirs onto the floor (which was somewhat dirty (and now muddy). Then I sat on top of the dryer with my clothes in it, cracked open a book and waited. They came in, looked at all their clothes on the floor, uttered, ""What the fuck..."" then looked up at me and I got to stare them down. They just picked up their clothes and left, didn't even put it in another dryer. 

Then there is this Gem.

&gt;This isn't a college dorm story but I'm sure it goes here. Unlike most of my friends from high school who went on to higher education, I joined the Marine Corps. After bootcamp and then School of Infantry, I was stationed in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii on the isle of Oahu. Up to this point, the only authority figures my peers and I had were drill instructors and SOI instructors. We arrived on the lawn of our new barracks in our alpha uniforms with gritted teeth expecting more of the usual rough treatment we'd become accustomed to. Then I saw him. On the third floor of the barracks a crowd had gathered on the balcony. Everyone had beers in their hands and a couch was tossed over the balcony. On the couch wearing a kevlar and flak jacket and holding his fist victoriously to the sky in a manner that would suggest he was riding Falkor from the Never-ending story was a man who would later be identified as my squad leader and for all intents and purposes, my new boss. The couch broke into various pieces upon the lawn but my squad leader rolled for a ways before standing up again, dusted himself off and went back inside with applause and cheers from the upper deck. This same night it comes to pass that the duty NCO, who is the man in charge of the barracks, comes down and finds my peers and I and assigns us each to our rooms and tells us that we are under orders to remain in the barracks for our first night. So I walk into my room and there's already someone inside, having wild sex with a chick. Now at this point, I'm 18 years old and I must have had an unsuccessful high school life because I was a virgin, so it was definitely awkward. I introduced myself, explained that I was new there and I offered to leave the room so they could have privacy, but the NCO who was right outside insisted I had to remain in my assigned room for the first night. It was his ass on the line if we disappeared. For some reason the nude couple in my room both found me terribly interesting. They were both hammered but they stopped mid-sex, and butt-naked and came over insisting that we all have a long talk to get to know each other. So I chat with the naked couple for about an hour before finally hitting the hay and they decide to finish doing the nasty in the bed right beside me. My virgin eyes lock onto the ceiling in what had to be one of the most awkward nights of my life. 

So you have to pass the colorblind to get into the Corps......SMH

&gt;And yet, as someone who served, I specifically remember the colorblind test we all had to pass as part of the initial physical before bootcamp.

Casually just found himself as a Corpsman out of no where.

&gt;Like all clueless teenagers, I had no idea what to do with my life. Didn't want want an Office Space situation where my life has no meaning so I joined the Marine Corps to think about it before I dug my college debt-hole. Ended up being stationed in Hawaii. Surfed, partied and lived the good life there. Did two tours and one day while responding to an IED attack, found myself wrist deep in people's abdomens because the corpsman (field medic) needed an extra set of hands. Purpose found. Today I'm finishing up my undergrad in cellular biology at UT and gearing up for medical school.

Then of course we have this.  This guy could write a fantasy novel.

&gt;It's debatable to say that you make less money in the marine corps. For one, as a married marine he will be given a home to live in for free, and not have to pay bills or taxes. He will have access to shopping districts on bases that are tax free which will sell pretty much everything. His paycheck will be less, but he will be given a bonus every four years. To give you an idea of how much, I was an infantry rifleman in the marines (enlisted, not officer) and in 2008 when my enlistment was up as a corporal my reenlistment bonus was in the neighborhood of 90k. Furthermore, if you retire after 20 years, you make 50% of whatever your pay grade is at retirement for the rest of your life. 75% after 30 years. I'm going to college myself now and my current employer retired after 20 yrs from the air force and decided to start a restaurant. He's been doing that for 15 years now. Between his retirement checks and his income from his second career, he has a 4-story house, bought houses for his 2 kids, and is currently worth around 6 million dollars. The military has a lot to offer, if you take advantage of it all.

There are more I am sure in his history but I had to draw the line on this one.

&gt;Duuude I was in Fox Co 2/3 Marines and was in operation Red Wings (II).. I remember when we thought the mission to go rescue the last seal was possibly getting cancelled (50/50) and my commanding officer ignored the radio comm and prepped our company to roll out regardless. Fortunately the mission got approved anyway so no legal complications.

I dont know who this guy is talking to, but wow.......just wow.  I hate lying shitbags.",,False,self,t5_2qswv,False,,,True,t3_1jihlc,http://www.reddit.com/r/USMC/comments/1jihlc/this_motherfucker/,

And I gotta say, this is my first re-read that hasn't got me all fucked up. See, I was in the invasion (with Arty), and while I didn't see the exact same action First Recon did, the things that happened over there do stick with me. I guess a ""thank you"" to my local Vet Center is in order. 

One thing that is sticking, right now, is missing the Marines I was in Iraq with. The book does such a great job of describing their camaraderie and love for each other, that it really makes me miss those guys. Too bad we're all out now.

This is not about me complaining or whining about my experience in the Marine Corps. No I have not been NJP’d, have been screwed over (well no more than everybody on average) or have a bad taste in my mouth and can’t wait to get out.  I am about to do another 4 years,0311, I have deployed a few times including Afghanistan. Like I said, I would like for this to be a serious discussion about your experiences and time in. 



1)	How commands have a tendency to label Marines that are getting out “shitbags”, even insult them and then throw them out instead of trying to set them up for success in the real world




2)	The need to correct Marines for stupid and ridiculous things. 
For example, I was walking down by Main side in Pendleton and I see some guy waiting to take the bus and he is wearing a normal baseball cap backwards. I think about correcting him but then I ask myself, “Is this bringing shame on the Marine Corps, or is it diminishing of those that gave the ultimate sacrifice?” No? Ok then, what is the big deal? I kept walking and went about my day. 



3)	Being so proud of being a Marine that you feel the need to cover your car in Moto stickers, leave your blues cover in your car all year and hate anyone that bad talks the Marine Corps.
I’ll leave those here to hopefully get this discussion going, please feel free to add anything you would like.

""SURF CITY,NC - Authorities in Pender County said the man wanted for an assault on a taxi driver over the weekend has turned himself into a mental health facility. Video released from a Surf City cab comany shows the brutal beating on one of its drivers over the weekend.Now, the suspect from the video has identified himself as 30-year-old Adam Kinosh. Kinosh is a Marine stationed at Camp Lejeune. Surf City police said that Gy. Sgt. Kinosh was picked up at the Trailer Bar; the timestamp on the video displays the time of the assault as around 1 a.m. Sunday. The video was released by Island Cab Company owner Rex Bowen. A driver of that cab has been identified as Charles Hawkesworth. According to Brittany Ann Schwartz, J.R.’s girlfriend, Hawkensworth received multiple fractures to his face including a broken bone under his eye socket, and bones around his sinuses. Police investigators believe that Kinosh thought he was being ripped off on the cab fare, and that's what led to the assault. Kinish has not yet been arrested, but police expect him to be charged with assault inflicting injury and communicating threats. Monday morning, Kinosh was at the Oak Mental Evaluation Center.""",,True,nsfw,t5_2qswv,False,,,True,t3_zoueh,http://www.reddit.com/r/USMC/comments/zoueh/liveleakcom_american_taxi_driver_beaten_by/,

This morning I got to formation five minutes early.  As i walk up to the formation some Staff Sergeant stops me and asks:

Staff Sergeant:  ""What time is your formation?""

Excited to get recognition from a staff NCO I respond

Me: ""In five minutes Staff Sarnt!""

Staff Sergeant:  ""Yeah well that makes you ten minutes late then doesn't it?""

Before I could answer his question he cut me off with a six minute impassioned speech about being punctual and Marine Corps etho's and I think he mentioned Chesty Puller a few times.  The Staff Sergeant was even kind enough to give this speech at a high volume, so my platoon could benefit from his teachings.  All in all it was a great experience that made me a better Marine, although it did make me a minute late for formation.  My platoon Sergeant understood.

Thanks for reading ooorah yut kill devil dogs!!

But merely for the hopes that given the same scenario, you would attempt to do the same. I see a very disheveled homeless man with a sign saying ""Homeless Vet, Need Help"". I pull over, get out and talk to the man. Darrel is his name. I ask if he is a vet, he says yes. I say prove it. He shows me his ID. Retired Marine. Corporal. I then proceed to tell him to standby and hit the nearest atm. I hand him 5 brand new 20 dollar bills. I instruct him, get a room, a shower and a hot meal. Its the least I can do brother. Now im not one to get sappy, but his look of gratitude was more than enough to falter even the toughest of the tough. I ask him where hes going, he says no. I know all too well the pride a retired Marine carries. I hand him my number on the back of a receipt for amps and cigarettes. I tell him if he needs anything to give me a call. He picks up his bag and walks down fresno st. Hopefully, to do as instructed. Now I will probably never know what will to become of this man. But I know I did what I could to give him perhaps a couple of days rest. Now again im not fishing for any sort of praise or attaboys, I just hope that if you see one of your fellow brethren in such a situation, you would do anything you can to help out a fellow Marine in need.",,False,self,t5_2qswv,False,,,True,t3_1ikddc,http://www.reddit.com/r/USMC/comments/1ikddc/always_help_your_fellow_marines_out_gents/,

 Here is an article about the situation: http://www.change.org/petitions/u-s-government-officials-get-u-s-marine-jon-hammar-released-from-a-mexican-prison

Over the last couple of weeks, the story has gained ground and has been featured on the local media stations in Florida, and once mentioned on FoxNews.

There are several petitions going around to nudge the government to do something about this. The more publicity we get the better.  We really need this to spread and to get more people to sign this petition. There are two petitions that I am aware of:
https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/help-bring-jon-hammar-home/VLpNf47b?utm_source=wh.gov&amp;utm_medium=shorturl&amp;utm_campaign=shorturl
and
http://www.change.org/petitions/u-s-government-officials-get-u-s-marine-jon-hammar-released-from-a-mexican-prison

Please spare a few minutes and sign the petitions. Help get him home!

1368037626.0,30,self.USMC,1dy31e,Any Marines want to help out a novelist aspiring for authenticity?,LadyErrata,39,9,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/USMC/comments/1dy31e/any_marines_want_to_help_out_a_novelist_aspiring/,"I know some of these are tricky and in-depth, but I thought there can't be a much better place to ask them than here. I appreciate any help!

The character I'm working on is a woman in her mid-late twenties, who would have signed up when she was 19 or so. It's modern, so this would have been about 8 or 9 years ago.

I understand that all women go to the Parris Island base for training regardless of where they're from, but that men are split between East coast and West coast boot camps. Mostly just checking that this is true.

My questions are mainly concerning roles in the Marines for women. I saw an article that said they allow women to take some physical test that, if passed, would allow them to take on active combat roles, but so far none have passed. I'm not interested in making a character who goes above and beyond like that, so it's fine to have her do other things. But I don't know what jobs are common for women to take. I assumed some kind of mechanic or ordinance technician would be appropriate.

If she works in a job like that, where would she be likely to be stationed? Would she be in the US, or abroad? What kind of work would she be doing, and if it would be on aircraft and things like that, what kind?

How common are women in the Marines? Are they really considered a rare breed, or is it more acceptable? Would you say they receive the same kind of treatment from their peers as the men do?

The other stuff is about ranks. I tried to read up on this, but it's a little confusing as I know very little about military ranks in general. I understand Marines are ""automatically"" promoted up to E-2, but after that it seems to be based on points awarded for various tests, as well as for time served, both in-rank and total served. Mainly I'm concerned with what kind of rank a woman could expect to achieve in 8-9 years of service, as someone who is maybe slightly above-average as far as intelligence and physical ability.

Finally, what kind of regulations are there for taking leave, and being discharged? Over the course of the story this character is going to be severely injured, unrelated to her job, to the point of needing metal rods in her legs to repair broken femurs. I assume she'd be given sufficient time to recover from such an injury, but would she be allowed to return to her regular job after that, or would she probably be assigned to something less physical?

How long does it take to process leave, assuming she's assigned in the States and needs to leave for an emergency?

She's going to need to leave the Marines at some point, so what kind of reasons are considered acceptable? How long does it take to process discharge?

**EDIT: I can't believe the response I've gotten from everyone here; you've all been outrageously helpful and informative. I'll probably be picking the brains of a few more people here who've been awesome enough to offer detailed help.

I actually went on a 3 mile moto run around the depot just for kicks. I actually slowed my pace and looked around, so no one on guard, and then found myself sprinting towards it for like 5 seconds. 

When I regained my composure I could hear the DI's in there just bending the fuck outta those poor recruits... it sounded like murder LOL.

He claimed to have gone to Parris Island for 16 weeks during the vietnam era and became an officer after he graduated MIT. He then claimed that he told his recruiter when he signed up that his goal was to ""be his boss"" and that his kill hat at PI told him that he'd eat his hat if he didn't become a general. Bull fuckin shit, right? I was so shocked but this guy just kept on going on how he was an 0311 then flew phantoms and was trained by navy seals! He claimed he retired last year after working in the Pentagon and I asked him if he ever met Gen Mattis. He was clueless as to who the man was. I acted like I had to be somewhere and left this assclown. He may have been old, but formulating that BS of a story is just disgusting.

We learned about it at boot camp and make references to Chesty all the time, but we didn't really get an actual first-hand description of what went on there (at least I never did).

The shit those guys went through is mind boggling. I kind of knew in the back of my mind that it was bad, but I had no idea it was THAT bad. I've been to Afghanistan twice, both with 3/7, and I saw plenty of shit, but I *still* can't imagine what it was like for them (mainly because of the cold). Fucking crazy.

So yeah, if you want to learn some more about one of the greatest battles/campaigns in Marine Corps history and gain some perspective on it, *definitely* check out that movie. Like I said, it's on Netflix. It's around an hour and a half long. I'd definitely recommend it.

My neighbor was an LST crewman who was present at both the D-Day and Okinawa landings. While on the LST for the Okinawa landings a Marine Sargent approached him with a skull. My neighbor was well known for his artistry and painting ability.

""Here, I want you to paint something on this skull."" Said the Marine.

My neighbor asked what he wanted, but more importantly, where did he get the skull?

""I killed this soldier at Guadalcanal just as he was about to charge into my foxhole, I cut his head off and buried it so all the flesh would decompose off. When we were about to leave I dug it back out and boiled off what was left. I want you to paint all of the pacific on the back of the skull, with marks of all the landings I have been in.""

He then provided my neighbor with a list of the landings.

My neighbor was more than a little bit disturbed and asked ""what are you planning on doing with it?""

The Marine smiled.

I'd love to hear back from some current and former Marines about what they think.

TLDR what do you think of this design?

Here it is:

On the 30th of March it will be the first anniversary of the death of one of my Best Friends. He was KIA in Afghanistan 3 weeks before he was supposed to come home. I've had the worst year dealing with it and am once again sleepless with the anniversary fast approaching. I've had an idea of getting a tattoo to memorialize him and have a design that a mutual friend has come up with but before I get it, I know that tradition and respect is number 1 in the USMC. (I am a civilian) What things should I AVOID in this tattoo?

the design is this: The Globe, Anchor and Eagle, with his name and dates above it, his regiment and location on the sides, and ""All Gave Some, Some Gave All"" below it. Its going to be in grey-scale and purple to represent his purple heart. The script would only be done in traditional print. It will be going on my left shoulder blade just above my heart.

If there is ANYTHING in this that is not OK, please let me know! I'm an open book for this only want to show the utmost respect for him. I knew this great man for a decade and wear his memorial black dog tag everyday. He is my hero and I want to do this to literally wear my heart and respect on my sleeve.

1333264572.0,25,self.USMC,rnmj5,My Boot Camp Story... just wanted to share.,Kurann,26,1,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/USMC/comments/rnmj5/my_boot_camp_story_just_wanted_to_share/,"Here we go, my nearly 6 month long boot camp experience &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

I shipped to boot (MCRD, San Diego) in April 2009, completed Phase 1 with a few trips to medical, mostly during swim week, for pain in my hip region (I ended up completing 4th-2nd class in one day) and initial PFT sucked hard.  During phase 2, I had to go to medical twice, again for hip pain (by this time they had me on Naproxen, an anti-inflammatory) and the second time they ordered a bone scan to check for stress fractures.  Surprise, they found 7, the worst of which was in my hip.

Got transferred to MRP on the first day of phase 3 where I ""healed"" for 13 weeks.  Completed my PFT to go back to training, and got back into training.  I completed everything with growing pain in my hip each day after beginning training again until the second day of the Crucible where I was having problems walking and my Senior Drill Instructor had me see the Corpsman and a Physical Therapist before I continued with the Crucible.

Since I had spent so long in MRP, he asked me what would happen if my stress fracture had reopened.  I knew of the two options for my chain of command, either back to MRP and a very quick ELS or they could choose to carry me through the last few hours of the Crucible and Graduation where I would go to BMP (Basic - or Broken - Marine Platoon) to finish healing.  Not to ring my own bell or anything, but being an older recruit (I was mid 20's at the time) and therefore more mature and being moto as fuck, my DI's and SDI's from both training platoons and MRP and my Series Commander from my first Training Company (who was transferred to the Special Training Company after I left) liked me enough that they wanted to keep me around.  So my current SDI wanted to keep me through Graduation and I listened to him fight for me up the chain of command.

I ended up getting dropped back to MRP at the recommendation of my Chief Drill Instructor.  So back I went to MRP purgatory on M-2 because there wasn't a way back from Camp Pendleton till the buses came to bring everyone back.  My Drill Instructors and Senior Drill Instructor were shocked to see me back, especially after I told them my story  (If you are unaware of policy at the time, you only were required to complete 4 hours of the Crucible to qualify for graduation).  I took up the billet of Head Scribe for my SDI cause I already knew how MRP worked.

Now I'm waiting on my clearance from Medical to be ELS'd cause I lost all motivation and im just like [FUCK IT](http://qkme.me/3oklho).  So I'm going out with the almost healed recruits for PT/PFT for clearance to return to training and I was telling my story to my Series Commander and the Senior Drill Instructor for PCP (Physical Conditioning Platoon) and they were commenting on how shitty it was that I got dropped again that far into the Crucible (I later read my paperwork and it said I did not complete 4 hours).  The SDI from PCP was telling me that the same CDI tried to drop a recruit to PCP for failing swim qual too (for those that don't know, you could not do that then; the recruit just gets special training and they try again later in training).  After I was in the Early Separation Platoon waiting on my ELS paperwork to come through, I was doing a work party at the dojo and met the former CDI from my second training platoon.  He asked me why I had my high and tight while I was in ESP.  I told him my story and he was pissed, not only that I got fucked, but that he trained the current CDI who was not doing his job correctly.  Finally, on my very last day, my DI's from my original training platoon saw my in my civvies and asked why I was still there and going home, told them the story and they...were...pissed...  While I was standing there, I was at attention, like a good recruit, and they told me I didn't have to stand at attention for them anymore, I was a civilian again.  So I switched to parade rest, they said I didn't have to do that either, to which I responded ""Do you Gentlemen not deserve the respect of being Sergeants in the United States Marine Corps?  Civilian or not, I think you do.""  They said I would have made a good Marine.  To this day, I extend the respect deserved to any military member I recognize as a member of the armed forces.

So, /USMC, that's my story.  If I felt like I could handle phase 1 again without loosing my goddamn mind, I'd go back and try again.

As much shit as I talk and joke around about the Marine Corps as a whole, I miss my buddies. No matter what was going on we had each others back. Took me a while to realize that misery breeds brotherhood and that is something you find when you get out with people you meet.

After coming to realizing what was going on and moving on, I have adapted fairly well. I enjoy the freedom of doing what I want, when I want with my family. Got a really good job, got married, have a baby boy. Everything seems to be going great except one thing.

The thing I am struggling with is my language. I have gotten it under control by really thinking before I speak but I am not going to lie, it is rough.

Don't get me wrong, I think that the 0311 is the backbone, but I also think that a backbone can't function without the rest of the body. 
How is the infantry going to know where to go without Intel?

I guess what I'm asking is, should I save myself the trouble and go Air Force, or should I just take the shit, and be the best Marine I can be in the Intelligence field?",,False,self,t5_2qswv,False,,,True,t3_vbmob,http://www.reddit.com/r/USMC/comments/vbmob/does_the_marine_corps_really_revolve_around_0311/,

I wanted to tell all of you because pursuing this interest of mine opened my eyes to all you do.  I see Marine Corps stuff every where I look now.  T shirts, bumper stickers, in the news, on the sidelines of football games.  When I see them I feel proud, and not because of something that I have done, but because I know that person is more brave than almost anyone I know and that makes me proud to be an American.

You are all the best of the best and I appreciate your service.

Not joining the Corps has ultimately made me feel shame, but I know that you all will continue to protect us and just keep on being Devil Dogs.  Thanks Again!  Sorry I cannot join you all.

I was just an aircraft mechanic. The only combat I ever saw was on CNN. I wasn't ever hard core moto or anything. I was just a shit bag air-wing marine with middle of the road pros and cons. I didn't really have much of a problem when I first got out in '06, but as the years have started to go by I've been feeling a bigger and bigger rift between myself and my co-workers and friends. The lack of accountability and piss poor work ethic I find in 90% of the people I work with leaves me seething. My civilian friends all seem to share a perspective on life that seems completely shallow and pointless. I can't seem to keep a job for very long. Not because I get fired, just the opposite. I keep getting promoted. In every job I've had since leaving the military I am offered a management position. As soon as I accept it however, I find myself disgusted with the prospect of leading a group of shit bag civilians. Before long I find myself looking for a new job. It's six in the morning right now, I've been lying awake all night trying to contain this rage that has been bothering me all day. I don't have anything in particular to be pissed about right now. I've got a great marriage, my bills are all paid, I like where I live. I don't have anyone in particular that is pissing me off right now, but all I want to do is beat the living shit out of someone, anyone. I don't know why. This isn't the first night I've had this issue either. It's becoming a somewhat common event.

I'm pretty sure this is normal, and I'm mostly blowing off steam here, but I can't seem to shake the idea that I should reenlist. It's like I want to, but I feel like I shouldn't. It's very confusing.

They don't do a sufficient job of making the reader understand the physical and psychological toll that being part of a war like this can take. Typically they just talk about the exciting aspects of war, the intense firefights, capturing HVI's, and direct contact with the enemy.

I've been doing the whole 9-5 career thing but find something lacking. I'm getting to that age where it's becoming harder to take chances.

That being said, I'd like to challenge myself and serve my country. I'm primarily considering USMC 02 or Navy reserve IS or 8404 HM.

From what I've seen on Reddit, it seems like most AD guys don't think much of reservists. I'm just having a hard time gauging the attitude. Is this a sort of hazing? Or genuine resentment? Comment section bias? (the idea that people may generally be more negative online) 

Maybe not a great analogy, but I played a few varsity sports in HS. We would sometimes 'big brother' or razz the JV guys, but at the end of the day they still came out to play hockey, football, etc, placing them in higher esteem than someone who, say, didn't compete in sports. Everything was good-natured. Is that similar to the prevailing attitude? 

I train MMA with quite a few pro fighters. They don't think less of training alongside people with other careers. They also have more respect for the banker or lawyer getting punched in the face than the guys who just go jogging.

I've seen countless remarks from guys saying 'my buddy is reserve and says it sucks. He really regrets not going AD.' Yet, I've yet to see a reservist post the same sentiment. I'm just not seeing, 'Reserve here, it sucks. I regret not going AD. Go active duty if you want to be a real Marine.' Where is the disconnect?

I'm just an average guy looking to be a part of something bigger than myself. Being a reservist may be my only feasible and best option to do that. It just seems odd someone willing to serve would still need to defend that logic. It seems like this attitude could really discourage people from becoming involved in the service. 

Any perspective would be much appreciated.

Recently, I went to a motorcycle event/get-together at a local food joint. I don't own a motorcycle jacket at the moment so I settle for whatever I have that fits the weather and offers some sort of protection. What I usually wear is [this](http://imgur.com/o7niv). Back when I was in college I found out due to my lack solo living experience, I was ill-equipped for the cold weather. So being the poor college student I was, I strolled down to the Goodwill nearby to see what I can find. I happened across this jacket which honestly offered a much better material, protection and warmth that the other jackets there, so I picked it up and have worn it since when I needed it. I have never really gotten comment about it until now, which was normal as I never meant to offend anyone.

Going back to the motorcycle event. As I was about to leave to go back home, a group of bikers came up to me to ask if the jacket was mine and if I was in the Marines. I said yes it was mine but no I was not in the Marines, I had just picked it up at the store because it was a good coat. They proceeded to get up in my face (quite loudly) that I was offending them by wearing it as they were all retired servicemen. Demanding that I take off the coat immediately and never wear it again, I responded that I couldn't and needed it for the ride home (I don't ride with just a t-shirt on). They were clearly very angry. I also mentioned that I was sorry and had no intention of offending but at the same time, that their offense to my clothing wasn't my problem, nor was I responsible for fixing their problem. I was just a man in a coat, that is all. They stated that I was breaking federal law by wearing and impersonating an officer (I was in no way attempting to impersonating an officer, nor do I think I could ever pass a Marine). And the kicker was after they realized I was not taking the coat off, they backed off and said that if they ever saw me again with the coat on, they'd ""kick my ass,"" all while taking photos of my bike. I nodded and respond with a simple ""okay"" and slipped on my gear and left as they glared at me.

I am somewhat unhappy at the aggressiveness and lack of politeness though I know that a reflection of the person, not the Marines. And their threat towards me all because they were offended seemed like a ridiculous escalation, not to mention not what I expected to hear from servicemen. Now I am iffy about wearing my coat around out of fear of offending someone to the point of violence. Nor do I want my bike to get trashed if they happen to recognize it in public again...

I guess I am curious how offensive a non-Marine wearing a Marine Coat is to more than just a group of motorcycle loving Marines. I know that this may very from person to person but some insight would be greatly appreciated.

**Edit** Thanks all for the input and insight. I really had no idea that this had such a huge significance behind it.

My friend is joining the Marines and ships off in August, he said I could join him in his workouts; as a female I know my requirements are lower, but I am planning on achieving greater. I started my work outs a week ago, and am going by a recruiting station next Saturday. I hope to come home with greater ambition to join, and information not only for myself, but to give to my family. I was hoping to receive tips from Marines who had a hard time with their family, and especially from female Marines, but all advice is welcomed. As far as what job I want as a Marine, I am not really sure. 
I've been doing my own IST work outs. Tonight I was able to do 20 sit ups in two mins, I aslo did 2 mins of butterfly kicks (didn't count) and did 30 push ups in 2 mins, as well as a minute of planking. I'm running after school tomorrow. I'd love for ANY and ALL work out plans; before last week, the only exercise I did was biking. (145 miles in one day about a month ago, but averaging 15miles a day now). 
Thanks! 

EDIT: accidently hit 0 twice.. and that zero makes a difference.


EDIT 2: 
Thanks everyone for the input. I went by the Marine station (and the Navy) today. 
I'm taking ASVAB with the Marines sometime next week. On the practice I received a 70.
If all my paper work goes through, I'll be going to boot camp in September/October. 
I appreciate everything everyone put it, and can't thank you enough.
I hope to make it as a Marine, and I hope to make you all proud.

Penzzoil is sponsoring a contest where they will give away a wheelchair adapted vehicle to an injured veteran that receives the most votes.  Personally I think its fucked that these guys aren't each provided a vehicle, but that is a longer story.

In full disclosure, I don't know Sgt. Seely personally.  My wife is very good friends with his wife and she sent me the message just a few minutes ago.  I am a mortard reservist, CPL type, who never deployed, but served '91 - '98 when there weren't any deployments for my unit.  I don't think that matters, but I wanted to get it all out on the table.

With that being said, if you could log in and vote for Sgt. Seely to get a wheelchair adapted vehicle then I would be very grateful.  For that matter, all of these guys deserve it, so vote for the one you feel is best.

It got me thinking that r/usmc doesn't seem to really discuss veterans groups. Is this something that was decided against some time ago or does the topic just never come up? Or maybe I'm just blind and haven't seen previous posts.
 
If it just hasn't been brought up maybe a discussion on the differences between all the groups and personal experiences of them is in order. 

I'd like to be clear in that I don't think one group is better than the other's or that I really have much of an opinion on them(due to a lack of experience). I haven't had a lot of exposure to veterans groups and I only recently found out about the league because a family member knew a member who contacted me.

I was curious to wonder what, in your opinion, is the most accurate portray of Marine life not on deployment, but at a duty station or a base/camp/fort? I apologize if I'm not clear, I don't really know military terminology.

I was watching A Few Good Men the other day. The movie contrasts the Navy's seemingly laid back lifestyle to the Marine's disciplined hardened approach. I was wondering if there is a better portrayal of this part of the Marine Corps (not a trial, but more of a POG desk job or so). I'm interested in seeing how formal interactions are, how things get done behind the lines, etc.

TL;DR: What movie accurately portrays Marine life NOT at the front lines (so not like Generation Kill, more like A Few Good Men)?",,False,self,t5_2qswv,False,,,True,t3_15j35q,http://www.reddit.com/r/USMC/comments/15j35q/best_hollywood_portrayal_of_marine_lifeduty/,

He wasn't getting any Marine response. I thought I'd post this here to see if any Marines here had an opinion. Thanks for reading.

""Dear Marines,
I want to ask a question about the Eagle, Globe and Anchor logo, but I want to preface this question by saying that I have the upmost respect for the Corps, and that this question is in NO WAY meant to be disrespectful to the Marine Corps. I know the EGA is near and dear to the hearts of every Marine, and I respect that.

So here goes...
The Eagle, Globe and Anchor is a great logo. Arguably, it's the coolest logo of all the U.S. military branches. However, the USMC prides itself as a fighting force - more specifically, that EVERY Marine is an Infantryman. With that in mind, Why is there not a Rifle in the EGA? 

Why not put a rifle (with a Ka-Bar type of bayonet) behind the globe at an angle to balance the Anchor? The Anchor is at an angle, why not cross it, behind the globe, with a Rifle with bayonet... the USMC is America's premier QRF (along with the Army's Airborne units). The USMC is a Combat oriented branch... why is there no weapon of any kind in the logo? Has there ever been any attempt to change/add to the EGA? 

Again, in NO WAY am I trying to disrepect the Corps or the EGA. It's just an honest question. Thanks.

Also, to any of you who may be heading into harms way in Afghanistan or Libya or anywhere else, God Bless and take care of yourselvs. Thanks for all you do for this nation.""",,False,self,t5_2qswv,False,,,True,t3_10b0nm,http://www.reddit.com/r/USMC/comments/10b0nm/an_army_friend_on_another_site_had_a_question/,

Nes (as he was called by friends) was trying to help his brother out (the brother had problems and Nes was letting him stay at his place). Apparently, there was an argument, and his brother shot him before turning the gun on himself.

Nes has two boys, and was a divorced single father. He didn't deserve this. I'm torn up. Now, my head is racing with the faces and names of all the other fellow Marines I knew that are no longer with us. The list is growing too long.

Nes was 40.

While was a SSgt and the Chief Traffic Accident Investigator at MCAS Tustin, Nes was a LCpl on the watch and often stood as gate sentry at the back gate which was right next to my quarters in base housing. I would often go out to talk to him, and he was a smart young man with big dreams and a wicked sense of humor. I reconnected with him a few weeks ago, and I was impressed by how far he'd come, what he'd accomplished, and his positive outlook on life and his future. I looked forward to more conversations with him. He was a good man, and an active member of his community's car scene.

It's a damn shame. Tragic.

I am on the verge of being discharged from the Delayed Entry Program because the Bureau of Navy Medicine has sat on its collective ass for months and months concerning an incredibly routine medical waiver, then has thrown every roadblock possible in the way. 

To give a little background, I am a 25 y/o graduate of The George Washington University in DC. I scored a 99 on the ASVAB and well above the cutoff off for Category IV languages on the DLAB. I have strong IST and PFT scores (265-280) and am in great shape. I tried to go officer for two years but didn't have the self-discipline to get my PFT up to a 285+ while working 40-50 hours a week in a professional job. I knew I wanted to be a Marine, and I'm not above working my way, so I enlisted and officially DEPed in January 25th, 2012. I'm not trying to brag or be a douche, I'm just trying to make the case that I'm a strong candidate.

All was looking rosy, until my initial physical and med clearance that I'd obtained through the OSO expired before I could ship. That meant I had to do the whole MEPS process over again. Fine, it should just be resubmitting my old medical info as nothing had changed right? WRONG. 

My eyesight is horrible, but my eyes are healthy and correctable to 20/20 or better. I've held off on getting LASIK because I didn't want to delay my medical clearance. Since my initial physical, one of my eyes had changed by a quarter point (I'm in the -7 range) and this triggered the need for a medical waiver. My physical was completed in July and my recruiter submitted the waiver immediately thereafter (my original shipdate was 8/13). Then SILENCE for three and a half months. It is now Thanksgiving and there has been no communication for BMED. The week after Thanksgiving they come back and ask for a full eye exam with dilation. I managed a 30 hour turnaround from getting the call that I needed and eye exam and having the full exam completed and results in my recruiter's hands. He resubmitted within 48 hours. Then... nothing. 

This morning I found out that they have come back for even more information. This means I'll be forcibly discharged from the DEP because I will have surpassed my 365 days by the time the get around to responding again.

Is there any way to put a boot up BMED's ass to speed them up? Does anyone know an alternative to being discharged from DEP?  My recruiter was going up to his district HQ today to try and sort things out, but that hasn't helped before. 
/whine
I gave up an awesome career in international development to serve my country. I've been waiting tables while in limbo for over a year. I gave up my apartment when I thought I was leaving in August (I was given two weeks notice that I wasn't leaving) and have been living my life week to week awaiting notice on this stupid waiver. I was told that I would ship within a week of it clearing... I realize the Marines are contracting. I'm surrounded by that debate every day here in DC (and living just blocks from the Commandant at 8th and I). But come the fuck on...

Should I be prepping my family for my deployment? or is it impossible to know until i'm actually there?

I went into the doctor, and they start asking me all kinds of questions about whether or not I've ever had asthma, to which I reply, no, of course not, I ran track and cross country, etc.  I don't have asthma, I didn't have it when I was little, and I don't have it now.

I even went to an ears, nose and throat specialist who told me I was fine.  

Basically, I'm worried that if I try to enlist, they will see that I was proscribed inhalers, even though I breathe fine and have exercised fine my whole life.  My questions are: will they be able to see that I have been given inhalers, even if I never needed them?  And also, does it matter that as a child I was never diagnosed with asthma and that I don't have it to this day?  I was never told ""you have asthma,"" the most the doctor said was ""maybe being sick brought some asthma symptoms to the surface.  Try these inhalers.""

i am 23 years old, swiss citizen, living in switzerland. i lived in Texas for about a year some years ago and i fell in love with the United States and the Marine Corps.
eversince, all i wanted, was to become a US Marine (yes, i have thought about the downsides as well, no need to lecture me).

the thing is, that i need a permanent resident card, aka greencard, in order to join.
the only way i could get one, as far as i know, would be through the greencard lottery. the chances to win are very slim (maybe that's why it's called a lottery).

does anyone know a faster and more reliable way to get a greencard and therefore being eligible to join?

i am willing to do (almost) anything.

While doing some research about my possible future in the military, I was researching which branch I could commission into. I was looking at either Navy, Army, or Marines. I realize each branch has their own culture, and there is a huge difference among them in what they actually do. 

I came across a person posting saying that the ""novelty of being a Marine wears off quick, go officer"" in response to a poster asking if one would rather be an Army officer or an enlisted Marine. I can't find the exact post, but I am paraphrasing here. I understand that there is that saying of ""once a Marine, always a Marine"". 

I guess my question is, what do you think of this? Does being a Marine truly wear off? If you were offered a better position, somehow say a magical commission in another branch, would you take it?

1352992630.0,11,self.USMC,138pzo,A few more questions about enlisting,BeastMode8128,13,2,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/USMC/comments/138pzo/a_few_more_questions_about_enlisting/,"I posted not too long ago with some questions about joining in my mid twenties. I liked the responses so I took the next step and started talking to the local recruiter. I took a practice ASVAB and scored a 97, which is good for me as I don't want infantry. Nothing against infantry, I just want to finish school and stay close to family. Here are where the questions kick in...

I have some (very few) credits towards an accounting degree and was hoping I could test into a financial MOS. The recruiter told me I could do that, but why not go bigger? He told me he could get me into anything I wanted, mentioned avionics and upon doing a little research, it seemed pretty interesting as well but so did a few other areas like intel in particular. If this is a chance for me to change career paths, I want to live up to my full potential, not just do accounting because it seems easy to me. Im pretty well rounded as far as math and tech/electronics go and have always had an interest in math and science. So to the question: What MOS would provide, not only the chance for more promotion, but also skills that would land me a good job after enlistment? Not just looking for the fast track to promotion, I'm just doing this for me as well as my family so I want to be setup to take care of them the best way possible. 

Question 2 is more of a legal question and not so long winded. Me and my gf of 4 years will be married by the time I enlist. I don't want to leave her with no benefits or help with bills (again, I'm joining to provide a better life for my family). My question is: If both of our names are on our lease, will the service members relief act allow me to put a hold on my lease or at least a portion of it while I'm at boot camp? By no means will this prevent me from enlisting, just delay me another 6-7 months while I try to get finances in order. 


I know these are probably questions a recruiter could answer but with working 60hrs/week, I have little to no time to work this out with them. Any info and/or resources would be greatly appreciated. 


Edit: Thank you for the feedback. I really do appreciate all the input. Whether its what I want to hear or not, it is all very honest and straight forward which is what I wanted. Maybe it's just me but, if every Marine is a rifleman, why not do more if I'm able? I don't mind stepping up to the plate and doing my part if that is what is required. When I was in HS and wanted to join, that is what I wanted to do. I had that ""warrior"" mentality where all I wanted to do was fight and blow s*** up. My priorities have changed with age, but that is still in me. If it came down to it, and I had to go fight, I would have no problem doing so. Maybe I've just heard too many stories of Infantrymen hating ""standing around, doing nothing."" I've read other post about Marines saying the part they hate most is 8 hours of doing nothing. Not being able to leave because they are on duty, but doing nothing while there. Maybe that is just a disgruntled Marine that is bored at that point in time, but why do that if I can have a job that will earn me experience after enlistment (or a good career within), go to school in my down time, and stay close to my lady and future family? It's not that I wouldn't want to fight if I needed to, just that I don't want to be stationed in a combat zone and feel like I'm not needed there, when I could be gaining transferable experience and not have to wait until I'm out to finish school. Especially if we're headed into peacetime... And I want the Marines because I want to hold myself to a higher standard. Mentally and physically.

To give some perspective; Rangers are held in even higher esteem to us than Force Recon are in the Corps, and in theory a male Soldier of ANY MOS can apply and be accepted. Rangers are awarded their coveted tab and if in a Ranger Regiment, can wear the tan beret (we have 4 kinds - green for SF, maroon for airborne, and black for regular jackoff). *They also gain the magical power to cause a woman to orgasm with nothing but a special look and slight nod.*
 
 To many line unit grunts, myself included, they are the people we dream of being. A Ranger is the ultimate Soldier capable of enduring anything mentally, and who have been pushed to their utter limits physically while asked to do things most of us would struggle with while well-rested, fed, and hydrated. They are hands down the best of the non-SF light infantry the Army can field(though our Ranger Regiments are SOCOM units). 
 
_____
 

 
&gt;Only **42% of soldiers that attempt the school at all eventually pass**, and most people **require an average of 3 attempts** (i.e. go back to your unit while seething over your failure and convince your CO that you deserve another chance, twice in a row). It's notorious within TRADOC for having one of the highest death rates of any school, but they've improved safety standards over the past few years. **~30 Marines are admitted Ranger school a year, and the competition for the slots is intense as they can't afford to send people who probably won't pass**. The **USAF gets 6 slots a year, and has a significantly lower pass rate**. Other branches may get slots, but I didn't find anything on anyone else managing to pass. 
 
&gt;To sum up the course - over 61 days in multiple environments and phases, the candidate basically sleeps for 5 hours of sleep a night at MAX **(average of ~0-3)**, is forced into a controlled near-starvation, has to ruck for most of the course, and is being hunted by OpFor elements who kick you from the school if they ""kill"" you. **The candidates have to organize themselves into groups and coordinate to counter-ambush the OpFor elements without a formal chain of command**- an E-4 with the right background and experience is more likely to be acknowledged as a unit leader than an O-1. It involves much much more, as well; including airborne jumps, helicopter rappel insertions, and coordinating Army-style gunship air support to name a few of the skills a Ranger has to learn and demonstrate over the course.
 
___
 
When Marines do get to go; they have to realize they can't go 3-7+ times like a Soldier may be able to, because of the very small number of slots for Marines - I can't imagine the difficulty they would have in trying to convince their leadership to give them another chance to go back to an Army school they washed out of. The Marines that are allowed to attempt the school are typically very experienced and qualified, however, and have often completed the course on their first attempt.
 
[In 2008, a USMC Ranger even became the first Marine to ever be admitted into the Ranger Hall of Fame.](http://www.albany.marines.mil/News/NewsArticleDisplay/tabid/4246/Article/59156/marine-inducted-into-ranger-hall-of-fame.aspx)

Here's an awesome story by a Recon Marine who earned his Ranger tab on his first attempt without even so much as a recycle: http://sofrep.com/1439/ranger-school-from-a-recon-marines-perspective/
 


 
&gt;""When I got a slot for Army Ranger School, I was pretty excited to go. Keep in mind: **I was a 19 year old Marine that was in the best shape of my life. I really thought that everyone in the Army went to Ranger School, so I just figured it’d be some good training and that was that. I was a bit wrong....**
 
&gt;Once the course was in full swing, I got used to a few things reserved for the Marine students. First off, *regardless of what rank you are, you are referred to as “Gunny”*. The RI’s (Ranger instructors) told me that they just thought it was a really cool sounding rank.... *Trying to be the “gray man” in an Army School as the only Marine in the class was absolutely impossible* So, I basically had to always be on my A-Game, since eyes were always on me. This was especially applicable in Florida phase. Since it was a lot of amphibious/swamp work with Zodiac boats, I was expected to outperform the other students being this was my background. **I did set an unofficial Ranger School record during this phase. I’ve been told I used the F-Bomb more than 18 times in a 30 second statement as the Class Leader. I’m sure the Marine Corps is quite proud of this.**

&gt;All in all, Ranger School was a great experience for me. **The training was exceptional and I was well versed in the art of raids and ambushes, something I took back to my team.** The leadership skills you learn are intangible. It’s not formal instruction on leadership, but basically getting thrown into the mix and being forced to lead men. **Another overlooked asset of being a tabbed Marine, is the ability to relate to your Army brothers when doing joint exercises. So, all of the Marines out there that think Ranger School has nothing to offer, think again.**

 **(** *I should add that any tabbed Marine is as much a Soldier as anyone to an Army grunt, and you are basically considered a member of two services by us at that point. This is also essentially an endless beer ticket in the presence of any bar with any squared away Soldier* **)**

&gt;I did make it straight through class 7-96 with no recycles and earned my Tab. **My Ranger Tab was proudly worn in its rightful place – underneath the pocket flap on my cammies**.""
 
_____
 



If you are interested and have a competitive enough skillset **(**Recon/whatever MARSOC is is considered the first step**)** and PT scores, maybe you could get one of those 30 slots and be one of the few people to earn your tab and know that you are among the most well-trained and hardest light infantry on the face of the planet. 
 
Takes a lot more than bravado and pride to know you're the best of two branches. I'd like to see more of this sort of thing happen.
 
**If anyone who reads this ever even so much as gets in, I will send them a care package of necessary goods. If they graduate, I will send them a small liquor cabinet's worth of their choice of drink - dead serious.** I also have a book I could mail to anyone who actually goes for this about a guy making it through that would help prepare someone for what to expect.",,False,self,t5_2qswv,1374620813.0,,,True,t3_1iwyij,http://www.reddit.com/r/USMC/comments/1iwyij/marines_rangers_reconmarsoc_current_or_future/,

2. I did really well on a practice test for the ASVAB and they told me I could go into intelligence.  They told me there are two different MOS in intel that I can go into, one being ~4 months training (I think this was DC), and the other ~2 years training (DD).  DD is supposed to be more like having a job at the CIA.  Can anyone verify?  Also, I keep looking up DD and I'm getting MOS 0231, and it doesn't say anywhere near 2 years.

3. They told me they can only accept a certain number of women in the region per year, and they only have 2 slots left.  What's the likelihood that's a ploy to get me to commit right away?  I don't want to lose my spot but I also don't want to get fooled.

4. They said I'd have to wait a full calendar year to try again if I missed one of those two slots.  I thought that waiting period was typically if they denied your enlistment.  Do you think this means that if I don't come right back in and sign things he'll just deny my enlistment?

Being as I am unable to make the physical trip to DC to meet before the Discharge Review Board I am requesting that the review my record and personnel file.  Doing this also allows me to submit any additional documentation.  I would like some help in terms of what I should submit alongside the form.  Letters from friends, family and peers to act as character references or are there other things as well I should add to increase my chances of changing my discharge?

EDIT 1: hunkill (from another subreddit I posted this in) made a good point so I shall elaborate on my discharge. I developed a severe drinking problem while in the Navy and was being brought up to an Article 15. It didn't make it past DRB (Disciplinary Review Board - A panel of senior enlisted reviewing the case and primarily verbally assaulting you while trying to gather further information about what happened.) I didn't go before the XO or the CO. Shortly after I spent a month and a half in a Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Program inpatient treatment facility for my alcoholism. Afterwards I returned to my base and about a month later changed duty stations. After I got to my new base I went to the appropriate person in my chain of command, took care of the necessary paperwork but there were issues with documentation missing from my previous command. Thus I wasn't able to pick up where I had left off in my treatment aftercare (which was suppose to be no less than 1 year). I had no mode of transportation and was thus unable to get around to the AA meetings that were located off base. Within a few months I had completely relapsed and was UA from my assigned place of duty due to bad combination of extreme depression and intoxication. After that, I went through the legal aspect of the system up to my Article 15 and was subsequently administratively separated for Treatment Failure. It's almost 1 year since my discharge date and I'm stuck with a General Under Honorable Condition/ RE-4 discharge.

Now I'm clean and sober, a full time student, law abiding citizen, attentive husband (soon to be father) and all I want is to clean up this part of my history and finally put it behind me without the shame I feel. That's the in-depth explanation as to what took place in regards to my discharge.

Personally, I love a good rumor. It's one of the reasons that boots are so unintentionally hilarious. 

What are some of the rumors that you just cant get enough of or get away from? Bonus points if you started it yourself. Here's my list for starters:

- If you shoot ""Expert"" on the range 10 times (in the Marine Corps) you become a Distinguished Marksman and never have to shoot again. (The grain of truth to this one is that Distinguished Marksman dont have to shoot again, but thats not how you become one.)

- The headquarters building on the MARSOC compound has Ka-Bar doorhandles. The one all the way to the left was Chesty Puller's (or Evans Carlson's) actual Ka-Bar. 

- You can trade 6 Certificates of Commendation in for a Navy Achievement Medal.

- The horse on the 7th Cav patch faces the other way on the combat patch. (I actually believed this one for a while, it seems like something the Army would allow.) (Sort of edit: Did some googlling and found [this](http://www.blackfive.net/photos/uncategorized/temp_display_img_2750.jpg) what the fuck? Now I'm confused again.)

- The guys with the red patches have HIV.

Main camp was Camp Blue Diamond in Ramadi but was part of a ""jump team"" that visited multiple camps and fixed, upgraded and trained communication equipment to the Marines at each camp.  Visited: Al Qaim, Hit, Hadithah, Al Asad, Korean Villiage, Camp Ramadi, Shark Base (provided comm support for the Seals + ""OGAs"" as they like to be called), Fallujah, Baharia, Camp Abu Ghraib (not the prison), Ripper (on Al Asad), Belleu Wood/Workhorse (on Fallujah).. and I feel like I'm missing one or two.  

I went back a few times as a contractor as well, but those don't count.  Our CO ""voluntold"" us for a 12 month tour, so I saw the infantry battalions rotate up to 3 times while being shot at pretty much daily in Ramadi (inside and outside the wire).

I'm on a 1500 cal high protein low carb. I have circuit training two days a week. Lift weights two days a week and cardio (swimming or cycling) two days a week.I also train for a 40 mile charity ride on Saturdays. I usually do the whole 40 that day. (stopping hourly to get food or food for energy during the ride) I just found a .pdf of the ""Guidebook for marines"" that lists the daily PT regimen they do. I'm going to start that this week. And look into insanity and other body weight movements I can do. I'm going to start running once I drop another 30 lbs (don't wanna damage my knees) and want to talk to a recruiter soon to get things like the pre-AVSAB and speak about possible MOS to get. My question is should I talk to them now? Or wait till I'm around 225 to talk to them? I'd like to show them I'm motivated and what I've done on my own will to make it happen. I don't want them to feel like they're wasting their time but would like to PT with them and start doing things or learning things I'll need to know in basic.

I wanted to get some feedback from those of you who first served in the Marine Corps, got out and after a few years ended up enlisting in another branch because the Marine Corps wouldn't take you back because of the way manpower is right now or you got too old.

I served on active duty from 1999-2003 and after I got out was going to school for a little bit, then working in higher education then, government contracting.  My re-entry code on my DD214 is good: RE-1A.

I got out when I was 24.  I blinked, years passed by and I'm 34 now - too old for the Marines.

I did some ""research"" on my own and found out that many prior service Marines enlist in the Army National Guard and for the most part enjoy it.  Now, I do understand that it's not the Marine Corps.  That's not what I want it to be.  All I have to do is visit my old buddies that I served with if I want that nostalgia.  I just want to continue serving our great country while I'm still able.

I talked to my local recruiter about my options and to get more information.  He answered all the questions I had.  I've not made a final decision yet because I'm still working on my fitness standards and I don't want to waste his time and embarrass myself until I know I'm physically fit again.
