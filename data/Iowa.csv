I'm hoping to get some feedback and suggestions on what you would like to see in this if it interests you.   

-Who am I missing?

-What is your favorite beer from X brewery?

-What beer from X should you steer clear of?

-Something else interesting about the brewery? 

-What tastes like piss?

-Why are you drinking piss?



It should be open to comments if you right click on a cell.  If this gets enough interest I'd like to through it into the sidebar.  


Edit:  Thanks for the input.  Updated the list with suggestions and added this link to the sidebar.  If you have any additions, please the mods know.

Just wanted to make everyone aware of a new Iowa subreddit (/r/IowaGamers) I've started that's geared entirely towards gaming, including tabletop and video games. 

In my searching around Reddit it appeared that any events and information would be shared within individual community subreddits or just the general /r/lanparty subreddit, which made it hard to find events and other players if you didn't frequent those. Some of us don't mind traveling!

My hope is that this subreddit will become a location where Iowa gamers can come together and post/schedule events, share gamertags and profiles, ask questions, and share their knowledge with fellow Iowans!

We'd love to have you! Please subscribe and invite your friends!

(Big props to tcpip4lyfe for allowing me to promote!)

1361746766.0,26,self.Iowa,195nez,Iowa summer camp I worked at is under threat of closing because those in charge don't see a use for it.,Ikorut,31,5,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Iowa/comments/195nez/iowa_summer_camp_i_worked_at_is_under_threat_of/,"Today I learned that the summer camp I worked at for 2.5 summers is possibly going to close because the department doesn't see a use for it. This is a 4H camp where I saw many children who were shy and didn't think they had friends learn that someone always cares. I learned more about myself from that camp than anything else in my whole life, and because of it I am a better person today.

At the end of the week, we had pins that were handed out. You were to give your pin to a person that you felt helped you out, was there when you needed them, or positively impacted you. I cannot describe the feeling of a child giving you a pin and telling you that you made camp special for them, or that you were the person who made them learn about themselves. I still have all my pins and will probably never be able to get rid of them. I want others to be able experience that feeling and have the chance to make impacts on kids in the same way that everyone else did.

This camp also offered special weeks for children of military families to come and experience camp and just feel like normal kids. They were with others kids their age who were feeling the same things they were, and they learned how to overcome their feelings of sadness and loneliness. It was one of the best things I felt we did as a camp, because all kids, especially ones going through a hard time like their parent being deployed, deserve to have experiences like that.

This camp has done so much good, and was so important to so many children, families, and staff. I can't imagine not being able to go out to the camp and immerse myself in nature. We are hoping to appeal to the group responsible for wanting to shut the camp down. Currently we are sending letters telling them of positive experiences, and why we feel that a camp that has done so much good should be left open for others to enjoy for many years to come.

I loved the Iowa 4H Center. If you have ever worked for a summer camp or a job where you have seen the positive impact places like this can make on children and young adults, please send positive letters of support to the Iowa 4H foundation and help to prevent the loss of a truly wonderful place.

* [Breakfast with Strangers](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com) 
* [Our video for the project](http://vimeo.com/43216845) 

If you are interested then please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA for 5 months this summer. We posted a few months ago our beta version and had a ton of great responses from the Reddit community. We will be in Iowa during the summer and looking to find great people now. 

**The Details &amp; Route**

On July 18, 2012 we’ll hit the road from Portland, OR bound for Portland, ME and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, we’ll blend old-fashioned and contemporary connection as we seek out strangers in a variety of ways: bulletin boards, classifieds, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, CouchSurfing, pure chance, and more. We’ll build community and engage local media outlets along the way.

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, learning what our new friends think about life’s big and little questions. We’ll chronicle these conversations in our blog so that strangers can meet strangers—virtually. Our project will foster connection, conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Conversation:**

This journey is a conversation. We’ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions, but our hope is that the conversation will continue long after the breakfast dishes are cleared. How? We’ll start here and see where it ripples out:

* www.breakfastwithstrangers.com
* www.facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers
* www.twitter.com/#!/BWS50Meals

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book, Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. We will donate 10 percent of the book’s proceeds to Servas US, a non-profit organization promoting peace through travel and relationship-building.

The most important outcome of all: the reminder that we are all part of a larger community.
Thanks for your consideration,

So, first things first, this is Drew from Little Village magazine. I've been a Redditor for four years (this is a throwaway), coming here off of fark.com and digg.com's heydays. 

One thing I haven't done, for several years now, is post relevant submissions from Little Village to Reddit. I have avoided doing this for a couple of reasons, namely the awareness I have that this could be seen as ""selling"" something or ""spamming."" 

This has caused me a bit of cognitive dissonance the last few years because I feel as though there are articles that I earnestly would like to share here, but have avoided doing so for the reason given above. On top of that, /r/iowa is not exactly the most active place either, which has further chaffed my resolution to avoid posting [LV content](http://littlevillagemag.com/) here (in the sense that I'd like to contribute, but am holding back).

The last few months, I have done some thinking, and I think I would like to start. I do not want to spam links, obviously, but I would like to start sharing articles, maybe two a week--maybe zero--which I think /r/iowa would find interesting. 

I want to be transparent on this because I think transparency is what I'm most concerned about here. With that said, I wanted to mention a couple things in light of this. First, our business model is not based on web traffic. No part of our magazine revenue relies on me 'getting clicks'. Second, I really do think this stuff is relevant for this subreddit, and it truly is, quite simply, ""OC"". It's written by people in Iowa, about Iowa, and it's really no more complicated than that. 

So, I guess I just wanted to say. Is this cool? Is this appropriate? Are we cool with me sharing a link or two, from time to time, on /r/iowa if relevant?  

For reference, I have two submissions thus far. Free free to click my username to see what they are about/what you might think about this kind of content coming to /r/iowa. Really, my only priority here is full transparency with the /r/iowa community. 

Thanks!

Drew",,False,self,t5_2qn1h,1366834399.0,,,True,t3_1d1300,http://www.reddit.com/r/Iowa/comments/1d1300/i_was_hoping_riowa_might_be_able_to_tell_me_whats/,

The bill would require Iowans convicted of aggravated misdemeanors to submit a DNA sample for DNA profiling. 

information from the Iowa ACLU:
Current law requires persons with a deferred judgment or conviction for a felony, as well as sexually violent predators and sex offenders, to submit a DNA sample for profiling. This bill expands DNA profiling to include Iowans convicted of aggravated misdemeanors. That includes many low-level crimes such as third offense driving with a suspended, denied, or revoked license; operating a vehicle without consent, and third-degree theft.
* The expansion is estimated to cost approximately $500,000 in the first year alone.
* The expansion would expose thousands of Iowans to due process and privacy risks. DNA contains much more information than a fingerprint; it has highly personal information
about ancestry, family and health that authorities have no right to. This bill would affect an estimated additional 10,000 Iowans in the first year alone.
* DNA testing is not infallible.
False positives can occur due to degradation of the DNA sample. Errors can also occur with cross-contamination or mislabeling; and misinterpretation of test results.
By dramatically increasing the number of DNA samples the state collects, we're increasing the likelihood of error.",,False,self,t5_2qn1h,False,,,True,t3_1czc44,http://www.reddit.com/r/Iowa/comments/1czc44/iowa_house_passes_dna_sampling_for_misdemeanors/,

I'll be stopping in Des Moines, Davenport, Burlington, Clinton, and Cedar Rapids.  Most of our evening will be taken up watching baseball, but if you have any suggestions of places to see, eat, visit in these cities, or in between, i'd love to hear them.

1326482231.0,22,self.Iowa,ofsg4,Senator Harkin's response to my SOPA Letter,IowanRedditor,25,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Iowa/comments/ofsg4/senator_harkins_response_to_my_sopa_letter/,"Dear IowanRedditor:

Thank you for contacting me. I appreciate you sharing your thoughts on proposed legislation to regulate intellectual property infringement online.

The Internet has spawned unprecedented opportunities for innovation, job creation, economic growth, and global competition. Unfortunately, the Internet also produced greater opportunities for individuals to illegally distribute things like copyrighted movies and television programs, as well as to sell counterfeit trademarked goods or patented products. The impact of copyright piracy and sale of counterfeit goods imposes a significant cost. It hurts consumers and harms legitimate businesses and their workers.

While copyright, trademark, and patent laws all apply online, enforcement of the laws is particularly difficult, especially when a perpetrator is abroad. In recent years, the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which I am not a member, has attempted to address the enforcement challenges.

This Congress, Senator Leahy introduced S.968, the PROTECT IP Act, which is designed to improve enforcement of ""pirate"" websites which facilitate the unauthorized distribution of protected content or counterfeit goods. The bill would give the Justice Department the authority to seek a cease and desist order against ""rogue"" websites that are primarily ""dedicated to infringing activities."" A similar bill, H.R.326, the Stop Online Piracy Act, is before the House Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition, and the Internet.

Under the PROTECT IP Act, once the court issues an order, it could then be served on financial transaction providers, Internet service providers, Internet advertising services providers, and location information providers to require them to stop financial transactions with the rogue site and stop linking to it. Also search engines-such as Google-would be ordered to remove or disable access to the Internet site.

In May, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed the PROTECT IP Act, making it eligible for consideration on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Because I am not a member of that Committee, I have not yet had an opportunity to review the legislation in detail. However, as I evaluate the legislation, there are extremely important free speech issues that must be considered. In particular, it will be critical to me that the bill property balances the need for vigorous enforcement of our intellectual property laws with the important principle of a free and open Internet.

Again, thank you for your input on this matter. Should this legislation come before the full Senate, I will certainly keep your views in mind. Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future with any questions or concerns you may have.

 
Sincerely [fuck off  (op ed)],


Tom Harkin
United States Senator

Of that $102.15 million transferred out of academics, $62.05 million came to Athletics ------------- in other words, $62.05 milllion from the general education went into covering deficits from the Athletic budget.""

Vernon), and after 5 years in the Twin Cities, we're moving ""home"". Ideally we would have liked to have moved to Iowa City, but obviously rental costs played a factor and we found ourselves in SW Cedar Rapids. I'm not terribly familiar with this side of town. I know the movie theater is great, Westdale is **awful**, and that's about it. We checked out the Newbo Market last weekend and were impressed.



So my question is:

What else are we missing out on in Cedar Rapids? I feel like we got to know it as teenagers, and then turned to Iowa City, scorning Cedar Rapids. Maybe it got a bad rap from us. We're in our late 20's, so we like to get really good food, go to shows, do outdoor activities, things like that.

We've posted around prior to starting our trip and now we are currently on the road and will be in the state for two days. We'll likely be in the Des Moines area but we are willing to travel a bit out of the way for an interesting story (millitary, nurse, farmer, etc). 

Do you fit the description? If yes, email us. If not, please pass the word along. Please see our site or Facebook page for more info:

* [Breakfast with Strangers site](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com)
* [BWS Facebook page](http://facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers)  

If you are interested - please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA. Please include 'IOWA' in the subject line. 

**More details about our project**

On July 18, 2012 we hit the road from Portland, OR bound for Portland, ME (and back) and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, we’ll blend old-fashioned and contemporary connection as we seek out strangers in a variety of ways: bulletin boards, classifieds, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, CouchSurfing, pure chance, and more. We’ll build community and engage local media outlets along the way.

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, learning what our new friends think about life’s big and little questions. We’ll chronicle these conversations in our blog so that strangers can meet strangers—virtually. Our project will foster connection, conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book, Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. We will donate 10 percent of the book’s proceeds to Servas US, a non-profit organization promoting peace through travel and relationship-building.

Over the summer of 2006, I was traveling abroad with a college group overseas. We spent about ten days in the Czech Republic (3 days in Prague, 7 in Pardubice) for a music festival. I wasn't afraid to admit that I was an American, although Iowa seemed like something much more difficult to explain. When someone said “Where are you from,” saying America wasn't enough. When they raised an eyebrow, I would say “you know...it's sort of right in the middle. Have you heard of Chicago? Yeah, it's closer to that than New York or LA.” It was mostly an impossible conversation, and I resigned to not being able to explain it, for the most part.

In one of my last days, I was standing outside of a campus building smoking a cigarette with some cool dude in a Linkin Park shirt I had just met. He asked where I was from, and I simply said “America,” not dwelling on the subject. He asked me more specifically, and I said “Iowa.” There was a moment of silence between the two of us, and then he looked at me with a raised eyebrow.

I just saw the movie *Bucky Larson: Born to Be A Star*, where a guy from Iowa(with a Minnesotan accent) moves to Hollywood to be in porn.  The portrayal of Iowans in this movie is *way* inaccurate.  Yes, I understand it is a comedy movie, but it is still disturbing.  This reflects on the people outside of the state and skews their perspective of us.  

Could it maybe have something to do with the fact that we are the first caucus state and it gives the media an out in case we don't pick the ""popular"" candidate?  I'm just speculating here, I would like to hear more perspectives on this.

Also *Sleeping With The Enemy* is an exception only because the woman who wrote it is *from* Cedar Falls, so she portrays it a little more accurately.

I have a close friend I'm really worried about.. Things are only getting worse; it's a downward spiral. 

I see the show Intervention and they send the people to amazing rehab centers somewhere nice. I want to do whatever I can to help but of course I can't afford that. Is there anyplace in Iowa with high success in rehabilitation for people with a serious problem? I don't know what these things cost but I'm willing to set aside a few hundred a week and I know we have loving friends who would be willing to help.

last edit: 9/24 

I am a little behind on when I thought I would be traveling through Iowa.  But the time is getting closer and I wanted to first thank everyone for their help, and second I wanted to mention the stops I will be making and try to see if anyone wants to meet up?

The dates of arrival are still up in the air. EDIT: I am leaving CA this Friday but not exactly sure when I will be in Iowa yet

here is where I'm going and what I'm doing:

Ames (would like to see this creepy doll house but can't find it on google) EDIT: was given the address

Cedar falls (a redditor offered to buy me a beer-then later deleted his offer-figured maybe someone else will?) EDIT: found out he deleted his account not the offer

Brandon (To see a large frying pan)

Mount Vernon (I was told to get lunch or dinner at the Lincoln Cafe)

So I hope someone is interested in meeting up! I will update and edit this post as much as possible if people are showing interest.

I have to mention that I have two dogs with me which are my first priority but I have done many road trips with them and never had a problem.


See Ya in Iowa!

So! It's about damn time we hear some fun things to do or see. 

* Living History Farms: With each season, the experiences change. It's educational, and quite humbling to see where we would be if we didn't have the technology of today.

* The Iowa State Fair: It's good to go to at least once.

* Downtown Des Moines: Walking around downtown often leads to New discoveries.

This is what I can think of. Even if it's listed here, if you want to elaborate, please do so. I was also thinking exploring some abandoned places might be fun (with other people of course!), but I don't know of any.

Edit 2: Thanks everybody.  We went to Iowa City and went to the Old Capitol and Natural History Museum.  Then walked around the shopping area down there.  We ate at the Oasis Falafel place, which was awesome-- holy crap.  We had a little time to burn, so we headed to the Coral Ridge Mall.

As someone who was there for 5+ hours I must say it was quite awesome.  I'm quite moderate when it comes to politics and usually don't get involved but it was quite incredible.  I left right as the coppers showed up (criminology major, can't have anything on my record) and it was wonderful!  

-someone was kind enough to drop off water and fruit for the cause

-despite the number of people, leaders arose and helped find a direction for the group

-they had what was called a ""soap box"" where individuals voiced their reasons on why they were attending

-towards the end individuals were volunteering to stay until arrested in peaceful protest on the grounds of the Capitol.  (I may even help in the bailing out of said protesters here around 4 a.m.)

-multiple news crews Rolled up and started filming live however I'm sure it will probably edited to some extent

-protesters were made aware that if their cars on the Capitol grounds after 11 they will be towed

-had the opportunity to talk to 4 people who were arrested the night before who were taken to county jail and booked.  They all said the officers were both respectful and professional (figured id mention this since the Tony Bologna incident) CAN'T EDIT AND DELETE WHAT'S BELOW THIS SORRY!

All in all it was empowering and quite inspirational.  As a middle class 
American I feel fortunate for what i have and give the upmost respect
 to the individuals who volunteered for intentional arrest.

I'm a senior in high school this year and I need to start thinking seriously about where I want to go to college. I want to either major in vocal music education or mathematics education (both to teach high school students) with an English minor with focus on creative writing. I live about 20 minutes away from Iowa City right now so I know the town pretty well, so I feel like that would help a lot but I also spent a lot of my childhood in Cedar Falls/Waterloo so I also know just a little of what those towns have to offer. I like Iowa City and Iowa because the town is really active, I know I'll be getting a great education, and it's very LGBT friendly which is very important to me for obvious reasons. But I also like Cedar Falls because it's farther away from home and I really like the campus and nightlife, but I absolutely hate Waterloo. Could anyone offer some helpful tips or advice for either of these colleges, or a personal opinion on the better place to go?

EDIT: Wow, many thanks for all the prompt replies, everybody. What about the math program at both schools? How do those compare to each other? While music is still a big draw for me, I'm really starting to wonder if I would rather do math. Also, how ""active"" is Cedar Falls as opposed to Iowa City? As a kid I never really noticed any of that stuff, but growing up near Iowa City now there's always something to do near the downtown area, and I was wondering if Cedar Falls is really like that.

EDIT 2: Again, thanks for all the responses, everybody.

We just got back from a weekend away in Dubuque and we absolutely fell in love with the scenery. We would like some insite from those living in Dubuque to try and see if the city would be a good fit for us.

We are a same sex couple in our 30's. We like to go out for a drink or two but aren't looking for a club scene, just nice bars. We liked the size of Dubuque as well. I have been reading some online forums and the reviews from people who have moved to Dubuque are awful and from what I experienced there I can't believe it is all true.

How is living in Dubuque? Are people friendly? Will we have a good chance to meet people and find new friends? How is the city for gay couples? What is the job market like? Any information you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

Edit: Everything I've read online states that Dubuque is not gay friendly, it is a very catholic community and they do not like outsiders. Any truth to this?  When I was there this weekend and saw the people at DBQ Fest I did see a few same sex couples.  

It's looking more and more like this is not a open minded city like I was hoping. If anyone can provide more insite I would appreciate it.

1324480378.0,12,self.Iowa,nlavd,In light of recent events in Iowa I thought you guys might appreciate this.,Beetle559,16,4,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Iowa/comments/nlavd/in_light_of_recent_events_in_iowa_i_thought_you/,"&gt;What is the attitude of the democrat when political rights are under discussion? How does he regard the people when a legislator is to be chosen? Ah, then it is claimed that the people have an instinctive wisdom; they are gifted with the finest perception; their will is always right; the general will cannot err; voting cannot be too universal.
When it is time to vote, apparently the voter is not to be asked for any guarantee of his wisdom. His will and capacity to choose wisely are taken for granted. Can the people be mistaken? Are we not living in an age of enlightenment? What! are the people always to be kept on leashes? Have they not won their rights by great effort and sacrifice? Have they not given ample proof of their intelligence and wisdom? Are they not adults? Are they not capable of judging for themselves? Do they not know what is best for themselves? Is there a class or a man who would be so bold as to set himself above the people, and judge and act for them? No, no, the people are and should be free. They desire to manage their own affairs, and they shall do so.

&gt;But when the legislator is finally elected — ah! then indeed does the tone of his speech undergo a radical change. The people are returned to passiveness, inertness, and unconsciousness; the legislator enters into omnipotence. Now it is for him to initiate, to direct, to propel, and to organize. Mankind has only to submit; the hour of despotism has struck. We now observe this fatal idea: The people who, during the election, were so wise, so moral, and so perfect, now have no tendencies whatever; or if they have any, they are tendencies that lead downward into degradation.

A few like minded, local individuals from a few different groups (I.E. such as /r/IowaGamers and IowaGamersOnline.com of which I am a moderator for, and a part of both groups.) are looking into hosting a LAN Tournament in the Cedar Rapids / Iowa City area and would like to hear some community insight on what numbers would be like for a turn-out if we were to throw this LAN event and what would you like to see to bring you to such an event. 

We have Facilities available to make this happen in the Cedar Rapids area, The hardware to host such an event, and several other things taken care of, There are a few things that still need some working out, such as a Roster of players available to make a trip to Cedar Rapids for this, a list of games to be showcased, like League of Legends, Team Fortress 2, Ect. Several locally hosted games for people to have fun with, Consoles too if you get into that kind of thing, a few non computer / console games and some prizes for the winners, A few possible local acts available for some good music and some laughs also! You get it by now, the best kind of fun for Gamers! 

I have been working with a few local Hotel's to make accommodations at a more than fair price for those that are willing to make the trip to the Cedar Rapids Area for this, in order to alleviate as much of a financial burden it is to make a trip out of town and have to bring your own hardware to play, Which will be located conveniently near where the event will be hosted.

After I can get a decent feel for the numbers, we will hopefully be able to proceed further and have a concrete event started, If you know of any groups in the Midwest interested in such things be sure to let them know of our efforts, we would be happy to have as much support as possible to make this something that Iowan Gamers can feel beyond proud about, Hope to make it a reoccurring event so visitors use this as some home-state nerd cred / badge of honor, and be able to walk away saying ""I've played with the best in the Midwest"", or knowing ""I am the best in the Midwest.""

--------------

Hello Iowa...I'm the co-founder of a fatherhood website, and a couple months ago, we brought on a writer/father who was cycling across the country with his family to raise money for Charity: Water.

This guy - Remy - is hardcore - he and his wife sold all of their belongings for this trip - and along with their two kids, are going from California to Maine. All for charity - not raising any money for himself.

**In short, it has not gone well.** Right now, he is in Carroll, Iowa, his bike is breaking down almost to the point of no repair, and he hurt his back. He has his wife and kids with him - and any help you can give him or the kids would be incredible. He's had people across the country to stay with along the journey, but a couple of unexpected stops, and a couple of drop-out hosts cost more than he anticipated.

If you are in or around Carroll, Iowa and can help house him for a night, or are able to afford a couple bucks for he and his family to continue, we'd appreciate it beyond words. **Please drop me a private message or answer here and we'll get in touch.**

Remy's longer story can be found [in these posts on our site if you're interested](http://www.8bitdad.com/tag/fatherhood-on-the-go/).

Go to the Democratic Caucus and try to create a viable ""Uncommitted"" group.  This way you can push the issues you care about to the county, district, and state conventions.  Remember that you get to vote for the party platform at the caucuses.  

If you disagree with the Obama administration on NDAA, the handling of the wars, the treatment of Bradley Manning, the bank bailouts, or anything else, you can make those issues known by not voting for Obama in the caucus.  If enough people vote ""uncommitted"" it will show the party that we are not pleased with some of the president's policy decisions.  

This is not meant to prevent Obama from being elected, but to push the conversation within the party further towards our ideals.  I will be going, will you?
