1347372983.0,113,self.atheismplus,zpj6b,[Meta]: Attention Downvote Brigade,koronicus,219,106,306,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/zpj6b/meta_attention_downvote_brigade/,"Greetings!

Some of you may have found us through a post like [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/zoyxr/atheismplus_the_death_of_debate_in_part_of_the/). Let me be the first to roll out the red carpet and welcome you to our humble abode. I would like to express my warmest affections for your taking the time to visit us today. I have the utmost confidence that, unlike those we have recently been forced to ban for disrespecting our desire to have Atheism+ exist as a [safe space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe-space) for our participants, you are a wonderful human being who values intellectual communication in the absence of hateful slurs and personal vitriol. This makes me very excited to have you! Furthermore, since many of you are already skeptics, you will understand our reticence to allow this subreddit to devolve into a giant ""introduction to social justice"" class in much the same manner as /r/evolution might object to becoming a Creatonism Talking Points page.

On your right, you will see an introductory code of conduct. Please familiarize yourself with it. If any of the concepts there seem strange or foreign to you, may I recommend the [google machine](http://www.google.com) as an excellent ignorance-removal device? As you have no doubt already heard, failure to adhere to this code of conduct may result in ~~bullying~~ banning. With the best interests of the larger community in mind, I hope the majority of you find these guidelines tenable and join us in participating in a healthy reddit community.

Again, welcome! I hope to see you around!

~

To the members of the /r/atheismplus community (including today's new members!),

Hello to you too! If you see any instances of our code of conduct being violated, please do not hesitate to report them. We will do our best to be aware of concern trolls, derailing attempts, and general asshole-dom, but feel free to help bring violations to our attention. Please also be aware that many of our visitors today may not be terribly interested in good-faith discussions. We have already seen a surge of drive-by downvoting, and I hope you'll bear with us until the moment passes. (And hey, now's a great time to familiarize yourself with the upvote button! Orange isn't my favorite color, personally, but I do enjoy spreading around the sweet, sweet internet points to people who aren't being assholes! It's a great hobby, and I couldn't recommend it any more highly.)

As always, thank you for your patience, and keep on being awesome!

~

Edit: I should probably give everyone a personalized welcome. It's the only equal thing to do, right? (If I've missed your sub, let me know, and I'll add it here!)

Hi r/skeptic! I just want you to know how very disappointed in you I am if you just came here to downvote stuff without reading everything in context. That's not very skeptical of you! Thankfully, however, most of you are cool people, and you've probably already taken the time to investigate. Feel free to hang around--we have cookies. (The cookies are sweet, sweet karma.)

*Hi SRD!* Sorry you've had to endure us twice now. If it were up to me, you'd have no reason to eat popcorn here. (Or, wait, I'm not really sure. Do you *enjoy* the drama? I've never been entirely clear on whether it's hilarious or horrible.)

~

Hi r/atheism! Uh, we're all atheists here, so I don't really know what else to say. Thanks for not believing in gods! (Gods are such a silly idea, aren't they?) So hey, like, if you think it's really shitty how certain people get treated (you know, like, for having boobies or dark skin or whatever), you should hang out here.

~

To everyone: Wow, this has been a fun ride, hasn't it? We sure have seen a lot of hostility from people over banning people who think feminism is out to emasculate all men (or whatever equivalent nonsense they spout). To me, this is a pretty solid confirmation that what we're advocating for is necessary. This behavior is exactly why we need safe spaces.

I understand very well the notion that founding documents (even ones from three weeks ago) shouldn't be casually changed.  At the same time, I think it's important to make it clear that atheism+ is a *feminist* movement:

Because feminism is [the radical notion that men and women are equal](http://www.feminism101.com/).  It is not about [oppressing men](http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2007/03/10/faq-why-do-you-feminists-hate-men/) in order to privilege women.  Using the euphemism 'women's rights' instead suggests that there's something wrong or exclusionary about feminism [(which there isn't)](http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2007/04/12/faq-why-feminism-and-not-just-humanism-or-equalism-isnt-saying-youre-a-feminist-exclusionary/) -

Because the atheism+ movement was born because [women couldn't talk about feminism in atheist spaces without being attacked](http://freethoughtblogs.com/blaghag/2012/08/how-i-unwittingly-infiltrated-the-boys-club-why-its-time-for-a-new-wave-of-atheism/), and using the euphemism 'women's rights' instead of saying the word 'feminism', given that history, is somewhat ironic -

Because 'women's rights' is a narrower and less well-defined term, while 'feminism' covers [a tremendous range of gendered oppression in society](http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2007/03/12/faq-why-do-some-people-talk-of-feminisms/) -

Because it will really annoy all the people from r/mensrights who seem to be running the comment section these days - 

Okay, ignore that last one if you like.  But in all seriousness, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts.  Do you think this sub should mark itself as explicitly *feminist* instead of just 'supporting women's rights'?

To those of you who are new, welcome! We've just recently hit the 1,500 subscribers mark (and before Atheism+ is even a month old!), which I think is pretty nifty. The forums are still just a little ahead of us in membership count, though, so bring some friends! Those of you who are new are encouraged to review the sidebar, paying special attention to [those](http://atheismplus.com/?page_id=127) [links](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/q24sl/meta_srsd_required_reading/) [in](http://derailingfordummies.com/complete.html) [blue](http://www.atheismplus.com), which offer valuable resources for your perusal. We've seen a few recurring topics in the last few days that I'd like to address. It seems that a lot of our more critical passers-through lack an understanding of what this idea of a ""safe space"" means, erroneously conflating it with some kind of enforced groupthink, causing them to object to what they perceive as an attack on their free speech. Let's dive into these issues, shall we?

- Safe Space

This page is a safe space intended to facilitate discussions about intersectional issues such as religion and social justice. [What is a ""safe space?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/zntcf/what_is_a_safe_space/) At its core, it is a place intended to foster discussion in which participants have no ""fear of being made to feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or unsafe on account of biological sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, cultural background, age, or physical or mental ability."" In short, a safe space is a moderated forum where certain kinds of speech are curtailed to prevent harassment, marginalization, and discrimination based on inherent characteristics. This has the following consequences:

1. Slurs: -ist language is not permitted. That one *should be* pretty self-explanatory, but avoiding [language](http://disabledfeminists.com/category/ableist-word-profile/) that is [ableist](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/pezwl/tinyeffort_ableism_101/) seems to be a hurdle. (Here's a discussion on [ableist words and possible alternatives](http://www.reddit.com/r/SRSDiscussion/comments/pz1av/ableist_language_and_ways_to_avoid_it/). If something *might be* ableist, just don't say it. [Here's](http://specialolympicsblog.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/an-open-letter-to-ann-coulter/) a good example of the problem of ableism.)
2. [Trigger Warnings](http://privilege101.tumblr.com/triggers.html): Use these where applicable [as a common courtesy](http://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2012/07/19/trigger-warning/). They can sometimes be something of a judgment call, and no one's going to come after you with torches and pitchforks if you forget somewhere, but it's best to err on the side of caution. If you forget, add them as requested. This shows that [you care](http://libcom.org/blog/trigger-warnings-why-we-use-them-15012012). (See also: [the Spoon Theory](http://www.butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/)) In general, we expect everyone to make a good faith effort at avoiding triggering language. Where applicable, hide such language behind a [CSS trigger warning](/trigger).
3. [Concern trolling](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Concern_troll): This is not acceptable. As a general guideline, if you're new here, we're probably not going to look too favorably upon your [sagely advice](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Concern_troll).
4. Hostility: (Note: The following rule does not apply to trolls, whose posts should be promptly reported and/or mocked.) Disagreement is fine, and some discussions will inevitably get emotional; contrary to popular opinion, being angry does not make someone wrong. Still, try to avoid disrespecting one another—attack the argument, not the person. Furthermore, if you are hostile to this whole Atheism+ thing, or to the core values listed in the sidebar, don't participate.

Note: This being a safe space does not protect your ideas from scrutiny. If you come bearing incidentally hurtful or bigoted notions, expect to have them mercilessly taken apart. (Explicitly hurtful or bigoted notions will be crushed beneath the weight of a cold, uncaring banhammer.)

- Free Speech

This is not your house, and if you wish to comment here, you may only do so in accordance with the code of conduct set forth by the community. Failure or refusal to adhere to the rules will very likely result in moderator intervention. This space exists primarily to serve the Atheism+ community, and if you do not wish to be a part of that community, don't. If you think we're just the most horrible thing ever to happen to the world, [go whine about us to someone else](http://www.reddit.com/r/antiatheismplus/). On this page, we are interested in neither discussing the necessity of Atheism+ nor debating the talking points of your preferred anti-feminist group.

- Groupthink

This is a charge that continues to astound me. Atheism+ is entirely devoid of ""official"" positions outside its core value statements, which promote groupthink no more than your local football club's imposition of the ""football is good"" rule. As such, charges of groupthink shall be met with incessant taunting. Seriously, if you think any of this constitutes a policy of enforcing groupthink, [you do not understand what that word means](http://www.psysr.org/about/pubs_resources/groupthink%20overview.htm).

- [Feminism](http://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2012/01/26/feminist-dogma/)

Feminism is the belief that men and women should be equal. If you believe this definition is fudamentally inaccurate, or if you think that feminists are out to ruin men's lives, you will not be happy here and should see yourself out. We support equality as part of a comprehensive approach to social justice, and feminism exists (or rather, feminisms exist) to improve society for everyone on the gender spectrum. (PS: [No, feminists aren't sexist against men](http://www.thefword.org.uk/features/2003/09/feminists_are_sexist).)

- [Privilege](http://tjlp.org/privilege101.pdf)

If being told to ""[check your privilege](http://blog.shrub.com/archives/tekanji/2006-03-08_146)"" causes you to roll your eyes reflexively, you will probably not be happy here. The proper response to being told this is not to respond with cries of *ad hominem!*, but rather to actually take a moment to reconsider your position from a different angle. Your experiences, beliefs, and attitudes [are not shared by the entire world](https://sindeloke.wordpress.com/2010/01/13/37/), and there really are people out there who know things better than you do. What works for you does not work equally well for everyone else. Do not [condesplain](http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/2010/01/25/you-may-be-a-mansplainer-if/) here.

- [Derailing](http://derailingfordummies.com/complete.html)

Using these tactics is highly likely to be interpreted as an effort to disrupt conversation. If you wish to be seen as arguing in good faith, do not make these arguments. If you want to talk about how an issue affects the majority, do not attempt to do so in a thread about how it affects someone else. Instead, start your own thread.

- Basic Questions

If you are unfamiliar with a concept being discussed, [familiarize yourself with it before adding your opinion](http://pharyngula.wikia.com/wiki/Social_justice_link_roundup). Failure to demonstrate due diligence will likely be interpreted as bad faith.

- Good Faith

We do not assume that newcomers act in good faith. This is the Internet, and there are a lot of assholes on the Internet. If you wish to be seen as arguing in good faith, [the onus is on you to be proactive](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/10agwk/how_to_avoid_arguing_in_bad_faith/). Generally, this means demonstrating an interest in honest discussions (see: basic questions) and avoiding [loaded language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_question). Refusal to argue in good faith is a bannable offense. (Pro tip: saying ""I'll probably get banned for saying this"" is taken as an *ipso facto* demonstration of bad faith argumentation.)

By participating in this subreddit, you are consenting to the rules laid out here. If a moderator informs you that your behavior is unacceptable, take that information to heart (pro tip: it is not an invitation to escalate the situation). Failure to modify your behavior will result in post removal and/or banning at moderator discretion. Finally, running off to another subreddit (unless it's [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/antiatheismplus/)) to cry or brag about being banned here will result in your being made a public spectacle of, as deemed appropriate by the International Court of Justice of the United Nations.

I went. I have been going for about a year now, on and off. Tonight, however, one of the gentlemen I don't normally talk to was sitting close to me. He decided to announce with a wink and a nod that atheism+ was problematic. 

I asked him why he thought that, and then it devolved. I simply could not get him to tell me why he disliked atheism+. I asked if it was the social justice angle? He said that no, he is for most social justice issues. 

I asked him to explain his viewpoint, but he dodged and started talking about the ""psychology of groups"". Then he brings up Jonestown, and Waco Texas. 

I stopped him, and asked him seriously if he thought people who like the idea of social justice issues with their atheism were likely to either a) drink poison and die for the ""cause"" or b) go down in a fire filled ball, taking children with them? 

Then, he started yelling that how dare I put words in his mouth, and he didn't say that. That atheism+ was a cult headed by PZ Meyers, and wasn't it obvious? People in Atheism+ were ""playing"" the victim, like ""that Rebecca from Skepchick"". He referenced feminists as villains. 

I wasn't alone in asking him to explain what that all meant. In the end I said I was a feminist, and an atheist, and I wasn't sure why the two topics couldn't go together. (You should have seen his face at that confession of my being a feminist.) That religions have a long history of oppressive behavior towards women, and for me the logic of being an atheist was to reject these gender roles, and also be a feminist. 

He poo poo'd that, and as it turns out he is an older white man who has been in the atheist circles for decades, and I simply think he finds this influx of new blood into ""his"" venues disturbing. 

I found it very frustrating. Apparently, I am diluting the cause by caring about social justice issues. 

It's not all bad, though. I met a few very good people both men and women in the group that were eloquent, and similarly kept trying to ask why was atheism with social justice a bad thing? 

Am I the only one that is running into this in actual atheist meetup groups, and events? I didn't even bring it up originally, and the man was shocked that anyone felt differently than himself. I wish my area had an atheist meetup group that was more friendly to the plus side of some atheists.

Atheists with nonreligious upbringing vs atheists with religious upbringing. ,Pwrong,94,33,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/10doiu/a_new_kind_of_privilege_ive_begun_to_notice/,"We all know about Christian privilege and religious privilege in general. This is a great example of applying social justice language to the atheist movement. I'm wondering if there's another kind of privilege, that applies to atheists who haven't had much contact with religion, as opposed to those who have directly suffered from religion. 

I have a mostly atheist family, and went to secular schools in a not-particularly-religious part of Australia. Religion has never hurt me personally. I'm aware of the ways it hurts others, but only indirectly. I don't really understand it because I haven't experienced it myself. 

For atheists who used to be religious, or were brought up in a religious family, or who live in a very religious society, religion is a very real threat. They have to deal with cognitive dissonance, guilt, shame and rejection. They've been told that their religion is the only source of meaning, and now they've lost that source and they have to find something new. I know at least two friends who deal with depression as a direct result of losing their faith (according to their own explanation). These are the people who really need the atheist movement to support them.

On the other end, I know other atheists who were brought up just like me, who dismiss the atheist movement because they don't believe or can't understand the fact that religion is actually that harmful. For them, the harm of religion is hypothetical, exaggerated, or just not their problem. Their experience of religious people is of nice old ladies who say ""bless you"", and the worst thing they have to deal with is Mormons knocking on their door once a year. 

I wonder if that's why so many people see us as being too ""aggressive"", and say we're ""just as bad as religion"". It reminds of how having male privilege can blind us to sexism, and white privilege can blind us to racism, (quick privilege check: I have both of these privileges, among others).

I don't know of any statistics that can back me up here, but it seems to me that my idea is testable. If I'm right, then you'd expect atheists who were always non-religious to be happier on average, and to have a lower opinion of the atheist movement on average. If this privilege is a real thing, it could be useful to know about. What do you think? 


tl;dr Atheists in religious homes/societies have different experiences to atheists who don't have much contact with religion, and this leads to a form of privilege and privilege blindness.

If you're not familiar with this idea, this is your opportunity to change that! So what is a safe space? Here are interpretations that I have [shamelessly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe-space) [borrowed](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Safe_space):

&gt;A place where anyone can relax and be fully self-expressed, without fear of being made to feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or unsafe on account of biological sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, cultural background, age, or physical or mental ability; a place where the rules guard each person's self-respect and dignity and strongly encourage everyone to respect others.[

and

&gt;Safe space is a term for an area or forum where either a marginalised group are not supposed to face standard mainstream stereotypes and marginalisation, or in which a shared political or social viewpoint is required to participate in the space. For example, a feminist safe space would not allow free expression of anti-feminist viewpoints, and would typically also prevent concern trolling and continual Feminism 101 discussions in favour of feminist discussion among feminists. Safe spaces may require trigger warnings and restrict content that might hurt people who have strong reactions to depictions of abuse or harm or mental illness triggers.

This subreddit is still fairly young, so we're not done filling out the sidebar, which will eventually contain elaborations (like this one!) on our code of conduct. I'd like to use this thread to collectively hash out our official definition of Atheism+ as a safe space here on reddit, which will have an impact on our moderation style. How would you like to see our ""safe space"" defined? (You're welcome to use as much or as little of the above language as you like in your suggestions.)

When we've received enough feedback and pretty much have the matter settled, you can expect to see the language we've agreed upon to appear as a link in the sidebar. Depending on how this goes, this post may be edited a few times to reflect the changing language.

Well, let's take a look, shall we, at the focus directed on just one woman over the past mere 48 hours.

----
Ophelia Benson wrote a [post](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/01/from-hacking-to-acid-throwing/) on the awful acid attack that happened to the director of the Bolshoi Ballet last week. Her post remarked on the [similarities between the ballet company and atheist community](http://i.imgur.com/GVFYPX1.png).

Well, how dare she, I guess. How dare she express her fear on the similarities between the two. It's not like irrational hatred like this ever erupts into actual violence. It's not like, as a commenter on the blog posted pointed out, we haven't [already seen this kind of obsessive hatred against a few women lead to violence in the atheist community before, with Madalyn Murray-O’Hair.](http://i.imgur.com/ukO5AkE.png)

[Ophelia further explains her post] (http://i.imgur.com/Iz6tpgr.png)

Like I said, how dare she. I suppose we better show her what a threat *really* looks like: [""Maybe a vial of acid would do you some good. You already look like you were set on fire and put out with a wet rake.""](http://i.imgur.com/dskHg0E.png)

I suppose it makes sense both to threaten Ophelia with acid to the face while simultaneously insulting her appearance. Seems like a rational and appropriate response.

----

Now, I have to say, ""The Slymepit"" is a place I don't give much thought to nor had I visited it before the events of the past couple of days. Certainly, I've heard enough about it through various blog posts but I very much wanted to believe it wasn't really *that bad*. It is that bad. I thought, ""Surely, I will go there and they will be categorically condemning Jerry Conlon's tweet as despicable with fullest sympathies extended towards Ophelia. Oh what a Sweet Summer Child I was!

I'm providing screenshots so you don't actually have to visit but it's all there if you're so inclined http://slymepit.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=224&amp;start=4950

[""Oh, for fuck's sake. Can someone tell this idiot he has just given Ophelia a gift?""](http://i.imgur.com/OcGOIoD.png)

That's right. He has clearly given Ophelia a gift by threatening an acid attack and deriding her for her appearance. She *wanted* to receive such a threat. It validates her, I guess? To receive violent threats?

[""To any FTBers, you know this guy is not serious, but for the record, I think he was a stupid asshole for even writing it."" ""But they will pretend it is serious. They will call it a threat. Mark my words.""](http://i.imgur.com/0psEyUo.png)

Yes, because clearly it wasn't a threat?!? Clearly, such a thing should just be brushed off and ignored? Sorry, Jan Steen, but some of us simply don't have that privilege.

Alright, here's a brave soul who will condemn Conlon: [""I'm glad I'm somewhere where I can say he was a cunt and good riddance to him.""](http://i.imgur.com/vXffN9r.png)

Great! Was it impossible to call out Conlon on his statement without using gendered slurs? Or just not preferable? Is there any possible justification for this?

Further blaming Ophelia for bringing on the comment by [somehow making light of acid victims?](http://i.imgur.com/HVN5fMN.png)

[More] (http://i.imgur.com/fCRP4Tq.png)

[WTF is this? I can't even](http://i.imgur.com/WGnRSTH.png)

[Vaguely condemning but still victim blaming!](http://i.imgur.com/2DtgfAA.png)

[""I basically told him to please leave us out of this because we're all currently over at the Pit saying what a horrible thing Jerry Conlon tweeted.""](http://i.imgur.com/2bETLQc.png)

No, you're busy calling him ""an idiot"" for doing so and that it's giving Ophelia ""what she wants"". This is a far cry from categorically condemning Conlon's tweet.

[""Jerry Conlon this is how you mock Ophie without giving her victim points: Over image of a prune (apparently one of their favorite appearance based insults for her: 'I'm a bit of a cunt when I'm on acid!'""](http://i.imgur.com/CKqVgP8.png) Sure looks like a condemnation to me!


It goes on and on like that. You get the idea.

[Jerry Conlon apologizes and Ophelia responds](http://i.imgur.com/x1W938G.png)

Here's the cherry on top for me, though: [Justin Vacula is raising money to attend Women in Secularism 2](http://skepticink.com/justinvacula/2013/01/19/help-send-me-to-women-in-secularism-2/) He's just shy of half way to his goal. Surely, you remember our [good friend](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/10rv06/rebecca_does_an_excellent_write_up_on_the/) Justin, he of the official A Voice for Men mark of approval and gleeful bullying of Jen McCreight and Amy Davis Roth?

Well, make sure we add Ophelia to that list if she wasn't on there already.


Here's what he had to say about Ophelia's [acid threat](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151222875229327&amp;set=a.166764564326.123040.714844326&amp;type=1) ordeal: [""Get a grip, Ophelia. Women who have acid thrown in their faces are in a much different situation than you are and face real quantifiable abuse - much unlike what you talk of as being abuse and the 'threats' you claimed to have received. Even if we grant that people ridicule you, say nasty things, and make fun of you on the internet this is -- by no means -- tantamount to acid splashing.""](http://i.imgur.com/4UqYDU7.jpg)

And the comments from Justin's fans, the people who subscribe to his feed:

[""This blogger is an attention whore"" +4] (http://i.imgur.com/qwr42b8.png)
[""Not to be an asshole, but seriously why is anyone giving her any attention, even criticizing? It's obvious she's just doing it for attention, so the best thing would be to ignore her.""](http://i.imgur.com/5LKCPvR.png)

Ophelia jumps in to call out her harassment. Gets harassed more: http://i.imgur.com/tDdbgRD.png

&gt;"" Yeah, really, Justin? Why did you use her face instead of the pineapple? lol"" +5

&gt;""WHERE'S THE TRIGGER WARNING, OPHELIA?!"" +4

&gt;""Ophelia, I think your face was used, to demonstrate the strangeness of your comparison."" +3

&gt;Ophelia: [""I wouldn't voice a damn thing with you if you hadn't lied about me on your podcast and then started cyberstalking me. You could always just leave me the fuck alone. But none of you shits will do that, then you dare to say we're self-important if we object to it!""

&gt;Antag:  ""Come on now Ophie McPrune criticism is not harassment. If you stop saying stupid shit people will not criticize you any more therefore your so called ""harassment"" will end"" +5](http://i.imgur.com/hbJ8HEJ.png)

Vacula tries to take the high road: [""It's unfair to, as Ophelia and her cadre often do, pick up random comments from people and cast this as representative of the people who offer civil disagreement. On any given issue you will find people who would post stuff like that online...""](http://i.imgur.com/kQQ0vRj.png)

His track record already stands for itself. And he, in no way, shape, or form, discouraged *any* of those commenters from saying what they did. 

EllenBeth Wachs (President of Humanists of Florida) tries to point this out but there's nothing to be gained in doing so sadly. [""Abbie Smith calling Ophelia ""Nanny Benson"", Daniel Waddell referring to her as ""Ophie McPrune"" Matthew Justin asking why you didn't use the picture of the pineapple instead. 
Is this the type of civil disagreement you talk about? Stirring this shit up on your wall can be a type of intimidation tactic.""](http://i.imgur.com/kxQvCZd.png)


You know, I *really* wanted to go to Women in Secularism 2. I've never been to an atheist/secular conference before. This one is almost perfect for me in terms of interest and location. I can save up for this one. But I don't want to go, no not at all, if Justin Vacula is going to be there. I simply don't feel comfortable. That's actually an understatement. I hope you'd agree that I feel justified in that after reading all of the above.

----


The next time someone asks you for evidence of anyone facing ""actual harassment"" in the atheist community just direct them to this post. Nah, we've got nothing to complain about here. Always just making mountains out of molehills! Sillies.

I think I need a sunshine bath and a double gin and tonic.

(Everyone else can stay and tell me where I've got it wrong or overlooked something important, of course.) You've probably got one question burning in your mind:

""Why are these women so angry?""

First things first, it's not just women who are affected by this argument. This is an argument directly about the rights of anyone with a uterus. This includes many women, some men, and some people who do not identify along the binary. Even those not directly affected have cause to be upset by the attempted denial of basic human rights, however.

Maybe your first reaction is to think, ""They obviously don't understand what Dawkins really *means* here, so if I explain it to them, they won't be so angry.""

No. You ['splaining](http://scienceblogs.com/thusspakezuska/2010/01/25/you-may-be-a-mansplainer-if/) Dawkins's position will not help. The problem is not a lack of understanding what he's trying to communicate. The problem is *what he's trying to communicate.*

Dawkins is saying that it's possible for fetal pain to override the potential parent's right to bodily autonomy. The consequence of this argument is the following: ""Oh, you have a uterus? Well, guess what! You may not actually be entitled to the same rights as the rest of us!"" This is especially egregious given the research showing that [fetuses don't even feel pain](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2811%2900885-2) until [*well after* most abortions are performed](http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/facts/women_who.html).

Now at this point, you might be tempted to say, ""But wait, Dawkins is actually pro-choice!"" And if that's the case, congratulations! You've completely missed the point. The inner working of Dawkins's mind, his thoughts and beliefs, are not relevant because *his argument* supports denying a basic right to anyone with a uterus.

There's also a possibility that you're about to respond with, ""Dawkins was arguing against anti-choicers to show them the hypocrisy of their arguments."" That may be the case, but it's irrelevant. In the process of trying to make those people look bad over a relatively minor point, he's conceded the larger issue. [Without argument or justification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question), he accepted the core anti-choice premise upon which all anti-choice arguments rest: that someone who is capable of carrying a fetus does not have the right to bodily autonomy.

Thus, even though Dawkins claims not to oppose abortion, his argument is a de facto anti-choice one. It agrees with denying someone the right to make their own reproductive choices. (It does not help his cause that he does so on the basis of a debunked notion of ""fetal pain."")

Sadly, whatever personal satisfaction he may have felt through this concession were ultimately futile because the ~~pro-lifers~~ forced birthers can always fall back on agreeing that their hypocrisy is also a problem while holding abortion to be wrong. Incidentally, this is the same response Dawkins has given about his own meat-eating. There's a reason, after all, that we call [tu quoque](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque) a logical fallacy. It's not a valid argument.

Next, you might be thinking, ""This argument doesn't *necessarily* support the stripping of those rights, it just *entertains the idea*. The conclusion depends on the amount of fetal pain, so if science shows us that that pain doesn't exceed our arbitrary threshold for denying these people the right to control their own bodies, then we're all good!"" Except no, we're not all good here because the implicit message is ""If your fetus can feel pain (or X amount of pain), your desires about your own body do not matter."" By this reasoning, a small clump of underdeveloped cells is assumed to be more important than the actual human being. This argument contends that because a fetus *might* experience brief pain, the person whose body it's attached to can be made to undergo [a potentially very dangerous if not fatal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complications_of_pregnancy) nine-month ordeal. Ostensibly for the sake of reducing pain, the actual human being would be subjected to a drawn-out mentally, physically, and emotionally draining experience, made worse by the fact that that person expressly wants not to undergo that process.

Again, the underlying assumption that fetuses feel pain isn't true, but even if it were, it couldn't override the right to bodily integrity. I'm surprised that Dawkins was apparently not aware of this, but because his background is in evolutionary (not developmental) biology, perhaps I shouldn't be. The fact, however, that Dawkins is a famous biologist lends false validity to the anti-choicers' beliefs in the same way that global warming denialists point to scientists studying unrelated fields to justify their denial of climate science.

It's important to remember that Dawkins isn't *starting* a conversation here. It would be irrational to think that this isn't part of a larger ongoing narrative. The war on reproductive rights is an unrelenting [global](http://www.guttmacher.org/sections/abortion.php) phenomenon. It's too common to find people who argue against the legal rights of any ~~baby factory~~ person with a functioning uterus.

Furthermore, how this pain and suffering argument plays out in reality is nothing like how it looks on paper. It's used to argue in favor of forced birth with no regard for the human being whose body a given fetus occupies. As Ana Mardoll recently wrote, [it *invisibles* that person](http://www.shakesville.com/2013/03/the-rhetorical-power-of-pig-pain.html) for the sake of propping up an inherently hypocritical and [ultimately untenable](http://www.shakesville.com/2013/03/arkansas-now-has-most-restrictive.html) political argument.

For most guys, this kind of conversation is abnormal. As cis men, we can't be forced to entertain these ideas if someone else raises them. We can simply walk away with nothing at risk for us personally. *That is privilege*. People who can get pregnant live with the constant threat of losing their bodily autonomy. Anti-choice advocates push for increased anti-abortion legislation *all the time* (see, for example: [US](http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/government-and-you/state-governments/key-findings-threats-to-choice.html), [Canada](http://www.morgentaler25years.ca/the-struggle-for-abortion-rights/,%20%5BUK%5D(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19856314), [UK](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19856314), [Australia](http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/prolife-advocates-rally-against-abortion-20130205-2dw9e.html), [South Africa](http://www.scross.co.za/2012/08/being-truly-pro-life/)). [Violence is committed upon or threatened to](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_violence) those who perform or support abortion services. This is a high-stakes argument.

The people at risk of losing their personal freedom as a result of this argument do not have the luxury of complacency. Is it any wonder, then, why some people might get ""emotional"" over this? And is Dawkins somehow ignorant of [the sexist associations with that accusation?](http://disabledfeminists.com/2009/10/13/ableist-word-profile-hysterical/) The ability to be emotionally detached from this issue is the product of privilege: cis men simply never have their right to bodily integrity questioned like this.

Contrary to Dawkins's apparent belief that stoicism is a necessary component of rationality, detachment here isn't an asset. It'd be absurd to expect or insist that a person whose rights are at risk of being taken away will respond as an emotionally-stunted robot. Since this is primarily an atheist space, I'll draw an analogy in the form of a reminder that we atheists [tend to get angry](http://freethoughtblogs.com/greta/2007/10/15/atheists-and-an/) when theists work to undermine our rights as nonbelievers. Would we not find it incredibly strange of an atheist did not get upset by the possibility of [being thrown in jail for their nonbelief](http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/646399-protest-for-indonesian-man-jailed-for-atheism-this-friday-in-new-york-city)? Why, then, would we expect someone whose uterus may end up government property to respond apathetically?

I don't doubt Dawkins means well. Sadly, as an an ""ally,"" he's throwing the people he claims to want to defend under the bus. He's saying ""Yes, I support you, except for the fact that I don't think you have this right that I enjoy."" This is no better than simply remaining silent on the issue; indeed, being friendly fire, this is much more painful. Allies should not be vicariously ceding rights to the opposition.

And finally, on the ""absolutism versus consequentialism"" nonsense, this is empty equivocation. Stripping someone's right to bodily integrity is wrong because of the consequences of that action. Using parts of our bodies to physically support another human being is an act that requires consent, and that consent can be denied or withdrawn. Pregnancy and birth are processes that invoke radical changes in a person's body, and forcing someone to undergo this is a gross violation of their right to bodily autonomy. We do not mandate more minor violations of this right (eg, giving blood, organ donation), so it is not acceptable to mandate this extreme violation. [Moral absolutism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_absolutism) is something different--something that gives us ""X is wrong because the Bible says so"" style reasoning. Consequentialist reasoning allows us to hold that the cold-blooded murder of an innocent person is absolutely wrong. This is no different.

Finally, a disclaimer: ""maybe people with a certain biological configuration shouldn't have the right to bodily integrity"" is not an acceptable argument here.",,False,self,t5_2ut2g,False,,,True,t3_1aiofx,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/1aiofx/on_dawkins_abortion_privilege_and_the_right_to/,

1347505052.0,33,self.atheismplus,zsx4p,I've been here reading discussions and trying to formulate my own opinion on atheism+ since I found this sub a week ago. I've come to the conclusion that I am on board. Here's why:,pj_fry_jr,64,31,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/zsx4p/ive_been_here_reading_discussions_and_trying_to/,"    Apologies for the wall of text. 
    This is kind of a brain dump from a week of contemplation. 

* I do think that atheism has lead me to care about things like social justice and equal rights, in that, since there is no god to care about the marginalized and voiceless members of society, then of course it's up to us (humans) to do it. That is just my own conclusion which I hold no one else to. The logical conclusion of how to conduct one's self in light of the rejection of god claims varies widely I'm sure, which leads to the most used argument against the concept of atheism+ that I've seen so far. That is, atheism should only be one thing: lack of belief in god/s, and that if we start drawing conclusions from that one thing, all hell will break loose and religious people will be right when they say things like ""atheism leads to mao!"". My reply to that is: Welcome to reality, where some people are irrational. I'm sure it's possible for someone to conclude that since there is no god to punish them, that they can abuse other people, but I think they're wrong and that's part of the reason I'm here. There is no objective right or wrong, it's up to us to determine, which can be a scary thought, but just avoiding it isn't productive imo. It's not always pleasant, but it's reality.

* I'm sick of the idea of ""don't feed the trolls"". I've never really had any trouble irl standing up to assholes, but somehow if I do online, I'm either a ""white knight"" or just an idiot b/c I'm arguing w/ someone who isn't being sincere. That's the weirdest/creepiest thing I've found out (irl) about guys who make the ""make me a sandwich"" joke, that when you really confront them and get to their motivation, they'll say that they don't really feel that way but that they just think it's funny to treat women like they do. It seems obvious to me at least, that, that is bullshit and they're just trying to reconcile their shitty behavior by detaching themselves from their own humanity. It must be confusing, but regardless, these troll sentiments are not insincere as some would like you to believe. 

* The level of push-back (and the vitriol involved) to the very idea of atheism+ basically proves the need for its existence imo. The fact that maybe some people haven't seen the harassment or generally shitty behavior and use that as the basis for saying it isn't a problem is something I wouldn't have expected to see in the atheist community but I admit to being naive about that kind of thing. I'm a white male, 30 years old, so those things (harassment and the like) are rarely directed at me but I see it happening, maybe b/c I go looking for it, but often it's blatantly obvious and I don't know how it is going unseen. Tbh, I don't think it is. I think the reasoning behind sacrificing a welcoming environment in favor of allowing assholes to harass people is the free speech argument (which reminds me of christians in the u.s. claiming persecution for not being able to discriminate), slippery slope and all that. It may be a narrow edge to traverse, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try. Maybe we'll slip, hell, we *will* slip, but we'll climb back up and keep trying. I'll always be in favor of not associating myself w/ assholes.

So, I'll be here, reading mostly. I probably won't say much, but I thought I should sound off on this.

The religion that considers women in leadership positions a more serious problem than child rape has a higher percentage of women than the unaffiliated community. The difference is even worse in the atheist community.

A religion that exalts a book that says ""women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says."" (1 Corinthians 14:34) just handed us our asses. All atheism had to do was be less sexist than that. As the last year has shown so starkly, atheism failed spectacularly.

So here's a gay man who is calling out religious institutions for their hatred of him and perpetuation of rape culture. To which they respond to which a circlejerk and tone arguments. 

To me, this is nothing more than saying ""Fuck you, you uppity queer."" How is that anything but homophobic? How does somebody calling out rape culture deserve mocking? 

I'm sick of seeing these ""progressive"" Christians. They are all about gay rights, no really, just don't bring up that their institutionalized religion has fought against our rights for the last few millennia. That's *offensive*. If you feel the need to mock gay rights activists for bringing up religion, you're not progressive. You're a bigot. If your reaction to queer rage is a little privileged pity party for yourself, you're a bigot.

Kassiane explains it.",rumblestiltsken,41,15,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/12yd01/when_is_words_matter_different_from_tone_trolling/,"So, I was reading through the debacle of Orycon at [the forums](http://atheismplus.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=2573) and at [Kassiane's](http://timetolisten.blogspot.com.au/2012/10/orycon-doesnt-want-autistic-money-also.html) [blog](http://timetolisten.blogspot.com.au/2012/10/i-am-going-to-be-stuck-on-oryconthing.html).

The second post in particular grabbed me, with this line:
&gt;""Tone is not a valid argument when you're talking down a power gradient""

Now, I don't know if I missed that part of the 101 lecture, or I just didn't put two and two together, but this really made the tone argument problem a ton clearer for me. 

The problem is pretty straight-forward - where do you draw the line between ""words matter"" and tone-trolling. I know both when I see it, but it can be hard to explain. 

This is how I read that sentence from Kassiane:
&gt;If a person with disadvantage criticises the tone of a person with advantage, they are saying that ""I am having trouble getting past your tone to hear your argument."" They could be saying ""I am running low on spoons, and today your tone is beyond my ability.""

&gt;If a person with advantage criticises the tone of a person with disadvantage, then they are saying ""I have tons of spoons, but I still choose not to hear your argument"". The are probably saying ""I can put up with the tone, but it suits me not to.""

Obviously this framing can't be black and white, all advantage is complex and relative. But for me this helps a lot, because words matter but tone trolling is bad.

Post-operatively they can marry into a heterosexual relationship legally.

At the same time it is one of the worst countries in the world to be gay, with the death penalty for homosexual acts. So some of the gender-reassignment surgery is for gay people who see it as the ""least worst"" option. It is considered a ""cure for homosexuality"" by some.

It also excludes non-binary gender identified people.

Further, the post-operative people are recommended to keep their history private, because the society is actually more prejudiced than the clerics on this issue. It is common for transgender people to be disowned by their families.

There is a documentary made about this called [""Be Like Others""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Like_Others), I haven't watched it yet but am planning to, well received.

I don't really know how to feel about this, some of it is awfully problematic but some of it is pretty amazing. 

Traditional culture (the acceptance of a select group of non-binary people or [Mukhannathun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukhannathun#Gender.2Fsexuality) in historical Iran/ME) plays such a strong role in what is accepted, like with the acceptance of [Kathoey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathoey) in Thailand. I hadn't seen it this integrated into religion before.

USA's first black President got a second term. I actually think this will push the discussion on racism in USA far more than the first term did. This is a consistent voice against bigotry. 

He even had specifically mentioned immigration reform in his acceptance speech, lets hope that goes somewhere this term.

[Minnesota](http://www.twincities.com/elections/ci_21945639/gay-marriage-amendment-too-close-call) has defeated an amendment define marriage as 1 man, 1 woman in the state constitution.

[Colorado and Washington](http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/11/06/14977250-colorado-washington-approve-recreational-marijuana-use?lite) approve legalising marijuana. Still illegal federally, but the first major success in ending the war on drugs which has torn apart poor and particularly racial minority communities.

I can't find numbers yet, but it seems that the number of women in the senate is set to up by at least 2 or 3. There are a couple of outgoing women too, but at this stage it looks like:
&gt;Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts),
&gt;Mazie Hirono (Hawaii),
&gt;Tammy Baldwin (Wisconsin),
&gt;Heidi Heitkamp (!!! North Dakota)

Even a few more is great. The Senate is currently 17/100 women, for reference.

That is all I can think of now. Were there any major blows against social justice and progress?

1347339177.0,21,self.atheismplus,zp012,Please help me understand the differences between Atheism+ and Humanism!,friendlyhumanist,43,22,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/zp012/please_help_me_understand_the_differences_between/,"Hi! Thanks for your time. I've read blog posts on this; I'm curious as to your opinions. Please help me understand the differences between Atheism+ and Humanism, as you conceive of them.

I'll explain what I mean by Humanism. I follow the American Humanist Association and the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard (see also, Humanist Community Project). Both of these are definitely *nontheist*, and as far as my experiences with them go, both are generally committed to social justice issues.

I've spent the last several years sincerely hoping for a sea change in the atheist community (and running a campus group to try to help it happen). I had hoped that the Humanist movement, as conceived by the movements above, would take off and encourage people to build communities and promote social justice rather than only criticize religion. I had hoped that the Humanist movement would also break away from those who claim to be humanist in lieu of supporting social justice movements, somehow.

The arguments I've heard are:
1. Humanists can be theist. (Just not accurate-- at least, not members of the modern Humanist movement)
2. Humanists can be asshats, saying ""I'm not feminist, I'm humanist instead."" (I've never met people like this, and it certainly isn't consistent with any rigorous definition of Humanism I've seen.)
3. It's necessary to say the word ""Atheist"" a lot so people hear it. (I don't like the word-- It's so negative. I'd rather focus on what we do believe, which is putting people first. But I'm sure others feel differently.)

The major difference, I think, may be Humanists' interest in community building. Please help me understand Atheism+'s stance on building community structures. I mean building congregations, mostly, with chaplains. I mean providing space, physical space, for people to come together on a weekly basis and talk about bringing our values into our everyday lives. Providing support systems for coping with loss and celebrating success. Providing celebrants to formalize births, marriages, deaths, etc. Encouraging time for meditation, contemplation, and calm. Emulating the good things about religious churches, and leaving the rest behind. Having rhymes, holidays, symbols, colors, etc. to help us recall our values and carry them out. The way it stands now, atheists seem to expect theists to drop theism and then that's it, with no formalized support system. I found it quite difficult, and I imagine that others have as well. I found at least one article that suggested that Atheists+ were hostile to this idea.

Where does Atheism+ stand on criticism vs. replacing negative structures with positive ones?

Of course, there's value in Atheism+ as a separate movement even if it is equivalent in many ways to the Humanism I've presented here. It's certainly done what Humanism hasn't.

Ha.

[The Genders are equal in the sense that Women aren't allowed to do the same things as men! Because that makes sense!](http://www.whyislam.org/social-values-in-islam/gender-relations-in-islam/status-of-women/) My favorite part is this, under ""Modesty""

&gt;In an environment which constantly emphasizes the physical form through various media, women are constantly faced with an unattainable standard of beauty. Although Muslim women are falsely classified as oppressed based on their modest dress, they are in fact liberated from such objectification by the society around them. This modest appearance, which includes veiling, highlights a woman’s personality and character instead of her physical figure and promotes a deeper appreciation for who she is as a person. In this regard, Muslim women identify with Mary, the mother of Jesus (pbuh), who is known for her piety and modesty.

So, instead of fixing the patriarchal society that emphasizes the physical look of women we are just going to make women equal by now allowing them to do anything. Now that is free will!

[A Muslim woman is told: cover your nakedness, do not play with your femininity as a commodity. Be proud and save your intimate best for the one who stands by you in times good and bad. Speak loud and clear; the game-and-promise bedroom voice does not belong on the streets, (Surah 33:32);](http://www.whyislam.org/social-values-in-islam/gender-relations-in-islam/within-the-sheltering-peace/)

Ah yes, more examples of women being equal to men!

Sorry, I hope this didn't break the rules, but damn does this site piss me off.

EDIT: I want to point out so I don't get labeled as islamophobic, I respect Islam more than most religions. Materialistically it has done a lot *for it's time in the 7th century* to boost the women's role in society, and on top of that, it promoted scientific thought that lead to revolutionary breakthroughs up until the 12th century. I also believe that the people who wrote the site sincerely believe that women are more equal when they are required to not worry about their financial responsibilities or whatever else was listed. That is what is horrifying, that equality can be defined as ""not being asked to do too much for what we think their sex is capable of"" rather than complete eradication of cisgender. Also, I posted this to promote discussion on whether modern religions can actually be capable of promoting feminism without breaking key points of their holy book.",,False,self,t5_2ut2g,1365887638.0,,,True,t3_1caesa,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/1caesa/i_have_seen_some_pretty_silly_apologetic/,

So I've been thinking of the culture of self pity. Well it's been kinda forced on me. So really, I'm pissed. And I deal with anger with snark. I'm sure this will bring on some tone arguments. You are able to stay calm while discussing violence and oppression, cool. I bet it's easy when it's not your violence or your oppression
.
So recently I've lost a few IRL friends over this Chick-Fil-A thing. Well it's not really about Chick-Fil-A, it's much bigger than that. It's a fight that's been raging for the last few hundred years. This is just another small chapter. It's tiny.

Over the last few weeks I've been in a whirlstorm of a lot of people around me (IRL) defending that chicken joint. I'm sure you've all seen the arguments that come out of this, and you know why they are BS. But basically, I have had people all around me trip over each other to defend somebody's right to oppress GSM Americans, including myself.
Now I'm sure some of you are ready to attack me for being American-centric. Look, I'm super proud of Canada for having a long standing history of gay marriage (less than a decade, it was legalized in 2005) and if you are not Canadian, I'm sure your country has no history of anti-GSM rhetoric fueled/caused by religion. Yes, anti-GSM violence and sentiment only exists in America. It's not like there's gangs of Christians going out to murder homosexuals in Africa right now, because some white American pastor told them about the horrible sin of homosexuality and that's all they needed to hear to start killing. Eastern European countries don't have a notable religious population, and even if they did they don't have any history of anti-gay violence. It's not like Moscow police break up gay pride parades because it was deemed ""Satanic."" Latin America is just a wonderland for openly GSM people. Not a single religious demonstration against GSM folk to be thought of. Religious hatred for queers begins and ends at USA's borders, and since you don't live here you have no reason to care.
First off, the gay marriage debate is beyond GSM people getting married. It's not just about getting married. Many people (regardless of sexuality and/or gender) don't want to get married or have a family. It's about the possiblity of getting married. It's about being recognized as an actual human deserving of rights and dignity and not as (as The Bible would say) an abomination. It's religious and legal warfare from a society doesn't value us. That's why you always about the ""sanctity"" of marriage. It needs to be kept ""sacred"" by keeping GSM people out.

So then comes Chick-Fil-A. A guy says that since he has Christian values, it's his right to hate gay people. And since he's Christian, he's going to give over 2 million dollars to other Christian groups. Christian groups that just happen to exist solely to prevent gay rights. Oh sorry, not hate people, disagree with homosexuality. And according to a lot of people, disagreeing with homosexuality isn't bigotry. It's just his view, and it's ""just as bad"" for me to call him out for it. Now if this was just one guy saying it, I wouldn't be so pissed. But the fact is, people all around him are tripping over each other rushing to defend this Christian bigot. ""Oh I'm not letting these PC queers stopping me from getting my chicken!"" ""It's his right to say those things! Freedom of speech!"" But almost worse than the hatred is that these bigots expect a pity party for them. I had somebody who I personally considered a friend complain about how he wonders if he'll ever be able to believe that marriage is only for a woman and a man without being called homophobic. He went on to post links about ""homosexual culture and agenda"" and the threat we pose to society. And of course, his Christian friends all said how insightful the article was. How this PC acceptance of homosexuality has gone ""too far."" How it's not fair that they are labeled bigots because it's their right to say what they think. That gay people were being ""heterophobic."" Talking heads lamented about how you can't even have an opinon today without being called homophobic, and oh how the masses swooned about how brave they were. Conservatives mocked gays for ""being surprised"" that he's anti-gay, because after all it's a Christian company and of course he's going to hold those views. I would have loved for it to be a surprise. It wasn't. You know it wasn't. I know that some of you are ready to shout out that not all Christians share that specific or other harmful beliefs. Technically, you are right. But you know in your heart that there's enough of a correlation that it's worth talking about. If there wasn't you wouldn't have to pull out your token examples. If you are less interested in the oppression that caused this anger and more offended by the anger, I really can't care less about your feelings. I'm actually really happy that this bugs you. This is my only outlet. When this conversation comes up IRL, I say nothing. I can't. I don't say anything, honestly out of fear. Where I live, I can't even be out IRL. It's better for me to be dishonest with everyone I meet rather than face the mockery and threats of violence that I dealt with elsewhere. I'd love to be able to wear women's clothing all the time, but I can't because I'd be risking death or at best extreme ridicule if I stepped out the door. When Christians bullied me just right before suicide. Where because of that depression I was put into a mental hospital. Where I was put into a government ordered placement for troubled youth. Oh yeah, that placement? A Mormon run institution where the people who were paid to bring me out of my depression constantly made violent gay jokes. That preached about how homosexuality is a choice and to be one you are just acting out on your depression. That your depression can be cured by just not being gay. That to graduate from the program you needed to renounce atheism and homosexuality to find God. You want to know the funny part? My story isn't rare. If I asked you the name of that one GSM youth who was bullyed to the point of suicide by Christians, you would need me to be more specific. You might think of that one guy who was bullied to death, who had his name put on a bill that specified that Christians can bully GSM youths as long as their religion says so. No really, it said that as long as it's your religious belief, there's no recourse to being a bully. But hey, why even mention his name? The real issue here is your comfort. Hell, me even bringing him up and his suicide offends you! After all, you've never been homophobic in your life so why should you care? Nevermind the suicides, most importantly, you are offended.

Whenever I bring this up, there's always a chorus of privileged self pity. ""Oh, you are just as bad as they are! Stop being so mean! There's no difference between you and homophobes!"" Look Christians, you have no idea how privileged you are. Like every other majority group, society can't do enough to pander to you. You're blissfully unaware of how much society has made you the norm. You'll never not be represented. You'll never be marginalized. You mention your religion and you are automatically trusted by most people. You'll never be fired because of your religion/lack of religion. Remember when people were outraged because Obama might have been a Muslim? Remember how the War on Terror was started because God told Bush to? Remember when government funds went to religious schools, and the support for that suddenly dropped when they found out that it went to (GASP!) ISLAMIC schools? Do you think that shit would have flown if you didn't dominate the power structure? The worst oppression you'll ever face being reminded of my own oppression. You are so used to having everything being made to pander to you, the slightest infraction makes you think you know just what it's like to be the other. If being reminded of what your religion means to a lot of people bugs you, you might want to go to a more Christian positive space. May I suggest ""almost anywhere else?"" Because if you've never been to almost anywhere else, it's really pro-Christian. You'll find that in almost anywhere else, you dominate the power structure. I know it must be hard to only have almost anywhere else to run to, but you'll manage.

Oh sorry, I forgot about all of that oppression you face.

Christian bars get shut down and run out of town because of concerned GSM groups.

Every politician with a serious campaign for president this year is queer, and all but one (Obama) has made a point to pander to his/her base by condemming Christianity. And since the beginning of time, it's dangerous for president to do anything short of condemning Christians because it endangers the GSM vote.

If any Christian appears on a TV show, there's a GSM campaign to take them off the air because they'll corrupt the youth just by existing.

Christian public figures have to hide their Christianity for years, often coming out on their death bed.

Christian rights groups get death threats from GSM folk, calling out for Divine (as in the drag queen) punishment for their transgression of being religious.

When Christians get bullied at school, the response from the GSM school officials is to just not act so Christian all the time.

I should say that if you are Christian and your response to this isn't defensive anger, I honestly have no problem with you. If you're able to read about the effects and history of your religion and you say ""I know, I'm sorry"" then I'm on your side. If you are aware of how society is made for you, I'm on your side. But if your response is still defensive anger, I'm not going to coddle you, and I'm not sorry for my stance.

It's not just a Christian thing. Far from it. It's all of the ruling groups. It's the white people who honestly think cracker is comparable to insert racial slur in offense. It's white people who ignore why The Black Panthers were created and focus on their ""reverse racism."" It's white people who are outraged that they don't have a White Entertainment Television or White History Month. It's white people who see nothing wrong with just mentioning that Romney is an Anglo Saxon. It's the men who get offended at anti-rape campaigns for only focusing on men because women can be rapists too. It's men who call women ""misandrist"" for being on guard for rape instead of being outraged at the fact that there's enough rape in the world that women need to be on guard. It's men It's straight people who say heterophobic without any irony. It's straight people who think that ""that's so gay"" and related phrases aren't offensive because nobody attaches sexuality to the term anymore. It's cis queer people who say that trans people are too weird and just hinder their civil rights. It's cis people that say they ""have no problem"" with trans people as long as they don't hit on them because ew. It's able-bodied people complaining about disabled parking spaces or defending their right to say ""lame."" It's Americans who have no idea why other countries would hate us. It's Americans who want the attempted genocide of the Native Americans taken out of schools because it might make some kids unpatriotic. It's (mostly white) Americans who called Chris Rock a racist for his 4th of July tweet. It's the Americans who hate Obama for ""apologizing"" to other countries instead of being a cowboy and pew pew pew. It's the upper class that calls any economic policy that doesn't benefit nobody but them socialism. It's the upper class' welfare queen fantasy. It's the upper class' idea that the poor have it made. It's not just the people who believe these things, but the people who think it's offensive to mention that they even exist. That it's just not nice to mention, because not everyone is like that, and most importantly ""I'M NOT LIKE THAT!""

And yes, I know that Richard Dawkins is a misogynist. Shelia Jeffries is a transphobe who learned her cissexist rhetoric from patriachal society. Spike Lee uses Jewish stereotypes in his movies. Sarah Palin uses veiled racist rhetoric to appeal to her base and refuses to apologize for, or even admit that there's any racist in the Tea Party. This rant is long enough, I don't need to go into Intersectionality 101.

And most of all, it's anybody that thinks that being a somewhat decent human deserves some special praise. If you start getting defensive the second there's a bit of discomfort on your end, you are not the amazing progressive ally you think you are. For once, it's not about you or your comfort.

1347923325.0,19,self.atheismplus,101r2c,Something that irritates me in many *trans discussions.,transpuppy,38,19,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/101r2c/something_that_irritates_me_in_many_trans/,"Often, in conversations about trans people who elect to medically transition their bodies to align with the expectations for their gender identity, I see it mentioned that many transwomen, and the majority of transmen, elect not to have genital, or ""bottom,"" surgery.


The reasons given tend to vary for transwomen and transmen.  For both, cost and lack of insurance coverage are cited.  For transmen, the additional barrier of less developed surgical techniques is given.

I find this rationale frustrating and othering.


First, it implies that transpeople should want surgery.  While many transpeople do desire surgery, and it's important to support those who do, it's not universal.  


When we present surgery as the holy grail of transition, we imply that anatomy=gender, rather than acknowledging that some people need surgical treatment for gender dysphoria, and some do not.


We reinforce the rationale behind discriminatory laws that make surgery a requirement of changing gender markers, even if we argue for exemptions on the sole basis of expense or surgical quality.  If laws are written based on these standards, there may come a time when surgery is both quality and accessible, which will marginalize those whose reasons for forgoing surgery are related to personal comfort with their bodies as currently assembled.  Some of us don't have a desire to alter our bodies, and the validity of our gender identities should not hinge upon that desire, or lack thereof.

When we say that FTM bottom surgery options are sub-par, we imply that those who've undergone such surgeries have defective bodies as a result.  We also suggest that MTF surgeries are without risk or potential impaired sexual function.  In a sense, we reinforce patriarchy by implying that sexual function and sensation matters to (trans)men, but not to (trans)women.


I see many trans activists and allies use cost or outcome to argue against surgery as a pre-requisite for gender marker change.  I'm asking that, as a community, and as individuals, we consider whether we're doing more harm than good with this line of reasoning.

As a transman who has elected not to have any surgery (top or bottom), I'd appreciate it.  I'll answer sincere questions on this topic in the comments, because even in *trans spaces I've encountered people who cannot fathom the idea of someone not wanting surgery, even if it was ""perfect"".  I've had other *trans people question my gender identity on that basis, because they genuinely didn't understand why I feel the way I do.",,False,self,t5_2ut2g,1347923605.0,,,True,t3_101r2c,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/101r2c/something_that_irritates_me_in_many_trans/,

1348301048.0,17,self.atheismplus,10agwk,How to Avoid Arguing in Bad Faith,koronicus,43,26,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/10agwk/how_to_avoid_arguing_in_bad_faith/,"This has been shamelessly lifted from [this thread](http://atheismplus.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=1168&amp;start=75#p15708) in the official forums, so I can claim absolutely none of the praise that's due for what follows. This should not be seen as a prescriptive rulebook, but rather as a descriptive list of suggestions for maintaining an atmosphere of good faith argumentation. (Note: bad faith argumentation is an invitation to moderator action, so think of this as more of a *strong suggestion*.)

My thanks go out to the people who've added their suggestions so far (emptyell, The_Laughing_Coyote, ischemgeek, tekanji) for their efforts.

*Thus begins the list of things to avoid:*
___

**Number 1:** Asserting with certainty things that are open to question.

**Number 2:** Responding to objections to these assertions with mere repetitions and/or restatements without giving consideration to the objections (and no, ""I have considered them and find them without merit"" is not arguing in good faith).

**Number 3:** Outright dismissal of provided evidence. Demands for more evidence that fits whatever magical conditions they have in mind that's 'good enough' for their hyperskepticism.

**Number 4:** A refusal to explicitly state what you would deem acceptable evidence. 

**Number 5:** Demanding that others spend time educating you when a half hour on Wikipedia will do the job just as well.

`[Ed Note: If you're going to tell someone to go away and do some reading before coming back, it's probably best if you actually tell them what to read. Unless they're trolling, linking them to a source would be considerate. This also helps to decrease the likelihood that they'll spend the next half hour reading a straw man of the concept you want them to understand. (And remember the burden of proof!)]`

**Number 6:** Any variation on ""You're wrong because I'm right!"" or ""My way or the highway."" Note that ""You're wrong because of x, y, and z"" is not prohibited. You can call someone wrong, but you have to back yourself up with why they're wrong.

**Number 6a:** Refusing to even entertain the possibility that other people's take on a situation may be valid and that there is not necessarily ONLY ONE valid way to tackle a problem/view an issue.

**Number 7:** When multiple people are saying that there is something seriously wrong with your point (or even just how you're presenting your point), you don't assume that EVERYONE ELSE is wrong or not understanding your Super Intelligent And Reasonable Point. In these cases it is most likely that: 1) You are lacking critical evidence/using bad evidence to form your ""reasonable"" argument, or 2) Failing to understand a critical perspective (or perspectives) that either contradict your evidence or show that there are more valid options than just your argument. In other words: You need to be able to demonstrate that you are willing to consider yourself wrong and entertain the possibility that, even IF you're right, others CAN ALSO be right. Not everything is a binary 1 or 0/yes or no/right or wrong type situation.

Just as a personal aside, something I have learned through the various fights I've had on the internet: It is often better to be fair than to be ""right"". What this means is that, even if you think the person you're arguing with is WRONGITY-WRONG-WRONG, it is often less productive to double down on your point (because I'm RIGHT and they're WRONG!) and instead to do things like ask questions and try to understand why they're taking the position they do. Not only does this allow you to better tailor your arguments to them (instead of just doing the equivalent of shouting I'M RIGHT YOU'RE WRONG I'M RIGHT YOU'RE WRONG WRONG WRONG), but it also leaves open the possibility to find out that there were things that they were ""right"" about.

Obviously ""fair"" doesn't mean ""must listen to anyone who spouts any kind of bullshit no matter what"". When it's an argument you've heard over and over and over and over and over again, the next person who makes it is 99% of the time already coming from a perspective you understand. Like, when gamers use gendered slurs in games (or on gaming blogs) I don't need to ask them why they think that it's ok to do that (although, depending on the person/situation, it can be useful), because I've heard every argument under the sun. So if/when I decide to engage, it's not a ""right or fair"" deal, but rather a ""do I want to make a point for the lurkers or try and get this person to understand where I'm coming from?"" decision.

**Number 8:** Do not assume that your argument is ""objective"". Recognize that you are a human being who brings your own biases into a conversation and even when your argument is supported by facts that does not mean that it is objective. Facts can be objective; the conclusions that we draw for them can't be.

**Number 8a:** ""Objective"" is not another way of saying ""correct"" and ""subjective"" is not another way of saying ""incorrect"". It is probably most helpful to look at ""objective"" as observations that are value neutral (""water is wet"") and ""subjective"" as the conclusions we draw from our observations (""water should be a basic right because people will die without it"").

**Number 9:** Don't use claims of ""logic"" or ""reason"" to shield yourself from criticism. Just because YOU think that your argument is ""logical"" or ""reasonable"" (or, conversely that another person or persons' argument is ""illogical"" or ""unreasonable"") does not mean that your assessment of the situation is correct.

**Number 10:** Coming to a thread with the attitude (stated or implied) that you will be attacked by the mean forum goers is toxic to productive discussion. It is also a pretty common trolling tactic, where the troll ""predicts"" that they will get shit for daring to disagree with the community, proceeds to engage in several bad faith tactics, and then jumps in with ""SEE, JUST LIKE I PREDICTED!"" when they are called out by the community and/or banned. They use this to justify their original position on the community, and will sometimes point to the thread as ""evidence"" while commiserating with their buddies about how horribly they were treated.

**Number 11:** Communication involves two people. This means that what you intend to say is not always what you end up actually saying to the person or people listening to you. When you're told that you're coming across in a certain way, DO NOT assume that the listener(s) are the ones having the communication fail (this is especially true if multiple people are saying that they heard ""x"" when you thought you said ""y""). In this case it is best for you to try and figure out where the disconnect happened (rereading arguments and asking for clarification--understanding that no one is obligated to give it to you-- are good ways of doing this) and then figure out how you can communicate in a mutually understandable way.

**Number 12:** Do not hide behind vague, all-encompassing ideologies. `[Ed note: Do not defend or condemn ideologies if you are not certain what those ideologies are.]`

I have seen two cases of this, one from a self-identified conservative and another from someone who claimed not to be a conservative but was still defending it. In the former case, there wasn't even a discussion, just bloviating about how there's so many liberals here and will the poor conservative be accepted. In the latter case, the defender of conservatism was forced to create a fairy-tale construction of history just to defend the basic conservative ideology, and paid absolutely no mind to how conservative politicians have always been against any form of social justice where specific issues are concerned; they've just ""moderated"" their language as their privileges have been eroded.

**Number 13:** You are more likely to have positive interactions with people if you learn the standards and conventions of the community before posting, especially if it's on a thread where hostilities have already occurred. Lurking is a great way to do this, but learning the ""flavor"" of the community is not enough. When watching people communicate with each other, try to see what kinds of words/phrases get positive responses versus which ones get negative responses.

The basic idea is: Think of the forums as a dinner party. When you go to a dinner party it's with the expectation that you will be respectful to your host(s) and their guests. Coming to the party with a bad attitude, being rude to the guests, insulting the host, or shitting all over the house (even if you're being perfectly polite to everyone!) are all things that will get you thrown out of a party. If you wouldn't do them there, don't do them here.",,False,self,t5_2ut2g,1348770789.0,,,True,t3_10agwk,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/10agwk/how_to_avoid_arguing_in_bad_faith/,

Ironically, I will be summarizing a Twitter conversation largely for the sake of clarity. My apologies to the honorable lady if I left anything out she feels was important or somehow misrepresented her statements. I will correct any such mistakes.

Ologies opened by pointing out that maybe there's some validity to tone arguments. I replied by stating if your only complaint is about tone, then your complaint is largely irrelevant.

She suggested that it's reasonable for someone to shut down when they feel threatened, and I pointed out that people who are emotionally invested in their beliefs are always going to be threatened by challenge so they're not interested in discussion anyway. It's not exclusive to theists.

She addressed the difficulty of changing your beliefs and ingrained habits/thought patterns. I addressed the difficulty of changing anything when you're not interested in having the conversation at all; tone arguments are commonly used as an excuse to NOT have a conversation.

She asked when it is appropriate to address tone, and if it might not be a sign that we're not communicating effectively. I suggested that I won't say it's NEVER appropriate to address tone, but there are two ways to bring it up: 1: ""I don't like your tone, so this conversation is over."" 2: ""Your message is getting lost in your delivery. Please rephrase so I can better understand what you mean.""

We agreed it's a conversation worth having, and that it's easy to get worn out defending our positions.

I’ve already commented that atheism is not a sound basis for any movement, and that goes double for social justice. The fact that religion is sexist and racist does not mean atheism (which is not the opposite of religion) is a sound platform on which to launch an anti-sexism and anti-racist worldview. The fact that their feminism is strictly funfem is proof of that. They are not really interested in helping women.

The government is planning to overhaul LGBTI anti-discrimination laws, and so far it is looking promising. It definitely needs a push to make sure we get decent laws though, so if you are from Australia (address required) write in to support it. Just a quick email.

[Here is a link](http://glrl.org.au/index.php/Take-Action/Current-Campaigns/againstdiscrimination) explaining what to do, with a set of general goals to pick and choose from too.

This is the current list of goals
&gt;1. Support the Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Bill and ask the Committee to recommend it be passed in this parliamentary term. 
2. Support the definitions of ""Sexual Orientation"" and ""Relationship Status"", which is broad enough to include gay, lesbian, bisexual, and questioning people. 
3. Recommend using the 2012 Tasmanian definition of ""Gender Identity"" (which is inclusive of Gender Expression/Presentation) 
4. Recommend the inclusion of ""Intersex"" as a protected attribute, using the 2012 Tasmanian Definition 
5. Support the prohibition on discrimination for Commonwealth-funded aged-care services administered by faith based organisations 
6. Recommend all Government funded services are restricted from discriminating, including faith based organisations 
7. Recommend faith based organisations, including in aged care, should not be allowed to discriminate against employees 
8. Recommend faith based organisations wishing to discriminate must publish a statement in position descriptions, on their website and in any brochures about their service, so that people know in advance what the organisation is about 
9. Recommend that the position of Commissioner responsible for Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity discrimination be established in the legislation.

I bring this up because I think the Innocence Project would greatly benefit from support from the Skeptic community. These two cases are far from isolated incidents. Thousands of people across the country are put away on bad eyewitness testimony and coercive interrogation techniques.

Anyone care to explain?",guohuade,44,27,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/zlc21/i_cannot_for_the_life_of_me_understand_the/,"My family was always very progressive and accepting, and things like race/gender/lgbt/etc were never mocked or put down. We had black family friends since I was young, and my aunt has been with her girlfriend since before I was born. My folks were also non-religious, and I have never personally held any religious beliefs.

I do identify with feminism, egalitarianism, anarchy, and a number of other political, social, and scientific philosophies. What I can't seem to do, despite reading various posts and whatnot for the last days/weeks, is understand *what in the world atheism has to do with any of those other social movements*?

All of the social issues we are currently discussing as a society: religion, feminism, racism, political influence, economics, etc.; do not seem to me to be *founded* in any way, shape, or form, on atheism. They do obviously have some connections: skepticism, critical thinking, progressiveism, post-modernism, deconstructivism, etc. And the various participants in each movement seem to be doing a fairly decent job of promoting their causes and making their cases. So why ""Atheism+""?

Here's the text from the sidebar:

&gt; It's atheism, plus a whole lot more:
&gt; Atheism plus we care about social justice.
&gt; Atheism plus we support women’s rights.
&gt; Atheism plus we protest racism.
&gt; Atheism plus we fight homophobia and transphobia.
&gt; Atheism plus we use critical thinking and skepticism.

I care about social justice, I support equal rights (feminism), I protest racism, homophobia, and transphobia, and I am a critical thinking skeptic. I am also an atheist. I can't figure out what in the world Atheism+ is purporting to add to the discussion. Is it just an alternative label for what one might traditionally refer to as a ""progressive, liberal free-thinker""? Please help?

My story: I've been an atheist for 5 years now. I was raised Catholic and attended Catholic school for 12 years. I bought into everything, hook, line, and sinker. I was actually pretty religious in high school. In college I took a class on World Wars I and II. Reading primary source documents of soldiers and their loved ones writing letters to each other on all sides, I couldn't help but note how each side was absolutely sure that God was on *their* side. It set the wheels turning. It was essentially a combination of no longer being subjected to Catholic doctrine on a daily basis and being exposed to other viewpoints and cultures that completely eroded my beliefs over a matter of months. I studied abroad, I was in college, I was reading and actively seeking more knowledge. More more more.

One day my partner gave me The God Delusion and so I read it. I didn't consider myself ""atheist"" before it, just ""not religious anymore."" I'll always respect Dawkins for his scientific contributions and for what his book gave to me as a person, but it just goes to show exactly why one shouldn't have ""idols"". 

I've been following PZ Myers and lots of other blogs (like Jen's and Skepchick) that would eventually become FtB pretty much since I realized I was an atheist. Fast forward several years....I see the ramp up of misogyny in the community. I see how hateful so very many atheists are. And I can't lie...I am extremely discouraged. I had thought I had found a community of people who espoused a better way of thinking, a better way of being human. It turns out I didn't. Atheists can be just as hateful, just as misogynistic, just as racist, just as homophobic, just as awful as we accuse our ""enemies"" of..apparently knowing that this is the one chance they get at living a meaningful life and making positive contributions to others isn't enough to keep people from resorting to base tribalism.

And then A+ came along. Just when I thought I was giving up on the atheist community...I knew I had a home again.

And that is the extremely condensed version of my journey! :p

",nofearof0,24,11,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/12w209/there_is_a_vast_and_largely_forgotten_tradition/,"""In 1999, the great class warrior Barbara Ehrenreich was given the Freedom from Religion Foundation’s annual Freethought Heroine Award at an event in San Antonio. In her acceptance speech she said:

&gt;I learned through my research that there is a vast and largely forgotten tradition of blue collar atheism in America, usually called freethought, in the nineteenth century … The freethought movement was very much connected to movements for social change of different kinds. In the Northeast, the freethought movement was linked to the working men’s movement of the early 1800s, which was a progenitor of the trade union movement. In the West it flourished among miners and other low-paid working people who were drawn to the Wobblies and other unions at the early part of this century.
 Everywhere you found freethinkers, you also found people were getting involved in women’s suffrage, in abolition, who were in involved in things like unions and other struggles. These were by and large poor people whose distrust of priests and ministers was part and parcel of their hatred of bosses and bankers. Their ethos was, put very briefly: think for yourself, because those who offer to do your thinking for you are usually planning to get hold of your wallet. That is a very clear- headed kind of skepticism.

I think this is a great quote, really simply stated but raises the important topic I'd like to see discussed more in this sub concerning economic justice and how it intersects with race, gender and religion. As skeptics how can we apply our knowledge to the broad systems of economic privilege and power?

Here are some quotes that stood out.

&gt; So it stands to reason that white folk don’t like it when it is inconveniently pointed out by ghetto interlopers that knowledge production and universal truth claims in the West have historically been marked as white. It’s cartoonishly pro forma when white folk, ignorant of these historical traditions, swaggeringly insist that atheist discourse is implicitly anti-racist, anti-sexist and anti-heterosexist because one, we say so, and, two, hierarchy is something only those knuckle-dragging supernaturalists do. It’s paint-by-the-numbers entitlement time when the so-called new atheist “movement” is resistant to the charge that **racial and gender politics just might inform who achieves visibility and which issues are privileged in the broader context of skeptical discourse.**

___
&gt; it flies in the face of the myth of meritocracy to suggest that eminent white philosophers and scientists don’t “focus” on race and gender because **their identities are based on not seeing it.**

___

&gt; As Greta Christina has noted in her insightful critique of racism, sexism and visibility within the new atheist movement; **hand-wringing about the absence of diversity without confronting the historical power dynamics of access and visibility becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.** When not seeing becomes a virtue its equivalent to telling all those uppity “missing links” to sit down and shut up. Let us write the record for you, because we know how it ends.

I wanted to try to draw together the discussion and assess it.

**GENERAL PRINICPLES OF RACE/FEMINISM INTERSECTION**
&gt;""[Nothing about us without us](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_About_Us_Without_Us)."" Don't act without any input from the group in question. 

&gt;Ethnic and cultural intersection with women's rights means that the exact same issues are *experienced in a different, not simply additive, way* and an outside observer can never fully understand the insider's experience. Hence the above rule. (I read a good piece on this recently, but can't remember where. If anyone has a link I will add it).

&gt;*Always* assume that most of the people from a different culture/race/ethnicity know more about that group than you do. Even better, assume you know nothing. People can be *really fucking different* and still be totally normal people. Corollary is that if a person from another culture self-describes as part of the same movement as you, but does it differently, you must accept that some of the difference may be cultural, and *permanently* lost in translation.

&gt;Show solidarity. If someone you are allied with does something wrong to another marginalised group, say promptly and loudly that the action was wrong. Do this *before* you criticise the marginalised group for something unrelated. This is very important because silencing, elision and dismissal are the primary tools of the bad ally.

Feminists have no excuse to be unaware of these rules, considering race-oppression in feminism has been a mainstream topic of discussion since the 70s, related to the problems people of colour faced in the movement.

**THE FACTS:**

&gt;1) Amina Tyler, Tunisian feminist activist (and self-described Femen member), protested lack of women's freedom by posting a photo of herself topless with the words (in Arabic) ""My body belongs to me, and is not the source of anyone's honor"" written across her chest.

&gt;2) Various Islamic clerics said she should be punished. For example cleric Almi Adel, leader of Tunisia’s Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, called for Tyler to be “punished according to sharia, with eighty to a hundred lashes, but [because of] the severity of the act she has committed, she deserves be stoned to death.

&gt;3) Femen lauched a show of solidarity with Amina, called the ""Topless Jihad"" where members would take barechested photos with messages written on them.

&gt;4) Some of these [were racist](http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18jpc9i1c1laajpg/ku-xlarge.jpg). There are numerous other examples.

&gt;5) There has been a large pushback from Mulsim women in the protest ""Muslimah Pride"". Many complained about the racism, many argued for western people to stop deciding unilaterally how to protest women's rights in the middle east, many argue that Hijab/Niqab etc is empowering for women. A diverse group made up of feminists and non-feminists.

&gt;6) There has been pushback from intersectional [western feminists](http://jezebel.com/5993775/muslim-women-shockingly-not-grateful-for-topless-european-ladies-trying-to-save-them) too.

So, a complex issue. Which of these actions is right or wrong? My opinions below, based on the above rules.

&gt;1) Totally right. Tunisian feminist protests for feminist issue.

&gt;2) Totally wrong. Everyone who supports social justice has common ground here.

&gt;3) Mostly right. The organisation Amina is a part of is doing what she did as a sign of solidarity. They are *supporting a member of that ethnic and cultural group in the way she utilised herself*.

&gt;""Mostly"" because Femen has form doing the exact same thing without middle-eastern members input, so the fact they are in line with intersectional ideals this time is perhaps more luck and timing than anything else. Femen leader Inna Shevchenko said ""(Muslim women) write on their posters that they don't need liberation but in their eyes it's written 'help me'.""

&gt;4) Totally wrong. This in not what [Amina wanted](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/10/mideast-feminists-against-femen_n_3052175.html?utm_hp_ref=world). Nor is it acceptable to be this racist in any context, even in support of women. Conflating Islam and being Arab is wrong. Conflating Islam and radical Islam is wrong. Playing mocking dressup of a radical Islamist as a caricatured Arab man in the middle-eastern equivalent of blackface is worse than wrong.

&gt;5) Some mix of right and wrong. Certainly there are multiple perspectives and multiple complaints, which shouldn't be criticised as a single block.

&gt;6) Some mix of right and wrong. No-one denies that cultural relativism can be taken to extremes, although this is like [straw feminism](http://www.harkavagrant.com/?id=341) - some people like this do exist, but the argument is made against them several orders of magnitude more often than their actual prevalence.

So considering all this, perhaps a generic type of valid response would be ""We support Amina, reject calls for her punishment, support those who show solidarity in the way she wanted, reject racism and hold a nuanced position on the pushback, which both supports the above but hears and doesn't conflate the varied disagreement from people directly involved in the issue."" 

This is a really generic response, and there is heaps to talk about at the edges of it, but denying the basic principles would usually be problematic.

**THE RESPONSE AT FTB**

I am going to focus entirely on Freethought Blogs as emblematic of modern SJ/atheist ideas in respect to Islam. FTB is a place where intersectional approaches are the norm, so should be ""not getting it wrong"". 

I am focussing on a few white bloggers. They are the allies here, and this post is about ally behaviour. There are certainly other bloggers there who are directly affected, and hold some of the same views and some more nuance. Feel free to read them at [A Million Gods](http://freethoughtblogs.com/amilliongods/2013/04/11/balance-muslim-women-vs-topless-europeans/), [Maryam Namazie](http://freethoughtblogs.com/maryamnamazie/2013/04/05/our-day-defend-amina/) and [No Country for Women](http://freethoughtblogs.com/taslima/2013/03/29/women-should-know-that-their-body-belongs-to-them/).

Also for a good background approach to how race and culture interact with social justice movements, do read [Black Skeptics](http://freethoughtblogs.com/blackskeptics) in general and [this piece by Crommunist](http://freethoughtblogs.com/crommunist/2013/04/10/in-bad-faith/) in particular.

**PZ**

PZ writes on Amina specifically [once](http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2013/04/04/free-amina/) and does well enough. He links to Maryam Nemazie's blog, which fulfills the prime rule of allyship. However, he has written [several](http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2013/04/03/both-wrong-both-right/) [articles](http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2013/04/08/head-and-heart-atheists/) dismissing Islamophobia as a prominent thing, all the while ignoring the racism that was prevalent in the protests. Which is relevant to the discussion he was having. He breaks the last rule of allyship - don't elide racism from a relevant discussion. Say it first and say it loud.

He also becomes perpetrator, surpassing elision. In the [first](http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2013/04/03/both-wrong-both-right/) of the two linked Islamophobia pieces above he describes Islam as ""barbaric"" and ""primitive"". For the sake of this discussion I am going to assume everyone is mature enough to realise that while ""Islam is not a race"", it is conflated with being Arab in the mainstream consciousness (wrongly, indeed only around [20% of Muslims](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim#Demographics) live in the Middle East). More importantly, Islam is conflated with a more sinister thought ... ""not white"" (also wrong, there are more Christians in Africa, Asia and South America than *the entire population of Europe and North America combined*). And we all know what ""not white"" people get called ... primitive and barbaric.

We all *know* that our media feeds us a horrendously biased picture of Islam, the go-to enemy of the last decade. We *know* that this creates biases. PZ and many others suggest the brutality of actions in some predominantly Muslim areas are why the go-to phrases for criticising Islam are ""primitive and barbaric"", despite [similar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_burning#Modern_witch-hunts) [atrocities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_views_on_female_genital_mutilation#Christianity) being performed by impoverished people the world over. That last page is a very good example of this bias - the Christian section states that FGM occurs in Christian Africa but is ""a matter of cultural tradition, unrelated to religious belief'"" and the Islam section also says the practice "" is mainly derived from culture"". Yet who do we associate the ""barbaric"" practice with? Surprise surprise, the religion thought of as ""not white"".

Also note that is just Christianity. You do not need to go far to find near limitless tales of all other world religions and horrific crimes. Only discussing Islamic crimes over and over is a good way to generate cognitive bias.

**OPHELIA**

Since the Amina story hit the internet, Ophelia has written 12 posts on the topic of it and/or Muslimah Pride and/or Islamophobia/racism/colonialism. And like PZ, she elides the racism.

Literally, in 12 posts, many of which are directly about the Femen protest ([defending it](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/04/of-course-stoning-is-bad-but/)) or the Muslimah Pride counter-protest ([ridiculing it](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/04/awesome-on-a-skateboard/)) she never once mentions the racist actions of *some* Femen members. As a member of the privileged race class being discussed (remember, race and Islam are conflated by almost everyone), it is her damn responsibility to make clear that racism is not acceptable.

To be sure, she doesn't pretend racism doesn't exist. She finds [examples of it](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/04/down-in-the-muck/) to write about when it is Muslimah Pride people doing it. Obviously, that is different to when white feminists do it, and requires visibility.

She then goes on to [mock claims of racism by Muslims](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/04/muslimah-pride/#more-7592) and goes out of her way to [deny intersectionality in general](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/04/attempting-to-impose-white-western-feminism/). She has this awesomely dissonant position - 
&gt;""We don’t (listen to all Muslims). We just choose a particular set we want to listen to and then refer to them as “Muslims” and what we’re doing as “listening to Muslims” so that everyone will think we have our finger on the pulse of “the Muslim community.” It’s all bullshit. This particular person was listening to some Muslims who dislike Femen and the protest about Amina’s arrest or kidnapping, and treating them as if they were all Muslims.""

As opposed to writing multiple pieces characterising the counter-protesters are brainwashed misogyny apologists, even while quoting things like 
&gt;""It seemed that many other Muslim women across the world agreed with my stance and what followed was a defiant and vocal rejection of Femen’s invitation. Instead of ‘getting naked’ Muslim women from across the world tweeted and uploaded pictures of themselves to Facebook in their hijabs, niqabs, and western attire.""

Assuming she read that, where is the awareness that some of the protestors are in western attire? Totally excluded from discussion. Her next line was entirely about how these women are subjugating themselves to male clerics.

This is the nuance I was talking about above. Ophelia is doing exactly what she describes, selecting a group she wants to listen to and claiming it is all Muslims. It is telling that unlike her commenter, she has chosen *the worst examples* of the counter-protest to make monolithic. Many of the counter-protestors support Amina. Many self-describe as feminist. Many feel that Islamic culture needs to change. 

Every oppressed group gets this. Feminism is ""a bad word"" in most settings for example, because the straw-feminist is held as the leading example. And even the people who fulfil those criteria would get (and do deserve) much more nuance than Ophelia provides on this issue.

To pretend Islam is a set of rules that starts and stops with [Sharia](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/04/are-sharia-councils-harming-women/) and [FGM](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/04/they-tell-you-that-youre-dirty/) is wrong. Those are just a couple of topics she happened to write about during the period of this debate. Unrelated of course. Also unrelated is that she never chose to write about [Islamic Feminism and Islamic Secularism](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nNSz0rHWRo) (long video link). [Islamic feminism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_feminism) has a long and significant history. I particularly like the quote
&gt;""When the British applied their law to Muslims in place of Shariah, as they did in some colonies, the result was to strip married women of the property that Islamic law had always granted them — hardly progress toward equality of the sexes.""

In many ways Islam was ahead of the west. It is not even unreasonable to suggest that wealthy white women could have seen the relatively better position of women in some parts of the world when western feminism and suffrage began to foment. 

Further down that page is a discussion on current issues for *Islamic women/feminists*. There is no question that Islamic feminists exist, nor that they are any less brilliant and thoughtful than any other (watch the video above if you disagree with that). So, a bunch of brilliant, thoughtful women's rights activists who have considered Islam *from the inside* and find it compatible with feminism.

But it is just dismissed, racism elided, voices silenced in preferece of arguing with straw-Islamists. The picture looks grim.

Then Ophelia denies that ""white western feminism"" is [even a thing](http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/04/attempting-to-impose-white-western-feminism/) or that feminism is at all altered by a cultural or racial lens. Ophelia, some [Black Feminists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_feminism) wanted a word with you. 40 years ago.

Ophelia ticks all the boxes for bad ally. Silencing, eliding, dismissing. She even pops in co-opting by discussing FGM and Sharia *co-incidentally* at the same time as she is arguing that Islam is a nasty woman-hating monolith.

1363865071.0,13,self.atheismplus,1aq5ye,[Effortpost] Tropes vs science - gender assumptions and sporting capacity,rumblestiltsken,39,26,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/1aq5ye/effortpost_tropes_vs_science_gender_assumptions/,"**WHAT THIS IS ABOUT**

The **certainty** of sexual dimorphism in sport came up in thunderf00t's recent ""tropes vs Anita"" video, using weightlifting as an example of the obvious inherent differences between men and women. And I say pshaw, as well as **bad science**. Sex differences in sporting performance are anything but settled.

*As a proviso - ""male"" and ""female"" and similar words are used below as they are used by sporting regulatory bodies. I acknowledge this is grossly binary and offensive, and doesn't represent the science or experience of human variation. Which is kind of the problem. So, Trigger Warning for gender binary bullshit.*

**BACKGROUND**

The current women's records in weightlifting (the archetypal strength sport) are equivalent to the male records up to around 1972 (the [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world_records_in_Olympic_weightlifting) doesn't give granular data and the time lag may be significantly smaller).

So, women of today who do weightlifting are *as strong* as the men of the 70s as measured by olympic weightlifting. How is that possible if there is an inherent, insurmountable difference?

**TESTOSTERONE**

The biological reason given for inherent difference ([sexual dimorphism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism)) is usually testosterone. Why testosterone? Studies have shown in vitro (test tube) effects where testosterone increases muscle dimensions and strength and so on.  Population level common sense shows men are stronger, bigger and faster than women. And testosterone is manly, right? 

This is the favoured hypothesis to the point that the Olympics Committee and IAAF can now decide who ""can participate as a woman"" by [testing these levels](http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Commissions_PDFfiles/Medical_commission/2012-06-22-IOC-Regulations-on-Female-Hyperandrogenism-eng.pdf) and even actively seeking out women athletes to run these tests on.

So, big organisations with tons of scientists. Case closed?

[Nup](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/fivering_circus/2012/07/olympics_sex_test_the_international_olympic_committee_has_a_way_to_test_whether_athletes_are_men_or_women_is_it_fair_.html). 5% of women elite athletes have ""male"" levels of testosterone. 6% of male elite athletes have ""female"" levels of testosterone (unpublished data by IOC). 

An overlapping range shows, at least partially, that testosterone cannot explain this ""30 year gap"" between records.

Even more so, in the same data 25% of male athletes had testosterone levels below the ""male range"". Yet they succeed at their sports of choice. 

Women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome are [over-represented in elite sport](http://www.academia.edu/1264578/The_Science_of_Sex_Verification_and_Athletic_Performance). They have no response to testosterone at all, yet are more likely to be an elite athlete than the general population (less than 1/5000 in general population, 1/420 in elite sport).

And testosterone levels in [a recent study](http://jap.physiology.org/content/112/11/1805.abstract) did not predict muscle growth post exercise! Women and men created the same amount of new muscle fibre post-exercise, even though men had 20+ times more circulating testosterone.

So, pretty clearly the testosterone hypothesis is bogus. There is simply no correlation between testosterone levels and success in elite sport. The test tube results as always don't apply on the macro level, and the population level results must have some other confounding factors.

But that doesn't mean the sexual dimorphism argument is bogus, right? There could still be a different hormone, or more likely a whole complex mix of biology, to cause a real significant difference that is inherent and insurmountable.

**ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS FOR DIFFERENCE**

Let's return to the weightlifting. Women are as good as men were in the 70s. Both male and female weightlifters have improved. What has changed?

1. Participation

2. Training methods

3. ????

*Note that biology hasn't changed. So any answer that includes ""biology is the sole determinant of sporting achievement"" is wrong.*

If it is the training methods, then women and men should advance at roughly the same rate, right? Each group benefits from the same discoveries.

Well, they don't. Women are [catching up](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/sunday-review/why-olympic-records-are-broken-or-not.html?_r=0). Check out the graphic on the left under ""multimedia"". It shows winning times in 1968 vs 2008.

The graphic can be divided where the blue bars end, which is essentially the cutoff between pool and field sports. In the pool, women have improved their records by an average of 11% in 13 events. Men have improved by 10% in 15 events (or 13 events excluding the 1500m free and 4 x 200 free relay). 

And yes, that is a 10% difference, not a 1% difference (you sneaky stats manipulators!).

In the field events it is harder to compare because women didn't get to do a fair few of them in 1968. If we only look at comparable events women advanced their winning time/distance just over 4%, men only gained 2.27% (10 events). Even including the 2 *best* events for men in the field (pole vault and hammer throw) they only make it to 3.6% improvement.

And yes, that is a 10-40% difference in rate of increase.

So women are gaining significantly faster, meaning it is not *just* training methods. Training methods may play a role, but the fact is that times and distances are converging. Even in weightlifting. From the page above I randomly selected a weight class (62/63kg). Since 1992 (60kg class) men have not improved at all. But women have lifted 15% more.

So, not training methods. Then what? I honestly cannot see anything but participation and access. Women are allowed to take part, and encouraged to more and more. We can see it in the Olympic events, women were excluded for a long time. 

A bigger pool of potential athletes means a statistical outlier of amazing talent is more likely to arise. And there are probably genetic explanations for some of these outliers, but there is no good evidence that they exist on the X or Y chromosomes. 

Some people will argue a range of things to deny the main point here, but no-one can argue that biology is the sole determinant of success. Not rationally. I admit there may be other explanations than my own ...

**TROPES VS SCIENCE**

But guess what? This shit has never been studied. Despite the big bucks in sport and training science, this is all too hard. Another example of the gender bias in science. It is assumed in tons of research that testosterone is the reason for gender difference. They don't even cite anyone for it. 

For more discussion on gender distortions affecting ""what gets researched"" see the [Rationally Speaking podcast](http://www.rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs77-victoria-pitts-taylor-on-feminism-and-science.html). Skeptics favourite, honest!

**TL:DR** 

Women are catching up to men in elite sport records, and have been since women started playing sport, decades after men were competing and advancing. Testosterone doesn't explain ability despite the IOC and IAAF basing policy on this flawed science.

Scientists have pretty much based all research on gender differences in sport around a flawed hypothesis. As we see in many fields of science, gender stereotyping affects what gets researched, skewing all the results before the measurement is even done.

Is there a gender differences that means something in real world sport? Who knows. The evidence doesn't exist.

All we know is that all the data points to convergence in sporting achievement at the top level. We have no evidence to suggest this trend will stop. As skeptics and scientists, we should find out.

There's repeated mentions of Jesus healing the hearing, speaking, and seeing impaired. By casting out their demons. Their demons. The Bible repeatedly says that people with disabilities literally have demons inside of them that need to be cast out. And when those demons were cast out by Jesus, the individual suddenly become able-bodied. Epileptic seizures are caused by demons too. 

Oh yeah, and this thing from Leviticus.

"" And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God. For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous, Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded, Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken; No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God. He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and of the holy. Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.""

Oh yeah, and Samuel 5:8.

""And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.""

If you do not feel the following description applies to you, you are welcome to hang around and participate in the comments section, but this post isn't really *for you*.

Let's carry on, shall we?

Hello gentlemen (and the occasional lady).

This will be an exercise in perspective-taking, so if you're not interested in understanding the A+ thinking process, feel free just to close this page now. Don't let the door hit you on the way out.

You're here today presumably because you think A+ is a stupid idea. You, like many others, may feel unfairly attacked by A+ because you interpret our explicitly stating our shared values as an implicit assertion that anyone who does not embrace the A+ label rejects those values. Let me state, as I have done elsewhere, that this is not our intention. We agree that you can be an upstanding citizen, an excellent member of your community, and a positive force for good in the world without wearing that label. We agree that you can be vehemently opposed to sexism without subscribing to this subreddit and without calling yourself a member. None of that is in question.

Similarly, most of you acknowledge that there is an element of sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, and unskeptical behavior in the atheism movement. We all agree that most people do not engage in most of these behaviors most of the time, so there is little point in making the painfully trivial observation that ""not everyone is like that.""

Another common observation seems to be that ""Atheism+ is divisive."" To this crowd, I would merely ask you to review [this article](http://freethoughtblogs.com/greta/2012/08/30/atheism-plus-and-some-thoughts-on-divisiveness/) to understand what seems to be the majority impression among a-plussers. The TLDR version is that the community is already divided, and pointing out the problem is not the same thing as causing the problem. (I would further stress that reacting with hostility to this being pointed out actually *worsens* the problem.)

Now, to the main point: most of you seem to have a very strong misunderstanding of what has motivated this whole A+ thing. I'm under no misapprehension that I can radically alter your impression in a single self post, but I think I have a pretty good idea of how to share a bit of our perspective with you. First, you need to open [this page](http://www.microaggressions.com). Take a moment to read and interpret what you see. Remember, this is an exercise in perspective-taking. For each entry you read, I'd like you to ask yourself the following question:

**Why is this here?**

Each item has been listed because the submitter feels attacked in some way. Your goal is to understand *why* they feel this way. Your goal is *not* to judge whether or not they are ""wrong"" to feel that way--put that thought out of your head entirely.

I'm referring to this picture.  This kind of apology is absolute bullshit.

Here's some problems from what I can gather.

1.  This person thinks they can apologize for all of Christianity as if that will negate the net effect it has had on all of history.

2.  This person still refuses to own their Christian history by putting in quotations ""Christians"" who happen to be hateful bigots and in doing so, tries to wash their own hands of their compliance with a religion that right now has an unfortunate net affect on those who don't adhere to the faith.

3.  This person refuses to talk to people as people and instead uses a Christian filter.  Look at how this person attempts to Christsplain to everyone as to how they REALLY are.  So therefore, our anger at Christianity as an entity must be skewed and without merit.  We just don't understand them obviously. 

4.  This person doesn't really care.  The explanations they are offering is more for them to absolve their sense of guilt from not having the courage to walk away from a destructive institution than it is to really try to establish a meaningful truce with non-believers and believers.

I've seen this kind of apologetics time and time again and I just do not think this is even remotely good enough.  I don't think I'm alone in saying that we don't typically want just some apologies for a day or so, we want them to pick up their trash and clean up their messes.  That means they're going to have to have enough courage to realize it's not all about THEM and their god, but about all of us as people.",,False,self,t5_2ut2g,False,,,True,t3_10osck,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/10osck/i_dont_think_this_kind_of_thing_is_good_enough/,

Inspired by the Malaysian Atheists who have been exposing us to their particular issues. Thanks rewarp!

I am Australian, and while we do talk about Australia a fair bit here it may be useful to have a concise rundown on some major issues currently facing Aussies.

1. Gay marriage [remains illegal](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-09-20/an-senate-votes-down-second-bill/4272428) despite [wide public support](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recognition_of_same-sex_unions_in_Australia#Public_opinion_polls). The ruling centre-left party members support gay marriage too, but the more conservative powerbrokers are blocking it happening.

2. Religious businesses remain [able to discriminate in hiring](http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/politics/gillards-bizarre-act-of-faith-leaves-vulnerable-unprotected-20130113-2cnf0.html), purely because they are religious.

3. Abortion by choice remains [ILLEGAL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_Australia#State-by-State_legal_situation) except in the ACT. SA, NT and Tas hold that economic and social reasons are not good enough to justify abortion. Most Australians have no idea about this, as the laws are not enforced. In SA every abortion needs 2 doctor consent, abortion is part of *criminal law* jurisdiction and women &gt;28 weeks must travel interstate even for medically justified abortions.

4. Government funding pays for religious chaplains in schools in place of trained counsellors. This continues [despite being judged unconstitutional](http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/political-news/chaplains-safe-despite-high-court-ruling-roxon-20120620-20n2d.html) by the High Court.

5. Australia continues to [lead the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_detention_in_Australia#Restoration_of_offshore_processing) in 'protect our borders' racism. We take people who risk their lives on boat voyages from Indonesia, send them to 'processing centres' for periods of up to 5 years. If they do make it to onshore processing (because the detention centres are full) they are not allowed to work, isolating them from the community.

6. There is also a bunch of nasty stuff happening to our equivalent of social security, most recently single parents got slammed with cuts of up to $110 per week, all in chasing a budget surplus.

7. Indigenous issues remain hugely problematic, with a massive [gap in life expectancy](http://www.budget.gov.au/2008-09/content/ministerial_statements/image/indigenous-2.gif) and health. 

I am sure I have missed a number of things, but these are some of the battles being waged currently by those with A+ values. Anyone else know of big ones I have missed? I didn't have a gender-based one because the [success of the test-case](http://www.news.com.au/business/low-pay-workers-granted-pay-rise/story-e6frfm1i-1226259496594) for wage equality is a huge step forward.

I'm a Muslim and a subscriber to /r/DebateReligion. We're currently having a discussion on the differences between ""new atheism"", ""atheism 2.0"", and ""atheism+"". Although we are technically a debating subreddit, we frequent end up just having informative discussions, which is what I hope this discussion will turn out to be. I also co-moderate an interfaith subreddit (i.e. /r/religion) so I had come across the term ""atheism+"" before. Alas, it seems most redditors (both theists and atheists) aren't familiar with the term ""atheism+"".

It would be really great is someone from this subreddit who is an actual card carrying atheism+ supporter (yes, I know you don't really carry cards) could contribute to our discussions. The link to the discussion can be found [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/zjrbz/to_atheists_new_atheism_vs_atheism_20_vs_atheism/).

1365869076.0,10,self.atheismplus,1c9upj,[Resource] Gapminder is awesome! Equality data by religion.,rumblestiltsken,29,19,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/1c9upj/resource_gapminder_is_awesome_equality_data_by/,"So, just because it is real cool and I have thrown up a few links here recently, Gapminder is a great place that draws population data from numerous world databases and makes it searchable and graphable.

[Hans Rosling](http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen.html) is the brain and face of Gapminder, and gives awesome talks. He has a half dozen at TED.

But for us it means we have a ton of data at our fingertips.

For example, [here is a graph](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=t1YAVXUoD3iJKy2mSq2Padw;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=tyeSLo9Zpmw_e05IR3EoReg;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=lin;dataMin=0;dataMax=93$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=0;dataMax=23$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) of the **murder rate of women**, with colour coding of countries by religion. 

In the setting of the recent discussions about Islam, the things to notice are twofold. 

The top about ten countries are Christian (even the 2 white bubbles as per Wikipedia). The highest Islamic country is at number 15 if I counted right. The entire top 30 contains about 5 Muslim majority countries.

The other thing to notice is that there is a strong trend between murder of women and poverty. A few outliers to be sure, but the trend is real.

The same relationship between religion and **general murder rate** holds [in general](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=tBrbR3BlR_12WlTIlSTpu6g;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=tZgPgT_sx3VdAuyDxEzenYA;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=lin;dataMin=0;dataMax=98$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=0;dataMax=131$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) although the poverty correlation is weak.

Of course, there is other data that is relevant. **Female literacy** [lags in the impoverished Muslim majority countries](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=0AkBd6lyS3EmpdE8xR0dUWDI4ME02SjQ5bi1NYnFHN0E;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=24;dataMax=115$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) slightly more than Christian or ""Eastern Religion"" majority countries.

**Fertility rates** [are relatively evenly spread](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0TAlJeCEzcGQ;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=0.79;dataMax=9.2$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) by religion and directly correlate to poverty levels, and [even more closely](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=0ArfEDsV3bBwCcGhBd2NOQVZ1eWowNVpSNjl1c3lRSWc;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0TAlJeCEzcGQ;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=1.8;dataMax=682$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=0.79;dataMax=9.2$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) to **child mortality levels**.

I remember some talk recently of Islam in some areas being against **vaccination** (well, because the US used a fake vaccination program to find out where Osama bin Laden lived in Pakistan). But is it true that Muslim majority countries vaccinate less? [Nope](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=txVTyScWObTBNuMmkNtLh1w;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=0;dataMax=99$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=).

Female foeticide is a big problem in highly patriarchal societies, perhaps **gender ratios of children** it could be a decent indicator of gender conflict? The [data suggests](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=tfWSVJPJHn3u7e_7MUaCbnw;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=88;dataMax=121$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) that in the impoverished world Muslim majority countries are indeed having more male babies delivered, but (and this surprised the hell out of me) are no more unbalanced than *rich* Christian nations.

Of course, India and China are in a far worse position, which is a known and urgent problem. 

Also surprisingly, **age at first marriage for women** is [pretty even](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=t4eF8H_jq_xyKCUHAX6VT1g;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=13;dataMax=34$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=) across religions. A few more Muslim majority nations right down the bottom end, but there is almost no difference.

**Whether women work** [does show a significant difference](http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2004$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=rOXvRa2ZC2oXqBn7gz62IMg;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID5;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=282;dataMax=119849$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=7.8;dataMax=86$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=), the lowest rates are almost exclusively in Muslim majority countries.

The one thing I can think of that it doesn't have that I really wish it did was wealth per person and wealth by gender.

1363159682.0,8,self.atheismplus,1a7d2z,Comment on /r/technology about PETA and tactical oppression,rumblestiltsken,20,12,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/1a7d2z/comment_on_rtechnology_about_peta_and_tactical/,"So, I am vegetarian (mostly vegan) and generally hate PETA for all various problematic approaches they use to get into the media.

[This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1a593e/peta_goes_after_assassins_creed_for_its_depiction/c8ubwlg) in the tech sub has my mind somewhat blown. I can see the truth of it.

&gt;Folks underestimate PETA. Almost ten years ago (I think?), I was accepted into a training program and met with their leaders and PR execs, including Ingrid Newkirk. At the time, PETA had just started a campaign where they suggested that people should drink beer instead of milk. MADD was up in arms. A media frenzy ensued. PETA and MADD went on multiple TV news shows and debated fervently. MADD talked about the woes of drunk driving, and PETA talked about the woes of drinking milk.

&gt;Here's the kicker: before their scuffle with MADD, PETA would really only go on news shows when they were asked to debate the actual issues of animal rights infringement. And in those news shows, PETA's message was muddled by the debating. Now, when MADD came along, I remember one of the heads of PR saying how thrilled she was. On the one hand, MADD could talk about the woes of drunk driving--all fine and good--and PETA could agree with MADD's concerns. On the other hand, PETA could make statements that would otherwise be objectionable in a debate--that milk causes disease, for example--and MADD wouldn't object to the premise or present the counter-argument; they'd just go back to espousing their talking own points. In other words, PETA and MADD got airtime to express their ideas, and neither did much to critique the other's viewpoints. A win-win.

&gt;I've seen this PR tactic over and over. Like clockwork. When PETA compared animal domestication to the suffering endured in the holocaust, for example, they got a lot of airtime. The Jewish representatives talked about the needless and incomparable suffering and the PETA reps talked about the deplorable conditions in factory farms. And, as controversial as the stance was, PETA was able to successfully get unchecked quality national airtime--airtime where they could critique factory farming without having to debate directly with a representative of the farming industry.

&gt;The general formula here is: 1) find someone to insult who is not directly in opposition with your message, preferably someone who might actually even partially agree with you. 2.) Insult them. 3.) Sit back and hope the insulted party says something like, ""though we agree with PETA on x, we take offense to the tactical approach they took on y."" 4.) Appear on TV or on the web to discuss the contention, and voice your opinion with minimal critical response.

&gt;In the case of Ubisoft, though everyone seems to think PETA is being idiotic here, they actually bated Ubisoft into admitting that whaling in its non-digitable manifestation is not condonable. And if a kid reads Ubisoft's response, they may hate PETA fervently but they now know that one of their favorite gaming companies finds whaling to be otherwise detestable. And, though PETA may be mistaken for thinking such, they will likely chalk that up to a win.

If anything this is making me hate PETA all over again. I always just saw it as controversy-generating tactics to get airtime, but intentionally targetting unrelated oppressed groups to get asymmetric debates feels even dirtier.

In this case, it is a gaming company so fair play to them I guess, but the same tactics are reguarly used to promote shittiness.

Not sure if anyone else cares, but I thought it was a thought-provoking idea directly tied into PR skepticism and social justice.",,False,self,t5_2ut2g,False,,,True,t3_1a7d2z,http://www.reddit.com/r/atheismplus/comments/1a7d2z/comment_on_rtechnology_about_peta_and_tactical/,

As a queer person myself, I do try to be LGBT friendly; however, I have been struggling with pronouns and trans-inclusivity.

When dealing with many issues of misogyny in religion, I frequently find myself using gender, sex, and assigned gender as synonyms.

The problem I have is that the sort of religions I talk about do the same. If I attempt to differentiate, I'm not properly representing the religion I'm arguing about, for one, and I completely ruin any chance of a religious agreement, for another. 

As an example, if I were talking about the treatment of women in Catholicism, I would find it necessary to bring up Catholicism's treatment of women in the home. Because traditionally Catholics equate women with motherhood, and motherhood with uteri and so forth, it would be hard for me to acknowledge that not all women have such capacities nor are all those with such capacities women. I also feel like that would kind of distract from the fact that traditional Catholicism despises pregnancy and women because they believe them to necessarily coexist- which is the main problem. 

So would it be appropriate for me to just avoid correct pronouns? Should I instead try for trans-inclusivity? Is there anything I can do to avoid confusion, keep with authenticity, whatever?

It's quite possible that I'm completely in the wrong here; sadly, there are very few trans atheist and anti-theist bloggers out there and even fewer trans-friendly, so all of the perspectives I've come across aren't too helpful.

Currently [Skepticon](http://www.skepticon.org/) is in our sights as a safe conference for a trial, but large enough to get a good vibe of the impact. 

We would need people who are attending to be willing to staff a booth for some of the time, hopefully not big chunks of time if we can find enough A+ers, to hand out cards and discuss the intervention/receive feedback.

This is part of the pushback against sexism and harassment in the community, and if I was in USA I would go. We need to get off our butts and promote the cause. I am able to do organisation and such from here, but we need boots on the ground.

I was trying to point out that the assumed sexual availability of transwomen was exemplified in several of his statements, such as comment 1.1 ""All the best are gay"".

1. Anger over Muhammad cartoon or this film are really the tip of the iceberg here.  The regional anger is at least equally due to a much less whitewashed daily news about the daily results of US aggression in the region.  From two Iraqi Wars, to Afghanistan-Pakistan, to our sabre rattling and sanctions against Iran, the asymmetry of the plight of Palestinians verses a US supported Israel, and the list goes on and on.  How many Muslims have been killed by US/western forces, actions and US supported governments in the region in the last 25 years? 100,000? 500,000? The US government hardly comes across as a force of a good for Muslims in the region.

2. Their lack of a real understanding of liberal democracies and free speech. People of the region equate all media originating in the US as either being condoned and created by their government because this is how the region's governments have worked for generations.

3. Their bias and misinformation.

They might be interesting for some, or possibly just tedious,
but could start a conversation.

At the start my conceptualization has an odd break.
Many atheists say they don't believe in God,
but for me the idea of God is so totally maleformed
even that isn't possible.
The concept of divinity is pernicous garbage.
It isn't that I don't believe God exists,
but rather that the whole idea is utter nonsense.
It makes no sense to say God does or does not exist
because the word God doesn't really refer to anything.

This may seem like a little detail that could be ignored,
but atheists get dragged into debates
over God this and God that and so on,
and none of that has any meaning at all.
Every such argument can only cater to the childish.

But then comes the obligation to work with the world
and the people in it on their own terms,
and it so happens that the nature of consciousness
causes us to naturally project agency onto everything.
From phenomena to objects to the world as a whole
every possible thing is seen as having the same trappings:
desires, beliefs, intentions, and so on.
From that mechanism emerges not only divinity,
but angels, miracles, life after death, and all the rest.
So there is a chasm of sorts--a great distance that looms.
And out of this chasm waft all kinds of questions.
How even to measure the distance and terrain?
Stay safely on the proper side?
Chip away at the great edifice upon which others base their lives?
Perhaps build a bridge or establish some other crossing?

Early on it seemed atheism itself was the answer,
and the task was propagation of truth.
But now that is less certain.
Careful investigation of popular beliefs reveals
the supernatural retains pervasive influence.
In America the open market for religion
fills churches large and small,
but in Europe and Asia where the secular dominates
close examination reveals all the same tendencies
held close and personal in closed religious markets.
So it seems the spiritual can fit in a range of ways.
Animism gives way to monotheism gives way to spirituality,
but true atheism is always a rarely taken path.
Crafting a righteous peace with ordinary beliefs
is no simple task for an atheist.
There needs to be a way of expressing acceptance
of the human tendancies of others
while at the same time understanding
that all such ideas are not only junk,
but contaminants that threaten all reason.
